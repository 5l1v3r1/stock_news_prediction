The approval was based on data from the Phase III PATH ( P olyneuropathy A nd T reatment with H izentra) study, which is the largest controlled clinical study in CIDP patients to date. CIDP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves and may cause permanent nerve damage.\n\"This new FDA approval for Hizentra marks a pivotal milestone for patients struggling with the disabling neurological effects of CIDP,\" said Dr. Andrew Cuthbertson, Chief Scientific Officer and R&D Director, CSL Limited. \"As the first and only subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy approved to treat CIDP, and studied in the largest controlled clinical trial for CIDP, Hizentra offers patients a more convenient treatment option with proven efficacy and the flexibility and freedom to self-infuse at home. CSL Behring is deeply committed to delivering innovative therapies to patients with rare and serious diseases like CIDP, and today we are proud to now offer a portfolio of immunoglobulin therapies for CIDP.\"\nThe PATH study demonstrated that the percentage of patients experiencing CIDP relapse or withdrawal for any other reason during SCIg treatment was significantly lower with Hizentra (38.6 percent on low-dose Hizentra [0.2 g/kg weekly]; 32.8 percent on high-dose Hizentra [0.4 g/kg weekly]; p values = 0.007 and <0.001 respectively) than with placebo (63.2 percent). Additionally, the PATH study demonstrated that patients on Hizentra reported fewer systemic adverse reactions (ARs) per infusion compared to IVIg treatment (2.7 percent versus 9.8 percent, respectively). In fact, 93 percent of the 4,225 total Hizentra infusions were free of any ARs.\n\"As a practicing neurologist treating patients with CIDP, I am excited to have a safe and effective subcutaneous treatment option to offer my patients who are interested in more treatment flexibility and control in their busy lives,\" said Dr. Todd Levine, Phoenix Neurological Associates.\nIn CIDP, the myelin sheath, or the protective covering of the nerves, is damaged, which may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. The effects of CIDP can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. Approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated.\n\"Despite available treatment options, many CIDP patients continue to struggle with daily disease and lifestyle challenges, making continued research and innovation critical,\" said Lisa Butler, executive director of the GBS|CIDP Foundation International. \"The approval of Hizentra offers patients who were once burdened by traveling to the infusion center or hospital the flexibility to self-administer their treatment at a time, place, and on a schedule that's convenient for them.\"\nHizentra is currently approved in 51 countries for the treatment of certain immune deficiencies. For more information about Hizentra, including the U.S. prescribing information, visit www.hizentra.com .\nAbout CIDP\nIn CIDP, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves (those outside the brain and spinal cord), the myelin sheath, the protective covering of the nerves, is damaged. This may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue, and other symptoms. CIDP effects can worsen over time, leading to significant activity limitations and a decreased quality of life. CIDP can occur at any age and is more common in men than in women. Approximately 30 percent of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence if not treated. In the U.S., it is estimated that the incidence of CIDP is up to two patients per 100,000 people each year, i with a prevalence of 40,000 people affected. ii\nAbout Hizentra ®\nHizentra (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous [Human] 20% Liquid), the first 20 percent SCIg developed for subcutaneous use, is registered in over 51 countries and approved to treat certain immune deficiencies. Hizentra , the world's most prescribed SCIg, has a proven track record of safety, efficacy, and tolerability and has over 4.8 million exposures worldwide since 2010.\nImportant Safety Information for the U.S.\nHizentra ® , Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid, is indicated for:\nTreatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI) in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older. Maintenance therapy in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) to prevent relapse of neuromuscular disability and impairment. Maintenance therapy in CIDP has been systematically studied for 6 months and for a further 12 months in a follow-up study. Continued maintenance beyond these periods should be individualized based on patient response and need for continued therapy.\nFor subcutaneous infusion only.\nWARNING: Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including Hizentra. Risk factors may include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer Hizentra at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity.\nHizentra is contraindicated in patients with a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human immune globulin (Ig) or components of Hizentra (eg, polysorbate 80), as well as in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. Because Hizentra contains L-proline as stabilizer, use in patients with hyperprolinemia is contraindicated.\nIgA-deficient patients with anti-IgA antibodies are at greater risk of severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Thrombosis may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra.\nMonitor patients for aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), which may occur following treatment with Ig products, including Hizentra. In patients at risk of acute renal failure, monitor renal function, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and urine output. In addition, monitor patients for clinical signs of hemolysis or pulmonary adverse reactions (eg, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI]).\nHizentra is derived from human blood. The risk of transmission of infectious agents, including viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent and its variant (vCJD), cannot be completely eliminated.\nThe most common adverse reactions (observed in ≥5% of study subjects) were local infusion-site reactions, as well as headache, diarrhea, fatigue, back pain, nausea, extremity pain, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, rash, pruritus, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, migraine, arthralgia, pain, fall, and nasopharyngitis.\nThe passive transfer of antibodies can interfere with response to live virus vaccines and lead to misinterpretation of serologic test results.\nPlease see full prescribing information for Hizentra.\nAbout CSL Behring\nCSL Behring is a global biotherapeutics leader driven by its promise to save lives.
