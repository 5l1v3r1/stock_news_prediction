(NASDAQ:CWST), a regional solid waste, recycling and resource management services company, today announced two transactions relating to certain of its industrial revenue bonds.\nCasella announced an offering of $15.0 million aggregate principal amount of Finance Authority of Maine (“FAME”) Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (Casella Waste Systems, Inc. Project) Series 2015R-2 (the “FAME Bonds”), under an indenture between FAME and the bond trustee. The FAME Bonds represent the drawdown of the remainder of the FAME 2015 solid waste disposal revenue bonds, the initial proceeds of which, in the amount of $15.0 million, were loaned to Casella in August 2015. The FAME Bonds will be guaranteed by all or substantially all of Casella’s subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of the indenture. The FAME Bonds have a final maturity of August 1, 2035. The FAME Bonds are not a general or contingent obligation of FAME, or of the State of Maine, and are payable solely from amounts received from Casella under the indenture. The net proceeds of the FAME Bonds will be loaned to Casella to enable it to finance or refinance the costs of certain of Casella’s solid waste landfill facilities and solid waste collection, organics and transfer, recycling and hauling facilities in Maine and the issuance of the FAME Bonds.\nThe Company also announced that it has commenced the remarketing of $16.0 million aggregate principal amount of Vermont Economic Development Authority (“VEDA”) Solid Waste Disposal Revenue Bonds (Casella Waste Systems, Inc. Project) Series 2013 (the “VEDA Bonds,” and together with the FAME Bonds, the “Bonds”). The VEDA Bonds were originally issued on April 4, 2013 and have a final maturity of April 1, 2036. Pursuant to the indenture under which the VEDA Bonds were offered, the interest rate period under which the VEDA Bonds were previously issued is expiring on April 2, 2018 and accordingly the VEDA Bonds are being remarketed at a new interest rate for a new interest rate period. The VEDA Bonds have been guaranteed by all or substantially all of Casella’s subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of the indenture. The VEDA Bonds are not a general or contingent obligation of VEDA, or of the State of Vermont, and are payable solely from amounts received from Casella under the indenture. Casella has issued a notice of a mandatory tender for the VEDA Bonds with respect to the expiring interest rate period. The remarketing is expected to become effective on April 2, 2018.\nThe Bonds are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The interest rate period, interest rate and timing of the offerings of the Bonds will depend upon market conditions and other factors and there can be no assurance that the offerings will be completed.\nThe Bonds have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Bonds, nor shall there be any sale of the Bonds in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. This notice is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain matters discussed in this press release are “ ”, including, among others, Casella’s intention to issue the FAME Bonds and its expectations regarding the use of proceeds of the FAME Bonds, and Casella’s intention to remarket the VEDA Bonds.
