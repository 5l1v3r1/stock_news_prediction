REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Under the provisional arrangement, Abramovich’s Cyprus-based company Crispian would be able to sell the shares to Potanin and Rusal in proportion to their existing holdings in Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel), the lawyer told a London court on Thursday.\nHowever, any transfer of shares would be reversed if the court rules in favor of Rusal in a dispute.\nRusal ( 0486.HK ) is trying to stop Chelsea soccer club owner Abramovich from selling Nornickel shares, arguing that would violate a 2012 shareholder agreement.\nFILE PHOTO: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich Action Images via Reuters / John Sibley Livepic Interros, which manages Potanin’s assets, said it planned to complete its purchase of a 2 percent stake in Nornickel from Abramovich next week. Rusal did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nThe ownership dispute is part of a long-running battle for control of Nornickel, a $31 billion company that competes with Brazil’s Vale VALE5.SA for the rank of the world’s top nickel producer. It is also the world’s largest palladium producer.\nPotanin owns a 30.4 percent stake in Nornickel and Rusal, controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, holds 27.8 percent. Abramovich and his partners hold a 6.3 percent stake.\nJudge Christopher Butcher said the trial over the legality of the share sale by Abramovich would start on May 14 unless the parties appealed for a delay by April 13.\nReporting by Peter Hobson; Additional reporting by Polina Devitt; Writing by Peter Hobson and Polina Devitt; Editing by David Goodman and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:23:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
