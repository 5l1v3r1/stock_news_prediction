Several countries have also stepped in to ban trading or the usage of cryptocurrencies. But the increased popularity of digital currencies led to the launch of bitcoin futures in the U.S.\nStill, the ultra-rich seemed to prefer parking their wealth in stocks and properties, the Knight Frank report showed.\n\"That's not surprising due to the fact that equities did very well last year,\" Holt said. \"And property still remains the cornerstone of most wealthy individuals' portfolios, accounting for up to 50 percent in many portfolios.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T07:04:57.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
