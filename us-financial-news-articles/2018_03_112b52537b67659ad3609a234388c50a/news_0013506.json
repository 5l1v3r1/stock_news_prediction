Toyota did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a special order in November, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked 29 automakers, including Toyota, to disclose the safety of any of their vehicles or engines containing products supplied by Kobe Steel.\nThe regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what data it had received in response and whether there was any evidence of faulty materials in Toyota cars.\nMonday’s 40-page lawsuit outlines the ways in which the companies allegedly concealed poor metal quality. It demands compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount.\nAccording to the complaint, at least six Toyota car models sold or leased to U.S. consumers were manufactured with sub-standard metal from Kobe Steel. Plaintiffs said the metal could impact vehicle safety and performance.\nToyota had the duty to disclose any defective vehicle components because it has consistently marketed its automobiles as safe, functional and reliable, the lawsuit says.\nKobe and Toyota had superior knowledge and access to the facts, the lawsuit alleged, giving rise to fraud by concealment claims.\nKobe is also undergoing a separate U.S. Justice Department probe.
