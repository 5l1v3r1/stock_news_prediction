The market may perceive this as reflecting positively on the SFO investigation outcome,” Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Pulleyn said in a note.\nPetrofac also said chief operating officer Marwan Chedid had stepped down and would act in an advisory capacity for a transitional period to assist on his succession.\nChedid was suspended in May and he consequently resigned from the board.\nThe company said it planned to exit the deep-water business and expects to take an impairment charge of $176 million related to its offshore construction vessel JDS6000.\nOilfield service companies had been hurt by weak demand as recent subdued oil prices forced explorers and producers to cut capital expenditure and defer or cancel contracts.\nHowever, Petrofac said in December it saw a recovery in orders and it continued to see a high level of tendering activity in its core markets.\nThe company, which designs, builds, operates and maintains oil and gas facilities, said new order intake stood at $5.2 billion, compared with $1.9 billion it reported same time last year.\nPetrofac said net debt was about $600 million as at Dec. 31, well below the $850 million it forecast in December.\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 3.7 percent to $730 million for the year ended Dec. 31, beating analysts’ average estimate of $695.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nHowever, the company reported a total net loss of $29 million, taking charges of $372 million related to exceptional items.\nRevenue fell 18.8 percent to $6.40 billion with an order backlog of $10.2 billion at the end of 2017, compared with $11.7 billion, a year ago.
