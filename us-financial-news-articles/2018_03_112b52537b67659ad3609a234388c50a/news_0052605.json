We believe that the fourfold growth in project backlog to 25 million outlines more clearly what we have done in 2017 and proves that we are on the right track toward the 2020 Strategic Plan. The gross margin at 40% is a testament to our great operational and business performance, the pipeline at 150 million confirms our strong synergies with ENGIE, and the investment of 27% of our revenues in R&D confirms our commitment to innovation and state-of-the-art technology positioning. This continuous growth, which is the result of our team’s excellence and commitment, is just the first step toward establishing a driving force in energy transition and is the key cornerstone for our long-term growth within the ENGIE group.”\nPARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nElectro Power Systems S.A. (“ EPS ”) (Paris:EPS), technology pioneer in energy storage systems and microgrids listed on the French-regulated market Euronext Paris (EPS:FP), today announces its 2017 full-year financial results. The accounts have been examined and approved by the Board of Directors on 28 March 2018 and audited by the Statutory Auditors. The full 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements will be available on the EPS’s website www.electropowersystems.com and the full set of consolidated figures is attached to this press release.\n2017 KEY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenues increased by 40% to 9,898k€, for an increase of 2,811k€ compared with 2016. Such result does not take into account 2,631k€ work in progress under the 20MW system in Spain, which would be shifted to 2018. Such growth is mainly due to the successful deployment of microgrids and off-grid solutions in emerging countries in East Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, but even more importantly of grid-connected solutions in Europe. These positive developments were due also to the credibility of the Group established through projects with Enel, Terna, Edison, Toshiba, and other major utilities and industrial players.\n1 Project Backlog means, as of the date of this press release, the estimated revenue and other income attributable to (1) purchase orders received, contracts signed and projects awarded as of the date hereof, and (2) projects secured on a Power Purchase Agreement basis, therefore where the agreed value is a price per kWh of electricity and an amount of MW to be installed.\n2 Data as of the date of this press Release, in line with the announcement made with the publication of the 2016 annual results (data published on 23 March 2017)\nOrder intake 2017 accelerated to 40.5MW, representing approximately €16.6mln, up 37% compared to 2016, including not only utility-scale storage systems but also microgrids, smart islands and control systems for mobility and distribution applications.\nProject Backlog as of the date hereof represents €25.1mln, of which €10.1mln of firm and irrevocable orders are on an EPC basis, and €15mln of projects are secured on a Power Purchase Agreement basis, for which the financing is currently being structured. Pipeline as of today is essentially stable to €150mln, meaning that projects converted into Backlog have been replaced by new opportunities under development.\nThe main regions where these systems have been installed or are under commissioning are Asia, North Africa, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. This result confirms the effectiveness of the EPS business model, which has been strengthened by the team and of the technology that has enabled EPS to accelerate its growth to 43 customers in 18 countries.\nDespite an increase in projects’ size and complexity, the gross margin stands at 40%, confirming the visibility of the business cash flow potential.\nPersonnel costs decreased by 5% to 3,503k€ compared with 3,696k€ in 2016, despite a 7% increase in human resources. This is essentially due to the intensity of the R&D effort constantly undertaken in parallel to the business execution, and to the related personnel cost investments aimed at implementing the potential of the EPS technology. In this respect, investments in R&D amounted to 2,693k€, including both the amount accounted for in profit and loss and the one capitalised. These investments represent 27% of consolidated revenues, confirming the strong commitment of the Group to continued investing in research and development.\nOther Operating Expenses decreased by 797k€, amounting to 2,102k€, compared to 2,899k€ due to cost rationalization and a more efficient internal organizational structure.\nDespite the more structured industrial footprint, EBITDA loss has been reduced to -€1.7mln for 2017 compared to -€4.0mln in 2016. This is mainly due to the solidity of the Gross Margin generation in relative terms in parallel with the revenues’ scale up.\nAs of 31 December 2017 – net of the €3,1mln IFRS2 accounting of the EIB Warrants – the Net Income was reduced by 31% compared to 2016 (from -8,557.6k€ to -5,923.3k€). Non-recurrent items, which account for 2,576.6k€, significantly affected the net income and are mainly represented by non-recurring legal, accounting and certification costs (for 986k€), non-recurring distribution and business development expenses (for 1,022k€) and non-recurring travel, communication and roadshow expenses (for 428k€).\nAt the end of 2017, the net financial position of EPS, compared to 31 December 2016, decreased from -974.4k€ to -12,320.3k€, mainly due to the growth of revenues, the backlog of orders and the related increase in working capital, as well as to continuous investments in research and development aimed at implementing the potential of EPS technology. More particularly, the change in working capital was at 5,821k€ on 31 December 2017, a significant increase of 454% compared to 31 December 2016. In this respect, EPS has continued to be supported by Intesa Sanpaolo, which on 6 March approved an additional 3,810k€ of working capital facilities to support the growth of EPS.\nThe Cash position, represented by liquid assets, cash and cash equivalents, amounted to 4,238k€ compared to 5,478k€ at the end of 2016.\nOn 31 December 2017, EPS had 1,449k€ in equity (before the IFRS2 adjustment) and total assets of 23,441.9k€.\nMAIN EVENTS IN 2017\nThe following principal events occurred in 2017:\nMigrogrid in Australia: On 19 January 2017, the Group announced the successful delivery, the official start and commissioning phase of the storage systems sired to the Coober Pedy Renewable Hybrid Power Project’s microgrid in Coober Pedy, Southern Australia.
