Zypries told reporters it would be “problematic” if Moscow were found to have launched the attack, as German media have reported. But she added: “At this moment there is no discussion of that. We cannot say anything at this point.” Germany on Wednesday said security officials were investigating an isolated attack on its government computer networks, but the incident had been brought under control. It did not confirm media reports that the foreign and defence ministries were affected by the attack.
