Nash, chairman, president and CEO of ILG. “In addition, we returned a total of $102 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. As we begin 2018, we are well-positioned to continue to grow our business and deliver shareholder value.”\nFULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $168 million and cash from operating activities was $79 million Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA* and Free cash flow* were $1.8 billion, $346 million, and $128 million, respectively, in-line with our guidance Consolidated timeshare contract sales increased 11% in the year on a pro forma basis. Excluding the estimated impact of the hurricanes, the increase would have been 15% We opened two world-class resorts, The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas and Westin Los Cabos Resort Villas and Spa, and expanded several other properties growing the number of vacation ownership units by nearly 700, or 11% At year-end we had 25 active sales centers, including four which were opened, or expanded, in 2017 We enhanced our product offering through the introduction of two new multi-site programs, Westin Aventuras and Hyatt Residence Club Portfolio Program Interval International added 63 resorts in 20 countries and broadened its suite of products by launching Hotel Exchange, as well as a hotel discount benefit program with Priceline Partner Network\nAs discussed, our results were negatively impacted by several hurricanes which affected our operations beginning in the third quarter. The table below summarizes our results for the quarter and the full year, and provides the estimated impact of the hurricanes in these periods:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Reported Hurricane\nimpact\nEx Hurricane Reported Hurricane\nimpact\nEx Hurricane Revenues 438 16 454 1,786 21 1,807 Net income attributable to common stockholders 67 7 74 168 12 180 Adjusted net income* 30 5 35 139 7 146 Adjusted EBITDA* 85 6 91 346 9 355 Diluted EPS 0.54 0.05 0.59 1.34 0.10 1.44 Adjusted diluted EPS* 0.24 0.04 0.28 1.10 0.06 1.16\n“Adjusted net income”, “Adjusted diluted EPS”, “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Free cash flow” are non-GAAP measures as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Please see “Presentation of Financial Information,” “Glossary of Terms” and “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” below for an explanation of non-GAAP measures used throughout this release.\nHurricane Impact\nIn September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria affected several Vistana and HVO resorts and sales centers, as well as nearly 300 properties within the Interval Network or managed by VRI or Aqua-Aston Hospitality. In particular, resorts in the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Maarten, Puerto Rico and Florida, were in the path of these storms. Many of the resorts were only affected for a short period; however, our Westin St. John Resort Villas in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hyatt Residence Club Dorado, Hacienda del Mar, in Puerto Rico remain closed, as do approximately 50 Interval Network properties on the hardest-hit islands. Our three Hyatt Residence Club resorts and our HVO sales center located in Key West were closed for several weeks but re-opened in October.\nWe believe substantially all the property damage and the recoverable lost profitability will be reimbursed by our property insurance and business interruption insurance policies, respectively. We have begun receiving payments for property damages and are currently working to quantify the business interruption claims.\nComparability of results\nIn addition to the negative impact of the hurricanes, the comparability of the results presented herein is impacted by the following factors:\n2017 benefited from a full year impact of Vistana given the acquisition closed in May 2016. 2016 was positively impacted by percentage of completion accounting, or POC, upon the receipt of the certificates of occupancy for certain units at our Westin Nanea and Westin St. John resorts in the fourth quarter. 2016 benefited from the gain on purchase resulting from the Vistana acquisition. The non-cash gain was not subject to tax and caused our effective tax rate to decrease to 18% for the year. The 2016 results reflect the impact of purchase accounting related to the acquisition of Vistana. The 2017 results are negatively impacted by the substantial liquidation of our Venezuelan subsidiary. 2017 was positively impacted by a provisional tax benefit of $51 million reflecting the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform”). This amount represents a non-cash benefit of $63 million associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, partly offset by $12 million associated with the “Transition Tax”, the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, that is payable over eight years. As per the tax reform accounting guidelines, these amounts will continue to be evaluated throughout 2018 and are therefore subject to change.\nFourth quarter consolidated operating results\nNet income attributable to common stockholders was $67 million, compared to $27 million in 2016 reflecting the $51 million provisional tax benefit related to Tax Reform recorded in 2017 and a $22 million pre-tax POC benefit in 2016. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, the effective tax rate in the quarter would have been 55%, reflecting $5 million related to several discrete items recorded in the quarter and Mexican inflation adjustments.\nAdjusted net income was $30 million and excluding the estimated impact of the hurricanes would have been $35 million. Adjusted net income excludes the $51 million provisional tax benefit and $7 million related to the substantial liquidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary, as well as other items.\nAdjusted diluted EPS was $0.24, and excluding the negative hurricane impact would have been $0.28.\nExcluding the above mentioned discrete tax items and adjustments for Mexican inflation, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS would be higher by $5 million and $0.04, respectively.\nConsolidated revenue was $438 million, compared to $455 million in the previous year, primarily reflecting the tough comparison to 2016 which included $46 million revenue benefit associated with POC, as well as the estimated $16 million negative impact in the quarter associated with the hurricanes. Excluding these items, plus the $9 million negative impact of purchase accounting in 2016, consolidated revenue in the quarter would have been up by 9%, primarily driven by a 20% increase in consolidated timeshare contract sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $85 million compared to $105 million in the prior year, principally reflecting the $24 million POC benefit recorded in 2016, as well as the estimated $6 million negative impact associated with the hurricanes in 2017. Excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter would have been up by 12%.\nBusiness segment results\nVacation Ownership\nVacation ownership segment revenue was $297 million in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the hurricanes, and adjusting for the $46 million favorable POC impact in 2016, Vacation Ownership segment revenue increased $44 million, or 16%, driven primarily by a $23 million, or 20%, increase in consolidated timeshare contract sales. This robust growth is largely attributable to a 14% increase in tour flow, driven by our recently-opened sales centers in Maui and Los Cabos and solid same store sales performance.\nVacation Ownership segment operating income was $28 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $47 million.\nExcluding the $4 million estimated impact of the hurricane in the segment, and the $24 million POC benefit in 2016, Adjusted EBITDA for the segment would have increased by $10 million, or 24%, to $51 million.\nExchange and Rental\nExchange and Rental segment revenue was $141 million, in-line with the prior year, despite a $2 million estimated impact from the hurricane to the Interval International business as approximately 50 affiliated resorts remained closed at year end.\nTotal Interval Network active members were 1.8 million at year end, relatively consistent with the prior year, and average revenue per member was $44.32, up 2% compared to the prior year largely attributable to an increase in Getaway fees.\nOperating income for the segment was $27 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $38 million.\nExcluding the estimated $2 million impact from the hurricanes, Exchange and Rental Adjusted EBITDA would have been $40 million, in-line with 2016.\nFull year consolidated operating results\nNet income attributable to common stockholders in the full year was $168 million, compared to $265 million in 2016 which included the $163 million nontaxable gain on purchase of Vistana.\nFor 2017 and 2016, we recorded tax provisions of $26 million and $57 million, respectively, which represent effective tax rates of 13% and 18%, respectively. The 2017 provision includes a net provisional tax benefit for the impact of Tax Reform of approximately $51 million and 2016 reflects the above-mentioned gain on bargain purchase.\nExcluding the impact of Tax Reform in 2017 and the gain on purchase in 2016, our effective tax rate would have been approximately 39% and 35%, respectively. The increase in 2017 is primarily attributable to the previously-mentioned discrete tax items and adjustments for Mexican inflation.\nAdjusted net income was $139 million in 2017 compared to $130 million, and excluding the estimated $7 million negative impact of the hurricanes, would have been $146 million. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.10, and adjusted for the estimated $0.06 impact of the hurricanes would have been $1.16.\nConsolidated revenue increased $430 million to $1.8 billion, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Vistana for a full year. The results include a $39 million positive POC impact recorded in 2016, as well as the estimated $21 million negative impact associated with the hurricanes in 2017 and a $24 million negative impact of purchase accounting recorded in 2016. Excluding these impacts, the increase would have been $466 million.\nIn the year, Adjusted EBITDA increased $44 million to $346 million, also primarily due to the inclusion of Vistana. Excluding the $26 million positive POC impact in 2016, and the estimated $9 million negative impact in 2017 related to the hurricanes, the year over year increase would have been nearly $80 million.\nBusiness segment results\nVacation Ownership\nVacation Ownership segment revenue increased $378 million, driven primarily by the inclusion of a full year of Vistana in 2017 and strong growth in consolidated timeshare contract sales, partly offset by the $39 million POC impact and the impact of the hurricanes.\nAssuming we had owned Vistana for the full year 2016, consolidated timeshare sales in 2017 would have increased by 11%, and excluding the estimated impact from the hurricanes, the increase would have been 15%. This robust performance resulted from the contribution of our new Westin Nanea and Westin Los Cabos galleries, as well as from solid same store sales, both primarily driven by growth in the number of vacation ownership units in our portfolio. In 2017 we expanded the number of vacation ownership units by nearly 700, or 11%. Tour flow increased 10% in the year, and excluding the impact of the hurricanes we estimate it would have increased by 14%.\nVacation Ownership segment operating income was $75 million compared to $53 million in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the segment increased by $33 million, to $156 million due primarily to the inclusion of Vistana for the full year in 2017. The comparison against 2017 is impacted by $26 million of POC (exclusive of any purchase accounting impact) in 2016, partly offset by a $12 million favorable product cost true-up from the realization of development cost savings related to the completion of The Westin Nanea under budget and ahead of schedule.\nExchange and Rental\nExchange and Rental segment revenue increased $52 million to $619 million due primarily to the inclusion of Vistana Signature Network for a full year.\nTotal Interval Network active members and revenue per member were 1.8 million and $190.05, relatively consistent with the prior year.\nOperating income and Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased $12 million to $144 million, and $11 million to $190 million, respectively, due to the inclusion of a full year of Vistana Signature Network.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $122 million.\nThe principal amount outstanding of long-term corporate debt as of December 31, 2017 was $570 million consisting of $350 million 5.625% Senior Notes and $220 million drawn under our revolving credit facility. ILG had $366 million available on its revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2017. The revolver may be increased by $100 million under certain conditions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, which includes $231 million of inventory spend, was $79 million compared to $7 million of net cash used in operating activities in 2016. The inventory spend was primarily associated with investments in development activities at our Westin Nanea, Westin Los Cabos, Sheraton Steamboat, Westin Desert Willow, Westin St. John and Westin Resort in Cancun. Excluding inventory spend, net cash provided by operating activities would have been $310 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $115 million reflecting capital expenditures related to investments in sales galleries and other resort operation assets, as well as IT initiatives.\nOn September 22, 2017, we completed a term securitization transaction involving the issuance of $325 million of asset backed notes. The notes are backed by vacation ownership loans from both Vistana Signature Experiences and Hyatt Vacation Ownership and have an overall weighted average coupon of 2.43%. The advance rate for this transaction was approximately 97%.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $26 million, reflecting net amounts received from the $325 million securitization as well as the release of $14 million in financing-related restricted cash associated with the securitizations, largely offset by payments on securitized debt, cash dividend payments and stock repurchases.\nFree cash flow (defined below) for 2017 was $128 million compared to $180 million in 2016. This primarily reflects a full year of repayments related to the September 2016 securitization, lower net proceeds from the 2017 securitization, higher inventory spend and capital expenditures, partly offset by higher cash provided by operating activities.\nDividends and stock repurchases\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, ILG repurchased 1.1 million shares for $28 million at an average share price of $25.00 and paid $0.60 cents per share for a total of $74 million in dividends, returning $102 million to shareholders.\nIn February 2018, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.175 per share payable March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 16, 2018.\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE\nThe 2018 Outlook schedule reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures in our full year 2018 guidance to the following expected GAAP results. The information below reflects anticipated changes resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. The changes, which primarily result in classification changes between revenue and costs, are not material. The 2018 Outlook does not reflect business interruption insurance proceeds as the timing of these payments is currently uncertain.\n2018 Outlook Low High (Dollars in millions) Net income attributable to common stockholders $154 $169 Net cash provided by operating activities $220 $235 Consolidated revenues $1,870 $1,995 Adjusted EBITDA $350 $370 Free cash flow $240 $270 Consolidated timeshare contract sales growth 9% 16% Based on information currently available to us, in 2018 we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28%.\nOur 2018 outlook includes the following estimated negative impact from the hurricanes:\n2018 estimated hurricane impact (Dollars in millions) Consolidated revenues $67\nAdjusted EBITDA $23\nFree cash flow $21 Consolidated timeshare contract sales growth 3%\nPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nILG management believes that the presentation of non-generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP) financial measures, including, among others, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted basic and diluted EPS, and free cash flow, serves to enhance the understanding of ILG's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance and liquidity prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, adjusted EBITDA (with certain different adjustments) is used to calculate compliance with certain financial covenants in ILG's credit agreement and indenture. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures improve the transparency of our disclosures, provide meaningful presentations of our results from our business operations and liquidity excluding the impact of certain items not related to our core business operations and improve the period to period comparability of results from business operations. These measures may also be useful in comparing our results to those of other companies; however, our calculations may differ from the calculations of these measures used by other companies. More information about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of historical GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures, is available in the financial tables that accompany this press release.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nInvestors and analysts may participate in the live conference call by dialing (844) 832-7221 (toll-free domestic) or (973) 638-3062 (international); Conference ID: 8973227 .

Additionally, this item includes certain restructuring charges primarily related to workforce reductions, costs associated with integrating acquired businesses and estimated costs of exiting contractual commitments.\nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period for basic EPS and, additionally, inclusive of dilutive securities for diluted EPS.\nAdjusted EBITDA - EBITDA, excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) goodwill and asset impairments and/or permitted reversals, (3) acquisition related and restructuring costs, (4) other non-operating income and expense, (5) the impact of the application of purchase accounting, and (6) other special items. The Company's presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders, excluding the impact of (1) acquisition related and restructuring costs, (2) other non-operating foreign currency remeasurements, (3) the impact of the application of purchase accounting, (4) goodwill and asset impairments and/or permitted reversals, and (5) other special items.\nAncillary member revenue - Other Interval Network member related revenue including insurance and travel related services.\nAverage revenue per member - Membership fee revenue, transaction revenue and ancillary member revenue for the Interval Network, Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club for the applicable period, divided by the monthly weighted average number of Interval Network active members during the applicable period.

Management believes presenting gross margin without these expenses provides management and investors a relevant period-over-period comparison.\nEBITDA - Net income attributable to common stockholders excluding, if applicable: (1) non-operating interest income and interest expense, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation expense, and (4) amortization expense of intangibles.\nFree cash flow – is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and repayment activity related to securitizations, plus net changes in financing-related restricted cash and proceeds from securitizations (net of fees). This metric also excludes certain payments unrelated to our ongoing core business, such as acquisition-related and restructuring expenses.\nImpact of the application of purchase accounting – represents the difference between amounts derived from the fair value remeasurement of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination versus the historical basis. We believe generally this is most meaningful in the first year subsequent to an acquisition.\nManagement fee revenue – Represents vacation ownership property management revenue earned by our Vacation Ownership segment exclusive of cost reimbursements.\nMembership fee revenue – Represents fees paid for membership in the Interval Network, Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club.\nNet leverage – Long term debt (excluding issuance costs) minus cash and cash equivalents divided by Adjusted EBITDA.\nOther special items – consist of other items that we believe are not related to our core business operations.
