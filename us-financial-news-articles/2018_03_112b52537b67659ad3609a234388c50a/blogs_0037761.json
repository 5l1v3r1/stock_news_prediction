Mike Lee, R-Utah, along with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., introduced a bill in February to withdraw U.S. armed forces from the Yemen conflict, where they have provided limited intelligence and refueling for warplanes. The Senate is poised to vote on the measure on Tuesday. \nAlso on Tuesday, antiwar demonstrations were held in Washington and New York City. Additional protests are planned in Boston to coincide with Crown Prince Mohammed's multi-city visit to the United States . \nThe crown prince spearheaded the invasion of Yemen shortly after being named minister of defense in 2015. The conflict has dragged on for three years, sparking a humanitarian crisis in the Arab world's poorest nation. \nTrump said the U.S.-Saudi relationship had improved from the days of the Obama administration, which halted some arms sales to Saudi Arabia over concerns about civilian deaths in Yemen. President Barack Obama also angered the Saudis by negotiating a nuclear agreement with their regional rival, Iran. \nPrior to his visit, Mohammed told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that Saudi Arabia would immediately seek to obtain a nuclear weapon if Iran developed one. \nAfter discussing the arms sales, Trump suggested that the United States could soon extricate itself from Middle East conflicts after years of involvement in Iraq and Syria. He noted that the United States and its allies have clawed back territory in those two nations from the so-called Islamic State. \n\"We'll be able to get out of certain areas that we've wanted to get out of for a long period of time, and other countries can handle it,\" he said. \"At this point, they'll be able to handle it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T20:18:28.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
