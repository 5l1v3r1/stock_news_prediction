He held off a check from Calgary’s Mark Jankowski when he redirected Brent Burns’ shot-pass into the cage.\nJankowski made amends by playing a part in Michael Stone’s goal at 12:17 of the first period to put the Flames on the board, screening Jones when Stone unloaded a blast from the point and snapped a 51-game goal drought with his third marker of the season.\nBut Kane’s shorthanded goal just before the midway point restored San Jose’s two-goal lead and took the wind out of the sails for the struggling Flames. Seconds after Calgary’s Dougie Hamilton rang a shot off the post, Kane was unchecked on a rush and made no mistake to make it a 3-1 count.\nAfter Justin Braun scored at 10:09 of the third period, Kane netted his second of the game 121 seconds later when Dillon’s shot ricocheted off him and into the cage.\nThe victory gives the Sharks a sweep of the season series.\nRittich made 28 saves for the Flames, who have lost five straight.\nOn Friday, the Flames announced Sean Monahan, their top-line center and top goal scorer with 31 tallies, has been shut down for the season to have wrist surgery as well as deal with a hip injury.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:50:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
