I thought they could have done better.\n“But anyway, from fifth we go to eighth.”\nChampion Lewis Hamilton grabbed a record seventh pole at the Australian race for Mercedes, surpassing Ayrton Senna’s six and leaving a gap of more than six-tenths of a second to Ferrari’s second-placed Kimi Raikkonen.\nFILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 23, 2018 Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice REUTERS/Brandon Malone Red Bull arrived in Melbourne with great expectations but finished behind both the Ferraris, with Max Verstappen to start fourth alongside four-times champion Sebastian Vettel.\n“I think the qualifying first parts were OK but at the end we just missed a few tenths,” Ricciardo said. “It looked like it was all in the first sector (of the circuit).\n“I don’t really know with the balance what I could have done much more there, so I’ll see now. Yes, for sure it was frustrating a little bit.”\nFormula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 24, 2018 Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in action during qualifying REUTERS/Brandon Malone Red Bull team principal Christian Horner earlier said he had never seen Ricciardo so enraged.\n“I don’t think (the stewards) wanted to give him the penalty but they had to,” the Briton said. “You could see from the wording of the statement that they tried to water it down as best they could.\n“It’s just so unfortunate for Daniel, home driver, home race. I’ve never seen him as angry as he was last night. It’s still eating him up and he’s still pretty revved up about it.”\nRicciardo, who has won five races for Red Bull, has had a bitter record at Albert Park, where no Australian racer has won.\nIn 2014, he finished second behind Mercedes winner Nico Rosberg but was later disqualified due to a technical infringement that was no fault of his own.\nLast year, he crashed during qualifying, had to start the race from pit-lane due to a reliability problem and ended up retiring midway.\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:50:24.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
