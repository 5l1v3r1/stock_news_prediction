Our boss was under extreme pressure from the bank to pay off loans,” said Wang.\nYulin Huachen, which runs a similiar-sized plant in neighbouring Shaanxi province, resumed half of its production last weekend after closing for more than two months, said a company sales manager, who declined to be identified as he was not authorize to speak to the media.\nSinopec and CNPC cut gas supplies to the LNG plants to meet the newly created demand from residential consumers. These buyers were converted to gas or electric heating ahead of this winter to reduce air pollution from coal-fired heating as part of the government’s war on smog.\nThe companies could not cope with the extra demand because of inadequate infrastructure and insufficient domestic output. The government rules on the fuel switching also prioritised residential users over industrial consumers.\nCNPC and Sinopec declined to comment on whether they have resumed piped gas shipments to the LNG users.\nMore of the LNG plants are expected to resume operations in the coming weeks as gas supplies improve, said Zhang Mengjie, gas analyst at Shandong-based Longzhong Information Group.\nData from Longzhong shows the LNG plants were operating at just 27 percent of capacity last week, versus 38 percent a year ago and a typical level of 50 percent.\nThe 27 percent is equivalent to daily output of 23 million cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations, based on overall daily operating capacity of 85.6 million cubic metres.\nChinese LNG prices have fallen as the plants return to production and as some end-users remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.\nThe daily wholesale LNG price index tracking spot prices across the country assessed by industry publication www.yeslng.com fell 5.4 percent to 4,659 yuan per tonne from Monday to Wednesday.\n“Demand from downstream users is not very good now as some of them remain on holiday and won’t be back until next week,” said Diao Zhouwei, a natural gas analyst at IHS Markit. “With the weather getting warmer, demand from residential users is declining, which leaves more fuel for the industrial sector.”\n$1 = 6.3275 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:29:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
