The revised protocol focuses on a subgroup of patients who have failed previous treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on this revised protocol, in Q1 2018, competents authorities in the U.S. and Europe approved resume of patient accrual. In addition, the approval from Israeli competent authorities to initiate the trial adds Israel to the U.S. and to seven European countries for the redeployment of the international Phase 3 Tedopi® trial.\nPhase 2 trial in pancreatic cancer, in clinical collaboration with the GERCOR group, an independent French non-profit network of cancer specialists\nIn September 2017, a collaboration was concluded with the GERCOR oncology cooperative group involved in digestive cancer to evaluate Tedopi® in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This is a Phase 2 trial of maintenance therapy with Tedopi® alone or in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor versus Folfiri*, in patients with stable disease after four months of standard chemotherapy with Folforinox**. Initiation of this Phase 2 is expected in 2018.\n* Folfiri: combination chemotherapy with folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan\n** Folfirinox: combination chemotherapy with folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin\nOSE-172, a new generation checkpoint inhibitor targeting myeloid cells via the SIRPa receptor – A focus on clinical development in tumor microenvironment : Clinical program planned end of 2018\nNew preclinical data were presented at international immuno-oncology and immunology conferences that show the strong impact of OSE-172 on the tumor micro-environment by targeting suppressive myeloid cells through a specific blockade of SIRPa. OSE-172 has a unique and beneficial pharmacologic profile, and is highly selective for promoting T-lymphocytes that destroy cancer cells. In July, the company received a €9.2 million grant from Bpifrance as part of a collaborative program (EFFI-CLIN) to support the development of OSE-172, planned to enter clinical Phase in 2018. This program will include product manufacturing, translational studies and a clinical program planned through Phase 2.\nOSE-703, a cytotoxic monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha-chain of the receptor for\ninterleukin-7\nIn June 2017, the company entered into a research collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York. The goal of this collaboration is to explore the efficacy profile and the development potential of immunotherapy with OSE-703 in solid tumors. The research is being conducted by\nPrasad S. Adusumilli, M.D., an expert in tumor immunology and in the development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) immunotherapy.\nAUTOIMMUNE DISEASES: PROGRAMS DEVELOPED THROUGH STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND CLINICAL MILESTONES EXPECTED IN 2018\nOSE-127, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the CD127 receptor, the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) – License option with Servier (December 2016) to develop and commercialize the product in autoimmune diseases\nNew positive clinical results and translational data, presented in June at the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies conference, have shown a differentiated mechanism of action for OSE-127 able to fight pathologic local homing of inflammatory T lymphocytes, key players in the chronicity of inflammatory bowel disease. In June 2017, the company received a €2.597 million payment from Bpifrance, after achieving a milestone in the collaborative EFFIMab project developing OSE-127 in ulcerative colitis.\nFR104, CD28-antagonist: Phase 1 completed – License agreement with Janssen Biotech (July 2016) to pursue the product’s clinical development in autoimmune diseases\nFollowing positive Phase 1 results, the product’s development is being pursued in partnership with Janssen Biotech to prepare its entry into Phase 2 trial in rheumatoid arthritis planned for the end of 2018.\nThe Company will pursue the research of new collaborative or license agreements, which can be initiated at different stages of product development, with players involved in the field of activation and regulation immunology and in therapeutic combinations of high clinical interest.\n2017 ANNUAL RESULTS\nMeeting of Board of Directors of OSE Immunotherapeutics was held on March 28, 2018. Following the opinion of the Audit Committee, the Board approved the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared under IFRS at 31 December 2017.\nThe key figures of the 2017 consolidated annual results are reported below (and presented in the attached tables):\nIn k€ 12/31/2017 12/31/2016 Current operating result -12 626 -8 236 Operating result -12 626 17 499 Net result -10 503 20 666 Available cash* 12 528 17 766 Consolidated balance sheet 77 353 89 547 As of December 31, 2017, available cash* amounted to €12.528 million, excluded 2016 and 2017 research tax credits totaling €5.585 million.\nThis available cash will enable the Company to finance its 2018 development costs including the Phase 3 clinical trial with Tedopi®, the preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development of OSE-127 and of OSE-172, and R&D costs on earlier stage products. In addition, the company should reach a new milestone this year in the development of OSE-127 as part of its contract with Servier, that could generate a cash inflow of €12 million.\nMoreover, completion of the next key milestone related to the company’s collaborative program on OSE-172 (EFFI-CLIN), if validated, will trigger a payment of €5.5 million from Bpifrance in 2018.\nAs of today, the Company has funds to pursue its activities during the next 12 months following the publication of the accounts closed on December 31, 2017.\nAs a reminder, the 2016 operating result was positively impacted, both due to the license option exercise by Janssen Biotech for FR104 and to a badwill due to the merger operation of May 2016.\nMoreover, due to the merger between OSE Pharma and Effimune, 2016 annual results include only 7 months of Effimune operational expenses.\n* Cash and cash equivalents and Current financial assets\nABOUT OSE Immunotherapeutics\nOur ambition is to become a world leader in activation and regulation immunotherapies:\nOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on the development of innovative immunotherapies for immune activation and regulation in the fields of immuno-oncology, autoimmune diseases and transplantation.
