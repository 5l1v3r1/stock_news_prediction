It had reported a 1.4 billion rand loss a year earlier.\nGroup service revenue rose 7.2 percent to 124 billion rand, due to strong performance in Nigeria, the company’s most lucrative where it has also been embroiled in a dispute over repatriating funds and unregistered SIM cards.\nThe Nigerian Senate approved in November a report largely exonerating MTN of illegally repatriating $14 billion. The report followed MTN’s agreement to pay a $1.1 billion fine to settle a row over unregistered SIM cards.\n$1 = 11.8992 rand Reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Edmund Blair\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:34:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
