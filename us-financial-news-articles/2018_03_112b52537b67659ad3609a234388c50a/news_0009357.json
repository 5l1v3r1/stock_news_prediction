The global sugar market has a large surplus.\nThe current price difference between gasoline and ethanol is among the largest on record, Unica said, with some places in Brazil showing a gap as large as 1.21 real per liter ($1.4 per gallon). Almost all of Brazil’s cars can run on either fuel.\nReporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:05:03.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
