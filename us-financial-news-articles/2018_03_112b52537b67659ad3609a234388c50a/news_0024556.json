Prime Minister Theresa May said earlier on Monday it was“highly likely” that Moscow was responsible for the attack and some British officials have suggested boycotting the Russia-hosted World Cup later this year in response. “We want to emphasize once again: such provocative statements, which fan anti-Russian hysteria, only complicate relations between our countries and are blow to world sport,” Interfax quoted the ministry as saying in a statement.
