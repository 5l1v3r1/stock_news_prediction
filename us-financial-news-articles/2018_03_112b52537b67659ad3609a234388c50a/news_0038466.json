He also launched Virgin Mobile with Virgin Group CEO Richard Branson, who he says had a big influence on his leadership style and philosophy of leading.\n“He basically said there’s no way that a company can be an enduring company if they’re not fundamentally a customer champion. So I really adopted that into my whole philosophy and way of thinking,” Schulman says about Branson. “And the second thing he said, companies need to be a force for good.”\nWatch the video above for more from our conversation with Schulman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T01:37:56.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
