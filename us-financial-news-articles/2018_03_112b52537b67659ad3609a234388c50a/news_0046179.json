While judges are not obliged to follow the adviser’s recommendation, they do so in most cases.\nCLIMATE BALANCE Separately, Kowalczyk said he was seeing some support in Europe and beyond for plans, backed by Warsaw, to let nations balance out their carbon dioxide emissions with absorption of greenhouse gases by forests.\nThe plan would be discussed, he said, at U.N. climate talks that Poland will host in December in its southern city of Katowice - the center of the coal-producing Silesia region.\n“The issue of absorbing emissions has its opponents, which is why we realize that these talks will not be easy. We will discuss this - first within the European Union,” Kowalczyk said.\nMany countries want to focus more on cuts in emissions, reckoning the idea of absorption is a sideshow favored by coal-dependent states such as Poland.\nKowalczyk said he had received a “clear declaration” from China’s special representative on climate change that Beijing was interested in the scheme.\nThe minister reiterated that Poland wanted to reduce the share of coal in its electricity production to around 50 percent by 2050 from around 80 percent now.\n“We will be moving slowly from coal to other sources, but it is important that it is not too abrupt,” he added.\nEditing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T20:35:10.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
