It is seeking to overtake foreign rivals and become a top semiconductor producer by 2030, according to its own roadmap.\nChina's ambitions have riled overseas regulators however, who have blocked several acquisition attempts by Chinese firms looking to speed up development through technology transfers.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration is requesting China purchase more semiconductors from the United States as part of a plan to avoid proposed tariffs and a potential trade war, Reuters reported on Tuesday.\nAccording to Friday's notice, companies producing high-end chips using 65 nanometre technology or smaller with an investment of over 15 billion yuan ($2.39 billion) will be exempt from corporate taxes for five years. Companies producing chips using 130 nanometre technology or smaller will be tax exempt for two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:09:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
