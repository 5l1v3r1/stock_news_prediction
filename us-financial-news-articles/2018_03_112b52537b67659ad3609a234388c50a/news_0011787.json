Department leaders contend that the dumping of cheap steel and aluminum from China and other countries puts U.S. competitors out of business, risking national security. \n\"This is the irony of Section 232,\" concluded Currie. \"A tariff intended to support U.S. industry may end up boosting margins and investment for a small subset of producers while leaving the broader economy at a disadvantage via higher costs.\" WATCH: Trump's tariffs could lead to unintended consequences show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T17:03:29.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
