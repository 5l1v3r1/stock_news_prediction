Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Gibney will use journalists Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian’s biography, “Tiger Woods”, which was also released on Tuesday, as a foundation for the series.\nJigsaw did not say when production of the series will begin, and it has yet to be picked up by a distributor.\nWoods, 42, the greatest golfer of his generation who closely guards his personal life and highly crafted image, is in the midst of his latest comeback from injury.\nFILEPHOTO: Director Alex Gibney poses during a photocall to promote the movie 'Zero Days' at the 66th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin, Germany, February 17, 2016.
