In nearby Kent, 5,000 households supplied by Southern Water had problems.\nSevern Trent, a supplier of water to 4.3 million homes and businesses in the middle of England, said the number of burst pipes was up 4000 percent, while in Wales, Welsh Water said between 3,000 and 6,000 homes were being affected.\nSuppliers warned that water supplies would continue to face disruption on Monday as they worked to fix leaks and refill pipes.\nThames Water advised its 15 million customers to only use water where essential.\n“Where possible, take short showers rather than baths, do not leave taps running unnecessarily and only run washing machines and dish washers when you have a full load,” the company said in a statement on its website.
