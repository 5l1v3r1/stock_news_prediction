The three major U.S. stock indexes lost between 1.4 percent and 2.9 percent, fuelled by a selloff in the tech sector on concerns about government regulation stemming from the strong growth and privacy questions surrounding Facebook. \"It appears that markets were trading technology risks, but in more than one sense,\" Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note, adding that Facebook's privacy infringement was a \"convenient excuse to sell-off ahead of the long weekend.\" U.S. markets are closed on Friday for a holiday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent on Wednesday. Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index dropped as much as 1.2 percent, heading for a fifth session of fall in six. It has declined nearly 3.5 percent so far this month in what could be its biggest monthly fall since January 2016. Financials were the top losers on Wednesday with lender Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd weighing the most. OCBC fell as much as 2.5 percent, while peer DBS Group Holdings dropped up to 2.3 percent. Thailand's key SET Index fell after two straight sessions of gains, hurt by consumer staples. Trading store operator Siam Makro PCL slumped as much as 12.3 percent, its sharpest in more than four-and-a-half years. The Bank of Thailand will decide on its one-day repurchase rate later in the day with analysts polled by Reuters unanimously expecting rates to be left unchanged. \"BOT interest policy will be kept at 1.50 percent, so it should be pretty neutral to the market... I do not think it will be impacting Thai equities much,\" said Teerada Charnyingyong, an analyst at Phillip Capital Thailand, adding that large caps could help cushion losses from foreign fund outflows. Indonesian shares fell 0.4 percent, primarily due to financials. Bank Negara Indonesia dropped 3.8 percent. An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks slipped about 0.8 percent. Philippine shares declined for a third session in four with industrials and real estate stocks weighing heavily on the index. SM Investments Corp dropped about 2.4 percent. Vietnam shares were slightly higher with Vingroup JSC up 1.1 percent.
