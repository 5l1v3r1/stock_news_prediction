The executives’ comments were monitored by Reuters via webcast.\nSAP plans to shut down 18 of its 45 datacenters by the end of 2019, as more customers switch to public cloud services, a faster pace than the 10 datacenters it closed in the last two to three years.\nLeukert also said that consolidating a string of cloud software acquisitions running on separate platforms, each separately maintained, onto a single, common platform would be completed by the end of 2018, further shaving costs.\nHe said SAP had elected to harmonise its own company-run datacenters by standardising Google as its preferred “go-to” infrastructure. “There is no difference any more running in Google or on SAP infrastructure,” he said.\nNonetheless, Leukert said SAP was working with all major public cloud providers and had no plans to compete with them.\n“Our cloud solutions run on the major public cloud providers,” he said. “We want to be friends with the best: the Googles, the Amazons, the (Microsoft) Azures”.
