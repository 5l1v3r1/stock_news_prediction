The consumer price index is not expected to fall this month, he added.\n“A downside surprise with inflation will give the bank more room to reduce the interest rate,” Estrella told journalists on a conference call.\nThe central bank cut the interest rate to 2.75 percent on Thursday, its fifth 25-basis point reduction since May.\nEconomic growth in Peru slowed to 2.5 percent last year as corruption probes hit construction activity and political turmoil heightened uncertainty and hobbled government spending.\nReporting By Teresa Cespedes, Writing By Mitra Taj Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:10:00.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
