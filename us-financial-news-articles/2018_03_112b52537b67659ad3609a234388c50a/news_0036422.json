Cloud business revenue rose 31.7 percent to $1.57 billion, but fell short of the average analysts’ estimate of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company in order to increase its competitiveness in the cloud market struck deals with AT&T Inc ( T.N ), construction company Textura TXTR.N and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) over the past couple of years. The company reported a net loss of $4.02 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Feb. 28, compared to a profit of $2.24 billion, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Oracle recorded a charge of $6.9 billion due to changes in the U.S tax law in the reported quarter. Excluding items, the company earned 83 cents per share. Total revenue rose 6.1 percent to $9.77 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 72 cents per share on a revenue of $9.78 billion.
