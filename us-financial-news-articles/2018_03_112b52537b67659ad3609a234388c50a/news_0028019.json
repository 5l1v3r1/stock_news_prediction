(CSE:AKE) (XFRA:A49) (OTC:ATLEF) (the “Company” or “Atlas Cloud”) is pleased to announce the closing of the previously disclosed acquisition of MKH Electric City Holdings LLC, a Washington State company. The transaction includes a 6,600-sq. ft. facility (“The Grant County Data Centre”) which is currently being upgraded to industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining standards.\nThe facility, located in Electric City Washington, is less than five kilometers from the Grand Coulee Dam which impounds a sizable portion of the Columbia River.

A second phase (an additional 2.0 MW) is expected to be completed in 2019, increasing total energy dedicated to digital currency mining to 5.0 MW. Atlas Cloud is fully funded to complete Phase 1 and 2 of the Grant County Data Centre.\nThe capital acquisition represents a $300,000 USD investment.
