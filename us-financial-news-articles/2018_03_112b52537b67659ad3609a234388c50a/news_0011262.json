This, she said, could \"ultimately damage our attractiveness to foreign investment.\"\nPrince Mohammed has defended last November's crackdown, in which dozens of top business leaders and princes were detained, as necessary to combat \"the cancer of corruption\".\nMost detainees have now been released, and the authorities say they have arranged to seize more than $100 billion in assets.\nAUDIENCE WITH THE QUEEN\nThe ambitious young prince, just 32, is sure to repeat his message at talks in Britain with Prime Minister Theresa May and when he meets President Donald Trump during a visit to the United States starting on March 19.\nHe will also have a rare audience with Queen Elizabeth and dinner with Prince Charles, the heir to the throne in Britain, after arriving from Egypt.\nAny visit to the London Stock Exchange -- and later the New York Stock Exchange -- will be watched closely by investors because of the potentially lucrative Aramco listing expected later this year.\nTalks with faith leaders in Britain including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, offer Prince Mohammed an opportunity to project a more tolerant image of Saudi Arabia, sources close to the trip told Reuters.\nUnder the reforms closely associated with the crown prince, social restrictions have been loosened, such as bans on cinemas and women driving. He has promised to promote a more moderate form of Islam.\nBusiness deals are possible with British defence group BAE Systems and European weapons maker MBDA, and initial agreements could be concluded on gas exploration, petrochemicals and industry, according to British and Saudi sources. They gave no details of the potential deals.\nForeign minister Boris Johnson lauded security ties with \"one of Britain's oldest friends in the region\" in a newspaper article last week and praised Prince Mohammed's reforms.\nBut rights groups and opposition lawmakers have criticised London's support for the prince, particularly over the licensing of 4.6 billion pounds ($6.37 billion) worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the start of the Yemen conflict.\nAnti-war and human rights groups plan a protest outside May's Downing Street office on Wednesday.\n\"Theresa May should use this visit to announce the UK will no longer supply arms to Saudi Arabia while the devastating Saudi-led bombing of Yemen continues and make clear Britain's strong opposition to widespread human and civil rights abuses in Saudi Arabia,\" opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said.\nU.S. INVESTMENT TOUR\nPrince Mohammed will hold talks with Trump before going to New York, Boston, Houston and San Francisco for meetings with industry leaders, as he seeks to shore up investments and political support from Riyadh's closest Western ally.\nSeveral dozen Saudi chief executives will join him in touting investment opportunities in the kingdom, particularly in the areas of technology, entertainment and tourism, a Washington source said.\nTalks will also include a U.S. bid to build two nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia and a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement needed for that to proceed, an industry source said.\nRiyadh wants to diversify its energy supply mix, enabling it to export more crude oil rather than burning it to generate electricity. But it has previously refused to sign up to any agreement that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium.\nThe political agenda in Washington will feature a new push to end the dispute between Arab allies of the United States that has isolated Qatar over alleged ties to terrorism, a senior U.S. official has said.\nThe crown prince is also likely to reiterate to Washington and London the view of Saudi Arabia that its regional rival, Iran, should not be trusted over its nuclear programme.\nUnder a deal reached with major powers in 2016, Tehran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting on economic sanctions.
