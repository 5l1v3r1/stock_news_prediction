The new MLF injection exceeded the value of such loans maturing on the same day. A batch of 1-year MLF worth 189.5 billion yuan was set to expire on Friday. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in the same statement that it skipped reverse repos on Friday morning. On Dec. 14, the PBOC raised the interest rates on liquidity tools, including the one-year MLF, to 3.25 percent.
