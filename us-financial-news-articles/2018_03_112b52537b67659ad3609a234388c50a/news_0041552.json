Mike Capuano, D-Mass., whose office has a median salary of $81,491. His office is also the only one where the median salary reaches the $80,000 point.\nMore from USA Today: \nShe was mad about being bumped from her flight to Austin. Then United gave her a $10,000 voucher\nSalon's Ivanka Trump Facebook post sets people's hair on fire\nFrench police kill gunman in supermarket siege that left 2 hostages dead \nRounding out the rest of the top five are:\nRep.

Macy Clay, D-Mo ($73,000) And if you left the top-paying offices to work at one of the lowest-paying ones, you'd take more than a 50% pay cut.\nAt the lowest paying congressional office, Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont, pays a median salary of just $35,925. His is the lowest paying office by almost $3,000.\nThe rest of the bottom five in the low-paying category are:\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. ($38,567) Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind. ($39,000) Rep. David Valadao, R-Calif. ($39,241) Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, R-Ind. ($39,996) If you're looking to make a top salary on Capitol Hill, becoming a chief-of-staff is your best bet. The median salary for that role is $154,634. A district/state chief-of-staff trails behind with $136,443 as its median salary, followed by state directors, information technology directors and chief counsels, all of which have six figure salaries.\nStaff assistants make the lowest median salary at $35,480. Following are district/regional coordinators, fellows, press assistants and research assistants.\nYou also might have a better shot at a high-paying job depending on the state your boss represents. In the House, the highest median salaries (at $66,454) are from Utah's delegation. Utah is closely followed by Idaho and Alaska as the only three state delegations with a median salary of more than $60,000.\nFor the Senate, Rhode Island pays the most, at a $65,735 median salary. Kansas ($65,520) and Mississippi ($64,594) are the next highest-paying.\nLegiStorm notes that while median salaries are useful for analyzing trends, several factors influence the final number, like the composition and size of office staff. For example, some offices might have a high number of low-ranking employees, while other offices have mainly highly-paid, high-ranking employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T22:53:14.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
