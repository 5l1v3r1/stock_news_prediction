But prescription rejections remain high as insurers worry about the cost of long-term treatment for potentially millions of patients.\nThe new Praluent pricing would be tied to an independent review conducted by an organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines and be based on Praluent data unveiled on Saturday, the companies said.\nThat data, presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Florida, showed that for patients who have acute coronary syndrome, meaning a recent heart attack or serious chest pain episode, and are unable to get their “bad” LDL cholesterol below 100 despite taking maximum doses of statins, adding Praluent reduced the risk of death.\nBased on the new risk-reduction data seen in the huge, multi-year study, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said an appropriate Praluent price for the highest risk patients would be $4,500 to $8,000 a year.\nThat is considerably less than the more than $14,000 a year list price and presumably below current net prices with discounts and rebates.\n“We will begin working with payers to ensure that high-risk patients have appropriate access,” Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement.\nReporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:16:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
