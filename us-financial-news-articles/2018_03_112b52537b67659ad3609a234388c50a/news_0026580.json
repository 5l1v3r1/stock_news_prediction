In connection with the offering, the Company expects to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 450,000 shares of common stock.\nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering.\nThe Company expects to enter into a forward sale agreement with Citibank, N.A. (the \"forward purchaser\") with respect to 3,000,000 shares of its common stock (and expects to enter into a forward sale agreement with respect to an aggregate of 3,450,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). In connection with the forward sale agreement, the forward purchaser or its affiliates are expected to borrow and sell to the underwriters an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of the common stock that will be delivered in this offering (or an aggregate of 3,450,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, which right is subject to certain conditions, the Company intends to deliver, upon physical settlement of such forward sale agreement on one or more dates specified by the Company occurring no later than March 1, 2019, an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock (or an aggregate of 3,450,000 shares if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) to the forward purchaser in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price, which will be the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreement.\nThe Company will not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchaser. The Company expects to use the net proceeds, if any, it receives upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreement to fund property acquisitions and development activity, with any remaining proceeds to be held for general working capital and other corporate purposes, including the reduction of the outstanding balance, if any, on the Company's revolving credit facility. Selling common stock through the forward sale agreements enables the Company to set the price of such shares upon pricing the offering (subject to certain adjustments) while delaying the issuance of such shares and the receipt of the net proceeds by the Company until the expected funding requirements described above have occurred.\nCopies of the prospectus supplement relating to this offering, when available, may be obtained by contacting: Citigroup, c/o Broadridge Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717 (Tel: 800-831-9146).\nThis offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement and related prospectus filed by the Company with the Commission (\"SEC\"). A prospectus supplement relating to the offering will be filed with the SEC. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Agree Realty Corporation\nAgree Realty Corporation is primarily engaged in the acquisition and development of properties net leased to industry leading retail tenants.
