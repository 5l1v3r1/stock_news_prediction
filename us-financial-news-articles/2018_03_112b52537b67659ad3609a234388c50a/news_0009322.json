The United States, on the other hand, is at odds with Syria and has increasingly chilly relations with Iran.\nIt was the United States, ironically, that drove Russia and Saudi Arabia together in the first place, with the surprising rise of an oil sector that is now producing record-high volumes, last seen in 1970.\nWith the cut in Saudi production, the United States' still-growing output of 10 million barrels a day is now more than Saudi Arabia's and catching up to No. 1 producer Russia. Even with this surge, the United States is still reliant on about 8 million barrels a day of imports, some of which come from Saudi Arabia.\nshow chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T19:23:20.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
