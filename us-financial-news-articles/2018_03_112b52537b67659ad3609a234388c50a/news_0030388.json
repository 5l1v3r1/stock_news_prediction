The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voided the U.S. Department of Labor’s so-called fiduciary rule on Thursday, nullifying nationwide the 2016 measure that was meant to curb conflicts of interest among providers of financial advice by requiring them to act in their clients’ best interests. “Our core strategy - consistent with our principles - remains that we always will act in our clients’ best interest,” Merrill Lynch Wealth Management head Andy Sieg wrote in a memo sent to the firm’s more than 14,000 brokers. Last June, Merrill Lynch rolled out a limited-purpose brokerage individual retirement account, which paid brokers a commission and was compliant with the fiduciary rule.
