The 30-year yield inched up half a basis point to 0.760 percent .\nThe BOJ on Monday bought 710 billion yen ($6.66 billion) of five- to 40-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-purchasing scheme.\nThe JGB market showed little reaction as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Aso Taro came under renewed fire over suspicions of cronyism involving sale of state-owned land.\nWhile the immediate response was muted, analysts said the scandal could have a negative effect on JGBs if it spells trouble for Aso.\nJapan’s Nikkei was up 1.7 percent following a rally on Wall Street on Friday.
