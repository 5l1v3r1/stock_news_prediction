There’s been a mixed response from other world leaders. The U.K. criticized the conduct of the election amid rising tensions after it blamed a nerve-agent attack on Russia, which denies involvement. While German Chancellor Angela Merkel did offer congratulations, French President Emmanuel Macron pointedly wished success “to Russia and the Russian people” in a phone call with Putin, according to a statement from the Elysee Palace.\nPutin received congratulations from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe and the leaders of most former Soviet republics, according to the Kremlin’s website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T18:26:16.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
