REUTERS/Jason Lee The rules for who heads the party, the military and the state - all positions Xi currently holds - are all the same, the paper added.\n“It is a system designed to accord with the national condition and ensure long-term peace and stability for the party and the country,” it said.\nSlideshow (7 Images) The party has had an unwritten rule that senior officials cannot be promoted once they reach the age of 68, though the party has said that this rule is exactly that - unwritten.\nThere has been heated speculation since the end of a once-every-five-years party congress in October about the fate of a close Xi ally, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, who stepped down from the elite Standing Committee at the congress, having reached the age of 69.\nBut he is expected to be appointed vice president at parliament, with a specific role dealing with the Trump administration.\nThe move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that would set a precedent for Xi, now 64, to stay in power after he reaches what is normally considered retirement age.\nXi will be formally elected to his second term as president at parliament, which opens on Monday. He began his second term as party boss in October.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T05:09:30.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
