It is clear that only big players can achieve adequate profitability.”\nEurobank last year reported a 10 percent increase in lending and a profit before tax of 20 million euros ($24.69 million), Pavlovic said.\n“We expect to maintain that growth in lending this year and in the coming years,” she said, warning that low interest rates and possible changes to legislation as Serbia progresses towards membership of the European Union remain a challenge.\n$1 = 0.8102 euros Reporting by Ivana Sekularac, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:27:09.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
