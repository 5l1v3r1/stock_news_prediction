Collins, Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee was speaking during a hearing with a whistleblower from political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, the firm which got hold of data of millions of Facebook users.\nCollins added: \"These are questions of a fundamental importance and concern to Facebook users, as well as to our inquiry as well. We would certainly urge him to think again if he has any care for people that use his company's services.\" (Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T01:05:08.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
