Grande West's Best-in-Class heavy-duty Vicinity bus is available in 27.5', 30' and 35' models powered by clean diesel or CNG designed with affordability, accessibility and global responsibility in mind.

Grande West is compliant to Buy America certification, and along with ABG, its exclusive US distributor, is actively pursuing opportunities in public and private transit fleet operations that would benefit from Grande West's vehicles.\nFor further information please contact:\nGrande West Transportation\nJohn LaGourgue\nVP Corporate Development\nPh: 1-604-607-4000\njlagourgue@grandewest.com\nwww.grandewest.com\nNeither the TSX-V nor its Regulation Service Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX-V) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking information\" and \"forward-looking statements\" (collectively \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.
