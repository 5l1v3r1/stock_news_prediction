But that decision angered Georgia’s Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who responded by warning Delta: Either reestablish ties with the NRA, or say goodbye to your tax break.\nWell, the state Senate voted 44-10 to approve a tax bill on Thursday that cut income taxes—but also included no tax break for airlines (Delta, based in Atlanta, would have been the prime beneficiary of to the tune of $40 million). Georgia’s House approved a version of the bill last week in a 135-24 vote.\nThe bill is expected to be signed into law early next week.\nI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA . Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.\n— Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) February 26, 2018\nOn Thursday, Lt. Gov. Cagle cheered the vote, saying on Twitter, “We just passed the largest tax cut in Georgia history!”\nWe just passed the largest tax cut in Georgia history! pic.twitter.com/Cv8YoRGwg2\n— Casey Cagle (@CaseyCagle) March 1, 2018\nStill, even as Delta’s relationship with Georgia grows cold, officials from Democrat-leaning states have offered their states as a new home base for Delta. In the days following Cagle’s threat, leaders from Virginia, New York, and Washington state reached out to woo the carrier .\nFortune has contacted Delta for a response.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/Cv8YoRGwg2", "https://twitter.com/Delta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/NRA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/CaseyCagle/status/968199605803454465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20172018/HB/918", "https://twitter.com/CaseyCagle/status/969261364740059136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-03-02T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T14:09:01.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
