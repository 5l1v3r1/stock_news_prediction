FILE PHOTO: Special Counsel Robert Mueller leaves the U.S. Capitol Building after meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo Spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on the Air Force One flight carrying Trump to New Hampshire that Trump’s weekend tweets criticizing Mueller by name do not presage a firing. “The president is not moving to get rid of Robert Mueller,” he said. He said the tweets reflected “some well-established frustration” felt by Trump over the Russian investigation.
