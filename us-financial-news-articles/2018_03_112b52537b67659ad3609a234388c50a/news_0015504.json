Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and non-recurring items rose to 387 million euros ($476 million), said the retailer, which opened 243 stores last year. Sales rose by 28 percent to 3.42 billion euros, said Action, which also operates in the Benelux countries, Austria and most recently, in Poland. Action is owned by Britainâ€™s 3i Group Plc, which in November said it had no immediate plan to sell or seek a stock market listing for the company, rebutting market speculation. Separately, 3i on Friday said it has completed a 2.41 billion euro refinancing of Action and that Action would pay it a dividend of 341 million euros by March 31. Action is based in Zwaagdijk-Oost, 50 km north of Amsterdam. $1 = 0.8130 euros Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T13:28:23.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
