Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank presents an oversized newly unveiled 10 euro note at the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, January 13, 2014. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski “All prerequisites for a sustainable adjustment of inflation to our objective are given,” Mersch said in Frankfurt, referring to the ECB’s inflation target of almost 2 percent. He added that as the inflation outlook improves, the ECB can gradually reduce its bond purchases, but should still maintain loose monetary policies to continue supporting the rise in consumer prices. Mersch, considered a hawk on the rate-setting Governing Council, added that moving too late to curb stimulus risked making the bond purchases ineffective while clawing back support too quick could lead to excessive market reactions that would undo he ECB’s work.
