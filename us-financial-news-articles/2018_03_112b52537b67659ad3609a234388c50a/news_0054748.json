Defaults on loans fell 0.6 percentage points in one year to 2.3 percent, reaching a five-year low at the end of 2017.\nCaixa increased its capital ratio by 4.1 percentage to 17.7 percent. By holding its loan book growth this year, Caixa foresees it will close 2019, when Basel III rules will be fully adopted in Brazil, with a core capital ratio of 10.6 percent, nearly one percentage point above minimum requirements.\nCore capital is a cushion formed by equity or equivalents, a sign of a bank’s health that is required by regulators.\nThe bank will pay to controlling shareholder, Brazil’s Treasury, 25 percent of its net income as dividends. Occhi, however, did not rule out the Treasury will reinvest this money in Caixa as a capital increase.\nThe state-owned lender posted a record net profit of 12.5 billion reais ($3.8 billion) last year, up more than 200 percent over the prior year. Its profit was boosted by a reversal of 5.3 billion reais in provisions previously made to pay for employees’ healthcare.\n$1 = 3.3323 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl and Alexandra Alper; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:00:32.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
