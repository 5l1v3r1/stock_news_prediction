More than 700 companies figure among the affected firms in the capital.\nBeijing achieved the biggest reduction in average pollution among 28 northern cities from October to February, the bulk of a winter heating season that ended on March 15, the newly formed Ministry of Ecology and Environment said last week on Weibo.\nThe Chinese capital’s first orange alert this year ran from Jan. 13 to 15, and the second from March 12 to 14. There have been no red alerts this year.\nReporting by Tom Daly and Lusha Zhang; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T09:33:44.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
