The provision in the bill was stripped out. \nDelta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOn Saturday morning, Delta announced it would end a discount for members of the NRA attending the organization's annual meeting in Dallas in May . The airline, along with United , which also announced it was ending a similar deal, had offered discounts of between 2 percent and 10 percent for meeting attendees.\nI will kill any tax legislation that benefits @ Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @ NRA . Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back. \nA coach-class ticket from Atlanta to Dallas for the dates of the conference, would cost about $180, meaning travelers could save around $5.60 to $18 with those discounts.\nAfter pulling the discounts, Delta said that it supports the 2nd Amendment and that it made it's decision to stay \"neutral\" in a raging debate over gun control. But the move backfired on Delta, a company that has exhibited savvy on political issues in the past.\nOther corporations, including car rental and insurance have cut ties with the NRA. Several retailers said they would raise the age to purchase certain firearms from 18 to 21 .\n.@ Delta , if Georgia politicians disagree with your stand against gun violence, we invite you to move your headquarters to New York. \nGovernors from New York and Virginia seized on the dispute and offered Delta a chance to move its headquarters.\nWATCH: Georgia Republicans mull dropping Delta tax break show chapters Georgia Republicans mull dropping Delta tax break      5:19 PM ET Tue, 27 Feb 2018 | 02:59", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T01:45:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
