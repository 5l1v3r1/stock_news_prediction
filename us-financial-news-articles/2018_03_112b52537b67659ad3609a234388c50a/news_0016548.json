The U.S. already passed top exporter Saudi Arabia late last year.\nFor 2019, the EIA forecast a crude production increase of 570,000 bpd to 11.27 million bpd.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T05:52:14.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
