Trust the justice of Turkey! Trust the Turkish Armed Forces! Come and surrender! A future filled with calm and peace awaits you in Afrin.” Turkey’s military and its rebel allies launched an offensive in the Afrin region nearly two months ago against the Syrian Kurdish YPG, which Ankara considers a terrorist organisation and extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a three-decade insurgency against the state. Turkish forces shelled the town of Afrin heavily overnight and killed at least 18 people, a YPG spokesman said. The YPG fighters were waging battles with Turkish and their allied forces trying to storm the town, the spokesman said. Turkey’s armed forces have been attempting to besiege the town of Afrin in recent days, and a spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that the town would be cleared of fighters “very soon”.
