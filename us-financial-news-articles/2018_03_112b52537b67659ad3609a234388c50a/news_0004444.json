I tried to do my best to get this medal.\n“I had a lot of people cheering for me in the crowd. I bet it must have been very hard to get here so I appreciate it very much.\n“I am so happy because I have done my best and I’m in good form. I knew I could do it, I wanted to do it, and it is amazing.”\nReporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:29:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
