The European Central Bank’s upbeat narrative should be reinforced on Thursday, encouraging speculators already long euros to top up their positions.”\nWall Street had a late rebound on Friday as investors who were initially spooked by the prospect of a global trade war clung to hopes that Trump was just rattling sabres as a negotiating tactic.\nNews over the weekend suggested, however, that Trump was going ahead with his plan, while there was no indication that allies would be excluded from the tariffs planned on imported steel and aluminium.\nCanada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat.\nTrump says the tariffs are needed to protect domestic industries against unfair competition from China and elsewhere.\n“Despite staging a comeback, major U.S. indexes suffered their worst week since early February,” said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut.\n“A number of other fears linger as investors reassess the prospects for continued global growth, brace for the possibility of a broader trade war and await the outcome of a parliamentary election in Italy.”\nIn commodities, Brent crude was up 38 cents at $64.75 a barrel while U.S. light crude edged up 42 cents to $61.67.\nSpot gold was a tad firmer at $1,323.10.\nEditing by Peter Cooney and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T03:17:49.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
