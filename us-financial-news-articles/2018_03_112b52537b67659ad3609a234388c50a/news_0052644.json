The Company's average initial yield on invested capital is approximately 15.8% for these five properties, calculated as the sum of the initial base rents, supplemental rent (with respect to the lease with PharmaCann LLC at one of the Company's New York properties (the \"PharmaCann NY Property\")) and property management fees, after the expiration of the base rent abatement period (with respect to the lease with a subsidiary of The Pharm at the Company's Arizona property), divided by the Company's aggregate investment in these properties (excluding transaction costs and including aggregate potential tenant reimbursements of $5.0 million).\nAcquisition Activity\nOn October 23, 2017, the Company acquired a property in New York for approximately $3.4 million (excluding transaction costs) in a sale-leaseback transaction, comprising approximately 40,000 square feet of industrial and greenhouse space. Upon the closing, the Company entered into a triple-net lease for the entire property with a subsidiary of Vireo to operate a medical-use cannabis cultivation and processing facility. The tenant is responsible for paying all structural repairs, maintenance expenses, insurance and taxes related to the property, and the lease provides that the Company will fund up to $1.0 million as reimbursement for future tenant improvements at the property. The initial annualized base rent for the property is $660,000, or 15% of the sum of the purchase price and the tenant improvement allowance made available for the property, and subject to annual increases at a rate of 3.5%. The Company also receives a property management fee under the lease equal to 1.5% of the then-current base rent throughout the term. The initial lease term is 15 years, with two options to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods.\nOn November 8, 2017, the Company acquired a property in Minnesota for approximately $3.0 million (excluding transaction costs), comprising approximately 20,000 square feet of industrial and greenhouse space.

The tenant is responsible for paying all structural repairs, maintenance expenses, insurance and taxes related to the property, and the lease provides that the Company will fund up to $1.0 million as reimbursement for future tenant improvements at the property. The initial annual base rent for the property is $600,000, or 15% of the sum of the purchase price and the tenant improvement allowance made available for the property, and subject to annual increases at a rate of 3.5%. The Company also receives a property management fee under the lease equal to 1.5% of the then-current base rent throughout the term. The initial lease term is 15 years, with two options to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company acquired a property in Arizona for approximately $15.0 million (excluding transaction costs) in a sale-leaseback transaction, comprising approximately 358,000 square feet of industrial and greenhouse space. Upon the closing, the Company entered into a triple-net lease for the entire property with a subsidiary of The Pharm for continued use as a medical cannabis cultivation and processing facility. The tenant is responsible for paying all structural repairs, maintenance expenses, insurance and taxes related to the property, and the lease provides that the Company will fund up to $3.0 million as reimbursement for future tenant improvements at the property. The initial annualized base rent under the lease is $2,520,000, payable monthly, which is equal to 14% of the sum of the purchase price for the property ($15.0 million) and the tenant improvement allowance ($3.0 million), and subject to annual increases of 3.25% during the lease term. The base rent on $5.0 million of the purchase price ($58,333.33 per month) will be abated until March 31, 2018, and the base rent attributable to the tenant improvement allowance ($35,000.00 per month) was abated until March 14, 2018. The Company also receives a property management fee under the lease equal to 1.5% of the then-current base rent throughout the term. The initial lease term is 15 years, with two options to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods.\nPipeline\nSubsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company executed agreements to purchase two properties for a total investment of $10.5 million. In addition, the Company executed two non-binding letters of intent for two properties representing a total expected additional investment by the Company of approximately $25 million to $30 million, with the final investment determined based on the Company's review and approval of future tenant improvements at each property.\nAs of March 28, 2018, the Company had identified and was in various stages of reviewing approximately $100 million of additional potential properties for acquisition, which amount is estimated based on sellers' asking prices for the properties, ongoing negotiations with sellers, the Company's assessment of the values of such properties after taking into account the current and expected lease revenue, operating history, age and condition of the property, and other relevant factors. The transactions for which the Company has executed agreements are subject to the Company's continuing diligence and customary closing conditions, and the Company cannot provide assurances that it will complete the purchase of these properties or the other properties in the Company's pipeline on the terms described herein, or at all.\nFinancing Activity\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 600,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price to the public of $25.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $14.0 million, after deducting the underwriters' discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

(\"NAREIT\"). NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT's operating performance equal to \"net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate properties, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\"\nManagement believes that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement. However, management believes FFO and FFO per share to be important supplemental measures of a REIT's performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the Company's properties without giving effect to certain significant non-cash items, primarily depreciation expense. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions. The Company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, FFO and FFO per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods. The Company reports FFO and FFO per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs and because FFO per share is consistently reported, discussed, and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about REITs. For these reasons, management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss FFO and FFO per share.\nManagement believes that AFFO and AFFO per share are also appropriate supplemental measures of a REIT's operating performance. The Company calculates AFFO by adding to FFO certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, consisting of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and severance expense.\nThe Company's computation of FFO and AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO and AFFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such REITs. Further, FFO and AFFO do not represent cash flow available for management's discretionary use. FFO and AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including the Company's ability to pay dividends or make distributions. FFO and AFFO should be considered only as supplements to net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP as measures of the Company's operations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328006164/en/\nInnovative Industrial Properties, Inc.\nCatherine Hastings\nChief Financial Officer\n(858) 997-3332\nSource: Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innovativeindustrialproperties.com&esheet=51780502&newsitemid=20180328006164&lan=en-US&anchor=www.innovativeindustrialproperties.com&index=1&md5=d22d9d4435e76d771659400d398b51d7", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.innovativeindustrialproperties.com&esheet=51780502&newsitemid=20180328006164&lan=en-US&anchor=www.innovativeindustrialproperties.com&index=2&md5=ba378442fe319c7f3e916e47ae86cdd3", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328006164/en/"], "published": "2018-03-29T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:50:54.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
