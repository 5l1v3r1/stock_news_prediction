Morgan, which is providing $5.6 billion in committed financing for the deal, was Microchip's financial adviser, and Qatalyst Partners advised Microsemi.\nMicrochip on Thursday also narrowed its net sales forecast for the fourth quarter ending March to a range of flat to down 2 percent, from up 1 percent to down 3 percent.\nThe company said it now expects adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be at between $1.32 and $1.37, compared with $1.30 to $1.39 per share previously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T13:41:56.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
