Sidney Crosby earned an assist on the goal.\nPittsburgh doubled its lead late in the first period as Oleksiak, the former Dallas defenseman, burned his old team with a slap shot that beat Lehtonen high on the glove side with just four seconds left in the frame. Phil Kessel and Riley Sheahan got assists.\nAlexander Radulov brought Dallas back to within a goal at the 12:03 mark of the second period. Radulov collected a cross-ice pass from Jason Spezza and buried a shot from a sharp angle behind Pittsburgh netminder Casey DeSmith while on a two-man advantage. Tyler Seguin garnered the other assist on the score.\nMalkin added an empty-netter with 44 seconds to play as the Stars pressed for the tying goal and added a sixth attacker in lieu of Lehtonen. Crosby passed the puck to Malkin before the length-of-the-ice shot and was granted his second assist of the match.\nDallas is 5-6-2 in its past 13 games following a five-game winning streak.\nThe Stars continue on with their six-game road trip, the second of which will be on Tuesday in Montreal. Pittsburgh also plays on the road for its next three matches, beginning Wednesday against the Rangers in New York.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T13:06:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
