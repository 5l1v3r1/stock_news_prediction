Words such as \"may,\" \"likely,\" \"anticipate,\" \"expect\" and \"believe\" indicate forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements may reflect management's present expectations and estimates regarding future expenses, revenue and profitability, trends affecting our financial condition and results of operations, operating efficiencies, revenue opportunities, potential new markets, and the ability of the Company to effectively compete in a highly competitive market. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that management's expectations and estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable and data management believes to be reliable, the Company's actual results, performance, or achievements are subject to future risks and uncertainties, any of which could materially affect the Company's actual performance. Risks and uncertainties that could affect such performance include, but are not limited to: the adequacy of funds for future operations; future expenses, revenue and profitability; trends affecting financial condition and results of operations; ability to convert proposals into customer orders; the ability of customers to pay for products and services; the impact of changing customer requirements upon revenue recognition; customer cancellations; the availability and terms of additional capital; ability to develop new products; dependence on key suppliers, manufacturers and strategic partners; industry trends and the competitive environment; the impact of the Company's financial condition upon customer and prospective customer relationships; and the impact of losing one or more senior executives or failing to attract additional key personnel. These and other risk factors are discussed in Company reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGiven these uncertainties, and the fact that forward-looking statements represent management's estimates and assumption as of the date of this press release, you should not attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements contained in this press release, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/creative-realities-inc-schedules-earnings-call-for-year-ended-december-31-2017-300618384.html\nSOURCE Creative Realities, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/creative-realities-inc-schedules-earnings-call-for-year-ended-december-31-2017-300618384.html", "http://bit.ly/criearnings2017"], "published": "2018-03-22T21:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T00:53:16.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
