We will produce pigs as usual. And Chinese people will eat meat as usual,” Liu said at a company briefing ahead of China’s annual parliament meeting which kicks off on Monday.\nEarlier in the briefing, he signaled Chinese buyers would likely find alternative supplies to the United States.\n“The market is huge. There are other countries other than the United States,” he said.\nHe didn’t comment any further, but farmers, traders and analysts have said that Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of agricultural goods including soybeans, beef and sugar, could benefit if the spat escalates.\nThe South American country has already grabbed a bigger share of the lucrative Chinese market over the past year from the United States, helped by competitive prices as well as the high protein content of its beans.\nChina is the globe’s largest soy importer and last year bought 95.5 million tonnes of the oilseeds, more than half from the South American nation.\nNew Hope has the capacity to produce 25 million tonnes of feed a year.\nReporting by Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T21:11:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
