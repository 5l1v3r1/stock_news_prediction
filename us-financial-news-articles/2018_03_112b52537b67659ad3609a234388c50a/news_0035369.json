It was not immediately clear when a final ruling would be issued.\nCareem, a Dubai-based competitor to Uber, said it had not yet received any official request to stop operations in Egypt, and continued to operate as normal.\nUber intends to appeal any court decision to suspend ride sharing licences in Egypt, a source familiar with the matter said. Uber had not been officially informed of the ruling, the source said.\nUber said last year it was committed to Egypt despite challenges presented by sweeping economic reforms and record inflation. Uber in October announced $20 million of investment in its new support centre in Cairo.\nThe San Francisco-based company has had to make deals with local car dealerships to provide its drivers with affordable vehicles and adjust its ride prices to ensure its workers were not hit too hard by inflation.\nUber had two million users in Egypt in 2016, giving jobs to 60,000 drivers, it said.\nEgypt is one of Uber's fastest-growing markets, its general manager in the country, Abdellatif Waked, has said, according to state news agency MENA.\nEgypt's investment ministry said last year a draft law regulating web-based transport services would provide a legal framework for companies like Uber, but did not say when that bill was likely to be passed.\nUber has faced regulatory and legal setbacks around the world amid opposition from traditional taxi services. It has been forced to quit several countries, such as Denmark and Hungary.\nLast year, London deemed Uber unfit to run a taxi service and stripped it of its licence to operate. Uber is appealing against the decision.
