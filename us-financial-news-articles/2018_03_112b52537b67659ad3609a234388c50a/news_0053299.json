SpaceX founder Elon Musk pauses at a press conference following the first launch of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., February 6, 2018. REUTERS/Joe Skipper - HP1EE2701YWP0 \nTesla agreed to buy solar panel installer SolarCity for $2.6 billion (£1.9 billion) in an all-stock deal in 2016. \nMusk was the biggest shareholder in both Tesla and SolarCity at that time, and his SolarCity shares were converted to $500 million of Tesla shares. \nIt is \"conceivable that Musk, as a controlling stockholder, controlled the Tesla board\" during the SolarCity deal, the judge commented here . \nThe lawsuit alleged that the board breached its duties to shareholders in approving the SolarCity deal.
