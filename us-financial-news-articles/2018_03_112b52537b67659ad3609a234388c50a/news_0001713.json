Such factors include the varied nature of each Funds’ investments and the performance of those investments, and that the ultimate characterization of each Funds’ distributions cannot finally be determined until the end of each Funds’ fiscal year, resulting in the possibility of a return of capital if any Fund makes total distributions in an amount that exceeds its net investment income and net realized capital gains during its fiscal year. Additional information as applicable regarding the composition of the distributions will be made available at us.allianzgi.com/closedendfunds.com after the payable date. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, no assurance can be given as to the actual composition or character of each Funds’ distributions at the time of this press release and neither the Funds, Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC (“AllianzGI U.S.”), NFJ Investment Group LLC, nor any of their trustees, members, officers or employees assumes responsibility for such statements.\nThis notice should not be used to prepare tax returns. In January 2019, Form 1099 DIV (or substitute Form 1099 DIV) will be sent to shareholders and will state the aggregate amount and tax characterizations of distributions for the 2018 calendar year.\nIt is anticipated that the Funds’ next quarterly distributions will be declared on or about June 1, 2018 and be payable on or about June 22, 2018.\nAllianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Asset Management of America L.P., serves as the Funds’ investment manager and is a member of Munich-based Allianz Group.\nThe Funds’ daily New York Stock Exchange closing market prices and net asset values per share as well as other information, including portfolio statistics and performance is available at us.allianzgi.com/closedendfunds.com or by calling the Funds’ shareholder servicing agent at 800-254-5197.\nStatements made in this release that look forward in time involve risks and uncertainties and are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
