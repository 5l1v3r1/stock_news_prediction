You would only not do this if you had something to hide.. SO not faith being built...\" @jimcramer: Another day, no outside counsel hired by $FB to investigate. You would only not do this if you had something to hide.. SO not faith being built...\" \nLater on \" Squawk on the Street ,\" Cramer said Facebook should \"bring in some 'adult' ... and have him or her investigate everything.\" \nCramer first suggested last week that the social network should hire what he called an \"internal special prosecutor\" to get to the bottom of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse. \nOn Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it's investigating the company's data practices. \nAdditionally, Facebook said it would send a top executive to appear in front of U.K. lawmakers, but not CEO Mark Zuckerberg . \nChristopher Wylie, the whistleblower in the scandal, told U.K. lawmakers on Tuesday that the election of Donald Trump prompted him speak out about the practices being employed by Cambridge Analytica, the political firm that worked on the Trump presidential campaign. \nCramer, host of \" Mad Money ,\" had previously called out Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg for being notably silent for days after reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the data from more than 50 million users of the social network without their permission. The data were used to target ads promoting Trump's 2016 candidacy, according to The New York Times and The Observer. Cambridge Analytica has denied the allegations. \nZuckerberg and Sandberg went on an apology tour late last week. \nShares of Facebook have declined about 13.5 percent from the close on Friday, March 16, to the close on Monday, March 26. \nFacebook did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Cramer's remarks.
