The new cities announced on Tuesday bring the number of metropolitan areas in the free delivery program to six.\nBesides Amazon’s Prime Now delivery service, the company also operates a separate Amazon Fresh online grocery delivery service. Customers using that service must pay a $14.95 monthly subscription fee.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nIn February, Yahoo News reported that Amazon was planning to merge Amazon Fresh with Amazon Prime Now.", "external_links": ["https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-amazon-cut-hundred-jobs-144111501.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T02:21:16.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
