Devlin will step down as chairman of pub operator Marston’s and as the senior independent director of the Football Association on May 1 and start as Persimmon chairman on June 1. He is also chairman designate of bookmaker William Hill . In December Persimmon’s then chairman Nicholas Wrigley and the chairman of the company’s remuneration committee Jonathan Davie quit, recognising their mistake in not putting a cap on the incentive plan. That scheme has since been reined in but originally could have seen the firm’s top management, including Chief Executive Jeff Fairburn, make a profit of more than 200 million pounds ($280 million) on share options. $1 = 0.7150 pounds Reporting by James Davey; editing by Costas Pitas", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T10:30:04.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
