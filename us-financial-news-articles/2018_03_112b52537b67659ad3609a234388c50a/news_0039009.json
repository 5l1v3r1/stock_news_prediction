But Moir said there appears to be little he could have done to intervene before the crash.\n“The driver said it was like a flash, the person walked out in front of them,” Moir said. “His first alert to the collision was the sound of the collision.”\nAccording to the Chronicle , the preliminary investigation found the Uber car was driving at 38 mph in a 35 mph zone and did not attempt to brake. Herzberg is said to have abruptly walked from a center median into a lane with traffic. Police believe she may have been homeless.\nTempe police plan to work with investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to reach a conclusion about what happened, according to the Chronicle .\nSunday’s incident appears to be the first-ever self-driving car fatality involving a pedestrian.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T22:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T02:46:30.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
