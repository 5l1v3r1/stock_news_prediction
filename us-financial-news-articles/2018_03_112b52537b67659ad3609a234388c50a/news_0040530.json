We continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the Yelchin family for their tragic loss.\"\nMessages left with Yelchin family attorney Gary Dordick seeking comment were not immediately returned.\nYelchin's final role was in indie film \"Thoroughbreds\" that was released this month.\nThe lawsuit also accused Fiat Chrysler of negligence, product liability and breach of warranty.\nDordick said when he filed the lawsuit that Fiat Chrysler had mailed a recall letter to Yelchin that was received seven days after his death.\nFinal recall notices were sent during that time, but interim notices had been mailed at least 17 days before Yelchin's accident, Fiat Chrysler said.\nAt the time of Yelchin's death, the roll away problem had been tied to at least 68 injuries, 266 crashes and 308 reports of property damage.\nDrivers complained they would exit vehicles with the engine running falsely believing the vehicle was in park.\nFiat Chrysler furnished a software upgrade to the affected 2014-2015 model year Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle as well as 2012-2014 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans.
