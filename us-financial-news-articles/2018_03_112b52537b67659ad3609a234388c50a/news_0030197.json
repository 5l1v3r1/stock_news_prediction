Robert Pittenger’s “ How China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer ” (op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical. \nLegislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations. \nBut Mr. Pittenger’s bill—the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act—goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies. \nThe new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.\nMore concerning is that Mr. Pittenger’s bill would do all of this unilaterally—without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.\nIn making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn’t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China’s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue. \nInstead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges. \nCongress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State—which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies—have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn’t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011. \nAs recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided. \nRep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job. \nChristopher Padilla \nIBM \nWashington \nMr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce responsible for export controls from 2006-2007. \n\nRep. Pittenger’s piece is premised on inaccurate claims about GE that undermine his arguments to reform government oversight of foreign acquisitions. We are a 125-year-old American company that has worked closely with the U.S. government and military for decades. Rep. Pettinger’s insinuation that GE would compromise our national security to do business in China is offensive and untrue. While we, like many global companies, have joint ventures in China, all of them are consistent with U.S. law, and in many instances were established in close consultation with the U.S. government. \nRep. Pittenger never contacted GE to fact-check his allegations. In truth, GE supports Cfius reform, including strengthening the federal resources devoted to reviews of inbound investments and focusing the review on sectors of highest priority. What we don’t support is the expansion of Cfius’s jurisdiction to outbound U.S. investments into joint ventures around the world (not just in China). Doing so would set back both U.S. national security and economic interests, creating a new bureaucracy that is completely redundant with the existing U.S. export control system. It would generate thousands of additional cases for an already underresourced Cfius system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad.\nUnfounded attacks like those made by Rep. Pittenger are unhelpful to the complex challenge the U.S. faces in safeguarding sensitive U.S. technology while enabling companies to compete in global markets. We will continue to work with the many lawmakers who are constructively wrestling with this important issue. \nKaran Bhatia \nPresident of Government Affairs and Policy \nGE \nWashington", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T13:39:41.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
