Tanfield, 21, forced his way into the national squad despite operating outside the heavily funded and hugely successful British Cycling set up after some startling performances in the national championships last year and has had to defer his university education to chase the unexpected opportunity. In his first taste of the big time he played his part in a crushing victory over Denmark in Thursday’s final in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn, as veteran Ed Clancy kept the British quartet on pace after the Danes went out hard to earn an early advantage before being reeled in. “We just keep on going and the results keep coming, I can’t believe it really,” said Tanfield, whose fellow amateur team mate Dan Bigham is also in Britain’s squad in the Netherlands this week. Triple Olympic pursuit champion Clancy said he was loving competing alongside the new generation as world champion debutants Kian Emadi and Ethan Hayter completed a new-look team. “I’m happy to still be here,” he said. “I’m 33 in a few weeks and riding with these young guys, I love it more and more every year. ”We didn’t win a single worlds between London and Rio so we really pushed hard for this, every single one of us. “I’ve still got massive passion and to be stood here as world champion with these young guys, who are massive talents, is great. I think there is an epic future for them on road and track. “Kian is a really exciting talent, Charlie is just a massive engine, a massive talent who has come from completely outside the system while Ethan I think is the next Bradley Wiggins to be honest. He really is that good. He’s probably the strongest man on our team today and he is 19 years old.” Britain’s women, fellow Olympic champions, were unable to make it a pursuit double as, despite the presence of experienced duo Katie Archibald and the returning Laura Kenny, they were well beaten in the final by the United States, who made it three world titles in a row. There was a big surprise in the men’s scratch race as Yauheni Karaliok of Belarus snatched gold after stealing a lap alongside Michele Scartezzini of Italy and Australia’s Callum Scotson and kept his nose in front over the final laps. There was another upset in the keirin as Colombia’s Fabian Hernando Puerta Zapata took gold after coming from nowhere to blast through the favourites.
