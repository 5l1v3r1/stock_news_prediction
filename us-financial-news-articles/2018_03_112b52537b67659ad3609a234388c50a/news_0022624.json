Kingdom Holding has $12.5 billion invested across more than a dozen sectors around the world, according to its website.\nAlwaleed's personal investment portfolio is also under government control, according to the Journal. Alwaleed holds substantial stakes in companies like Citigroup , Twitter , Lyft and Time Warner . The Journal report does not indicate whether the government has exercised its newfound influence over these investments.\nHowever, sources tell the Journal the government has already intervened in a major real estate project, ordering senior managers at Kingdom Holding to abandon the Jeddah Tower, which would be the world's tallest skyscraper when — and if — it is completed.\nOfficials have directed Kingdom Holding to instead focus its energy on a new city called Neom, which is expected to cost $500 billion to build.\nThe project was announced in October by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the influential king in waiting who is overseeing the kingdom's economic transformation and spearheaded the campaign that led to Alwaleed's detention.\nAlwaleed was among dozens of influential Saudis swept up and detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh in a campaign meant to crack down on graft, according to the government. On Sunday, The New York Times published an investigation alleging the detainees faced coercion and physical abuse .\nAlwaleed was once listed as the kingdom's wealthiest man, wielding a net worth of $18.7 billion, but Forbes removed the prince and other wealthy Saudis from its annual Billionaire's List because their finances are uncertain following settlements with the Saudi government.\nLong seen as a broker for investors seeking to put money to work in the kingdom, Alwaleed is now stepping back from that role, according to the Journal.\nThe Saudi government did not respond to the Journal's requests for comment. Kingdom Holding could not immediately be reached by CNBC for comment.\nRead the full story at The Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T18:14:49.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
