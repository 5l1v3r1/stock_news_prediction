(s.nikkei.com/2ox44eb)\nThe Japanese automaker had earlier vowed to reinvent itself by improving oversight of its final inspections after it revealed in October that uncertified staff had carried out tests of new cars for the domestic market for decades. The revelation described final inspections of new vehicles that occurred at the company’s main Gunma complex in north of Tokyo in violation of transport ministry norms and eventually led to the recall of 395,000 vehicles.\nIn December, shares fell to their lowest since July 2016 after the company said it was also investigating whether mileage readings may have been falsified during final checks.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T01:49:45.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
