Microchip’s offer of $68.78 per share in cash for Microsemi represents an about 7 percent premium to its closing price on Thursday. Reuters, citing a source, reported earlier this week that Microchip was in talks to buy Aliso Viejo, California-based Microsemi. Microchip said on Thursday the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, would immediately add to its adjusted earnings per share. The Arizona-based chipmaker expects an estimated $300 million in savings in the third year after the deal close. J.P. Morgan, which is providing $5.6 billion in committed financing for the deal, was Microchip’s financial adviser, and Qatalyst Partners advised Microsemi.
