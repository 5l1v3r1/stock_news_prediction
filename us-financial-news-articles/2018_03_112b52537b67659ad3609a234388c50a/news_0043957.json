I think they sold something they shouldn’t have sold.”\nWhile the sale proceeds from the leasing business will be used to reduce debt, the bulk will be paid out as special dividends, potentially limiting the upside in a stock that has more than quadrupled since hitting a seven-year low in late 2015.\n“The amount of money generated from this exercise could almost wipe out AirAsia’s entire debts, so it would appear a positive move,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of consultancy Endau Analytics, but he noted it faces risks associated with higher leasing rates.\nLeasing had accounted for around 20 percent of AirAsia’s revenue, with a similar share earned from non-ticket items like baggage fees and food sales.\nThe aim is to lift revenue from so-called ancillaries by 12 percent this year.\nAirAsia plans to launch remittance and lending products in Southeast Asia, through its BigPay debit card and mobile app in Singapore after the recent launch in Malaysia, BigPay’s group CEO Chris Davison said.\nBut for now, the company’s non-flying revenue lags global low-cost leaders like Spirit Airlines in the United States and Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings in Europe that receive 40 percent of revenue from ancillaries, said Jay Sorensen, president of U.S.-based consultancy IdeaWorksCompany.\nHe said AirAsia’s food, in-flight Wi-Fi and loyalty programmes were good offerings but its approach in pricing add-ons was not maximising revenue because it only offered two bundled choices rather than three.\n“The best practice today is to present three choices at the same time, based upon a good, better and best model.”\nGOING DIGITAL The digital push is front and centre as Fernandes restructures AirAsia into a listed group that oversees stakes in multiple airlines in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, India, Japan and soon Vietnam and China and digital ventures rather than having the listing based on its Malaysian airline.\nCombined, AirAsia forecasts the digital businesses will account for 7.6 percent of revenue this year, nearly half of its ancillary sales.\nFormer CEO Aireen Omar, who became deputy group CEO in January, is overseeing the non-airline businesses in a single entity that will ultimately seek a U.S. listing.\nCorrine Png, CEO of research firm Crucial Perspective said AirAsia could triple its share price if it can successfully collect and monetize its Big Data.\n“AirAsia’s current valuations are low as investors see it as a cyclical airline,” she said. “However, as its long-term revenue and earnings growth prospects improve, equity investors will start to value AirAsia like a growth stock.” (Reporting by Anshuman Daga and Jamie Freed; Additional reporting by Jennifer Hughes in HONG KONG and Liz Lee in KUALA LUMPUR Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:19:12.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
