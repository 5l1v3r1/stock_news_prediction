(“GSV Capital” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:GSVC) today announced the pricing of $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”).

The sale of the Notes is expected to close on March 28, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will be convertible into shares of GSV Capital’s common stock (the “common stock”) based on an initial conversion rate of 93.2836 shares of the common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $10.72 per share. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 28, 2023, the Notes will be convertible at any time.\nThe Notes will mature on March 28, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2018. The Notes will be general, unsecured, senior obligations of GSV Capital.
