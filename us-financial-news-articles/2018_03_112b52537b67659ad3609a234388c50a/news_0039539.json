His diverse corporate leadership experience will add significant value to our oversight as we transition to a clinical-stage company and advance our differentiated development programs in immunometabolism,” said Mark Manfredi, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Kyn Therapeutics. “We also welcome the insights of Dr. Quintana, whose expertise in key areas relating to our programs will inform both our preclinical activities and clinical strategy.”\nMr. Renaud currently serves as the chief executive officer of Translate Bio. Formerly, he served as president and chief executive officer at Idenix Pharmaceuticals until its acquisition by Merck in August 2014. Prior to that, Mr. Renaud served in several key roles at Idenix including chief financial officer and chief business officer. Before joining Idenix, he served as senior vice president and chief financial officer of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, following a career as a biotechnology equity research analyst at several major investment firms. Mr. Renaud also serves on the board of directors for Chimerix Inc., Axial BioTherapeutics and Akebia Therapeutics.\n“Immunometabolism is a fascinating new frontier of immuno-oncology, and Kyn has assembled a pipeline that approaches compelling pathways from unique angles,” said Mr. Renaud. “There is a major need for therapeutics that improve the clinical outcomes of cancer immunotherapies, so I am pleased to join a team that has connected novel science with patient need so clearly.”\nDr. Quintana is a highly-awarded immunologist and has published over 140 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters. He is the recipient of multiple awards including the Lady Anne Chain Prize for Academic Excellence and Scientific Achievements, the Award for Outstanding Research Achievement from Nature Biotechnology, and the Mentor Award from Harvard Medical School.
