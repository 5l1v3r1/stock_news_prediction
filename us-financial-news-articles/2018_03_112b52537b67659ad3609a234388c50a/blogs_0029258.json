The Boston Beer Company \nThe brew, called Samuel Adams Utopias, is aged in barrels that once held bourbon, which are emptied and re-filled with beer. The ingredients include multiple malts, three varieties of German hops, and a yeast that is typically used for creating champagne. \nThe beer's flavor is \"reminiscent of a rich vintage Port, old Cognac, or fine Sherry with notes of dark fruit, subtle sweetness and a deep rich malty smoothness,\" according to Samuel Adams. The Boston Beer Company \n\"One of the things I wanted to do is bring to beer the same dignity and respect and nobility that's been accorded to wine,\" Koch says. \nThe beer is then put into bottles that are replicas of the company's giant brewing kettle. The Boston Beer Company \n\"You don't pound it like a regular beer, you just sip it,\" Koch adds. \nIn 2017, only 68 casks were produced, creating 13,000 bottles available for purchase. \nThere's just one catch: the brew is illegal in 15 states in the U.S., including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia, according to the Sam Adams site. \nKoch says it's illegal \"because of the high alcohol [content and] the unique brewing process,\" which he calls the \"lunatic fringe of brewing.\" \n\"As a brewer I'm okay with that,\" Koch tells \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich. \"To me, there's only one thing better than great, wonderful beer — it's great wonderful beer that's illegal.\" \nWatch new episodes of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" Wednesdays at 10P/ET. \nDon't miss:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T16:16:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
