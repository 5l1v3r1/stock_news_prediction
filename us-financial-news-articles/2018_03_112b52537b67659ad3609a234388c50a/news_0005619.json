They will have a chance to improve their resume on Saturday when they travel to No. 1 Virginia. An upset of the Cavaliers followed by a deep run in the ACC tournament would get the Irish at least back in the NCAA Tournament discussion.\nWith the loss, the Panthers (8-23, 0-18 ACC) become the second ACC team to go winless in conference play in the last 30 years. Boston College went 0-18 in ACC games during the 2015-16 season.\nMatt Farrell and T.J. Gibbs each finished with 14 points to lead the Irish.\nNotre Dame used a 16-0 run to take control in the first half. Gibbs had three 3-pointers during the spurt, which gave the Irish a 30-13 lead with six minutes left in the half.\nThe Fighting Irish went into the locker room with a 39-23 lead. Pittsburgh never mounted a serious comeback threat in the second half.\nJared Wilson-Frame came off the bench to lead Pittsburgh with 20 points. Terrell Brown and Shamiel Stevenson each added 10 points for the Panthers, who shot 33.3 percent from the field and were outrebounded 51-35 by the Irish.\nMartinas Geben, one of five Irish seniors celebrated on Wednesday, had nine points and pulled down 12 rebounds for Notre Dame.\nThe Irish started the season 11-3, but have been ravaged by injuries, including to their two top players, Colson and Farrell. Both appear to be healthy now, but it could be too late.\nThe ACC tournament tips off Tuesday at Barclays Center in New York.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T10:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:08:56.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
