REUTERS/Ernest Scheyder/File Photo Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down 35 cents at $70.10 a barrel by 1:05 p.m. EDT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 lost 47 cents to $65.41.\nLast week, Brent gained 6.4 percent and WTI rose 5.7 percent, the strongest weekly gains since July.\n“I don’t see anything extraordinarily bearish in the market today. I think some folks here are just ... happy to take profits,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.\nAlthough crude and product futures slipped on Monday, most share prices for energy companies, especially refiners, were up, Yawger said. The S&P Energy Index .SPNY was up 0.7 percent.\nGlobal stocks came off six-week lows on reports that the United States and China were set to begin trade talks, easing fears about a trade war. Analysts had been concerned that a trade war could hurt oil demand.\nU.S. President Donald Trump last week signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of imports from China.\n“The (oil) market is pulling back after pushing strongly high last week.
