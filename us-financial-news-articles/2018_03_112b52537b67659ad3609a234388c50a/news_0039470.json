Germany's 10-year Bund yield rose to 0.60 percent , up 2 basis points on the day, after the sale.\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Fanny Potkin; Editing by Catherine Evans and Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T19:32:09.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
