(“Callidus”) (NASDAQ: CALD ) common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of Callidus by SAP America, Inc. and its affiliate (“SAP”) announced on January 29, 2018 (the “Complaint”). The Complaint, which alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Callidus, its Board of Directors (the “Board”), and SAP, is captioned Franchi v. Callidus Software Inc., Case No. 3:18-cv-01443 (N.D. Cal.).\nIf you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff’s counsel, Seth D. Rigrodsky or Gina M.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, shareholders of Callidus will receive $36.00 in cash for each share of Callidus they own (the “Proposed Transaction”).\nAmong other things, the Complaint alleges that, in an attempt to secure shareholder support for the Proposed Transaction, defendants issued materially incomplete disclosures in a Definitive Proxy Statement (the “Proxy Statement”) filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
