It barely held up as the Seminoles (23-12) stormed back with an 8-1 burst, slicing the deficit to 55-52 on a 3-pointer by PJ Savoy with 1:16 remaining.\nFlorida State made it a 56-54 game when Phil Cofer, its leading scorer with 16 points, tipped in a missed shot with 22.0 seconds left. But Robinson sank two free throws with 20.9 seconds remaining, then grabbed the rebound of a missed 3-pointer and dribbled out the clock.\nThe Wolverines will meet South Region champion Loyola (Ill.) on March 31 in the Final Four in San Antonio. It’s Michigan’s first Final Four appearance since 2013.\nSavoy finished with 12 points for the Seminoles, who made just 32 percent of their field-goal attempts.\nThe teams that raced up and down the floor in lopsided regional semifinal wins Thursday night bore no resemblance to the ones that set the tone for a rockfight by grinding through a first half in which neither led by more than six points.\nMuhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman drained a 3-pointer to give Michigan a 10-4 edge just over three minutes into the game, but Florida State’s length and quickness began bothering the Wolverines at that point.\nHolding Michigan to four points in just under 6 1/2 minutes, the Seminoles grabbed a 17-15 edge when Braian Angola swished two free throws following a Flagrant 1 foul on Robinson at the 10:32 mark. But the Wolverines didn’t allow a point over the final 4:40 of the half, and Wagner’s two foul shots with a minute left gave them a 27-26 edge at intermission.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:21:32.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
