We are engaged in the research, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of OTC consumer healthcare products, dietary supplements and other remedies in the United States. This includes the development and marketing of dietary supplements under the TK Supplements ® brand, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nIn August 2017, we formed a new, additional wholly-owned subsidiary, ProPhase Digital Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PDM”). Our objective is for PDM to become an independent full-service direct marketing agency. PDM’s first initiative will be to market the TK Supplements ® product line. If successful, this may lead to the marketing of other company’s consumer products.\nIn addition, the Company also continues to actively pursue acquisition opportunities for other companies, technologies and products inside and outside the consumer products industry.\nInvestor Contact\nTed Karkus, Chairman and CEO\nProPhase Labs, Inc.\n(267) 880-1111\nSource:ProPhase Labs, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d2x7diUEeZxfYth3EVe-J35DplaArY5QKbyY4VqCxh_d96fvpF1-ogdsDSK4VBtPL8Fntn293ShBa80LvHkq_a270-6bH11GjV_zBBkk_6w=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nPxM1iBRRP2DTVwvrVV6VG5SHSVfZbR2-U19Avv3j7nfMRaXH9-6-uhmX3RmPHflH5UVLahdEIa1kpDtGNxb2Ht4KrbvhEqZkBr_bqEx_a9tymcdbG1EQTDVsigqWdm02-8QzEk0b3jygjfStoCFBoRUP3xwbFYwZDfj7Gfc7sOaRRDzcrO87D1m8-VSvs7y", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b0111bf5-4be5-4734-be7d-962d1a984641", "https://engage.vevent.com/rt/prophaselabsinc_ao~6285328"], "published": "2018-03-16T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T21:02:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
