These actions will protect good-paying jobs in Ohio and across the country.”\nTrump said on Thursday he planned tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum products, with a formal announcement to come next week.\nDemocratic Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey urged the president to move quickly.“Let’s get it done,” he said.\nBut not all Democrats agreed.“We need a thoughtful and aggressive response to China’s overproduction of steel and aluminum, but blanket tariffs are not the answer,” Colorado Senator Michael Bennet said in a statement, adding that Trump’s action“will invite retaliation and isolate us further from our trading partners.” (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Frances Kerry)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:40:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
