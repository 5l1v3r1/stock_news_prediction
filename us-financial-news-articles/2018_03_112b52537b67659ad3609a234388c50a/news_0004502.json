INAP previously announced the acquisition on January 29, 2018.\nThe transaction was funded with an incremental term loan and cash from the balance sheet.

The innovative platform will strengthen INAP’s current capabilities in managed hosting and services and expand the addressable market for SingleHop’s services across INAP’s global data center footprint.\nPeter D. Aquino, President and CEO of INAP, stated, “We are pleased with the speed of this strategic deal from signing to close enabling us to provide our combined customers the full suite of INAP and SingleHop services and capabilities.
