This was an impressive performance from Bob Dudley and his great team, now fully into their stride,” BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in a statement.\nDudley, 61, took the helm of BP in 2010, months after a deadly spill on the Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico. BP has since paid more than $65 billion in clean-up costs, fines and lawsuits, some of which are still ongoing.\nAfter selling oil and gas fields, refineries and other assets since the spill, 2017 marked one of the strongest years of growth in BP’s history after it launched 7 new projects.\nIt plans to start six additional fields this year, which will help it boost its production by 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 2021. BP’s production rose 12 percent in 2017 to 2.47 million boed.\nBP’s current pay policy, which applies until 2019, includes lowering Dudley’s maximum long-term payout to five times salary from seven times and cutting bonus payments by a quarter.
