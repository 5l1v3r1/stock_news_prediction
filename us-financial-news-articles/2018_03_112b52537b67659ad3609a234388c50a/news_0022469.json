REUTERS/Andrew Kelly A new version of its MarketPsych Indices, which it runs in conjunction with MarketPsych Data LLC, a behavioral economics research firm, will scan over 400 websites, many specific to cryptocurrencies, to capture market-moving sentiment and themes, Thomson Reuters said in a statement.\nDigging through market chatter and analyzing online sentiment has long proven popular among traders of traditional asset classes.\nThe boom in the prices of cryptocurrencies in recent years has spurred a huge online industry where individuals exchange trading ideas in forums and news websites report on the latest developments in the industry.\nMany analysts have linked online activity, for example Google searches for “bitcoin”, with the price of the best-known cryptocurrency.\n“News and social media are driving the investment and risk management process more than ever with the continuing rise of passive and quant-driven trading,” said Austin Burkett, Global Head of Quant and Feeds, Thomson Reuters.\nBitcoin’s price gained more than 1,300 percent last year as investors piled in, and since peaking at close to $20,000 in December has lost more than half its value.
