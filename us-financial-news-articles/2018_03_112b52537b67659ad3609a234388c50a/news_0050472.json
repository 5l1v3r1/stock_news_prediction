REUTERS/Brendan McDermid NEX, formerly known as ICAP, said on Wednesday that CME Group had made a takeover proposal of 10 pounds per share, a premium of around 3 percent to the stock’s closing price. \nTalks with CME - one of the world’s biggest exchange groups that owns the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - are at an advanced stage, NEX Group added in a statement after the market close. \nNEX, a financial technology company that matches buyers and sellers of bonds, swaps and currencies, said there was no certainty an offer would be made. \nNEX shares closed 9.8 percent higher at 972 pence. \nThe stock has risen more than 40 percent over the last two years as market volatility triggered by political surprises - such as the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, fuelled trading on its platforms. \nAttempts at blockbuster exchange mergers, such as between the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Deutsche Boerse, have hit antitrust buffers in recent years, and buying NEX could be easier for regulators and politicians to accept. \nCME Group closed two operations in London last year after they ran up losses of more than $100 million, saying its customers preferred using its U.S. operations. \n($1 = 0.7089 pounds) \nReporting by Justin George Varghese and Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:16:41.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
