Sakellaris, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ameresco. “Our earnings growth accelerated in 2017, and we anticipate more acceleration in the year ahead. Business is strong because we have a focused, effective strategy in place, and we are executing well against it.”\nSakellaris continued, “Increased investment in the efficiency project pipeline resulted in outstanding backlog growth, giving us great visibility. Growth is supported by our success in penetrating new regions across the US, and from initial success in the UK. Finally, we are strengthening our business model through the continued expansion of our energy asset portfolio. This high margin, recurring revenue is becoming a significant contributor to profit, and is set to grow meaningfully in 2018 and beyond.”\nFinancial Results\n(All financial result comparisons made are against the prior year period unless otherwise noted.)\nFourth Quarter 2017\nRevenues were $211.1 million, compared to $174.2 million.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $21.1 million, compared to $14.4 million.\nFourth quarter net income includes a benefit of $14 million or $0.30 per diluted share related to the impact of the re-measurement of the Company's deferred income tax balances because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.

assets 30,000 31,000 Stock-based compensation 1,000 2,000 Adjusted EBITDA $ 75,000 $ 85,000 Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures defined and discussed below to provide investors and others with useful supplemental information to our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please see Other Non-GAAP Disclosure and Non-GAAP Financial Guidance in the tables above.\nWe understand that, although measures similar to these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, they have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage investors to review our GAAP financial statements included above, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, loss related to a significant non-core project in Canada and charges related to a significant customer bankruptcy. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: adjusted EBITDA and similar non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon financing and accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the methods by which assets were acquired; securities analysts often use adjusted EBITDA and similar non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies; and by comparing our adjusted EBITDA in different historical periods, investors can evaluate our operating results without the additional variations of depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and loss related to a significant non-core project in Canada. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.\nOur management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as measures of operating performance, because they do not include the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of the business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning our financial performance.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we changed our calculation and presentation of adjusted EBITDA to exclude restructuring charges and losses related to a significant non-core project in Canada and during the third quarter of 2016, we changed our calculation and presentation of adjusted EBITDA in order to exclude charges related to a significant customer bankruptcy. We do not consider these items indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the prior periods have been recalculated to be presented on a comparable basis.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and EPS\nWe define non-GAAP net income and earnings per share (\"EPS\") to exclude certain discrete items that management does not consider representative of our ongoing operations, including restructuring charges, loss related to a significant non-core project in Canada, impact from redeemable non-controlling interest and charges related to a significant customer bankruptcy. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business because they eliminate the effects of events that are not part of the Company's core operations.\nAdjusted Cash From Operations\nWe define adjusted cash from operations as cash flows from operating activities plus proceeds from Federal ESPC projects. Cash received in payment of Federal ESPC projects is treated as a financing cash flow under GAAP due to the unusual financing structure for these projects. These cash flows, however, correspond to the revenue generated by these projects. Thus we believe that adjusting operating cash flow to include the cash generated by our Federal ESPC projects provides investors with a useful measure for evaluating the cash generating ability of our core operating business.
