REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure Sarkissian, 64, a former prime minister who once served as the country’s ambassador to Britain, was elected to serve a seven-year term.\nNinety lawmakers voted to elect him, ten opposed his election, and one abstained.\nSarkissian succeeds Serzh Sarksyan, who opposition leaders say could now become prime minister.\nArmenia, a South Caucasus country of around three million people, is in line with some other former Soviet republics and countries in eastern Europe in moving away from direct democracy, according to analysts.\nOutgoing Sarksyan became president in 2008 and nominated former prime minister Sarkissian to succeed him in January.\nArmen Sarkissian, who was chosen by Armenia's parliament as the country's new president, attends a parliamentary session in Yerevan, Armenia March 2, 2018. Photolure/Vahram Baghdasaryan via REUTERS Under the terms of a constitution approved in 2015 in a referendum that effectively abolished direct presidential elections, parliament can elect a president with a three-quarters majority.\nThe presidency is now meant to become largely ceremonial under the amended constitution and power to shift to the prime minister and parliament.\nArmen Sarkissian, who was chosen by Armenia's parliament as the country's new president, attends a parliamentary session in Yerevan, Armenia March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure Opposition leaders accuse Sarksyan of planning to move into the post of prime minister to continue ruling Armenia.\nSarksyan denies having any such intention.\nBut many members of the ruling party say Sarksyan would be the best candidate for prime minister given his experience, especially in negotiations over neighboring Azerbaijan’s breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.\nClashes over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies inside Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenians, have intensified in the past three years and there was a flare-up in violence there in April 2016.\nArmenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991, but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling the economy.\nWriting by Margarita Antidze; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:40:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
