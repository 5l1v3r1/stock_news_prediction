This policy action has sweeping implications across several markets.\nThe tariff proposal has been met by widespread opposition from U.S. trade partners and congressional Republicans who fear such a policy could sour relations around the world.\nThe administration's new move on trade could not have come at a more inopportune time, and could result in several unintended consequences. A rupture in trade relations between the U.S. and trade partners across the globe could open the way for retaliatory action and stifle long-term investment plans.\nThe global economy is in woeful need of fresh capital investment, and generally companies invest only in a climate of free an open markets. Therefore, any conflict in the trade arena could scuttle long-term investment plans and dampen growth.\nAlthough the Trump administration on Wednesday hinted that Mexico and Canada could be exempt from the tariffs, the move did not eliminate the prospect of a trade war with the rest of the world, including our allies in Europe.\nEquities have already felt some of the heat as investors fear that the proposed tariffs could have a dampening impact on the U.S. economy just as markets were looking for explosive growth from the new tax law.\nYet another inadvertent consequence of a tariff could be rising inflation, but of the bad sort — from consumer costs rather than in hourly wages — which may force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy even as growth begins to slow.\nSo far the markets are relatively sanguine, treating the whole tariff issue as a tempest in a teapot.\nStill, given the shift in the macroeconomic landscape in recent sessions, investors should be on high alert for any material weakness in equities because the sell-off could be long-lasting, especially if the rest of the world decides to respond in kind.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
