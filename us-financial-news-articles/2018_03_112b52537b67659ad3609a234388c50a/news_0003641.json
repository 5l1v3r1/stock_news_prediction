KG (LEAP) joint venture for lithium-ion technology.\nBosch also plans to sell U.S. start-up Seeo Inc. which it bought in 2015 to enhance its expertise in next-generation lithium-ion batteries and already has potential buyers, said Bulander, declining to elaborate.\nSeparately, Bosch said it did not expect a decline in registrations of diesel-engine cars to accelerate after Germany’s top administrative court on Tuesday removed uncertainty over the legality of diesel bans in cities.\n“The market is looking for secure framework conditions, then it will decide in favour of diesel vehicles,” Bulander said, noting current diesel models complied with emissions limits.\n$1 = 0.8202 euros Reporting by Andreas Cremer Writing by Maria Sheahan Editing by Arno Schuetze and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:28:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
