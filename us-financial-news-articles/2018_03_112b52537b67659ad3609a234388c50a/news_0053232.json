REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader \nMohammad Barkindo was commenting on news that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia were working on a long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for up to 20 years. \nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the plan in an interview with Reuters on Monday. \nRussia, the world’s biggest oil producer, has worked with the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in previous oil gluts to rein in supplies and push up prices, but a 10 to 20-year deal between the two would be unprecedented.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger \nA deal to extend the pact, which has boosted prices to around $70 now, was agreed in November. The output cuts are now due to run until the end of 2018. \n“In addition to the 24 countries that came to sign the declaration of cooperation in November, we have six more producing countries who came to show solidarity,” he said. \nSeveral oil exporters have suggested a six-month extension to the supply pact, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi told the conference, without identifying the countries. \nRegarding Iraq’s own resources, the minister said OPEC’s second-largest producer might have oil reserves twice as big as indicated by current estimates of about 150 billion barrels. \nHe said the crude market was stabilizing and prices had “improved”, adding that a decision on whether to extend cuts beyond 2018 depended on meetings to be held by the exporters by the end of this year. \nBarkindo said OPEC was evaluating the impact of the supply pact to determine the “appropriate action” when it expired. \nIn addition, he said investment in the oil industry was increasing as oil prices recovered but had not yet reached the level before the downturn in 2014.
