With 33 self-performing in-house tower service groups, Tower One’s services subsidiary has the knowledge, equipment and resources to facilitate every aspect of tower construction including 5G, small cell tower and Internet of Things (IOT) deployment, Fiber and Cell site construction and 5G network roll-out across the continental USA.\nJohn Logiudice states: “I am excited to join the Tower One team at this pivotal time in the telecom industry with the upcoming and widespread implementation of the new 5G wireless networks across the United States. Tower One is well positioned to construct and deploy all aspects of the 5G networks, tapping into hundreds of billions of dollars in new economic activity with currently over 400,000,000 cellular subscribers in the US alone. The implementation of 5G will also bring transformative new IOT and Artificial Intelligence capabilities as well as empowering Big Data Analytics and Cloud based SAAS to American consumers and businesses.”\nIn addition to strengthening its tower services subsidiary, Tower One recently completed site acquisitions on 80 new tower sites in Argentina. The Company currently has under construction 15 towers in Argentina and has received multiple co-location applications in Colombia, hosting multiple carrier clients on a single wireless tower. Tower One’s current portfolio now consists of over 40 wireless towers in Colombia and Argentina and over 300 secured search rings for future tower construction bringing the Company’s total tower pipeline to over 350 towers.\nAlejandro Ochoa, CEO of Tower One states: “Tower One has not only strengthened its Tower Services division by recently acquiring ProCell with over $17 million in 2017 revenue but also its management team with the addition of Mr. Logiudice to oversee its tower services spin-out. This spin-out will provide Tower One shareholders with additional equity exposure in the growing telecom services sector, while allowing Tower One’s management team to focus on its core business of providing cell towers to mobile network operators in Latin America. This business has seen strong growth, in Colombia and Argentina, along with new opportunities in Mexico.”\nAbout Tower One Wireless Corp.\nTower One builds, owns, and leases its portfolio of wireless infrastructure assets to wireless carriers on long term contracts.
