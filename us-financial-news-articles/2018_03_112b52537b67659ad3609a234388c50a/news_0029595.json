(the “Company” or “BVT”) (TSXV:BEE) announces the appointment, on a contractual basis, of Dr. Gerardo Suazo, Ph.D., M.B.A. to the position of Senior Technical Manager.\nMexico is a market where about $250M of chemical fungicides are being used today, and where growers are already actively modifying their production practices to meet standards demanding higher levels of food safety and quality with less chemical inputs. Offering a motivated and highly-scalable market, it will be the next, after the United States, that BVT will target in which to develop its technology. Dr. Suazo will be responsible for overseeing and managing trials in Mexico and will play a key role in driving the BVT technology adoption within the country.\nDr. Suazo brings 15 years of industry relevant experience in the US and Mexico to the Company. His work experience spans research, product and project management and includes 8 years working with Syngenta. He holds a Ph.D. in Horticulture from Cornell University, an M.B.A. in Marketing and Entrepreneurship from the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, an M.S. in International Horticulture from Essex University in the UK, and a B.S. in Horticultural Engineering from Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos in Mexico. Dr. Suazo is based in Queretaro, Mexico and will be responsible for developing the BVT system for the Mexican market, and in assisting with the commercialization efforts in the US.\n“The BVT system is highly innovative, and the discussions I had with growers in Mexico before taking the role have confirmed that there is a very good opportunity for this technology across many crops in Mexico,” said Dr. Suazo. “I am very excited to be part of the team now and feel that my experience and connections will help accelerate development of the business in Mexico and the US.”\nAshish Malik, CEO of BVT added, “Gerardo is very strong technically, but what we are most excited about is that he is very hands-on and has a very good business sense that relates very well to growers. He has a record of accomplishment of commercializing innovative tools for growers and being bi-lingual makes him a perfect fit to help build our business in both Mexico and the US.”\nMexico is experiencing a production increase of several crops for export and domestic consumption (i.e. avocados, berries, vegetables). BVT has the potential to address the vegetable and fresh fruit production markets (for example, 22,500 acres of strawberries, 8,000 acres of blueberries and over 300,000 acres of tomatoes & peppers).\nAbout Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc.\nBVT has developed and owns patent-pending bee vectoring technology that is designed to harmlessly utilize bumblebees and honeybees as natural delivery mechanisms for a variety of powdered mixtures comprised of organic compounds that inhibit or control common crop diseases, while at the same time enhancing crop vigor and productivity. This unique and proprietary process enables a targeted delivery of crop controls using the simple process of bee pollination to replace traditional crop spraying, resulting in better yields, superior quality, and less impact on the environment without the use of water or disruptions to labour.\nAdditional information can be viewed at the Company’s website www.beevt.com\nOn Behalf of Bee Vectoring Technologies International Inc.,\n“Ashish Malik”\nPresident & CEO\nFor further information, please contact:\nAshish Malik, President & CEO\nmarketing@beevt.com\nBabak Pedram, Investor Relations\nVirtus Advisory Group\nTel: 416-995-8651\nbpedram@virtusadvisory.com\nFor media enquiries or interviews, please contact:\nJosh Stanbury | josh@sjspr.co.uk | T. 416-628-7441\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCertain statements contained in this press release constitute \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation.
