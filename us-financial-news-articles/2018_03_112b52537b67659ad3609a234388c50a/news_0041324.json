The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) increased rates on reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, used for open market operations by five basis points (bps), it said in a statement on its website. The seven-day reverse repo rate was raised to 2.55 percent from 2.50 percent. Earlier in the day, the PBOC injected 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) via seven-day reverse repos, according to the same statement. Many market watchers had expected the PBOC to follow a Fed quarter-point hike with a more modest 5-10 bps increase, but they said such a move would be largely a symbolic one after China’s leaders told parliament this month that would they press ahead with a crackdown on risks to the financial system this year. China did not change its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates. Those have remained unchanged since October 2015, with the central bank preferring to guide borrowing costs via liquidity operations and interbank market rates.
