(Nasdaq:NEOS), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative extended-release (XR) products using its proprietary modified-release drug delivery technologies, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided a business update.\n“We’ve launched three ADHD products in the last two years and are very pleased with our product portfolio, which we believe reflects both the strength of our unique technology platform as well as our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize products,” said Vipin K. Garg, Ph.D., President and CEO of Neos Therapeutics. “Our second product, Cotempla XR-ODT™, is new to the market but already seeing strong adoption. We believe this is, in part, the result of our established relationships with nearly 11,000 healthcare professionals, their awareness of our XR-ODT technology and their interest in using our innovative products. With three synergistic Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD) products on the market, we expect to see continued commercial growth and a significant improvement in gross profit.”\nNeos’ three commercial products are Adzenys XR-ODT ® , Cotempla XR-ODT ™ and Adzenys ER ™ which launched in May 2016, October 2017 and February 2018, respectively .\nCommercial Product Highlights as Reported by IQVIA (formerly called IMS Health)\nCumulative total EUTRx* (4Q17) Cumulative total EUTRx (4Q16) Year-over-year increase Cumulative total EUTRx since launch\n(as of 3.2.18) Patients switching from another medication\n(as of 2.23.18) Adzenys XR-ODT ® 62,737 20,330 208.6% 260,767 71% Cotempla XR-ODT ™ 12,073 N/A N/A 37,168 79% TOTAL 74,810 20,330 268.0% 297,935 N/A *EUTRx = Equivalent Unit TRx\nAdditional Commercial Product Highlights as Reported by IQVIA\nContinued Strong Growth in Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT Prescription Trends: The cumulative total number of EUTRx for Adzenys XR-ODT were 62,737 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 23.7% over the 50,697 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. For Cotempla XR-ODT, the cumulative total number of EUTRx for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were 12,073, compared to 648 EUTRx for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Market Share of Neos’ XR-ODT Products is Increasing: The combined total weekly prescriptions for Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT continued to grow and had increased to 9,031 weekly EUTRx for the week ended March 2, 2018. This represents an aggregate market share of 0.54% of the entire ADHD market. The Number of Prescribers of Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT Continues to Grow : As of December 31, 2017, 10,870 health care providers had written prescriptions for Adzenys XR-ODT since its launch, and 1,949 health care providers had written prescriptions for Cotempla XR-ODT since its launch. As of the week ended February 16, 2018, those numbers had increased to 11,619 and 3,480, respectively. Patient Switching from Another ADHD Medication Continues to be an Important Driver of Product Uptake : Doctors are switching patients over from other ADHD medications to both Adzenys XR-ODT (71% switching) and Cotempla XR-ODT (79% switching).\nRecent Announcements\nIn January 2018, the Company announced that study findings for two of its ADHD medications, Cotempla XR-ODT and Adzenys ER, were presented in three posters at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders. The results showed efficacy, safety and tolerability of Cotempla XR-ODT in children 6-12 years of age in a laboratory classroom study, and demonstrated bioequivalence of Adzenys ER with Adderall XR. On February 26, 2018, the Company announced the U.S. commercial launch of Adzenys ER (amphetamine) Extended-Release Oral Suspension, its third ADHD product. This product received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 15, 2017 for the treatment of ADHD in patients six years and older. This extended-release liquid medication does not require refrigeration or reconstitution at the pharmacy level. Adzenys ER oral suspension utilizes the same proprietary modified-release drug delivery technology as Adzenys XR-ODT.\nSelect Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal product revenues were $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2016, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, total product revenues were $25.0 million, compared with $9.2 million for the same period in 2016. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, total product revenues associated with dispensed patient prescriptions for the Company’s ADHD products were $7.2 million.\nNet product sales (in $millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Change % FY 2017 FY 2016 Change % Adzenys XR-ODT $6.3 $2.2 186.4% $19.0 $3.0 533.3% Cotempla XR-ODT $0.9 N/A N/A $0.9 N/A N/A Generic Tussionex $0.6 $1.3 -53.8% $5.1 $6.2 -17.7% Total $7.8 $3.5 122.9% $25.0 $9.2 171.7% The Company reported a gross profit of $5.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a gross loss of $0.5 million for the same period in 2016, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit was $12.6 million as compared to a gross loss of $2.3 million for the same period of 2016.

The decrease in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a decline in testing, materials and supply expenses due to the approval of the Company’s ADHD product candidates in 2017 coupled with a non-recurring FDA fee associated with the filing of the New Drug Application for Adzenys ER in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses were $11.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.7 million for the same period in 2016, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, selling and marketing expenses were $46.9 million compared to $49.3 million for the same period in 2016. The fourth quarter increase was principally due to higher medical marketing costs as well as increased transaction fees associated with the higher level of prescriptions processed for the Company’s products. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $3.0 million compared to $3.0 million for the same period in 2016, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expenses were $13.8 million compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2016.
