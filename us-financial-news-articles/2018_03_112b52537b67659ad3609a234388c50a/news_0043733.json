(\"New Legacy\"), a newly-created Delaware corporation (the \"Transaction\").\nKey Elements of the Transaction\nEach unit representing a limited partner interest (NASDAQ: LGCY) will be converted into the right to receive 1.0 share of New Legacy's common stock (\"Common Stock\"); Each 8% Series A and Series B Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Unit (the \"Preferred Units,\" NASDAQ: LGCYP and LGCYO, respectively) will be converted into the right to receive 1.9620 and 1.72236 shares (pursuant to Legacy's partnership agreement) of Common Stock, respectively, with any rights to accumulated and unpaid distributions being discharged and the Preferred Units being cancelled; All incentive distribution units will be automatically cancelled and will cease to exist; New Legacy will purchase the General Partner for $3 million in cash; and The general partner interest of Legacy will remain outstanding, indirectly owned by New Legacy.\nMr. Paul T. Horne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Legacy's general partner, commented, \"As a result of the Transaction, Legacy will become a newly-traded C-Corp stock with a less complicated balance sheet and an enhanced opportunity to raise capital and grow the business. We took our first steps towards this transition over two years ago and, after considerable time, effort and evaluation, we are thrilled to make this announcement and look forward to continuing our great operations under a new, simplified corporate structure. We have established a platform for the creation of significant value for the company and we look forward to stepping out from the dark cloud we have been under as an upstream MLP.\"\nConditions to Closing\nCompletion of the associated merger is subject to customary conditions including the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast by unitholders at a special meeting of the unitholders and the customary closing conditions of the associated purchase agreement having been satisfied or waived. Under the terms of Legacy's partnership agreement, holders of the Preferred Units are not entitled to vote on the merger. The Board of Directors of the General Partner (the \"GP Board\") has unanimously approved the terms of, and has recommended that the unitholders approve, the merger. The GP Board approved New Legacy's purchase of the General Partner with the special approval of the Conflicts Committee of the GP Board. The Merger is intended to be tax-free to unitholders subject to potential recapture for some unitholders as a result of the change in tax status from a partnership to a C-Corporation.\nOther Capital Structure Items\nLegacy's existing revolving credit facility, second lien term loan, and senior unsecured notes will remain in place with Legacy remaining as the borrower. Legacy has entered into separate agreements to amend the revolving credit facility and the second lien term loan to, among other things, permit the Transaction, allow for the incurrence and payment of tax and overhead expenses at New Legacy and further restrict Legacy's ability to make distributions. As part of the Spring redetermination, Legacy's borrowing base was reaffirmed at $575 million. Legacy intends to commence a consent solicitation to amend the provisions of the indentures of its senior unsecured notes to, among other things, amend the definition of Change of Control to exclude the Transaction and reflect the new corporate structure. Legacy owns over 50% of the outstanding principal amount of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (\"2021 Notes\") and intends to vote in favor of the proposed amendment. In addition, holders of over 50% of the outstanding principal amount of Legacy's 8% Senior Notes due 2020 (\"2020 Notes\") have agreed to vote in favor of the proposed amendment. Legacy is not offering or paying any consent fees to any holders of 2020 Notes or 2021 Notes for such consents.\nAdvisors\nKirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal counsel to Legacy. Evercore Partners acted as independent financial advisor and Richards, Layton & Finger, PA acted as independent legal counsel to the Conflicts Committee of the GP Board.\nConference Call\nLegacy will host a conference call to discuss the Transaction later today at 3:30 p.m. (Central Time).
