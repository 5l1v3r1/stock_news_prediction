Insurgents say the de-escalation zones free up Syria’s army to make territorial gains elsewhere.\nHundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 11 million made homeless in Syria’s multi-sided civil war. The government has made huge territorial gains since Russia joined the fighting on the side of Assad in 2015.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T14:57:01.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
