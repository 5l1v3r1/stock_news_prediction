Sales for the year were up from $11,144,462 in 2016 to $13,434,460 in 2017, an increase of 21%.\nKen Globus, President of United-Guardian, stated, “We had a significant increase in both sales and earnings in 2017, which was the result of both a 40% increase in sales of our cosmetic ingredients and an 18% increase in sales of our most important pharmaceutical product, Renacidin ® Irrigation. The increase in sales of our cosmetic ingredients was due primarily to renewed sales of one of our Lubrajel ® products in China, and the increase in Renacidin sales was mainly the result of this being the first full fiscal year of sales of our new single-dose form of that product. We have retained a web consultant to assist us in expanding our marketing efforts for Renacidin via our new Renacidin web site ( www.renacidin.com ). With some of our new “natural” cosmetic ingredients being actively promoted globally right now, as well as additional “natural” products in varying stages of development, we are optimistic that we will be able to further expand sales of both our cosmetic ingredients and Renacidin as the year progresses.”\nUnited-Guardian is a manufacturer of cosmetic ingredients, personal and health care products, pharmaceuticals, and specialty industrial products.\nContact: Robert S.
