The state’s spread over top-rated municipal bonds widened since it last issued similar debt a year ago.\nThat means that the state, which has budget problems and high debt levels despite being one of the wealthiest in the country, had to pay more to borrow in part because of its credit woes.\nReporting by Hilary Russ; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:28:42.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
