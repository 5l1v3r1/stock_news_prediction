As the Vice President of Physician Practice Services, Dr. Powell was responsible for physician practices services, the employed physician network, overall quality, medical staff affairs, and recruiting, overseeing 14,000 employees and 4,000 clinicians, spanning 1,100 sites in 21 states.\nPreviously, he served in a variety of positions at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, serving his last seven years there as Assistant Chief Medical Officer overseeing Vanderbilt Health Williamson, a multi-specialty physician network system of care.\nRector said that he expects Dr. Powell to be a valuable and visible member of Corizon’s leadership team involved in all aspects of the company from physician recruitment and effective onboarding to driving strategic standardization and adoption.\n“I have seen Pete in action and I know he can forge Corizon into a clinically integrated healthcare system,” Rector said. “He puts the patient first and has the mentoring and communications skills necessary to marshal all the moving pieces to ensure appropriate, evidence-based healthcare is provided to the patient in the most effective manner possible.”\nAbout Corizon Health\nCorizon Health is the leading provider of correctional healthcare services in the United States, providing quality healthcare services to states and municipalities across the country.
