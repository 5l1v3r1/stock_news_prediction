The decision by the ILO’s Governing Body is rare and follows the cancellation of a high-level ILO mission in January because the government did not confirm ILO officials could meet the people they wanted to. The complaint was brought by the leading business group Fedecamaras, long at odds with the government of Nicolas Maduro, saying it was subjected to pressure and intimidation and that there was no dialogue with the authorities. “They set up a commission of inquiry ... it was adopted by consensus,” ILO spokesman Hans von Rohland told Reuters. The Governing Body is composed of 28 governments, 14 employers’ representatives and 14 workers’ representatives. The last such ILO probe was launched into Zimbabwe in 2008 and there have only been 12 in the past 60 years, including on Myanmar regarding forced labor under the military junta, von Rohland said. It was not clear what cooperation the inquiry would get from the Caracas government grappling with a crisis-hit economy and hyper-inflation ahead of presidential elections set for May 20.
