She looked in complete control from her first jump, which propelled her straight to the front with 6.89.\nBy contrast, the 31-year-old Reese always looked slightly short of the mark and admitted she did not perform at her best.“I beat myself today,” she said.“It is what it is.”\nSlideshow (4 Images) Even when Reese did briefly hit the front with her fourth jump, Spanovic countered by immediately regaining the lead with what proved to be the winning jump.\n“I still cannot believe it even though I was preparing myself for it,” said Spanovic.“Last time I lost the world title in the final attempts so I just wanted to stay focused and waited until the very end.\n“I have tried to win this title so many times and finally I managed to produce gold. Brittney Reese is a huge personality, she is a special athlete.\n“We had the same goal and it was a tough battle. But I am happy she is here. She is pushing me forward and I like competing against her. Today, all the girls jumped well.”\nReporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-04T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T21:17:50.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
