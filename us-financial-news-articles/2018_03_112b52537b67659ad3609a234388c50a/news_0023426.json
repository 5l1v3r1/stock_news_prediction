It also mostly shut down expectations by some that early 2019 rate hikes were on the cards.”\nSpain’s 10-year bond yield, up 1.5 bps at 1.42 percent , was set to end the week down around 12 bps — its biggest weekly fall since July last year.\nPortuguese bond yields pulled back from Thursday’s six-week low around 1.79 percent, but were set for their biggest weekly fall since November, of around 12 bps.\nThe gap between 10-year Italian and German bond yields was at 134 basis points, and close to levels hit on Thursday that marked the tightest in two weeks.\n“The ECB wants to see evidence, data, before acting further, which suggests a gradual exit from here,” Luigi Speranza, head of economics at BNP Paribas said on a call with reporters.\nAnalysts said reports that Italy’s centre-right alliance was reaching out to lawmakers from the Democratic Party to seek support for a broad governing alliance after Sunday’s inconclusive election was also supporting Italian debt.\nThe leader of Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Friday his party was preparing economic policy proposals for other parties as a way of finding common ground to form a government.\nNews that U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in what would be the first face-to-face encounter between the two countries’ leaders helped ease fears about geopolitical tensions, denting safe-haven bonds.\nGermany’s 10-year bond yield rose 1 bps to 0.64 percent DE10YT-RR. The gap between five and 30-year bond yields was wider at 125 bps, having hit its tightest since November 2016 on Thursday at around 121 bps.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Fanny Potkin Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T19:57:35.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
