Low-carbon activities now account for 91 percent of its portfolio from 75 percent three years ago.\nASSET SALES Kocher said Engie had now completed 13.2 billion euros worth of asset sales as part of a 15 billion plan and that the sales process had been launched for the remainder.\nAs for reinvestment of the proceeds, Engie has invested in or committed to a total of 14.3 billion euros in new activities.\nEngie CFO Judith Hartmann told Reuters that about 2.5 billion of this amount had been spent on acquisitions of new businesses such as French solar firm Solairedirect and Dubai air-conditioning firm Tabreed. The rest was mainly invested in existing activities to boost organic growth.\nAsked about Engie’s interest in buying into German peer Innogy, Kocher said Engie is not considering any major acquisitions and is focusing on organic growth, although she did not rule out smaller acquisitions.\nShe also reiterated Engie is happy with its current 32.6 percent stake in waste and water firm Suez.\nEngie’s 2017 revenue rose 0.3 percent to 65 billion euros ($80.6 billion). Engie’s revenue had risen high as 97 billion euros in 2012, but it has since shrunk due to debt-reduction and restructuring plans.\nCore earnings fell 1.8 percent to 9.3 billion euros and the firm swung into a net profit of 1.4 billion euros, reversing a 400 million euro loss.\nFor 2018, Engie aims for 2.45-2.65 billion euros net recurring income and core earnings of 9.3 to 9.7 billion.
