Both the person operated on and the blood clot patient are in good condition, it said.\nThe hospital’s spokesman did not answer requests for comment.\n“These are quality system issues that should not be leveled at staff,” Oluga said, adding punishing doctors and nurses would not address problems in the patient tracking system.\nA shortage of medical staff and inadequate theater space made errors more likely, Oluga said.\n“Doctors are overwhelmed. You find one doctor could be doing 10 to 19 operations [in a day],” he said.\nGovernment-employed doctors say they are poorly paid and work without adequate equipment. Last year the government granted them a pay rise promised in 2013 after a three-month strike.\nReporting By George Obulutsa; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T13:03:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
