Kim has met U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other officials to raise concerns over the so-called Section 232 probe and consider a plan that would minimise the damage to South Koran companies.\nShares of South Korean steelmaker Posco fell more than 3 percent on Friday to a four-week low.\nTrump is expected to formally announce the tariffs measure next week.
