(Nasdaq: WBA) pursuant to the previously disclosed Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2017 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). As of March 2, 2018, Rite Aid has transferred 1,651 stores and related assets to WBA, and has received cash proceeds of $3.6 billion, which the Company continues to use to reduce debt. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, WBA will purchase a total of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for an all-cash purchase price of $4.4 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis. Rite Aid expects to complete the store transfer process in the spring of 2018.\nThe majority of the closing conditions have been satisfied, and the subsequent transfers of Rite Aid stores and related assets remain subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the stores being transferred at such subsequent closing, as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Additional details regarding today’s announcement have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K.\nRite Aid is one of the nation's leading drugstore chains with fiscal 2017 annual revenues of $32.8 billion.
