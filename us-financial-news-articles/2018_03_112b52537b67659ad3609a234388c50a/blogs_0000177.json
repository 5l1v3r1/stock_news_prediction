Canada, the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, said it would retaliate if hit by U.S. tariffs.\nThe IMF did not elaborate on the economic damages. It is currently in the midst of updating its global economic forecasts ahead of April meetings of its 189 member countries.\n\"We are concerned that the measures proposed by the U.S. will, de facto, expand the circumstances where countries use the national-security rationale to justify broad-based import restrictions,\" IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in the statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T21:56:55.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
