They see people coming but not leaving.”\nNiger’s interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAbout 40,000 refugees and asylum seekers registered by UNHCR are in Libya, the main crossing point from Africa to Europe.\nIt is hard to resettle refugees directly from Libya partly because most countries closed their embassies in Tripoli after fighting escalated there in 2014.\nMany are trapped in smuggling networks or detention centers where they are exposed to a range of abuses including rape and torture that have been widely documented by rights groups.\nNiger agreed to host the refugees temporarily so that they could be brought to safety. Most of those flown to Niger are Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Somalian, UNHCR said.\nMore than a quarter are unaccompanied children, for whom host countries have pledged insufficient places, it added.\nAlmost 2,300 places have been offered for refugees coming from Niger but the speed of the resettlement process is “out of UNHCR’s control”, Sakhr said.\nFrance and Switzerland have sent delegations to interview refugees in Niamey, and some have been approved for resettlement but are awaiting security checks, she said.\nAs the operation stalls, people continue to suffer under horrendous conditions, said Richard Skretteberg, an adviser with the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n“What is going on inside the camps in Libya is so bad that something must be done. They should speed up the process,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nUNHCR has also flown thousands of Africans home from Libya since last year.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton.
