In Mar. 2013, Netflix share’s were trading at around $26.\nIn the most recent quarter, Netflix (nflx) reported solid earnings that included adding 8.3 million subscribers, far higher than the 6.3 million that Wall Street had expected. Netflix has over 117 million total streaming subscribers, as of the end of Dec. 2017.\nOne of the ways Netflix has grown its subscriber base is by creating original programming that’s been a hit with viewers. As Fortune’s Tom Huddleston noted in January, two of Netflix’s most popular original shows—the science fiction series Stranger Things and the historical drama The Crown —premiered in the company’s fourth quarter, which could have prompted more subscribers to sign up.\nNetflix plans to spend $8 billion in 2018 on original programming , including movies, teen dramas, and even anime .

One of Netflix’s core advantages, Ives cites, is its original programming, which he said will continue to lure new subscribers.\nFrom the GBH Insights research note:\nWith more consumer dollars shifting away from traditional cable with cord cutting and towards streaming delivery, we believe Netflix has a long runway of growth and opportunity ahead of itself and clear first mover advantage despite intense competition from larger media players (Disney), pure play competitors, and new potential entrants (e.g. Apple).", "external_links": ["http://time.com/money/4985396/netflix-8-billion-2018-programming/", "http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-stock-all-time-high-market-valuation-1202716101/"], "published": "2018-03-03T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T11:37:10.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
