There will be extra staff on hand to process waiting travelers once the checkpoints re-open, it said.\nMore than half a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, while another 650,000 are said to have entered the country on their way to other destinations or on a visit before returning home. The figures do not include thousands who are estimated to have crossed the border illegally.\nReporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Helen Murphy and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:16:09.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
