Walmart is the biggest U.S. seller of groceries but its expansion into home-delivery services follows Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods last year. \nBy Sarah Nassauer \nWalmart Inc. will offer home delivery of groceries in 100 cities by the end of the year and launch same-day delivery in New York City, adopting a costly model it previously resisted as Amazon AMZN, +0.69% , Kroger KR, -1.67% and Target TGT, +0.01% invest in similar services. \nUnder the new program, online grocery orders will be packed in a Walmart WMT, -0.34% store by company workers and then handed off to a delivery company or startup that uses contract workers to bring orders to homes, said a Walmart spokesman. \nUber Technologies Inc. will be one of the initial partners, expanding a test started in 2016. Other crowdsource delivery companies will be added later this year, the spokesman said. Walmart currently offers grocery delivery in six cities through Uber and Deliv Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., firm. \nRead: Wal-Mart acquires New York City delivery service Parcel \nThe plan also includes using Jet, the online retailer Walmart purchased in 2016, to offer a same-day grocery-delivery service in New York City to compete with Prime Now, Amazon.com Inc.’s one- and two-hour delivery service, said people familiar with the plan. \nJet already delivers food to homes in some cities, but orders arrive via a carrier like FedEx FDX, +0.48% , usually within a few days. Jet aims to expand fast grocery delivery to around 10 large cities where Walmart hasn’t built a store presence like San Francisco, said one of these people, though specifics of the plan aren’t yet set.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T13:35:32.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
