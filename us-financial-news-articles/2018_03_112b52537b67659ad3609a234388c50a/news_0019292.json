It is particularly vulnerable to a U.S.-led trade war, which threatens the outlook for global growth and the demand for commodities.\nThose concerns have been reflected in global financial markets, with investors dumping shares for the safety of gold, cash, the Japanese yen and Swiss francs.\nThe Australian dollar, considered a risky asset, has been volatile since the start of February, losing 3.6 percent that month alone.\nOn Wednesday, it slipped 0.6 percent to go as low as $0.7772, not far from a recent two-month trough of $0.7713. It was last down 0.4 percent at $0.7797.\nTo add to the uncertainty a key advocate for free trade in the White House announced his resignation on Wednesday, fanning fears Trump would go ahead with tariffs and risk a trade war.\nCloser to home, Lowe sounded confident about the country’s future, saying the economy was moving in the right direction and signalling the next move in rates was likely up, not down.\nSPEED BUMP Lowe’s confidence rests partly on unexpected strength in the domestic labour market and a synchronised upturn in global activity.\nThat helped offset a disappointing end to last year with official data showing annual economic growth slowed to 2.4 percent in the December quarter, from an upwardly revised 2.9 percent in third quarter.\nNot all economists were as optimistic as Lowe.\n“The outlook for business investment is better, but dwellings investment will probably continue to decline and consumption may weaken again soon,” said Paul Dales, Sydney-based chief economist at Capital Economics.\n“So while the RBA believes that GDP growth will step up, we think another year of growth of about 2.5 percent is on the cards,” Dales added. “That partly explains why we doubt the RBA will raise interest rates until late in 2019.”\nThe RBA held rates at a record low 1.50 percent for a 17th straight meeting on Tuesday as inflation is still below its 2-3 percent target band.\nThe RBA sees only gradual progress in reducing unemployment and inflation. As a result, “the Board does not see a strong case for a near-term adjustment of monetary policy,” Lowe said.\nThe futures market reacted by pushing back the chance of a rate hike, with a 25 basis-point increase not fully-priced in until May 2019.
