(“Midstates” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MPO) today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Highlights and Recent Key Items\nAnnounced a proposed combination with SandRidge Energy, Inc. (“SandRidge”) in an at-market, all-stock transaction with potential annual cost-saving synergies in excess of $70 million from highly complementary assets Engaged in ongoing discussions with SandRidge on the proposed combination Set market-focused strategy aimed at reducing costs, generating substantial free cash flow, improving liquidity and focusing activity to maximize optionality Reported a net loss of $85.1 million, or $3.39 loss per share, in 2017, which included a non-cash ceiling-test impairment of $125.3 million related to the application of the Company’s market-focused strategy and one-rig drilling program in the year-end 2017 reserve report Announced year-end 2017 SEC proved reserves of 108.9 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe); utilizing March 9, 2018 strip pricing, the Company’s year-end 2017 proved reserves had a net present value discounted at 10% (PV-10) of approximately $600.1 million, an increase of approximately $40 million from year-end 2017 SEC pricing Achieved total Company production of 21,217 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 82% was in the Mississippian Lime, with the balance in the Anadarko Basin Generated Adjusted EBITDA of $33.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 12% over $30.2 million in the prior quarter; full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $128.2 million Disclosed a 2018 capital budget of $100 million to $120 million with a one-rig drilling program Completed workforce reduction in January 2018 to streamline G&A with current activity; reducing adjusted cash G&A expense by $3 million to $5 million annually (excluding one-time severance costs) Executed $50 million pay-down to RBL facility in March 2018; reducing annualized interest expense by approximately $3 million\nDavid Sambrooks, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During the second half of 2017, we made several key strategic decisions to streamline our Company with a focus on the Miss Lime and to pursue a drilling and development program that will be return driven and fully funded with internally generated cash flow. By committing to a single-rig drilling program for the foreseeable future, we will be able to generate free cash flow, but as a result, we had to reclassify a portion of our proved undeveloped reserves to probable which created a non-cash impairment during the fourth quarter. We continue to rationalize our portfolio and last year we sold our non-core assets in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, and will conclude our Anadarko Basin strategic review process soon. The continued execution of our strategy to generate free cash flow will further enhance our very strong financial foundation and provide maximum optionality to drive shareholder value.”\nMr. Sambrooks continued, “As we enter 2018 with stronger commodity prices, a clean balance sheet, and a strategic direction that is focused on free cash flow generation, the outlook for Midstates is clearly the best it has been in many years. Even with our confidence in the future for Midstates as a standalone company, we believe there are significant benefits from an at-market, all stock merger with SandRidge. Combining these two companies would form a stronger, more formidable company and deliver undeniable benefits to all stakeholders. The strategic fit and geographic overlap of both companies’ assets in the Mid-Con builds critical mass, creates significant synergies, and generates attractive risk-adjusted returns, while having options for growth in the Miss Lime, NW STACK, and North Park assets. The combined company will have zero net debt, strong liquidity, and forecasted free cash flow generation of up to $400 million over the next five years.”\n(Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Cash General and Administrative Expenses are non-GAAP financial measures. Each measure is defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the tables below.)\nProduction and Pricing\nProduction during the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled 21,217 BOEPD, compared with 21,358 BOEPD during the third quarter of 2017. Production from the Company’s Mississippian Lime properties contributed approximately 82%, or 17,327 BOEPD, and the Anadarko Basin properties contributed approximately 18%, or 3,890 BOEPD. For the total Company, oil volumes comprised 30% of total production, natural gas liquids (NGLs) 23%, and natural gas 47% during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Midstates’ average realized price per barrel of oil, before realized commodity derivatives, was $54.43 ($53.49 with realized derivatives), while its average realized price for NGLs sales was $27.42 per barrel (there were no NGL hedges in place during the fourth quarter). Natural gas averaged $2.44 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) ($2.67 with realized derivatives). Detailed comparisons of commodity prices by period and region are included in the tables below.\nOil, NGLs and natural gas sales revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $57.5 million, before the impact of derivatives, compared to $51.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. The loss on derivatives for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.1 million, compared with a $3.6 million loss during the third quarter of 2017.\nHedging Update\nTo reduce downside commodity price risk and protect cash flow, Midstates has entered into a number of swaps, collars, and 3-way collars to hedge a portion of the Company’s oil and natural gas revenues through 2019. A summary of the Company’s hedges is included in the below table.\nNYMEX WTI Fixed Swaps Collars Three Way Collars Hedge\nPosition\n(Bbls) Weighted\nAvg\nStrike\nPrice Hedge\nPosition\n(Bbls) Weighted\nAvg\nCeiling\nPrice Weighted\nAvg Floor\nPrice Hedge\nPosition\n(Bbls) Weighted\nAvg\nCeiling\nPrice Weighted\nAvg Floor\nPrice Weighted\nAvg\nSub-Floor\nPrice Quarter Ended: December 31, 2017(1)(2) 276,000 $ 53.58 46,000 $ 60.00 $ 50.00 115,000 $ 62.80 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 March 31, 2018(1) 99,000 $ 50.61 — $ — $ — 225,000 $ 62.14 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 June 30, 2018(1) 145,600 $ 51.22 — $ — $ — 182,000 $ 60.65 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 September 30, 2018(1) 92,000 $ 50.38 — $ — $ — 184,000 $ 59.93 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 December 31, 2018(1) 92,000 $ 50.38 — $ — $ — 46,000 $ 56.70 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 March 31, 2019(1) — $ — — $ — $ — 45,000 $ 56.20 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 June 30, 2019(1) — $ — — $ — $ — 45,500 $ 56.20 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 September 30, 2019(1) — $ — — $ — $ — 46,000 $ 56.20 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 December 31, 2019(1) — $ — — $ — $ — 46,000 $ 56.20 $ 50.00 $ 40.00 NYMEX HENRY HUB Fixed Swaps Collars Three Way Collars Hedge\nPosition\n(MMBtu) Weighted\nAvg Strike\nPrice\nHedge\nPosition\n(MMBtu) Weighted\nAvg\nCeiling\nPrice Weighted\nAvg Floor\nPrice Hedge\nPosition\n(MMBtu) Weighted\nAvg\nCeiling\nPrice Weighted\nAvg\nFloor\nPrice Weighted\nAvg\nSub-Floor\nPrice Quarter Ended: December 31, 2017(1) 1,907,000 $\n3.43\n551,000 $ 3.84 $ 3.23 610,000 $ 4.30 $ 3.25 $ 2.50 March 31, 2018(1)(3) 1,350,000 $\n3.47\n—\n$ — $ — 1,530,000 $ 4.38 $ 3.25 $ 2.50 June 30, 2018(1) — $\n—\n— $ — $ — 1,365,000 $ 3.40 $ 3.00 $ 2.50 September 30, 2018(1) — $\n—\n— $ — $ — 1,380,000 $ 3.40 $ 3.00 $ 2.50 December 31, 2018(1) — $\n—\n— $ — $ — 1,380,000 $ 3.40 $ 3.00 $ 2.50 March 31, 2019(1) — $\n—\n— $ — $ — 1,350,000 $ 3.40 $ 3.00 $ 2.50 (1) Positions shown represent open commodity derivative contract positions as of December 31, 2017. (2) During the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into long call oil trades to offset its three way collar short calls for the second half of 2017. (3) During the second quarter, the Company entered into natural gas three way collars with long call ceilings in order to offset its Q1 2018 natural gas fixed swaps. Proved Reserves\nMidstates’ reserves were fully engineered by its third-party independent reserve consultant, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. The Company’s estimated proved reserves for year-end 2017 totaled 108.9 MMBoe, which consisted of 64.5 MMBoe of proved developed reserves and 44.5 MMBoe of proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves. Total proved reserves were comprised of 29% oil, 23% NGLs, and 48% natural gas. Geographically, 92% are in the Mississippian Lime in Oklahoma and 8% are in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and Texas. Consistent with the Company’s strategy to prudently develop the Mississippian Lime assets and generate free cash flow, Midstates reduced the forward rig count assumptions in its reserve report to match the current one-rig development program within the SEC five-year window. As a result, the Company’s PUD reserve locations decreased year-over-year to 139 locations at year-end 2017 from 274 locations at year-end 2016. Additionally, the Company’s Mississippian Lime PUD type curve was reduced approximately 10%, to 450 MBoe from 512 MBoe, at year-end 2017.\nAt year-end 2017, Midstates’ proved reserves, as prepared utilizing SEC pricing, had a PV-10 of $558.1 million. Utilizing March 9, 2018 strip pricing, the Company’s year-end 2017 proved reserves had a PV-10 of approximately $600.1 million.\nOil (MBls) Natural Gas (MMcf) NGLs (MBbls) Total (MBoe) PV-10 (in millions)\nMississippian Lime: Proved developed producing\n12,606 148,052 11,359 48,640 $ 333,398 Proved developed non-producing 1,822 21,605 1,680 7,103 40,191 Proved undeveloped 13,866 125,169 9,729 44,457 131,360 Total 28,294 294,826 22,768 100,200 $ 504,949 Anadarko Basin: Proved developed producing 2,840 20,893 2,425 8,747 $ 53,183 Proved developed non-producing — — — — — Proved undeveloped — — — — — Total 2,840 20,893 2,425 8,747 $ 53,184 Total Proved\n31,134 315,719 25,193 108,947 $ 558,132 Costs and Expenses\nAdjusted Cash Operating Expenses (which excludes debt restructuring and advisory fees, as well as severance costs) for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $24.9 million, or $12.77 per Boe, compared with $26.0 million, or $13.22 per Boe, in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the third quarter of 2017 was attributable to lower general and administrative costs.\nLease operating and workover expenses (LOE) totaled $15.2 million, or $7.80 per Boe, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $15.7 million, or $7.97 per Boe, in the third quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 LOE decreased compared to third quarter of 2017 primarily due to reduced contract labor and workover expenses. Full year 2017 LOE averaged $7.83 per Boe.\nSeverance and other taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.7 million, or $1.38 per BOE (4.7% of oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenue), compared to $2.4 million, or $1.20 per BOE (4.5% of oil, NGL and natural gas sales revenue) in the third quarter of 2017. In May 2017, new legislation was signed into law in Oklahoma that increased the incentive tax rate from 1% to 4% on wells that commenced production between July 1, 2011 and July 1, 2015. Additionally, in November 2017, new legislation was signed into law in Oklahoma that increased the 4% incentive tax rate to 7% effective with December 2017 production.\nIn January 2018, to better align our general and administrative expense with our current activity level, Midstates completed a workforce reduction that will result in annualized adjusted cash G&A expense savings of $3 million to $5 million (excluding one-time severance costs). G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $6.3 million, or $3.20 per Boe, compared to $7.3 million, or $3.69 per Boe, in the third quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 and third quarter 2017 general and administrative expenses included net non-cash share-based compensation expense of $2.1 million, or $1.07 per Boe, and $2.8 million, or $1.44 per Boe, respectively. Adjusted cash general and administrative expenses, which excludes non-cash share-based compensation and certain non-recurring items, but includes capitalized general and administrative costs, totaled $4.1 million, or $2.12 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.2 million, or $2.64 per Boe, in the third quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted cash general and administrative expenses decreased compared to third quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower employee costs. Full year 2017 adjusted cash general and administrative expenses averaged $2.48 per Boe.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $19.4 million, or $9.92 per Boe, compared to $15.2 million, or $7.72 per Boe in the third quarter of 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a $125.3 million non-cash impairment charge in conjunction with the reduced forward rig count assumptions, as discussed above.\nInterest expense totaled $1.7 million (net of amounts capitalized) for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. The Company capitalized $0.4 million in interest to unproved properties in each of the fourth and third quarters of 2017.\nThe Company did not record an income tax expense or benefit during the fourth quarter or full year 2017 and had an effective tax rate of 0%.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company invested $33.6 million of operating capital, predominantly devoted to the Mississippian Lime assets.\nThe following table provides operational capital spending by area as well as a reconciliation to total capital expenditures for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Drilling and completion activities $ 31,779 $ 121,753 Acquisition of acreage and seismic data 1,775 9,523 Operational capital expenditures incurred $ 33,554 $ 131,276 Capitalized G&A, office, ARO & other 1,159 6,671 Capitalized interest 387 2,441 Total capital expenditures incurred $ 35,100 $ 140,388 For the Three\nMonths Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Mississippian Lime $ 33,319 $ 128,808 Anadarko Basin 235 2,468 Total operational capital expenditures incurred $ 33,554 $ 131,276 Operational Update\nMississippian Lime Update\nKey Highlights:\nProduced an average of 17,327 BOEPD in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 29% was oil, 22% NGLs, and 49% natural gas Full year 2017 production averaged 18,181 BOEPD, of which 28% was oil, 24% NGLs, and 48% natural gas Spud 9 wells and placed 5 wells online during the fourth quarter of 2017; spud 32 wells and placed 26 wells online in 2017 Incurred average drilling, completion and facility costs of $3.2 million for wells brought online in 2017\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company continued exploring options to maximize individual well performance by increasing the number of frac stages from approximately 17 stages to as many as 25 stages during its completion operations. This resulted in increased average well cost for its trial wells to $3.3 million per well, increasing the year-to-date average cost per well from $2.8 million in the first half of 2017 to $3.2 million for the full year 2017. Production results from this pilot program are currently being evaluated and the completion design optimization program is expected to continue in 2018.\nFurther, in conjunction with the appointment of David Sambrooks as President and Chief Executive Officer on November 1, 2017, a strategic review of all areas of operations was initiated. As part of this study, along with the reduction of the rig count from two rigs to a one rig program, completion of new wells were temporarily delayed pending a review of completion techniques. By early March 2018, a modified design was executed on six of the wells that had been awaiting completion. Pending review of the production results, decisions regarding completion design will be made on our remaining five drilled uncompleted wells.\nDuring 2017, the Company brought online three additional non-Arbuckle saltwater disposal injection wells in Woods and Alfalfa Counties, Oklahoma. The Company has subsequently added another non-Arbuckle saltwater disposal injection well in February 2018 in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. The Company is currently operating 11 non-Arbuckle injection wells in Woods and Alfalfa Counties, Oklahoma, with a total permitted injection capacity of approximately 240,000 barrels of water per day. The Company’s total permitted injection capacity in Woods and Alfalfa Counties, Oklahoma, which may differ from actual injection capacity due to operational constraints, is approximately 372,000 barrels of water per day, with a current disposal rate into all formations of approximately 165,000 barrels of water per day.\nAnadarko Basin Update\nMidstates has engaged SunTrust to explore strategic alternatives for its Anadarko Basin producing properties. The Company will retain the NW STACK undeveloped acreage in Dewey County, Oklahoma.\nThe Company’s Anadarko Basin assets averaged production of 3,890 BOEPD in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which 35% was oil, 27% NGLs, and 38% natural gas.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity was approximately $108.5 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $68.5 million and $40.0 million available under its credit facility. Its long-term debt was $128.1 million, resulting in net debt of approximately $59.6 million.\nOn November 1, 2017, Midstates announced that the Company’s borrowing base under its revolving credit facility was reaffirmed at $170 million. The agreement with its bank group excludes the Company’s Anadarko Basin assets in Texas and Oklahoma from the redetermination of the borrowing base. The next scheduled borrowing base redetermination will occur on or about April 1, 2018.\nIn early March 2018, the Company made a $50 million pay-down to the outstanding RBL balance with cash on hand. This will reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $3 million.\nFresh Start Accounting\nThe Company adopted fresh start accounting as of October 21, 2016, the date the Company emerged from its Chapter 11 reorganization. Adopting fresh start accounting results in a new reporting entity for financial reporting purposes and as a result, the Company allocated its reorganization value to its individual assets, including oil and gas property, plant and equipment, based upon their estimated fair values as of that date, and its historical retained deficit was eliminated. Due to the application of fresh start accounting, the Company’s consolidated financial statements on or after October 21, 2016 are not comparable with its consolidated financial statements prior to that date. References to “Successor” refer to the Company after the adoption of fresh start accounting, while references to “Predecessor” refer to the Company prior to adoption. Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2017 for further information regarding Midstates’ emergence from Chapter 11 restructuring and its application of fresh start accounting.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results on Wednesday, March 14, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (7:30 a.m. Central time).

This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs, estimated future development costs and estimated cash flows related to future asset retirement obligations (“ARO”). PV-10 is a financial measure not defined under US GAAP. Accordingly, the following table reconciles total PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information because it is widely used by investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies without regard to specific income tax characteristics of such entities. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under US GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under US GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted cash flows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2017 As of December 31, 2016 PV-10 $ 558,133 $ 578,155 Present value of future income tax, discounted at 10% (8,890) (48,205) Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $ 549,243 $ 529,950\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006507/en/\nMidstates Petroleum Company, Inc.\nJason McGlynn, 918-947-4614\nJason.McGlynn@midstatespetroleum.com\nSource: Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006507/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.midstatespetroleum.com&esheet=51772636&newsitemid=20180313006507&lan=en-US&anchor=www.midstatespetroleum.com&index=1&md5=4e7c0f54ff119abb8c8e3fda1834ef1f"], "published": "2018-03-13T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T00:40:25.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
