(NASDAQ:KOOL), a market leader in automated cell processing and point-of-care, autologous cell-based therapies, today announced financial and operating results for the transition period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, which is necessary to accommodate the change in the Company’s fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31, and provided a corporate update.\nTransition Period and Recent Highlights\nOn March 19, 2018, Cesca’s ThermoGenesis device subsidiary filed a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for an innovation to its CAR-TXpress™ technology which will allow for the simultaneous purification and activation of T-cells, thereby simplifying the CAR-TXpress workflow and tangibly accelerating the CAR-T cell manufacturing process.\nAlso on March 19, the Company announced that ThermoGenesis signed an exclusive license agreement with China-based IncoCell Tianjin Ltd. for CAR-T related contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) services covering the Asia Pacific region.\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company announced the commercial launch of its second-generation AXP ® II system for the advanced isolation, collection and storage of hematopoietic stem cell concentrates from both cord blood and peripheral blood.\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company raised net proceeds of $2.7 million through a follow-on offering of 898,402 shares of common stock.\nThe Company continued to advance development of ThermoGenesis’ novel CAR-TXpress platform, aimed at addressing the urgent need for automation of the CAR-T cell manufacturing process.\nThe Company bolstered its intellectual property position with the issuance of a second patent (No. 9,821,111) related to its Buoyancy-Activated Cell Separation, or X-BACS™, cell separation technology. On July 28, 2017, the Company announced that SynGen, which the Company acquired on July 10, 2017, had been awarded U.S. patent No. 9,695,394 covering the X-BACS apparatus. The X-BACS technology is key to the ongoing development of CAR-TXpress\nThe Company has continued to pursue active discussions with leading developers and others in the CAR-T space, for potential collaboration and co-development opportunities.\n“During the six-month transition period ended December 31, 2017, and through today, we have continued to make significant progress adapting our industry-leading cell processing technology to the burgeoning CAR-T market, where speed and consistency are key success factors,” stated Dr. Chris Xu, chief executive officer of Cesca. “We look forward to imminently introducing the first in a line of kits for the CAR-T research market – specifically, the X-Mini™. Our aim is to follow this with the introduction of the additional kits throughout the year. At the same time, we are entering the contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) capabilities market, as evidenced by our recently-signed license agreement with IncoCell Tianjin Ltd. We intend to leverage these new capabilities as we pursue collaborations with potential development partners, including leading pharmaceutical companies, medical technology companies, academic institutions and distributors.\n“We also recently introduced our second-generation system for advanced cord blood processing, AXP II, which will help Cesca maintain its leadership position in this important legacy market. Finally, we further strengthened our management team with the addition of Joe Balagot, who is now leading a robust corporate development program. We are very pleased with the progress we have made thus far, and believe we are well-positioned to be the partner-of-choice in the evolution and growth of CAR-T and other revolutionary immunotherapies.”\nFinancial Results for the Transitional Six Months Ended December 31, 2017\nNet revenue. Net revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $6.0 million compared to $7.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Revenues decreased primarily as a result of a single end user customer purchasing one-time larger than normal orders of AXP disposables to stock up inventory levels in the six months ended December 31, 2016, the distributor change in the China market and a one-time shipment of our remaining inventory associated with a discontinued product line (Res-Q ® ) in the prior year six month period. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in sales of our BioArchive ® devices, as we sold eight such devices during the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to none in the six months ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit. Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.2 million, or 35.8% of net revenue, compared to $2.9 million, or 37.8% of net revenue for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher overhead costs as a result of the acquisition of SynGen assets and our mix of products sold.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $935,000 compared to $775,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due to a higher personnel costs related to filling previously open positions and the transition of the X-Series product lines to ThermoGenesis Corp. as a result of the SynGen acquisition.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $2.2 million, compared to $1.4 million for the comparable period in 2016. The increase is due to additional headcount and expenses related to the development of our CAR-TXpress platform, and a shift in existing personnel from the clinical development segment to the device segment as we are minimally funding clinical development projects until a strategic partner is located.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were $3.6 million compared to $6.3 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in severance and accelerated stock expenses of $1.8 million for the termination of the former chief executive officer in November 2016, the elimination of certain positions and a decrease in legal expenses of approximately $1 million primarily due to settlement of the SynGen litigation.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $2.3 million, or ($0.23) per share, based on approximately 10.1 million weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding. This compares to a net loss of $25.8 million, or ($3.26) per share, based on approximately 7.9 million weighted average basic and diluted common shares outstanding for the six months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. In addition to the results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Cesca also uses a non-GAAP measure, adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate comparisons with historical results and trends. The Company defines EBITDA as its income or loss from operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP adjusted for depreciation and amortization along with stock compensation expense. For the six months ended December 31, 2017, Cesca reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.0 million compared, essentially unchanged versus the six months ended December 31, 2016.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCesca will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 4:30 p.m. EDT (1:30 p.m. PDT).
