In February, Grossman said the company was focusing on \"inspiring healthy habits for real life.\" \nThe meal-kit industry has exploded since 2012 â€” quickly becoming saturated with more than 150 companies competing nationally, regionally and locally, all fighting for their share of the $1.5 billion market.\nConsumers who flock to these services seek fresh ingredients, convenience and unique recipes. But keeping them engaged is a challenge. In order for meal-kit services to thrive, companies need to address the convenience, price and flexibility of their subscriptions.\nIt is unclear how much Weight Watchers' meal kits will cost, but the majority of such kits run between $60 to $75 a week for three meals for two people to $130 to $150 a week for three meals for four people.\nIn addition to meal kits, Weight Watchers will also start selling kitchen tools along with its branded packaged food.\n\"Our goal is to be a partner to everyone on their pursuit toward healthier living,\" Grossman said in a statement, according to Bloomberg.\nWeight Watchers and Blue Apron did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.\nRead the report from Boomberg here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T18:03:17.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
