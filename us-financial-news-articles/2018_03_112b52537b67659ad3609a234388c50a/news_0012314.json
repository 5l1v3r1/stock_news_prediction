REUTERS/Staff/Remote The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 1.1 percent at its close, while Euro zone stocks .STOXXE also rose 1.1 percent.\nThough the ECB dropped its pledge to increase its bond buying if needed, comments by President Mario Draghi that policy would remain “reactive” and that measures of underlying inflation were still subdued weighed on the euro, which in turn benefited Europe’s exporter stocks.\n“Depending on how long the ECB continues to hover around the exit without going through, the euro may have to soften further,” Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.\n“In turn, that could open up further breathing space for European shares.”\nMerger and acquisition news drove big stock moves once again.\nSpanish construction firm ACS ( ACS.MC ) rose 8.7 percent after reports it was in talks with Italy’s Atlantia ( ATL.MI ) to break up Abertis ( ABE.MC ) in an effort to avoid a bidding war for the highway concessions company.\nAtlantia, which confirmed preliminary talks with ACS over Abertis, gained 5.1 percent, while Abertis fell 4 percent.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Shares in Hochtief ( HOTG.DE ), which had also bid for Abertis, rose 7.3 percent.\n“It’s positive news since instead of a bidding war there will be a division of assets and we’ll get a fairer price and maybe better synergies,” said Stefano Fabiani, fund manager at Italy’s Zenit.\nAnother Milan-based fund manager said: “It’s particularly good news for ACS/Hochtief since the market didn’t like their offer because it increased leverage.”\nEarnings took their toll on some stocks.\nFrench supermarket Casino ( CASP.PA ) dropped 3.7 percent after its results disappointed investors. The grocer said profit grew by over 10 percent in France for the year, against market expectations of 14 percent.\nA Reuters report that Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) is preparing to sell electronics directly into Brazil, a key market for Casino, could also be weighing on the shares, a trader said.\nHugo Boss ( BOSSn.DE ) shares fell nearly 7 percent after the German fashion house struck a more cautious tone on profit as it kept up investment in revamping stores and its website.\nBoskalis Westminster ( BOSN.AS ) sank 10.8 percent, the worst STOXX 600 performer, after the construction and engineering firm reported full-year earnings and said it would be a “challenge” to match 2017 results.\nAxel Springer ( SPRGn.DE ) sank 10 percent after results triggered profit taking.\nReporting by Helen Reid; Additional Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by Danilo Masoni and Andrew Roche\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T20:00:35.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
