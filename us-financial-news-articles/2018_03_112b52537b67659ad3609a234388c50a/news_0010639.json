On Tuesday, the company said some of the data falsification went back 50 years. \nKobe Steel’s announcement opened the floodgates for similar revelations at other top manufacturers, puncturing national pride in Japan’s manufacturing prowess. In recent months, Mitsubishi Materials Corp. MIMTF, +945.78% and Subaru Corp. FUJHY, +0.64% admitted to quality-inspection lapses, while Nissan Motor Co. said it let unqualified employees perform final quality inspections on some cars. Those companies, as well as Kobe Steel, said no safety issues resulted.
