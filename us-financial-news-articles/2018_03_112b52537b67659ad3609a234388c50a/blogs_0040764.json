So, if the greenback continues to weaken this year as he expects, it could help support higher gold prices. Dudas also sees upside inflation risks pointing to a bullish backdrop. \nBut the yellow metal, considered a safe-haven asset, is trading around $1,310 and has been flat this year. Even when the Feb. 2 correction gripped the stock market, it failed to rally in the weeks that followed. \n\"It has, I think, been a little bit frustrating for some of the gold bugs,\" Dudas said. \nBut he sees the situation changing. He predicts gold prices will reach 2018 highs of $1,400 an ounce before the fourth quarter â€” about a 6 percent gain from current levels. His forecast calls for a yearly average of $1,350. \n\"In this range of $1,320-$1,340, it's been kind of in a tight range, which again in these days relative to the equity market and bitcoin, is a pretty safe haven,\" Dudas said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T14:45:13.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
