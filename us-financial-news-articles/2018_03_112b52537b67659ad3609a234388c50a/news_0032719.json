It identified uncleared derivative contracts between Britain and European Union (EU) parties with a notional value of £26 trillion ($36 trillion). A further £70 trillion of cleared contracts is seen as a particular risk to the EU.\n\"Cleared\" trades are trades that take place on an exchange while \"uncleared\" trades take place between two counterparties directly. A derivative is a security with a price that is dependent upon, or derived from, one or more underlying assets.\nInsurance risk Another risk area highlighted by the bank committee is insurance. It said major insurers may not be able to pay claims or receive premiums from policyholders in the opposing jurisdiction.\nIt is estimated that around 50 million people could be affected with liability values totaling £83 billion.\nDespite noting that major U.K. banks are adequately capitalized to cope with a disorderly Brexit, the FPC is to carry out another round of stress tests in 2018.\nThe scenario, which includes a 33 percent fall in house prices and interest rates rising to 4 percent, is the same as in 2017.\nThe United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union at 11 p.m. London time on 29 March 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T13:59:37.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
