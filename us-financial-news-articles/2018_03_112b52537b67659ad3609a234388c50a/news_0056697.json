It’s a challenge, I would say, for the agency,” Aris Xenofos told Greece’s Alpha 989 radio, according to a transcript of the interview. “But I think it’s a feasible target.”\nWhile privatizations have been a pillar of Greece’s bailouts since 2010, they have raised proceeds of just 5 billion euros, rather than a targeted 50 billion euros, mainly due to the crisis, political and union resistance and bureaucracy.\nBy June, Greece needs to conclude the lease of a vast seaside property, the sale of gas grid DESFA and launch the sale or the securitization of a stake in electricity utility Public Power Corp. (PPC). It will later sell minority stakes in water utilities EYDAP and EYATH.\nReporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T11:17:41.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
