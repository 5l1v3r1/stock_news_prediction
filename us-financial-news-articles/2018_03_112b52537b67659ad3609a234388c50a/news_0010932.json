If they did, the timing could be awkward for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who founded 1MDB, as he prepares to call an election that must be held by August.\nThe court filing said the prosecutors sought to lift the stay order to make way for a \"consent judgment and proposed consent judgment that will fully resolve this case\".\nRed Granite Pictures, which produced 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and was co-founded by Najib's step son, had announced in September that it had \"reached a settlement in principle\" with the U.S. government, without revealing any sum.\nThe Hollywood blockbuster, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was among the assets listed in the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuits.\nThe filing also said the parties involved have reached a global settlement that includes rights and interests in the motion pictures Daddys Home and Dumb and Dumber To.\nRed Granite and 1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to U.S. lawsuits filed in the past three years under the Justice Department's kleptocracy asset recovery initiative.\nThey include a private jet, a hotel and real estate in New York, and a $107 million interest in EMI Music Publishing purchased by Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, the department said.\nThe U.S. attorney-general described the 1MDB scandal as \"kleptocracy at its worst\".\nThe lawsuits also said $681 million from 1MDB was transferred to the account of Malaysian Official 1, which U.S. and Malaysian sources have previously identified as Najib.\nNajib's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nNajib set up 1MDB in 2009 and previously served as chairman of its advisory board. He and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.\nAt least six countries are investigating transactions related to 1MDB, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.\nIn the past week, Indonesian authorities seized a luxury yacht, the Equanimity, which was sought by U.S. prosecutors as part of their investigations linked to 1MDB.\n(Reporting by Joseph Sipalan; editing by Praveen Menon and Simon Cameron-Moore)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T00:09:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
