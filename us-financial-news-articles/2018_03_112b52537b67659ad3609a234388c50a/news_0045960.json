Haaf as the new chief executive officer. With experience in leadership roles at Lucky Supermarkets, Food Lion, LLC, Office Depot, Inc., GE and more, Haaf will drive Self Point’s strategic initiatives to ensure the mobile-first e-commerce platform supports food retailers in elevating targeted offers and simplifying online shopping.

Mike knows more than anyone about the urgency for food retailers to upgrade the way they enable consumers to shop, and he has influenced the evolution of our product roadmap to better accommodate our clients’ needs.”\nWith more than 20 years of experience in marketing, business strategy and leadership roles, Mike Haaf has led teams to drive topline and bottom line growth, receiving retail industry awards and recognition. While serving as executive vice president and general manager at Lucky Supermarkets , a Save Mart Company, Haaf led the turnaround of the business, growing the topline and delivering profitability for the first time in 15 years. At Lucky, Haaf launched social media advertising, online ordering, and the company’s first loyalty program. During Haaf’s tenure as senior vice president of sales, marketing and business strategy at Food Lion, LLC , he reorganized the business around the customer. Haaf initiated systematic changes in assortment, merchandising, pricing and store attributes leading to the turnaround of that business. Haaf has an MBA from Columbia Business School. He also serves as an advisor as well as a member of the Board of Directors of several technology startups.\n“Food retailers must pivot strategies to accommodate the empowered consumer,” said Haaf. “Grocers know they need to focus on customer loyalty, and mobile shopping is a mandatory component.
