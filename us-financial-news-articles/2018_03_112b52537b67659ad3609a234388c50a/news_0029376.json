Management believes Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful indicator of our performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it removes material non-cash items that allows investors to analyze the operating performance of the business using the same metric management uses. The exclusion of non-cash items better reflects our ability to make investments in the business and meet obligations. Presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. Management uses this measure to assess operating results and performance of our business, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to our business segments. While management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of comparative operating performance, it should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and the measure, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nThe following table includes the reconciliation of our consolidated U.S. GAAP net loss to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\nNet loss\n$\n(6,126)\n$\n(21,874)\nInterest expense\n8,622\n8,400\nProvision for income tax\n1,234\n155\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,705\n2,957\nBasis-difference amortization in equity earnings of affiliate\n460\n484\nChange in fair value of stock warrants and other\nderivatives\n3,922\n4,573\nStock-based compensation\n1,841\n1,010\nRestructuring\n249\n5,938\nLoss from discontinued operations\n—\n3,277\nForeign currency exchange loss on intercompany accounts\n(591)\n1,487\nNon-cash royalty expense\n3,234\n6,681\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n16,550\n$\n13,088\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rlj-entertainment-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300614333.html\nSOURCE RLJ Entertainment, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rlj-entertainment-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300614333.html", "http://www.rljentertainment.com/events/"], "published": "2018-03-15T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T14:56:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
