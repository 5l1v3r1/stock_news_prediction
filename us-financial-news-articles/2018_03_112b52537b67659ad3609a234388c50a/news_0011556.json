He earlier told Reuters the general reserve of the central bank and its assets in foreign currencies had increased by $1.5 billion in the first two months.\nSalameh also told Reuters that November’s increase in local currency interest rates of around 2 percentage points — a result of the political crisis — had been enough to iron out market imbalances, “therefore we have an outlook of stable interest rates”.\n“With the rise of interest rates and the return of political issues to normal, the dollar reserves at the central bank rose by around $1.4 billion by the end of February since the end of 2017,” Salameh told the conference.\nOrganised by Lebanese business magazine Al-Iktissad Wal-Aamal in cooperation with Prime Minister’s office, the conference was a roadshow for Lebanon’s government before an international donor and investor conference in Paris in April seeking support for infrastructure development.
