You're not missing a moment of productivity,\" Roth says.\nBut it's not all about work. For example, the custom Italian leather seats were inspired by coat the financier's wife bought during a trip to Milan, Italy.\nCNBC \"She just loved the color and they asked us to duplicate the color of the coat for the seats,\" Roth explains. \"These chairs are probably about $45,000 each and there's five of them.\"\nCNBC And when the busy Wall Street exec wants to take a break from stock trading, he can relax in his G5's refurbished lounge area with the big-screen TV.\nCNBC For overnight flights, there's even a king-size bed on board.\nCNBC To respect his client's privacy, Roth would not reveal to CNBC his client's name or the company he works for. However, Roth did give a hint on how much he spent to remodel the plane. The trader could have bought over 14,000 shares of Apple (at its $178.44 closing price on Wednesday) with the money he spent on the renovations.\nWatch new episodes of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" Wednesdays at 10P/ET. \nDon't miss: Meet the man who guides the 1 percent on $120,000 climbing expeditions to the top of Mt.
