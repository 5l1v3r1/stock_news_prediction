REUTERS/Samrang Pring A statement on the human rights situation in Cambodia read by New Zealand on behalf of a group of 45 countries, including the United States, Germany, Australia and United Kingdom, said previous optimism had been “replaced by deep concern” regarding a decline in civil and political rights in Cambodia. The statement, which was read to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, urged Cambodia’s government to reinstate the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) and all elected members. Dozens of opposition lawmakers were banned when Cambodia’s Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP last year in a ruling that was widely condemned by the international community. That decision followed the arrest of CNRP leader Kem Sokha last September. Kem Sokha has been charged with treason, accused of colluding with Americans to overthrow the Cambodian government. He denies the charges and the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh has also denied the accusation. Kem Sokha faces 30 years in prison if convicted. Prime Minister Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia for 33 years.

Government spokesman Phay Siphan said Cambodia won’t comply with demands made by foreign countries. “We are equally members of the United Nations,” Phay Siphan told Reuters. “This is a violation of Cambodia’s sovereignty.” “We will hold elections according to what Cambodians want, based on Cambodian laws,” he added.
