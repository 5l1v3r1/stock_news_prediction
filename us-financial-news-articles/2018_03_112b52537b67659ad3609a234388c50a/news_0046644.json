Picture taken June 12, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter The strong performance by China’s biggest-listed bank shows how conservative lending practices and increased recognition of bad loans is helping underpin results at the country’s larger commercial banks, after years of decline in margins brought on by successive interest rate cuts.\nState-controlled ICBC, one of the world’s biggest banks by market capitalization and assets, posted a net profit of 58.1 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) for the three months ended December, versus 55.5 billion yuan a year ago.\nThat was the fastest pace of growth since 2014 and was also more than the 2.8 percent average net profit growth estimated by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.\nICBC’s net interest margin rose to 2.22 percent at end-December, from 2.17 percent at end-September.\nICBC’s non-performing loan (NPL) ratio dropped slightly to 1.55 percent at end-2017, from 1.56 percent at end-September.\nThe lender’s net profit for the full year rose 2.8 percent, aided also by strength in its retail business.\nICBC reported a net annual increase of individual customers amounting to 38 million, “the highest in recent years”.\nIts number of credit card customers increased to 88.59 million, making ICBC the largest domestic credit card issuing bank, it added.\nHowever, ICBC still reported a 3.7 percent drop in net fee and commission income for the year, its first contraction since its listing more than a decade ago, as income from personal wealth management, private banking, corporate wealth management and investment banking contracted.\n($1 = 6.2745 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai and Matthew Miller in Beijing; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T18:32:04.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
