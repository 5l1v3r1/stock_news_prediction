The stock closed a dollar below its IPO price of $17 on Tuesday.\nDropbox's IPO comes on the heels of a strong market debut of cyber security firm Zscaler Inc, which had also raised the size and price of its offering.\nMusic streaming service Spotify, valued at roughly $19 billion in the private markets, has also filed for a direct listing and will debut on the NYSE on April 3.\nDropbox's increase in IPO price range bodes well for Spotify, said Michael Carvin, Chief Executive of personal finance technology firm SmartAsset. \"They will be watching this closely as they look towards their own debut.\"\nA direct listing lets investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.\nIn contrast, San Francisco-based Dropbox has hired JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, among others, for its IPO.\nThe order book for the offering closes at midday on Wednesday and the pricing is expected on Thursday.\nSources told Reuters on Monday that the offering was oversubscribed.\nThe company has 500 million users and competes with Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc . Box Inc is its main rival.\nThe stock will start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.
