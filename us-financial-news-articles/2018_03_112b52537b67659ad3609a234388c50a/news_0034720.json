As previously disclosed, beneficial interests in the Company (“units”) are generally not transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law.\nFinancial Results\nLiquidation Basis of Accounting\nThe Company reported that estimated net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 are currently estimated to result in future liquidating distributions of approximately $7.26 per unit. To date, the Company has distributed $10.75 per share/unit of liquidation proceeds. This estimate of future liquidating distributions includes projections of income and expenses to be earned or incurred during the period required to complete the plan of liquidation. There is inherent uncertainty with these projections and, accordingly, these projections could change materially based on a number of factors both within and outside of Winthrop’s control including market conditions, the timing of sales, the performance of underlying assets and any changes in the underlying assumptions of projected cash flows.\nAfter giving effect to the $0.60 per unit liquidating distribution paid on August 29, 2017 and the $0.90 per unit liquidating distribution paid on November 21, 2017, the current estimate represents a decrease in liquidating distributions of $0.24 per unit from the Company’s estimate at December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in the liquidation value of our 450 West 14 th Street equity investment due to unfavorable changes in the real estate market in New York, New York, continued difficulty in leasing the retail space at the property and increased real estate taxes; (ii) a decrease in the liquidation value of our Houston, Texas residential property based on actual sales proceeds; and (iii) a decrease in the liquidation value of our Oklahoma City, Oklahoma property based on actual sales proceeds. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in estimated corporate expenditures resulting primarily from decreases in estimated fees payable to the Company’s advisor due to the reduction in the overall liquidation value.\n2017 Distributions\nOn August 29, 2017 paid a liquidating distribution of $0.60 per unit to holders of record on August 22, 2017.\nOn November 21, 2017 paid a liquidating distribution of $0.90 per unit to holders of record on November 14, 2017.\nTax Information\nWinthrop Realty Liquidating Trust K-1’s are now available and can be accessed by clicking on the link on the homepage of the Company’s website.\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about the Company and its assets, please visit the Company’s website at www.winthropreit.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\n“Safe Harbor” Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
