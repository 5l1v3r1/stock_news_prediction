REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton/File photo Relations between China and India have been tense in recent months after their troops faced off on a disputed part of their border. China was also angered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s February visit to the eastern border state of Arunachal Pradesh, also claimed by China.\nSenior officials in the foreign and interior ministries said exiled Tibetans would not be allowed to hold a rally in the capital, but could do so in the northern town of Dharamsala, where a Tibetan government in exile is based.\n“We don’t want Tibetans to hold big anti-China protests in New Delhi because it creates a bit of diplomatic tension between India and China,” said the senior foreign ministry official.\n“It’s a very sensitive time for India and China ties and we want to ease tensions.”\nChina took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it calls a “peaceful liberation” of the remote, Himalayan region.\nAn uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet erupted in 1958 and troops crushed it the following year.

India allows him to pursue his religious activities in the country and to travel abroad.\nTens of thousands Tibetans live in 39 formal settlements and dozens of informal communities across India.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T13:37:52.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
