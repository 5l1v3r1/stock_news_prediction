Consumer staples and materials weighed the most, wiping off a combined 17 points from the index.\nTop FTSE loser was Smurfit Kappa, which fell 4.1 percent after the firm spurned a renewed offer from International Paper.\nHaving jumped to a record high on news of the takeover approach early this month, Smurfit’s shares are now down more than 7 percent from that peak.\nFresnillo was the biggest gainer, up 4.5 percent after Goldman Sachs analysts upgraded the stock to “buy” and added it to their “conviction list”, based on their bullish position on gold.\n“Our commodities team is bullish on gold for the first time in more than five years based on higher inflation, rising EM wealth and concerns about an equity correction,” wrote Goldman strategists, upgrading the whole gold mining sector.\nRandgold Resources also gained 1.1 percent after the Goldman upgrade to “buy”.\nAmong mid-caps, JD Sports fell 4.7 percent after agreeing to buy Finish Line, one of the largest retailers of athletic footwear and apparel in the United States, for $558 million.\nInchcape rose 2.2 percent after saying it would buy Grupo Rudelman, an auto distribution business in Central America.\nDana Inc increased its cash offer for GKN by $140 million, ramping up its efforts to fend off rival suitor Melrose. GKN shares rose 0.6 percent.\nTools and equipment hire company Speedy Hire rose 8.1 percent after saying full-year profits were likely to be ahead of expectations.\nOverall, analysts are downgrading their estimates for FTSE 100 earnings, and the leading UK index has underperformed European peers over the past 12 months.\nReporting by Helen Reid Editing by David Stamp and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:51:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
