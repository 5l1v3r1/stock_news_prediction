The findings build on previous research showing that cooking meat at high temperature is linked to the formation of potentially cancer-causing chemicals in the meat. \nThe results of the study were presented Wednesday at an American Heart Association meeting . The study followed 86,777 women and 17,104 men. While none of the participants had high blood pressure at the start of the study, 12-16 years later, 37,123 of the participants developed hypertension. \nFrom those, researchers found that the risk of hypertension was 17% higher for those who ate two servings of grilled, broiled, or roasted meat each week. The risk of developing high blood pressure was also 15% higher in people who preferred their food well done. \nGang Liu, the study’s lead author and a research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says that the research merely suggests that avoiding the use of open-flame or high-temperature cooking methods could reduce the risk of developing hypertension, reports the Today show. \nBottom line: grilling isn’t something you should avoid entirely, but like everything, should probably be done in moderation.
