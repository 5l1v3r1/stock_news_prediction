BlackBerry and Microsoft were bitter rivals until both decided to focus their businesses elsewhere after losing out in the fiercely competitive smartphone market.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo Microsoft has concentrated on cloud computing, while BlackBerry has moved away from selling its own phones to providing software and security to others’ devices. As part of the partnership, the Canadian software maker’s platform, BlackBerry Enterprise Bridge, will allow businesses to securely access Microsoft’s apps such as Excel, Word and PowerPoint on smartphones. “Microsoft’s core Exchange/Outlook customer base is commercial, including government and regulated industries,” Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said. “These customers were the big users of BlackBerry.” BlackBerry’s services such its mobile application developing tool BlackBerry Dynamics and Workspaces will be available on Microsoft’s cloud computing platform Azure, the companies said. BlackBerry’s shares were up 4 percent at C$17.32 in Toronto, while Microsoft was marginally higher at $93.07 in early trading on the Nasdaq.
