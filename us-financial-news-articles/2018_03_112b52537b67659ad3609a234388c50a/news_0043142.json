The cast of “Pleasures and Palaces” had endured a disappointing tryout in Detroit, their work buffeted by negative reviews. There had been talk of another tryout in Boston before opening on Broadway, but now neither would happen: The producer decided to close the show. Nevertheless, at the last rehearsal, the cast put on a special performance for an audience of one, the show’s director and choreographer, Bob Fosse. Fosse had been working on a new version of “Tears of Joy,” a number that had given him fits, and the cast wanted to demonstrate that they had learned his intricate moves. Afterward, they sang and danced numbers from other Fosse shows. “That’s the kind of loyalty the man inspired,” remembered Kathryn Doby, one of the dancers present at the rehearsal.\nTheir loyalty was understandable, as Kevin Winkler makes clear in “Big Deal: Bob Fosse and Dance in the American Musical,” a biography that views the choreographer’s art through the lens of his life. To start with, Fosse was very successful. By 1965—when “Pleasures and Palaces” foundered—he had already won Tony Awards for choreographing “The Pajama Game” (1954), “Damn Yankees” (1955), “Redhead” (1959) and “Little Me” (1962). His musical staging of “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” (1961) contributed heavily to the show’s long run on Broadway. As a dancer, he had the goods, as demonstrated by his performance in the 1953 film “Kiss Me Kate” or the 1958 Hollywood adaptation of “Damn Yankees.”\nBig Deal By Kevin Winkler\nOxford, 350 pages, $29.95\nThe foundation of Fosse’s success was laid in his early years. Born in Chicago in 1927, he began taking dancing lessons at the age of 9. By the time he was 13, he and another boy had teamed up to form the Riff Brothers, a tap-dancing act that performed at nightclubs, theaters and beer gardens. They performed at burlesque houses too, and it was there that Fosse was exposed to the seamier side of show business. The impressions of those early years stayed with him, as he readily acknowledged, and he drew on them all throughout his life. After spending a year in the Navy, he moved to New York, worked as a dancer, and met Mary Ann Niles, who became his professional partner and, in time, his first wife.\nTwo traits were apparent from early in Fosse’s career: He was extraordinarily ambitious and he possessed nearly limitless energy. About his ambition, Mr. Winkler relates an account from the filming of “Kiss Me Kate.” Hired for the supporting role of Hortensio, Fosse approached the show’s choreographer, Hermes Pan, about the possibility of choreographing a number of his own. Pan, impressed by Fosse’s dancing skill no less than his pluck, told him to go ahead. The payoff was “From This Moment On,” and it is a joy to behold. “The number’s highlight,” writes Mr. Winkler, “arrives when the lights drop and the tempo downsizes to a big band fanfare. The cheerful musical comedy dancing of the preceding hour and forty-five minutes is forgotten as a blast of jazz adrenaline jumps off the screen” as Fosse dances a duet with Carol Haney. Mr. Winkler analyzes their gestures, some of them small (their cool finger snaps, for instance) and others large (such as Fosse’s virtuosic backflip), arguing that the number introduces nothing less than “a new dance vocabulary.”\nPhoto: Getty Images The discussion of “From This Moment On” illustrates a difference between “Big Deal” and “Fosse,” Sam Wasson’s fine biography from five years ago. Mr. Wasson’s book concentrates more on Fosse’s life than on his art. Mr. Winkler takes something of the opposite approach. Not only was he a professional dancer, he also took part in the 1982 Broadway revival of “Little Me,” and thereby had the chance to work for Fosse, who had been brought in to stage one of the numbers. Writing with authority and economy, Mr. Winkler helps readers see more deeply into the movements that pass brilliantly before their eyes.\nThe energy Fosse expended in pursuit of his ambition came at a cost. Ever the perfectionist, he labored incessantly over all his projects; 16-hour days were common. “Cigarettes,” he claimed, “were identified with work,” and seldom was he seen without one depending from his lips. (In his 1979 film, the autobiographical “All That Jazz,” the Fosse character even smokes in the shower.) For years, he employed a round of amphetamines to wake him up in the morning and barbiturates to help him fall asleep at night. A heart attack at the age of 47 put him out of commission for a few months, but before long he resumed his arduous schedule, making a minimum of concessions to his mortality. He died of a heart attack at the age of 60. Fittingly, he spent the last day of his life in rehearsal.\nOne of Mr. Winkler’s stated goals is to examine the impact of “each of the important women in [Fosse’s] adult life.” The most significant of these was Gwen Verdon, his third wife. It was Verdon who was responsible for originating the title role in Fosse’s 1966 musical, “Sweet Charity.” Later, to help with the 1969 film version, she gave up the chance to make her Broadway debut as a dramatic lead in Tennessee Williams’s “The Seven Descents of Myrtle”; Verdon even coached Shirley MacLaine, who would play Charity in the film, and Debbie Allen, when Ms. Allen was cast in that role for the 1986 stage revival. Verdon remained, until her death in 2000, a “living repository for Fosse’s work.”\nThe high point of Fosse’s career came in 1973 when he won an Academy Award for “Cabaret,” a work depicting an aspiring nightclub singer in Weimar Germany as the Nazis came to power. That same year he also won three Emmy Awards for his contributions to “Liza with a ‘Z,’ ” a variety program starring Liza Minnelli, and two Tony Awards for “Pippin,” a musical about a young prince’s quest for meaning and adventure. Further accomplishments awaited him, but never again would Fosse’s star shine so bright.\nMr. Winkler is a fan of Fosse’s work, but not uncritically so. The 1975 musical “Chicago,” he argues, would have had a longer run had it not been in direct competition with that musical theater colossus, “A Chorus Line.” By contrast, he holds that “Big Deal” (1986) suffered from a weak book (written by Fosse) and that it needed the help of a veteran writer who “could have brightened the characters and quickened its pace.”\n“To have worked with Bob Fosse is to have had your hand directly on the pulse of life,” Ben Vereen once wrote. Fosse’s dancers and actors saw firsthand that he poured his life and energy into his work. More important, he had the gift of inspiring them to achieve more than they thought imaginable. This is why the cast of “Pleasures and Palaces” rallied around him that bleak day in Detroit, singing and dancing for him one last time: It was, as Mr. Winkler writes, “the purest, most meaningful way for them to say ‘thank you.’ ”\n—Mr. Check is a professor of music at the University of Central Missouri.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T14:57:38.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
