(“DCF” or the “Company”) (TSX:DCF) (TSX:DCF.DB) is pleased to announce the sale of its indirect stake in the 618 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Rancho Mirage, California known as the “Eagle”. DCF’s initial cash proceeds are approximately $14.3 million, representing a realized gain before U.S. taxes of about $7.7 million on its investment (all figures in Canadian dollars).\nAs part of the transaction, DCF has retained an indirect equity stake in the Eagle. The Company has the option to monetize such stake as at August 1, 2018 and generate an additional approximate $800,000 in proceeds. Pre-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) on the investment is about 18% and after-U.S.-tax IRR is about 15%.\nDCF acquired its interest in the Eagle in November 2012 as an opportunistic purchase of a distressed asset, following the success the Company’s co-founder and Executive Chairman, Michael Wekerle, had with the commercial real estate investments he made personally in south Florida in 2009 and 2010. DCF’s interest is held indirectly through its subsidiary, Difference RM Properties LLC (“DRM”), a Delaware limited liability company.\nRancho Mirage is located in the Coachella Valley in south-central California, immediately south-east of Palm Springs. The Eagle sits immediately across from the former Annenberg Estate, Sunnylands, an historic site sometimes referred to as the “Camp David of the West.”\n“The disposition of this investment has significantly improved our ability to repay our outstanding debentures in a manner non-dilutive to shareholders, which has been an important focus for the Company,” states Henry Kneis, Chief Executive Officer of DCF.\nThe Company will release its fourth quarter and 2017 year-end financial results on Monday, April 2, 2018.\nAbout Difference Capital Financial Inc.\nDifference Capital Financial Inc. invests in and advises growth companies. We leverage our capital markets expertise to help unlock the value in technology, media and healthcare companies as they approach important milestones in their business lifecycle.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this press release may be deemed “ .” Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the words “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates,” “projects,” “potential,” “scheduled,” and similar expressions, or that events or conditions “will,” “would,” “may,” “could” or “should” occur.
