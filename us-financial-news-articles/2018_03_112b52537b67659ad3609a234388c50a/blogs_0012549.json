The broader market correction hit about 10 months later on Feb. 2.\nFor now, the markets seem to breathing a sigh of relief.The Dow rallied 336 points to close at 24,875 on Monday on the notion that Trump may back down from the steel and aluminum tariff threat. The Dow needs to rise 5 percent to break-even.\nAccording to Paul's latest prediction, the February pullback may be just a blip compared to what's ahead.\n\"The correction is going to be huge, and I don't think anybody can predict. But I think this correction we had in '08 and '09 wasn't allowed to really go its course and restore some sensibility to the market. I think that'll be a mild correction to what could happen,\" Paul said.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
