One Reddit user said that Alexa laughed after the command, \"Alexa, patio off,\" which could sound vaguely like, \"Alexa, how do you laugh?\" Others have reported creepier occurrences like hearing Alexa giggle without any prompt.\nOn Wednesday, more users reported bizarre scenarios, leading up to a trending Twitter moment . \nSo Alexa decided to laugh randomly while I was in the kitchen. Freaked @SnootyJuicer and I out. I thought a kid was laughing behind me. pic.twitter.com/6dblzkiQHp \nâ€” CaptHandlebar (@CaptHandlebar) February 23, 2018 \"We're aware of this and working to fix it,\" an Amazon representative said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:51:24.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
