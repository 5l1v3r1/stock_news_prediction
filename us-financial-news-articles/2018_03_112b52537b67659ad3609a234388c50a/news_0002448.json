Protagonist management will host a year-end update call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Time the same day.\nConference Call and Webcast Details:\nDate: Wednesday, March 7, 2018\nTime: 4:30 PM (ET) / 1:30 PM (PT)\nUS/CANADA Toll-free: (844) 515-9178\nInternational: (614) 999-9313\nConference ID: 4054387\nWebcast URL: www.protagonist-inc.com under \"Events & Presentations\" on the Investors page of the company's website\nAbout Protagonist Therapeutics\nProtagonist Therapeutics is a clinical development-stage biopharmaceutical company that utilizes a proprietary technology platform to discover and develop novel peptide-based drugs to transform existing treatment paradigms for patients with significant unmet medical needs. Its primary focus is to develop potential first-in-class oral gastrointestinal (GI) restricted targeted therapies that block validated biological pathways currently targeted by marketed injectable antibody drugs. Our lead peptide candidates, PTG-100 and PTG-200, are oral targeted therapy drugs being developed for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The alpha-4-beta-7 integrin antagonist peptide PTG-100 is currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, and the company's interleukin-23 receptor antagonist peptide PTG-200 is currently being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers to support further development in Crohn's disease. Both alpha-4-beta-7 integrin and IL-12/23 pathway blockade are approaches that have been validated through FDA-approved injectable antibody drugs. The company has entered into a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech for the clinical development of PTG-200. Protagonist has also applied its versatile platform outside of the GI disease areas and is developing an injectable hepcidin mimetic, PTG-300, for the potential treatment of rare blood diseases such as beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). PTG-300 recently completed a Phase 1 clinical trial where we achieved a pharmacodynamic-based clinical proof-of-concept in normal healthy volunteers.\nProtagonist is headquartered in Newark, California with pre-clinical and clinical staff in California, and discovery operations both in California and Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.
