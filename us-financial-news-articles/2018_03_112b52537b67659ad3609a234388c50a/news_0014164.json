There was speculation that this had been the main motivation behind the plan.\nAfter Wall Street’s S&P 500 had put on more than 1 percent, Asia’s bourses rallied in concert overnight.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, snapping five straight days of losses. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.8 percent from a five-month low, helped too by reassurances from the head of the Bank of Japan that it would not suddenly end stimulus.\nKorean shares also erased the remainder of the hit they took after Trump’s tariff warnings last week. The country is seen as being among the most exposed in Asia due to the large amount of steel it exports to the United States.\n“Even in the face of such bad news, it shows the volume of money in the equity market that is looking for an entry point,” said JP Morgan Asset Management’s chief markets strategist for the UK and Europe, Karen Ward.\nRATE EXPECTATIONS The threat of a trade war is not the only source of tension for the world’s financial markets.\nAs the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up and lead to fast interest rate hikes.\nThe European Central Bank meets this week and looks almost certain later this year to end its three-year-old, 2.5 trillion euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus programme.\nU.S. 10-year bond yields had reared back up to 2.8888 percent on Monday and most euro zone yields - with the exception of those in Italy - were following suit with German Bunds off a five-week low at 0.65 percent.\n“The ECB is going to be presenting growth forecasts that are likely to be stronger, but will be at pains to stress that the move away from monetary easing will be delicately done,” said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho.\nThe euro traded at $1.2340, having extend its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.2154.\nIn Italy, where currency traders are keeping an eye on post-election developments as none of the three main factions has emerged with enough seats to govern alone, the country’s President, Sergio Mattarella, is expected to open formal coalition talks in April.\nEarly elections are possible if no coalition accord is found.\nThe Canadian dollar was stuck near an eight month low at C$1.2995.\nCanada is most exposed U.S. tariff threats but its central bank holds a rate meeting on Wednesday and if it keeps the door open to further hikes, the currency “is likely to be able to resist further notable depreciation,” Commerzbank said.\nIn commodities, crude prices held firm, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at an industry meeting in Houston this week.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $62.69 per barrel, up 0.2 percent following a 2.2 percent gain on Monday.
