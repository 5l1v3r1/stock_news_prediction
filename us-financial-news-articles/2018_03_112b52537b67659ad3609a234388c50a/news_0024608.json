The single currency, after a strong start to 2018, remains below the three-year peak hit in February of $1.2556.\nThe dollar, which has tended to fall when risk appetite is rising, meanwhile fell. The greenback against a basket of currencies dropped 0.1 percent.\nThe strong U.S. job growth data released on Friday was counterbalanced by slower increases in wages, resulting in money market traders sticking to bets that the Fed would raise interest rates three times this year, with only around a one-in-four chance seen for a fourth rate hike in 2018.\nHigher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars also rose, while sterling gained 0.2 percent to trade at $1.3871.\nThe yen, which tends to perform well when markets are anxious, gained as traders eyed a suspected Japan cronyism scandal involving the sale of state-owned land for its impact.\nThe name of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s wife was removed from documents regarding the issue, media said on Monday, as pressure mounted on the premier and his ally Finance Minister Taro Aso over a possible cover-up.\nMarket participants said the political developments in Japan helped temper gains in Japanese equities and lent some support to the yen.\n“The yen could strengthen if this leads to uncertainty over economic policies,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.\nThe dollar eased 0.3 percent to 106.51 yen, edging away from a one-week high of 107.05 yen set on Friday.\nThe dollar had risen against the yen last week as risk appetite improved on hopes for a breakthrough in the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.\nThe greenback also gained ground against the yen last week as fears of a global trade war receded.
