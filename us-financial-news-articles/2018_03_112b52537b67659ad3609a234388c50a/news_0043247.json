(Full disclosure: It’s entirely my fault. Also full disclosure: I am an idiot.)\nLast March, I booked a trip to Miami for me, my wife and our 2-year-old and 4-year-old children without doing even a cursory check of the local calendar. Everybody—except me, apparently—knows that March is Spring Break season. This time of year, you need to use caution in planning a beach getaway—unless you want to spend your family vacation doing Jell-O shots and keg stands, which, I don’t know, maybe you do, you lunatics.\nI learned of my screw-up a few weeks before arrival, when I got an upbeat email from a reservationist announcing that our hotel would be hosting a series of poolside events for the “Miami Winter Music Conference.”\n“Though this is a very exciting time for both our locals and tourists,” the note read, “i t tends to be a more vibrant vibe than our typical tranquil atmosphere.”\nOh dear. I knew what that meant: BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA.\nAs in the throbbing, wordless, molar-rattling, DJ-driven electronic music which forms the soundtrack for a lot of dance party fun for young people who are far cooler than me. I consider myself a reasonably hip adult—I don’t fall asleep on the couch most Saturdays until after 9 p.m.—but I would rather spend a day inside a garbage can being hit with a hammer than endure 10 minutes of BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA.\nThis was a disaster. I wrote back to the hotel, politely asking if there was some alternative situation.\nOK, that’s not true. I threw a hissy fit.\nThe hotel was apologetic and tried to make good. They offered to help us change our dates (not possible, since we’d booked air travel and it was a school vacation week for my wife, a teacher). They offered to move us to another hotel, but that proved difficult, because it was peak season, and besides, every other hotel was having its own BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA bash.\nThen the hotel offered to upgrade our family to a two-bedroom suite.\nA two-bedroom suite? You don’t say. I’d never stayed in a room that nice in my life.\nHow bad could it be? I asked my wife.\n“Bad,” she said. “You’re an idiot.”\nStill, we went. What were we going to do, stay home and freeze in the Arctic? Why not try to tough it out in the fancy suite? Had I gotten so old and cranky that I’d forgotten how to have big, noisy fun? Maybe I would love the dance party.\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, it was tranquil. You could have heard a kitten tiptoe across the lobby. We took the kids to the pool, and they were ecstatic.\nIn a corner, a sound crew worked on a speaker set, but Day One was blissfully quiet. The next day, it began around noon: BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA. It sounded like a jet engine wrestling a jackhammer.\n‘ Parents may want relaxation, but kids like action. ’\nSoon, the Spring Breakers arrived. First it was a handful, then a truckload. All the BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA didn’t faze them in the slightest. They drank cocktails from plastic cups, floated in the pool, compared sunburns and yelled at each other over the din.\nAnd here’s the thing: My kids thought it was fantastic . They couldn’t believe their luck to be at a place like this, with all these people, loud music and tattoos. Someone threw a pile of beach balls into the pool. Free beach balls!\nIt underlined a truth about family vacations: Parents may want relaxation, but kids like action.\nThe Spring Breakers, meanwhile, thought we were hilarious—the pasty parents who had brought preschoolers to a music festival. They chatted up the children, asking them about dinosaurs, animals, french fries. They were really quite sweet. There wasn’t a boorish drunk in the group. It turns out that the Winter Music Conference isn’t totally a Spring Break bacchanal—there’s an international crowd of electronic music connoisseurs who really know their BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA.\nThere’s also this: the Miami BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA world doesn’t do mornings. We had the early hours at the pool to ourselves. The young guests would trickle in around midday, groggily. The party didn’t really get going until late afternoon, and then we’d escape to the beach or go on a bike ride.\nMore Essays from Review\nSpring Break in Miami—With Our Toddlers March 23, 2018 Who Is the Real Atticus Finch?

March 16, 2018 Frankly, it was a fun vacation. And a weird relief. As a parent of toddlers, I’m used to us being the loudest, most objectionable thing in every room we walk into. When we walk into an airplane or restaurant, we’re used to the looks of horror: Please please oh please don’t sit next to me with those horrible kids.\nFor a few days, we were the quiet ones. I loved it almost as much as the cheese plate in the two-bedroom suite.\nNext week, we’re off on another family vacation, to an undisclosed warm location. I’ve made certain that it won’t be the mania of last year. But when we get to the rental car, I’ve got a little something for the stereo and my wife and kids. Just a few minutes of BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA–BOMPA. Rattle our teeth, for old times’ sake.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com\nMore by Jason Gay\nScreen Time for Kids Is Awful—And I Can’t Live Without It Are You Ready for (Even More) Football?
