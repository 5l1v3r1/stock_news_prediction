(NASDAQ:OMED), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel anti-cancer therapeutics, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“As we look ahead into 2018, OncoMed’s focus is on developing our novel anti-cancer therapeutic candidates through key value inflection points. OncoMed’s two most advanced immuno-oncology programs, anti-TIGIT and GITRL-Fc, are progressing well, and the Company is encouraged by the robust pace of enrollment in both programs. In the near-term, OncoMed will initiate the Phase 1b portion of anti-TIGIT in combination with an anti-PD1 agent, and it is the company’s current plan to present data from the on-going Phase 1a study in the 4 th quarter of 2018,” stated John Lewicki, Ph.D., President of OncoMed. “Additionally, OncoMed expects to present data from an on-going Phase 1b study of navicixizumab in the 2 nd half of 2018.”\nPipeline Highlights\nAnti-TIGIT (OMP-313M32)\nOncoMed plans to initiate the Phase 1b portion of its anti-TIGIT trial to study anti-TIGIT in combination with anti-PD1 in the first half of 2018. The Phase 1b portion of the anti-TIGIT trial is designed to assess safety and tolerability of escalating doses of the combination treatment. OncoMed continues enrollment in the Phase 1a single agent study of anti-TIGIT in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The Phase 1a study is designed to assess safety and tolerability of escalating doses. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be assessed in this study which includes a dose expansion cohort. The company’s current plan is to present data from the on-going Phase 1a study in the 4 th quarter of 2018.\nGITRL-Fc (OMP-336B11)\nEnrollment continues in the Phase 1a single agent study of its wholly-owned GITRL-Fc in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. GITRL-Fc is a fusion protein with an Fc-linked fully human trimer ligand and is designed to directly activate the co-stimulatory receptor GITR (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein) to enhance T-cell modulated immune responses. The Phase 1a study is designed to assess safety and tolerability of escalating doses. The presentation of data from this Phase 1 study is currently planned for 2019.\nNavicixizumab (anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific; OMP-305B83 )\nEnrollment continues in two Phase 1b multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and expansion studies of OncoMed’s anti-DLL4/VEGF bispecific antibody in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapies: one in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who have failed more than two prior therapies or prior bevacizumab and a second in patients with 2 nd line metastatic colorectal cancer. To date, OncoMed has enrolled over 90 patients across the Phase 1a and Phase 1b trials. In the 2nd half of 2018, we expect to publish the Phase 1a data and report interim data from the Phase 1b ovarian cancer study.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $103.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $184.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nRevenues were $38.2 million for the full year of 2017, an increase of $13.0 million, compared to $25.2 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in amortization of upfront fees from our partnership with Celgene as a result of revision of estimated period of performance. Revenues were $20.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $14.4 million, compared to $6.2 million for the same quarter in 2016.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $59.8 million for the full year of 2017, a decrease of $49.9 million, compared to $109.7 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower external research and development costs resulting from the discontinuation of dosing of all patients in our demcizumab and tarextumab programs and a decrease in internal costs due to reduced headcount following the restructuring actions in April 2017. R&D expenses were $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $15.6 million, compared to $24.2 million for the same quarter in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $16.8 million for the full year of 2017, a decrease of $2.0 million, compared to $18.8 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expenses, as a result of our reduced headcount following the restructuring actions in April 2017. G&A expenses were $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.6 million, compared to $4.4 million for the same quarter in 2016.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $39.1 million ($1.04 per share), compared to $103.1 million ($3.14 per share) in 2016. The change in year-over-year net loss was primarily due to higher collaboration revenue and lower operating expenses. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.5 million ($0.25 per share, basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of $22.3 million ($0.60 per share, basic and diluted) for the same quarter in 2016.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nOncoMed's current cash is estimated to be sufficient to fund operations through at least the third quarter of 2019, without taking into account future potential milestone payments from its partners. OncoMed estimates 2018 operating cash burn to be approximately $55 million, before considering potential milestones/opt-ins.\nCorporate Update\nAs announced in January, the Board of Directors has retained an executive search firm and initiated a search for a Chief Executive Officer. The company also announced in January that Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Sunil Patel has resigned effective March 9, 2018. As a result of these executive changes, OncoMed named Perry Karsen as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and John Lewicki as President of OncoMed. The company plans to provide an update on the CEO search once a final decision has been made.\n“We are very grateful for Sunil’s nine years of leadership, and wish him the best in all of his future endeavors. Sunil has played an instrumental role in OncoMed’s growth, and his contributions to our patients and shareholders will be carried forward in the continued advancement of our clinical programs,” commented Perry Karsen, Executive Chairman of OncoMed.\nConference Call Today\nOncoMed management will host a conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT to review fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and corporate updates.\nAnalysts and investors can participate in the conference call by dialing (855) 420-0692 (domestic) and (484) 756-4194 (international) using the conference ID# 4997704.
