The reactor began operations in 1982 with a capacity of 566 megawatts but has been shut since 2012.\nThe decision took into account factors including the cost of reinforcing work to meet new safety standards and the need to extend the reactor’s operations after a standard operating life of 40 years, the company said in a statement.\nShikoku Electric earlier decided to scrap the No.1 reactor at Ikata, while a Japanese court in December ordered the utility not to restart the No.3 reactor, overturning a lower court decision. The No.3 reactor has been idled for maintenance since October 2017 after resuming operations in 2016.\nJust five reactors are currently operating out of 40 commercially viable units. All reactors in Japan had to be relicensed following the 2011 Fukushima disaster which highlighted shortcomings in regulation.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:45:01.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
