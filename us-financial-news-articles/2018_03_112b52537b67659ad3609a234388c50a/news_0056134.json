It is close to the oil export ports of Brega and Zueitina.\nNo further details or claim of responsibility were immediately available. Some six cars were damaged by the blast, a witness said.\nThe town is controlled, as is much of eastern Libya, by forces of Khalifa Haftar allied to a parallel government based in the east.\nReporting by Ayman al-Warfalli; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:53:21.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
