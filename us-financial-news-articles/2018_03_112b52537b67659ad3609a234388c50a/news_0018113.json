The DUP welcomed the move, with member of parliament Sammy Wilson saying in a statement that the party “welcomes the commitment by the Government to make further key decisions relating to good administration in Northern Ireland.” Irish nationalists Sinn Fein, who fear that their unionist rivals may effectively govern the province through their influence on May, said the budget was “disappointing” and called for the convening of a British-Irish body created under the 1998 peace deal. “The two governments must act on their responsibilities as co-guarantors of the (1998) Good Friday Agreement which provides for a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference ... as a matter of urgency,” Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, said in a statement. “There can be no return to direct rule,” she said.
