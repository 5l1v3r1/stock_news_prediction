However, the purchase price looks quite high even after synergy effects and AXA’s debt ratio is again rather stretched,” said analysts at German brokerage Bankhaus Lampe, who kept a“hold” rating on AXA shares.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Bate Felix\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:36:43.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
