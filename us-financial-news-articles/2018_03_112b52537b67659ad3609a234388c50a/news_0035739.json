Sources familiar with the final document do not remember a similarly large penalty, she said.\nTop officials in the Trump campaign signed similar agreements, but legal experts questioned whether such an agreement would be legal for a high-ranking government employee, given constitutional free-speech protections.\nOfficials ultimately agreed to sign the agreements, in part after concluding they were likely not enforceable, according to the Post.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T01:54:31.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
