Last year a lot of investors preferred rival Dollar Tree , DLTR 1.45% as excitement built around its acquisition of Family Dollar in 2015. Dollar General’s shares fell even as it beat expectations.\nNow the scale is tipping back in its favor.\nDollar General reported an increase in same-store sales of 3.3% for the fourth quarter. Earnings per share of $1.48 on revenue of $6.13 billion met analysts’ expectations. But its 2018 outlook far exceeded them. It forecast a 9% increase in sales and sees earnings between $5.95 and $6.15 a share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $4.49 a share. It also added $1 billion to its stock buyback program. Shares were up nearly 5% Thursday afternoon.\nThat’s especially impressive given the recent performance of other retail stocks. Ross Stores ROST -0.47% ’ stock has plunged, and Walmart and Target also missed earnings estimates. And when Dollar Tree reported fourth-quarter earnings last week, the stock fell nearly 16%, its biggest tumble in nine years.\nDollar Tree’s earnings and sales both fell slightly short of expectations. More worrying for investors was the retailer’s disappointing forecast. For the first quarter of 2018, it expects earnings per share between $1.18 and $1.25, below estimates of $1.32.\nDollar Tree is essentially still paying for its acquisition of Family Dollar, investing to upgrade stores and planning to spend around $100 million this year on wages, maternity leave and employee training. Dollar Tree is facing further pressure because Walmart and Target have also increased wages and issued bonuses.\n“With unemployment so low and employees potentially getting better wages at other retailers, Dollar Tree is feeling pressured,” says Anthony Chukumba, a retail analyst at Loop Capital. “Discount retailers already pay their employees less to begin with.”\nDollar General, unburdened by a big acquisition, did much of that spending last year.\nDollar General outbid Dollar Tree for Family Dollar in 2015, but didn’t get the prize. Now, having made smart investments last year, it’s looking strong while its rival struggles with an acquisition that still needs a lot of work.", "external_links": ["https://www.barrons.com/articles/dollar-general-blame-dollar-tree-1504189753", "https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.31.min.js"], "published": "2018-03-15T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:20:39.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
