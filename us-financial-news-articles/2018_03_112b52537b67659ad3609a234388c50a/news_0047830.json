REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki Syrian government forces were also mobilising around Douma, the last rebel-held town in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor reported, piling pressure on the insurgents holed up inside to cut a similar deal.\nThe Jaish al-Islam group, which has so far refused to leave Ghouta, said Russia had yet to give an answer to proposals that involve its fighters and civilians staying in Douma, adding that a meeting was expected on Wednesday.\nRebels have been leaving other parts of Ghouta in batches with their families since Thursday, accepting safe passage to the Idlib region in the northwest after they were beaten into retreat in a fierce assault by the Russia-backed Syrian army.\nIt marks the biggest defeat for the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad since insurgents were driven from eastern Aleppo in 2016, underscoring his unassailable military position in the seven-year-long conflict.\nSome 7,000 people - most of them fighters and their families - left on 100 buses in the early hours of the morning, the Observatory said. More buses drove into eastern Ghouta ahead of a further evacuation.\n“We faced two choices: go to Idlib or make peace with the regime,” said Sakhr Yousef, a 24-year-old fighter with the Failaq al-Rahman faction as he was preparing to leave eastern Ghouta with his wife and four young siblings.\n“Making peace with the regime is very difficult, making peace with those who bombed us with criminal Russia,” he added in a voice message to Reuters, referring to Assad’s main backer in the conflict.\nThe rebels being evacuated on Tuesday are leaving from a tract of territory centred around the towns of Arbin, Ain Tarma and Zamalka that was controlled by Failaq al-Rahman rebels.\nThe last remaining insurgent-held area in Ghouta is the town of Douma. The United Nations said it is highly concerned for 70,000-78,000 people it said were trapped inside.\nThe Islamist group that controls Douma, Jaish al-Islam, is in talks with Russia that have yet to yield a result.\n“We have presented our decision to stay. This is not only a decision by Jaish al-Islam, but by all the revolutionary institutions and figures in Douma,” said Hamza Birqdar, the group’s military spokesman.\nDISPLACED PEOPLE SUBJECTED TO “SCREENING PROCESS”\nA girl looks out of a bus carrying rebels and their families as they wait to be evacuated, at Harasta highway outside Jobar, in Damascus, Syria March 25, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki Backed by Russia and Iran, the government has repeatedly forced rebels to surrender areas and withdraw to Idlib. The opposition has called this a policy of “demographic change” aimed at forcing dissidents out of Syria’s main cities.\nState television, broadcasting from the outskirts of Arbin, showed buses moving along a dusty road through a wasteland of heavily damaged buildings.\nA correspondent with Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV said it could take four to five days to evacuate the tens of thousands of people who had agreed to leave Arbin, Ain Tarma and Zamalka.\nHezbollah, a heavily armed Lebanese group backed by Iran, has fought on Assad’s side during the war.\nThe Russian news agency TASS said 13,190 rebels had left eastern Ghouta in the last three days.\nSyrian rebels and civilians look through a bus window as they leave Harasta in eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki Many tens of thousands of people have also fled eastern Ghouta this month into areas controlled by the Syrian government.\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said more than 80,000 people had left formerly besieged parts of eastern Ghouta as control shifted since March 9.\nThe displaced “have to proceed to collective shelters and are not permitted to leave, until they have undergone a screening process and are able to prove a sponsor”, OCHA said in a situation report.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned on Tuesday that the displaced people were at risk from communicable diseases and said procedures for people to leave the shelters “should be accelerated”.\n“Many children who are already extremely weak are being exposed to further health hazards like diarrhoea, lice and skin diseases. We have seen many children who had to walk many kilometres barefoot or in completely worn-out shoes,” the ICRC said in a statement.\nSyrian state TV said the army freed 28 people who had been held captive by militants in Arbin. The Observatory said their release was part of the deal agreed by rebels.\nThe Syrian military split eastern Ghouta into three separate zones during its assault that began on Feb. 18 and has killed more than 1,600 people, according to the Observatory.\nThe government says the offensive is securing Damascus from insurgent mortar fire that regularly used to hit the capital including its Old City.\nIn addition to their foothold in the northwest, anti-Assad rebels still hold a chunk of territory along the southern frontier with Jordan and Israel, and enclaves near Damascus, Homs and Hama.\nAdditional reporting Katya Golubkova and Lisa Barrington; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T13:07:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
