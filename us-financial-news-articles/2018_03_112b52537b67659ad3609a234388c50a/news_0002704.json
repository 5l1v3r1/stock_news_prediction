Last week, the Singapore-listed firm had flagged a loss of $4.78 billion to $4.98 billion for 2017.\nThe debt restructuring is crucial for the survival of the company, which has sold billions of dollars of assets, taken hefty writedowns and cut hundreds of jobs over the past three years to slash debt.
