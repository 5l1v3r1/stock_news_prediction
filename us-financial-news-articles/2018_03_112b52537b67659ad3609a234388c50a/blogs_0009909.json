U.S. Steel shares rose 5.7 percent. \nIndustrial heavyweights like Boeing and Caterpillar also fell as investors worried about higher raw material costs and trade barriers elsewhere. Boeing was down 3.5 percent and Caterpillar was down 2.8 percent. \n\"It's always a concern about what's the retaliatory response to this. Underlying all of these trade issues here, when you have trade wars, is again fueling inflation, because presumably prices are going to be higher,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \nRising inflation and bond yields were the main concerns as Wall Street ended a turbulent February on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 capping their worst months since January 2016. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 420.22 points, or 1.68 percent, to 24,608.98, the S&P 500 lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 92.45 points, or 1.27 percent, to 7,180.56. \nThe S&P 500 is down 3.7 percent since Monday's close. Thursday's fall marked its third straight day of declines, the first such streak for the index since January 2016. \nLast month confirmed a 10-percent correction for the S&P, which is still down more than 6 percent from its Jan. 26 record high. \nStocks had mostly traded lower before Trump's announcement. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tried to temper remarks he made on Tuesday that raised concerns about the potential for four interest rate hikes this year rather than the Fed's forecast of three, but New York Fed President William Dudley, speaking in Sao Paulo, Brazil, was a bit more pointed and said four rate hikes would be \"gradual\". \nBut investors said it was the tariff issue that drove the market in its afternoon selloff. \n\"The risk to imparting these tariffs is that it invites a retaliatory response from our trading partners and particularly China,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored decliners. \nThe S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and 25 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 43 new highs and 100 new lows. \nAbout 9.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.4 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. \n(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Sruthi Shankar and Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T08:53:11.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
