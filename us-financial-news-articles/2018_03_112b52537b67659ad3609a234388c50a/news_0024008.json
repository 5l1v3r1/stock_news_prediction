The connection would improve the conditions for many industries in northern areas,” Finnish Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner told a news conference.\nShe said the railway should be linked with the proposed project to build an undersea rail tunnel between Finland and Estonia.\nWith the tunnel, the railway would also connect with Rail Baltica, a link between Tallinn and Warsaw projected to be completed in 2026.\nLast month China, despite being a non-Arctic state, outlined its ambitions to develop Arctic shipping routes.\nReporting by Tuomas Forsell, additional reporting by Terje Solsvik in Oslo, writing by Jussi Rosendahl; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T22:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T19:56:13.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
