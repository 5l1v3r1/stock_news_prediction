The central banker has been a persistent critic of moving monetary policy to a more restrictive stance. When he held a voting role on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee last year, he voted against all three rate increases done in 2017.\nLast year, he argued that with inflation weak and well below the Fed’s 2% inflation target, there was simply no justification to boost the cost of short-term borrowing in the economy. What’s more, he warned that Fed rate rises were even risking tilting the economy into recession.\nAlso\nFed Official Who Bailed Out Big Banks Is Now One of Their Biggest Critics Mr. Kashkari, in his comments Friday, said his support of the latest rate increase comes down more to defending the central bank’s credibility under a new chairman, rather than a shift in his fundamental outlook.\n“If I had been sitting in the chairman’s seat, I would have raised rates because we told the markets we were going to raise rates,” Mr. Kashkari said. Boosting short-term rates “represented continuity with what the Federal Reserve said it was going to do.”\nHowever, “we have a ways to go” before achieving the Fed’s job and inflation goals, and “there’s still some slack in the labor market,” Mr. Kashkari said. And on that front, “I don’t think the data itself supports rate increases at this point.”\nMr. Kashkari was speaking as part of the Quinnipiac G.A.M.E forum in New York. They were his first public comments since the Fed put in place the first rate rise in the tenure of new Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. The FOMC boosted its overnight target rate range to 1.50% to 1.75%, and penciled in around two more increases over 2018.\nThe Fed also offered an upgraded economic outlook and said it now expects inflation will exceed the central bank’s 2% inflation target in coming years. For many observers, that outlook increases the odds the central bank may be even more aggressive with interest-rate increases over coming years.\nIn his remarks, Mr. Kashkari warned that he currently views monetary policy as about neutral in terms of its influence on the economy, saying more rate increases will likely serve as a choke on growth. The official also said that recent shifts in the bond market may be signaling to the Fed that its rate rises are becoming a drag on growth.\nMr. Kashkari said he still sees no evidence the economy is overheating. He also said that while predicting a coming economic downturn is difficult, he sees about even odds right now of an economic downturn.\nRegarding the Trump administration imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatening curbs on imports from China, Mr. Kashkari said “if there was a full-fledge trade war...it would have a dramatically negative impact on the economy.”\nWrite to Michael S.
