It will start shipping and arriving in stores this week. Consumers can buy it for $329.\nIt's all part of a new suite of products that Apple is offering the education market.\nThe new device will bring some of Apple's high-end specs, like Retina display, Pencil support and A10 Fusion chips, to a lower-end device. It will also take the iPad back to its roots with new digital book creation features: Co-founder Steve Jobs worked both inside and outside of Apple to bring computers to college campuses, and digital textbooks was one of the original use cases that inspired the creation of the iPad, according to biographer Walter Isaacson.\nJim Young | AFP | Getty Images Apple's Greg Joswiak speaks at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois on March 27, 2018. Apple hosted the Tuesday launch event at Chicago's Lane Tech College Prep High School. At the event, CEO Tim Cook emphasized the company's investments in community colleges, as well as expanded classes at Apple's retail locations through the \"Today at Apple\" program announced last year. Apple has 200,000 apps made for education, according to Apple vice president of product marketing Greg Joswiak, who discussed the iPad.\nNew apps are taking advantage of Apple's augmented reality development kit, executives said.\nBoulevard AR's app allows students to virtually walk through a museum and see artwork, while a WWF app allows students to interact with wildlife. Froggipedia allows students to dissect a virtual frog with their Apple Pencil.\nIn addition to more education-related content in Apple's augmented reality developer program, Apple is also rolling out a new software development platform, ClassKit, aimed at education.\nApple's Classroom app is also expanding to Mac, executives said. A new free app, Schoolwork, will make it easier for teachers to assign handouts and track students' progress.\nApple also announced that iCloud storage will be free up to 200 GB for the education market, and education users will get the Apple Pencil at a $10 discount.\nJim Young | AFP | Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois on March 27, 2018. Apple's \"Everybody Can Code\" program, focused on mobile apps, recently expanded to 70 more colleges, and iPad devices host Swift Playgrounds, a code education platform. Apple said it plans to expand that curriculum on Tuesday to support broader creative activities.\nBut while Apple products still get prominent placement in university bookstores, Google's low-cost Chromebooks have surged to over half of all computing devices shipped to schools. Apple didn't unveil any new Mac devices during Tuesday's keynote, despite some rumors that a lower-priced MacBook might be on the way.\nApple said in January it would fund 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai's women's education advocacy. Yousafzai was shot in the head, neck and shoulder as a teen after publicly defending women's education under Taliban rule.\nOn Tuesday, Cook also addressed recent U.S. gun control rallies at schools across the country and in the nation's capital, saying Apple has \"always believed that people with passion can change the world.\"\nApple also didn't stray from the controversy surrounding rival technology companies over privacy, noting that \"it's important to us that you understand this data stays private.\" Apple has emphasized parental control options after criticism that children were developing addictions to its tech products.\nâ€” Writing by Anita Balakrishnan, reporting by Paayal Zaveri\nWATCH: Apple's Tim Cook on FB data scandal show chapters Apple's CEO speaks out over Facebook data scandal 1:09 PM ET Mon, 26 March 2018 | 00:30", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T18:41:59.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
