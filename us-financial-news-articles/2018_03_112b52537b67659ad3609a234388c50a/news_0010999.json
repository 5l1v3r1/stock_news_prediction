If the unrealized foreign exchange loss is excluded, the Company's net profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 is expected to be approximately RMB321 million to RMB328 million, representing a year-on-year growth of approximately 128% to 133%. Such an increase was primarily attributable to a strong growth in revenue driven by implementing the Company's \"follow-the-molecule\" strategy, and efficiency enhancement of the Company's business operation.\nAbout WuXi Biologics\nWuXi Biologics, a Hong Kong-listed company, is the only open-access biologics technology platform in the world offering end-to-end solutions to empower organizations to discover, develop and manufacture biologics from concept to commercial manufacturing.
