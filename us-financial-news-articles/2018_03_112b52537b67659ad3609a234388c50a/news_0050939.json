Big data analytics — comparing information provided by large numbers of patients — give leading drugmakers indications of how medicines perform in the real world. \nThe PMO estimated the global digital health market was worth 6 trillion shekels annually and the income potential for Israel’s economy at 12 billion shekels a year. \nIsrael has 470 companies in the digital health sector. \n“We hope pharmaceutical companies will want to come here,” Groner said. “We anticipate creating a new industry of medical research here.” \nHealthcare experts say Israel’s push to harness big data for healthcare had huge potential, but also held risks in terms of privacy and medical confidentiality. \nGroner said participation in the database will remain voluntary and there will be several layers of data protection. \n“We need to get better at data protection,” Groner said but added: “No country is as adept at cyber protection as Israel.” Reporting by Tova Cohen, editing by Louise Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T17:05:28.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
