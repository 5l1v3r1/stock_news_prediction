The United States, Germany and a number of other countries have followed Britain in expelling Russian diplomats over the attack.\n“(Trump and Merkel) welcomed the coordinated action of European states and NATO allies as a strong signal of unity towards Russia’s behavior,” Seibert said.\nMerkel’s relationship with Trump got off to a frosty start after his election.\nBefore a phone conversation on March 1 to discuss the war in Syria and Russian nuclear arms, the two leaders had not spoken to each other in more than five months.\nHowever, the two leaders reaffirmed their wish for their governments to cooperate closely, Seibert said. During their phone call, the two leaders also discussed the situation in Syria and with North Korea.\nReporting by Paul Carrel, editing by Emma Thomasson and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T05:35:05.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
