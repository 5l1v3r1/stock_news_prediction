But campaigners say the country still struggles to stem the flow of migration.\nOfficials at the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection, which partially funded the film that premiered last month, said they hope the story can serve as a deterrent.\n“I hope that the film could reach the rural areas as well as where the women job seekers and the girls are originated from,” said Vennetia Danes, the ministry’s deputy head of women’s protection.\n“Indonesia which has thousands of islands and a population of 260 million people face challenges in controlling trafficking in persons,” she said over the phone from Indonesia.\nMost of the actors in the 41-minute film were trafficking victims who were domestic workers in Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan, producer Maizidah Salas said.\nThe story is also drawn from Salas’ own experience.\nA former domestic helper in Taiwan over a decade ago, her employer refused to pay her and withheld her passport. Salas was eventually arrested and deported when her work visa expired.\n“This has happened to so many Indonesians, falling victim to these false promises,” said Salas, who is also a campaigner with the non-profit Indonesian Migrant Workers’ Union.\n“I hope the film can be a more effective way in raising the awareness,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBoth the producer and the government are promoting the film in rural Indonesia, where people are vulnerable to human traffickers because there is less awareness of the problem.\nThere is no official number of Indonesian trafficking victims. Nearly half of the world’s 53 million domestic workers are from Asia, according to the International Labour Organization.\nAn Indonesian maid died in Malaysia last month in one of the latest abuse cases, angering Indonesian officials who later said she was a victim of human trafficking.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
