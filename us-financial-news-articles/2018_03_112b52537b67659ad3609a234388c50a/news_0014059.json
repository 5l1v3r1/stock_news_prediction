Anyone who takes out a private student loan, particularly those who need a co-signer, should read the promissory notes carefully, she said.\nshow chapters Student debt could hold back economic growth, Fed chief says      1:59 PM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 01:23 The bill also proposes that lenders make it easier for borrowers to get a one-time removal of a default on their loan from their credit report.\nThat is if the financial institution offers a loan rehabilitation program whereby a borrower demonstrates the ability to make timely monthly payments and the ability to repay the loan.\nUnder the terms of the proposal, the lender would have to meet certain requirements in order for the loan rehabilitation program to be considered valid. A borrower would only be able to use this option once per loan.\nWhile there is currently no requirement for lenders to provide rehabilitation programs, it is often possible to negotiate with them to clean up your record in exchange for resuming payments on the loan, Kantrowitz said.\n\"There's no formal requirement that lenders provide rehabilitation, but it is one of the informal things that happens in practice,\" Kantrowitz said.\nTalk to your lender Many borrowers make the mistake of not trying to work with lenders to alleviate issues when they arise, according to Kantrowitz.\n\"Too often borrowers don't talk to the lender,\" Kantrowitz said. \"They don't explore options for avoiding default.\"\nIf you are struggling you repay your student loans, call your lender and evaluate your options, Kantrowitz suggested.\nYou may be able to obtain a forbearance, which can suspend your obligation to make loan payments in the short term, though interest will continue to accrue.\nYou may also want to consider switching to a different payment plan, which can lower your monthly payments, though it will extend the length of the loan and consequently increase the interest you pay.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nSenate banking bill would make credit freezes free \nDear parents, your kid doesn't really care how much college costs \nThe top 10 private colleges with generous financial aid packages", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T20:55:10.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
