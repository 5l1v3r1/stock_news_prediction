REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Porsche Automobil Holding SE, which controls a 52.2 percent voting stake in Volkswagen, the world’s largest carmaker, said its board of directors would be extended from six to 10 members, allowing some fourth-generation members of the clan to gain a seat.\nHans-Peter Porsche, a grandson of VW Beetle designer Ferdinand Porsche, will resign from the supervisory board, and hand control to Josef Michael Ahorner, Stefan Piëch and Peter Daniell Porsche, the company said.\nAuto industry analyst Philippe Houchois from Jeffries said adding new blood could help spur change.\n“We believe these changes are important as they clearly maintain a balance of influence among families and they are essential to Porsche SE establishing new leadership and, eventually we think, becoming an agent of change,” he said.\nGovernance at Porsche and Volkswagen was for decades marked by an in-house rivalry between the two clans. Porsche Automobil Holding SE Chairman Wolfgang Porsche has worked to keep relations between the two families harmonious.\nOf the new appointments, Ahorner is founder and chairman of the supervisory board of the marketing platform Emarsys AG while Stefan Piech, son of Hans Michel Piech, is director of media company Your Family Entertainment AG, Munich.\nPeter Daniell Porsche is the owner of the holding company PDP Holding GmbH, Salzburg, the company said.\nThe fourth generation family members will sit on the Porsche Automobil Holding board alongside Wolfgang Porsche, Hans Michel Piech, Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Hans-Peter Porsche.\nSome clan members including Luise Kiesling, Hans Michel Piech, Ferdinand Oliver Porsche and Wolfgang Porsche also sit on the supervisory board of separately listed Volkswagen AG.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by David Evans and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T23:56:04.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
