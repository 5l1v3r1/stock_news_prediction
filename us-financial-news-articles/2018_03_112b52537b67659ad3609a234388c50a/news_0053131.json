A Dutch defense ministry spokeswoman said the two countries were looking at possible joint procurement programs, but had not yet reached any decisions. ECONOMY OF EFFORT \nSince World War Two, Britain and France have been Europe’s top military powers. However, Germany has come under increased pressure since Trump’s election to meet NATO’s defense spending target, set at two percent of member states’ annual economic output. \nThe new coalition government says it intends to meet Germany’s NATO commitments, but its agreement does not explicitly mention reaching the spending target by 2024. \nGschossmann said working together on new capabilities made sense given tight budgets and the fact that both countries needed to buy new short-range air defense missiles and radar systems, including a replacement for Stinger shoulder-launched missiles that will go out of service in the mid-2020s. \nGermany is close to completing requirements for a new very-short and short-range air defense system that could be worth around 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in the near-term, according to government sources. \nThe Defense Ministry is expected to launch a competition this summer with the goal of awarding a contract in mid-2019, Gschossmann said. \nPotential bidders include Diehl Defense, a privately held German weapons maker, whose IRIS-T missile has been modified with a dual-cab tracked vehicle built by a unit of BAE Systems for Sweden. \nFrance’s Thales systems, would also be likely to compete for the order, industry sources said. \nGermany aims to have six brigades ready for deployment by 2032, which would require close to 20 air-defense fire units to protect them, Gschossmann said. \nJoint work by the Germans and the Dutch could even extend to the United States in the future, Gschossmann said, noting that the U.S. military was also seeking to rebuild its short-range air defenses after years of cuts. \nIn the longer term, Germany and the Netherlands could jointly operate longer-range missile defense systems such as the Patriot system built by U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co, Gschossmann said. \nThat system is due to remain in use in Germany until at least 2030, he said, although Germany is also negotiating a contract for a follow-on system with Lockheed Martin Corp and European missiles maker MBDA additional reporting by Anthony Deutsch; editing by David Stamp", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T18:32:54.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
