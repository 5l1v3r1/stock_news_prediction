The Offerors expect to accept for purchase all of the Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Tender Date, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to such Tender Offers. The Offerors expect that the conditions to the Tender Offers, including the Financing Condition, will be satisfied as of the Early Settlement Date.\nThe total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of the applicable series of Notes is set forth in the table above (with respect to each series of Notes, the \"Total Consideration\") and is expected to be paid on the Early Settlement Date to the holders of Notes tendered and accepted for purchase as of the Early Tender Date. The Total Consideration includes an early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase as of the Early Tender Date. In addition to the Total Consideration, all Holders of Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on those Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to those Notes to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date.\nThe Tender Offers remain open and will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 9, 2018 (such date and time with respect to a Tender Offer, as it may be extended for such Tender Offer, the \"Expiration Date\"). No tenders will be valid if submitted after the Expiration Date. The Offerors expect to purchase any remaining Notes tendered following the Early Settlement Date that have been validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase, subject to all conditions to the Tender Offers having been either satisfied or waived by the Offerors, promptly following the Expiration Date (the date of such acceptance and purchase, the \"Final Settlement Date\"). Any acceptance of tenders of Notes following the Early Tender Date will be subject to the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the Tender Cap, the Acceptance Priority Levels and proration as described in the Offer to Purchase. The Final Settlement Date is expected to occur on the second business day following the Expiration Date, assuming the conditions to the Tender Offers have been either satisfied or waived by the Offerors at or prior to the Expiration Date.\nThe deadline for holders to validly withdraw tenders of Notes has passed. Accordingly, Notes that were already tendered at the Early Tender Date and any additional Notes that are tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date may not be withdrawn, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law.\nIf the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered by the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase does not exceed the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount, the Offerors intend to redeem certain of their outstanding securities after the Expiration Date in a principal amount equal to the excess of the Aggregate Maximum Purchase Amount over the principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers.\nDeutsche Bank Securities is acting as the dealer manager in the Tender Offers.
