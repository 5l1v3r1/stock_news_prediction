However, with prolonged consumption these symptoms may increase in severity and may include vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid or labored breathing. Should these symptoms occur, we recommend pet owners contact their veterinarian immediately.\nThe FDA informed Smucker of three illness reports and we immediately initiated a voluntary recall of the limited, impacted production.\nConsumers who have purchased the specific lots of product listed above should stop feeding it to their dogs. If consumers have questions or would like to receive a refund or coupon for replacement product, they should call us at 1-888-569-6767, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM EDT or email us by completing this form .\nNo other Milo's Kitchen速 dog treats, or any other product manufactured by The J.M.
