It also holds stakes in an assortment of lifestyle companies, including AHAVA, an Israeli skincare brand.\nOn Wednesday, Guo told investors and reporters that Fosun was looking to increase its investments in India, Africa and Portuguese-speaking countries going forward, as it diversifies its focus beyond developed markets in the West.\n“When we invest in Europe and the U.S., we set eyes on the future direction. But when we move to (invest in) India and Africa, we actually know better where they should head to.”\nThe group, like a handful of Chinese conglomerates, is also turning its sights to the domestic market amid a crackdown by Beijing on flashy and non-essential overseas acquisitions by its private conglomerates.\nIn December, Fosun and its units acquired a 17.99 percent stake in Tsingtao Brewery Co from Japan’s Asahi Group Holdings. In the same month, it sold off a Sydney office tower for A$142.5 million ($109 million) as part of its efforts to par back its foreign real estate portfolio.\nThe group has also moved to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce net debt, and balance its acquisitions with asset sales.\nIts net gearing ratio, which used to be a long-time concern among investors and analysts, fell to 49.7 percent from 60.3 percent at end-2017.\nIn January, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Fosun’s corporate family rating to Ba2, still speculative, citing the firm’s “improved business profile” and expectations that the company would maintain current leverage ratios.\nReporting by Julie Zhu; Additional reportying by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T05:59:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
