The volume traded was 13.99 billion as of the last full trading day. ** As of 04:03 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 25.20 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The Shanghai stock index is below its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving average. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Shanghai index was 14.98 as of the last full trading day, while the dividend yield was 2 percent. ** In Hong Kong, the sub-index of the Hang Seng index tracking energy shares rose 2.7 percent, while the IT sector gained 1.4 percent.
