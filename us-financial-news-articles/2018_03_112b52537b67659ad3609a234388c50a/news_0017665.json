REUTERS/Serhii Nuzhnenko The flow of illegal weapons is one of the issues Kiev is grappling with as a result of its nearly four-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed and around 1 million displaced. Volodymyr Ruban was apprehended on Thursday at a frontline checkpoint with a collection of weapons, including machine guns and explosives, the State Security Service (SBU) said, adding that it had been tracking his activities for some time.

Ruban, who is the head of a non-governmental organisation that has organised swaps of Ukrainian troops and Russia-backed separatists, could not be reached for comment. A Kiev district court ordered that he be detained for two months while the case is further investigated.
