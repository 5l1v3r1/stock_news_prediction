The increased use of premium gasoline has raised octane demand, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy in Chicago.\nSales of premium gasoline as a percentage of total motor gasoline have steadily risen since 2011, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.\nIn 2011, premium gasoline sales were 8.97 percent of total motor gasoline sales by U.S. prime suppliers, the data showed. In 2016, the most recent annual data available, premium gasoline’s market share increased to 11.52 percent.\n(For a graphic on premium gasoline's market share, see: tmsnrt.rs/2I7Xa6I )\nThe RBOB futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $0.0005 to $2.014 a gallon by 2:10 p.m. EDT (1810 GMT)\nPremium gasoline for physical delivery on the Gulf Coast traded at 6 cents a gallon above the futures contract on NYMEX, traders said. By comparison, M2 conventional gasoline traded 10.50 cents below the futures benchmark.\nIf the EPA were to ease fuel efficiency rules, manufacturers could reduce produce of vehicles with higher-performance engines, Fielden said.\n“That would increase the amount of regular gasoline versus premium and that would have a negative or neutral effect on this increase in the octane demand in the market,” Fielden said.\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2I7Xa6I"], "published": "2018-03-29T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:27:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
