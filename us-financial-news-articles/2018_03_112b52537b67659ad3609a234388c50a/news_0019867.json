REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The sovereign funds include Singapore’s Temasek [TEM.UL] and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the person said.\nDeutsche Bank is finalizing plans for the IPO of the asset management business, known as DWS, that have been a year in the making. Deutsche is expected to sell 25 percent of existing DWS shares for 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.5 billion), people close to the matter have said.\nDWS is seeking anchor investors, the person said, while it also wants to ensure the liquidity for the free floating shares.\nDeutsche Bank’s largest investors, the Qatari royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA [HNAIRC.UL], are not expected to invest in the IPO, said the person, who disclosed the potential investor base on condition of anonymity because the IPO process is ongoing.\nSpokesmen for Qatar and HNA declined to comment. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment, while the potential DWS investors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.\nThe DWS listing will mark the most tangible milestone yet in Chief Executive Officer John Cryan’s struggle to restructure the flagship German bank.\nDeutsche said in March 2017 it would list a stake in DWS as part of a broader overhaul to help the bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals.\nSome investors have raised questions about the timing of the IPO as the economic growth cycle turns and financial markets become more volatile.\nFILE PHOTO: Business magnate George Soros arrives to speak at the Open Russia Club in London, Britain June 20, 2016. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo “One of the key investor concerns regarding DWS is the question whether the asset management industry in general is at the top of the cycle,” said a second person close to the IPO.\nThe asset management industry is facing pressure on fees and rising regulatory costs, which show no signs of abating and which could limit profits for the sector.\n“Asset management is under pressure from regulators, investors and the public to perform better and charge less,” said Tom Brown, Global Head of Asset Management at consultants KPMG. “Firms need scale or to specialize to stay in the game.”\nThese potential constraints come on top of issues specific to Deutsche Bank.\n“Will DWS be able to cut costs as harshly as needed?” the second person close to the IPO said. “Will it be able to do an interesting large M&A deal given the fact that DB wants to retain control?”\nAnother concern among investors is that Deutsche Bank could dilute the price of DWS shares by selling down its stake if the bank needs to raise capital.\nThe IPO would help Deutsche to bolster its balance sheet and quell shareholder unrest over the pace of its turnaround after three consecutive years of losses. It could also possibly open the way to dividend payouts.\nA price range for the shares is expected to be announced as soon as Sunday, followed by the publication of an investor prospectus on Monday.\nThe IPO would likely take place in the week of March 19, sources have said, adding it had been brought forward hoping to lock in stock market valuations ahead of any correction.\nDWS head Nicolas Moreau, formerly with the French insurer Axa ( AXAF.PA ), has been on the road for four weeks over the past few months drumming up investor interest and plans to meet with investors again next week.\nAdditional reporting by Simon Jessop in London and Anshuman Daga in Singapore; Editing by Kathrin Jones and Jane Merriman and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T22:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:03:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
