Deutsche Bank Securities is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering of Common Stock by the Company.\nOn March 21, 2018, the Wynn Family Limited Partnership (“WFLP” and together with Stephen A. Wynn, the “Selling Stockholder”), an entity affiliated with Stephen A. Wynn (“Mr. Wynn”), sold an aggregate of 4,104,999 shares of Common Stock at a price of $180 per share in open market transactions pursuant to Rule 144 under the 1933 Act.\nAdditionally, following the Rule 144 open market transactions, on March 22, 2018, the Selling Stockholder entered into agreements to sell approximately 8.0 million shares of Common Stock in privately negotiated transactions, representing all of his remaining holdings of the Company’s Common Stock.\nOn March 20, 2018, the Company announced that its indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp. (the “WLV Issuers”), had received the requisite consents to approve an amendment to the indenture (the “2023 Indenture”) governing the WLV Issuers’ 4.25% Senior Notes due 2023. The amendment conforms the definition of “change of control” relating to ownership of equity interests in the Company in the 2023 Indenture to the terms of the indentures governing the WLV Issuers’ other outstanding notes.\nThe Common Stock being sold by the Company will be issued pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the SEC on November 8, 2016. Copies of the prospectus supplement, when available, may be obtained by visiting EDGAR on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov .\nThis press release does not and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any Common Stock, nor shall there be any sale of Common Stock in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
