Those sectors could include semiconductors and 5G wireless communications.\nThe Treasury Department had no immediate comment when contacted by CNBC.\nTrump had said last week that the tariffs he was imposing were \"the first of many\" trade actions. On Tuesday, the White House said he talked to both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron about addressing China's \"unfair\" economic and trade practices, including intellectual-property theft.\nBloomberg reported that the White House is considering using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to ban Chinese investment in some tech sectors.\nThe 41-year-old law allows the president to declare a national emergency in the face of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\nTrump has previously taken action, without invoking that law, to block takeovers of American companies involved in semiconductors and 5G wireless on national security grounds related to China.\nBoth cases were very unusual, as American presidents in the past three decades have blocked the sale of U.S. companies just a handful of times.\nIn September, Trump blocked the sale of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. after citing national security concerns. The prospective buyer was Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which is backed by China Venture Capital Fund Corporation Limited. The White House had said the venture capital fund is \"owned by Chinese state-owned entities.\"\nOn March 12, Trump blocked the buyout of chip maker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom for the same reasons. Factoring into that decision was concern that the United States would lose a competitive edge to China's Huawei in the development of 5G wireless technology.\nRead the full Bloomberg report here .\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T19:49:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
