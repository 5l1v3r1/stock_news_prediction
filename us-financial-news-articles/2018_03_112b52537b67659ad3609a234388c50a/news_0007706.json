They have now outscored their opponents by a total of 1,362 points in the third period this season.\nOtto Porter Jr. had a team-high 29 points and game-high 10 rebounds for the Wizards, who lost for just the fourth time in 14 games since John Wall sustained a knee injury.\nAfter a teeter-totter first half in which the Warriors went up by 15 in the first quarter and the Wizards rallied into a one-point lead in the second period before falling behind at the half, the Warriors took charge in the third period. Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson buried 3-pointers in the 27-14 burst.\nThe Wizards got no closer than six in the fourth quarter, including three times in the final minute.\nHowever, Curry (four) and Andre Iguodala (two) combined for six clinching free throws, capping a 25-for-30 night at the line for the Warriors.\nDurant, who had been on the losing end in six of his previous 10 homecomings, hit 12 of his 20 shots, including three of his six 3-point attempts.\nCurry had four 3-pointers among his 25 points and Thompson three among his 13, helping the Warriors improve to 4-0 since the All-Star break while sweeping the season series from the Southeast Division leaders.\nDraymond Green recorded an 11-point, game-high 11-assist double-double, and Iguodala came off the Golden State bench to contribute 14 points, The Pacific Division leaders improved to a league-best 24-7 on the road, including 12-1 against Eastern Conference competition.\nPorter connected on four of his six 3-point attempts to account for almost half his points.\nKelly Oubre Jr. had 17 points, Markieff Morris 16 and Tomas Satoransky 11 for the Wizards, who were playing the second half of a back-to-back and fell to 5-5 on such occasions.\nWashington won for the fifth time in six games when it triumphed 107-104 at Milwaukee on Tuesday night.\nWizards All-Star Bradley Beal was held to eight points on 3-for-15 shooting.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:42:13.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
