We had solid top line, gross margin, and bottom line improvement, while still being able to invest significantly in developing our Solésence finished products business,” commented Nanophase CEO and President Jess Jankowski. “We expect meaningful Solésence revenue to come on line in Q2 of 2018, which will further enhance our prospects for 2018.”\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for fiscal year 2017 was $12.5 million, vs. $10.8 million reported during the same period of 2016.\nThe net loss for fiscal year 2017 was $0.8 million, or a loss of $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.04 per share, for the comparable period of 2016.\nThe Company finished the year with approximately $2.0 million in cash and cash equivalents; which included $0.3M of short-term debt.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the fourth quarter was $2.6 million in 2017 and $2.4 million in 2016.\nThe net loss for the quarter was $0.2 million in 2017, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per share, for 2016.\nJankowski continued, “While I’m happy with these results, they have been depressed due to our increased investment in the development and marketing of our new finished products. We expect 2018 to be a signal year for Solésence, which we believe will become a major growth driver over the next several years. We believe we are well-positioned in the right markets, and our strategy is starting to show commercial results.”\nShareholders and members of the financial community are encouraged to participate in the upcoming conference call, where Mr. Jankowski will discuss the company’s current and long-term prospects.\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call\nThe Nanophase conference call, to be hosted by Jess Jankowski, the Company’s President & CEO, is scheduled for March 22, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. CDT, 11:00 a.m. EDT.
