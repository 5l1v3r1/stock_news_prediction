Inflation has gradually eased since. \nAnnual urban consumer price inflation fell to 14.4 percent in February while core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food, fell to 11.88 percent. \nTo combat inflation after the currency float, Egypt had raised its rates by 7 percentage points. \n“Domestic risks surrounding the inflation outlook include the evolution of inflation expectations, the timing and magnitude of potential subsidy-reform measures, as well as demand-side pressures,” the bank said. \nIt added: “Risks from the global economy are crude oil price developments and the pace of tightening financial conditions.” \nEgypt’s economy has struggled since a 2011 uprising drove tourists and foreign investors away. The country hopes sweeping economic reforms it embarked on in 2016 will put its economy on the right track.
