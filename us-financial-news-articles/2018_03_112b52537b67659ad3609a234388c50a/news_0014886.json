(“Alphatec” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:ATEC), a provider of innovative spine surgery solutions with a mission to improve patient lives through the relentless pursuit of superior outcomes, announced today that it has acquired SafeOp Surgical, Inc. (“SafeOp”). SafeOp is a privately-held provider of advanced neuromonitoring technology designed to prevent the intraoperative risk of nerve injury with automated assessment that obviates the need for a technician or other neuromonitoring professional in most surgeries. The Company also announced a $50 million capital raise, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the acquisition.\nAdditionally, the Company announced several leadership updates. Pat Miles has assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. Terry Rich has been appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. Both will retain their existing Board positions. Dr. Luiz Pimenta has been appointed Chief Medical Officer.\nSafeOp Acquisition\nSafeOp has developed patented technology that automates SSEP’s (Somatosensory Evoked Potentials), designed to provide surgeons with unprecedented, objective feedback during surgery.\n“This strategic acquisition of SafeOp marks a transformational moment for the new ATEC,” said Pat Miles. “Our answer to the need for better neuromonitoring is investing in technology that automates information to enable objective clinical decision making and eradicate non-critical operating room personnel. The integration of this key technology into our spine procedures will address unmet clinical needs and improve surgical outcomes in spine. We expect the combination to accelerate our business by increasing procedural revenue and driving pull-through across our entire portfolio.”\nIn consideration for SafeOp, Alphatec will pay $15 million in up-front cash, a $3 million convertible note, and the issuance of 3.3 million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 2.2 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.50 per share. SafeOp will be eligible to receive an additional 1.3 million shares of common stock, subject to the achievement of performance milestones. The issuance of the shares of common stock in the merger, including at closing, upon achievement of milestones, conversion of the notes and exercise of the warrants is subject to limitations until required stockholder approval is obtained in accordance with the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules.\nLeadership and Board Appointments\nThe Company also announced the following leadership and board appointments.\nDr. Luiz Pimenta will advise Alphatec as Chief Medical Officer. Pimenta is a world-renowned spine surgeon with over 30 years of expertise, and is widely credited with pioneering innovative surgical techniques and developing new technologies to improve spine surgery. His broad contributions have been commercialized via numerous industry partners. Dr. Pimenta will enhance the ATEC strategy by focusing on spine innovation and medical education.\nMiles continued, “I am honored and thrilled to work again with Dr. Pimenta. His decision to assume a key role in our mission is pivotal. It speaks volumes of the surgical community’s perception of ATEC’s visceral dedication to improved outcomes through eXtreme innovation.”\nRichard O’Brien, M.D., and Robert Snow, the scientific principals of SafeOp, with over 50 years of combined neurophysiology expertise will join Alphatec as executives.

Before joining Impulse Monitoring, O’Brien spent over two decades in the neurophysiology field, as both a physician and consultant. Mr. Snow, a neurophysiologist, was SafeOp’s Vice President, Marketing for 5 years, following an 11-year tenure as co-founder and Senior Vice President of Marketing at Impulse Monitoring.\n“I could not be more excited to join the ATEC family and to engage in the creation of automated tools that provide objective information for better clinical decision making,” said O’Brien.\nThe SafeOp development and integration effort will be led by Jim Gharib, an electrical engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field of neurophysiology. Gharib was the technical lead of NuVasive’s neurophysiology platform from the company’s inception to its achievement of billion-dollar revenue levels. Gharib is a named inventor on more than 20 patents in the fields of neuromonitoring, spine surgery, IV infusion, and blood chemistry.\n“I am exceptionally pleased to work again with Rob, Richard, and Jim, the new leaders of our adjunctive technology team,” said Terry Rich, President and Chief Operating Officer of Alphatec. “They each have a proven history of successfully creating value in the neurophysiologic and spine marketplace.
