Recent comments from EU officials have dampened expectations that a Brexit transition deal can be reached as soon as this month,” MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman said.\nTuesday’s falls followed a more positive Monday when a survey on the crucial services sector showing UK economic activity was solid helped support the pound.\nMichael Hewson at CMC Markets said the pound “could creep back towards the $1.3980 level”.\nWhile many analysts are bullish on the pound if a transition deal can be secured, uncertainty ahead of the EU leaders summit later this month, where Britain has said it expects to sign a deal, has kept a lid on sterling bulls.\nPrime Minister Theresa May’s landmark Brexit speech on Friday sought to convince the EU that it is in its interests to show flexibility in deciding the shape of the relationship with Britain after its exit, but markets did not see sufficient signs of progress in the talks.\nThe EU is due to give more feedback on its approach to the future relationship this week (Reporting by Tommy Wilkes Editing by Catherine Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv"], "published": "2018-03-06T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:23:02.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
