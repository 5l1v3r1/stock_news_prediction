Prior to Trump’s tariff talk some of that excess was being corrected, but his announcement took the dollar back to square one,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\nThe greenback was 0.15 percent lower at 106.065 yen, having slid for the past two sessions against the Japanese currency, which tends to gain in times of risk aversion and equity market weakness. The dollar fell to as low as 105.960 yen, its weakest since Feb. 16.\nThe euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.2276 after rising 0.6 percent overnight.\nThe common currency was still poised for a loss of about 0.25 percent this week, during which it slid to a seven-week low of $1.2154 on Thursday when the dollar was still enjoying a broad bounce.\nFocus for the euro was on the Italian parliamentary election scheduled on Sunday and how much support populist agendas could garner due to its potential impact on the European Union.\nLeading political parties in Germany also decide on a coalition deal on Sunday that would secure Angela Merkel a fourth term as chancellor.\nThe pound was effectively flat at $1.3780 after bouncing overnight from a near two-month low of $1.3712.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May will lay out her views on how to keep trade open between all of the United Kingdom and the European Union in a key speech on Friday.\nMay is due to speak just two days after the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier struck a downbeat tone on the progress of Brexit talks so far, weakening sterling.\nThe Australian dollar was steady at $0.7759 and off the two-month low of $0.7713 set on Thursday on lacklustre domestic business investment data.\nThe New Zealand dollar rose 0.3 percent to $0.7271.
