Portuguese 10-year yields fell to a more than one-month low of 1.837 percent, before inching up to 1.874 percent.\nData showing U.S. private-sector jobs increased by 235,000 in February briefly put some upward pressure on yields, coming before Friday’s closely-watched non-farm payrolls report.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve’s Lael Brainard said she had greater confidence that gradual interest rate increases were needed.\nBREATHING ROOM The Italy-Germany 10-year yield spread tightened further to 140 bps, having narrowed to pre-election levels on Tuesday, as investors appeared to put last weekend’s inconclusive vote behind them.\nThe effect on spreads and on a flat euro was minimal after former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said in a newspaper interview he would support the leader of the eurosceptic League party in attempts to form a government.\n“Spreads more broadly may have some more breathing room as the actual government formation discussions in Italy do not look set to kick off for real until later this month when parliament convenes for the first time,” ING strategists said in a note.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan Editing by David Stamp and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:07:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
