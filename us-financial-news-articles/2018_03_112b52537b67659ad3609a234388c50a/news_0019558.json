The fire, in the Tarapur industrial area in Maharashtra, began late on Thursday after a boiler containing industrial solvent burst, said an official with Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). “The fire spread quickly as neighbouring factories were also producing chemicals. People 10 km away from the spot heard blasts,” said the official said, who declined to be identified. The fire damaged six factories before it was brought under control but a few areas were still burning, said Manjunath Singe, a district police superintendent said on Twitter. Tarapur is about 125 km (75 miles) north of the city of Mumbai. The Tarapur Atomic Power Station is 20 km (12 miles) west of where the blaze occurred and was not affected by it, the MIDC official said.
