(“TRHC”) (NASDAQ:TRHC), a healthcare technology company optimizing medication safety by deploying new medication risk mitigation digital software solutions and novel, proprietary medication decision support tools, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided its 2018 financial outlook.\n“This was an exciting year for Tabula Rasa and we completed the year with another strong quarter in which both our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA results exceeded our guidance,” said Calvin H. Knowlton, PhD, TRHC’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout 2017, we expanded our leadership position in the PACE market, we made meaningful progress in the health plan and at-risk provider markets, and our integration of SinfoníaRx has progressed nicely as we continue to capitalize on abundant cross-selling opportunities and synergies.”\nDr. Knowlton continued, “Taking a look at the bigger picture, we’ve seen very promising trends from the healthcare industry and Washington as awareness of the risks associated with adverse drug events and benefits that can be achieved through targeted, personalized, effective treatment regimens increases. More specifically, our Medication Risk Mitigation™ platform directly addresses the rising epidemic of accidental opioid overdoses. Ultimately, we believe these trends will lead to numerous exciting opportunities and continued momentum for Tabula Rasa in the 2018 fiscal year and beyond.”\nFinancial Performance for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nAll comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal revenue was $43.9 million, an increase of 60.9%. Total revenue included product revenue of $27.1 million, an increase of 31.0%, and service revenue of $16.8 million, an increase of 154.6%. Product revenue increased as a result of a combination of expansion from existing clients and new clients onboarded during the year. The increase in service revenue was driven by the SinfoníaRx acquisition in September of 2017, which contributed $9.5 million and TRHC’s participation in the Enhanced Medication Therapy Management program, sponsored by the Center for Medicare and Medication Innovation, which started on January 1, 2017. Offsetting these increases was approximately $2.5 million of service revenue related to a non-recurring project completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was 32.7% compared to 34.3% in 2016. This quarter showed sequential quarter over quarter growth from the 29.5% gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, realized in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease is primarily related to the fact that the fourth quarter of 2016 was impacted favorably by a non-recurring project. SinfoníaRx, which realized a gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, of approximately 36.3% represented 21.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. TRHC maintains a longer-term gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, target of 35% to 40%.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $7.1 million compared to $4.8 million, an increase of 47.3%. The increase in Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by growth in both the PACE market and health plan market as well as a $1.7 million contribution from the SinfoníaRx acquisition, even after accounting for approximately $300 thousand of start-up costs incurred during the fourth quarter to prepare for the new contracts secured by SinfoníaRx that began January 1, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.1%, down slightly from 17.5% and was in line with guidance. As previously noted, the fourth quarter of 2016 was impacted favorably by a non-recurring project contributing approximately 2.0% to Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nNet income of $10.9 million compared to a net loss of $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Q4’17 net income was positively impacted by a gain of $7.1 million due to the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration for SinfoníaRx. The gain resulted from a slight decrease in 2018 forecasted operating results, which reduces the amount of contingent consideration that we expect to pay. The Company is forecasting approximately 40% growth in revenue for SinfoníaRx in 2018. In addition, there remain a number of active opportunities in the pipeline that could have a meaningful impact on 2018.\nNet income per diluted share was $0.55, compared to net loss per diluted share of $0.39. The net income (loss) per share calculations were based on a diluted share count of 19.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 15.4 million shares for the same period in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.09, compared to Non-GAAP Adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.10.\nCash at the end of the fourth quarter was $10.4 million compared to $5.9 million at September 30, 2017. The increase in cash was due to positive cash flow from operations. TRHC had $39.6 million available under its line of credit at the end of 2017 after paying down drawn amounts under the line of credit with $35 million of proceeds from the follow on offering in December.\nFinancial Performance for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nAll comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal revenue was $134.5 million, an increase of 43.0%. Excluding the impact of the SinfoníaRx acquisition, TRHC grew revenue by 30.2%. Total revenue included product revenue of $98.5 million, an increase of 24.0%, and service revenue of $36.0 million, an increase of 146.5%.\nGross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, was 30.4%, which represented a slight drop from 30.7%. The incremental margin driven by the growth in service revenue, including the impact of the SinfoníaRx acquisition since September 2017, mostly offset the contribution to overall margin generated by the non-recurring project in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $18.3 million compared to $13.6 million, an increase of 34.3%. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was impacted by incremental expenses related to operating as a public company for the full fiscal year of $1.4 million which were not incurred during the first 9 months of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 13.6% compared to 14.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was also impacted by the incremental expenses related to operating as a public company.\nNet income was $14.3 million compared to a net loss of $6.3 million. Full year 2016 included $6.4 million of expense related to the early extinguishment of debt, $4.5 million of interest expense and $3.5 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants and shares issued in connection with TRHC’s initial public offering. Full year 2017 net income includes incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $5.2 million related to restricted stock grants issued in connection with TRHC’s initial public offering, which was fully expensed by May 2017, the partial reversal of the valuation allowance and the impact of significant permanent tax items which resulted in tax benefits of $9.8 million as well as a $6.2 million gain related to the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nNet income per diluted share was $0.76 compared to a net loss per diluted share of $0.59. The net income (loss) per share calculations were based on a diluted share count of 18.8 million for the full year 2017 compared to 11.6 million shares a year ago.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.27 compared to non-GAAP Adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.19.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in this press release in the accompanying tables. Non-GAAP results exclude change in fair value of warrant liability, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration expense, acquisition-related expense, payroll tax expense related to stock option exercises, stock-based compensation expense, and adjustments for the partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognition of tax windfall benefits. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFinancial Outlook\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance: Revenue for TRHC’s first quarter 2018 is expected to be in the range of $42 million to $43 million. Net loss is expected to be in the range of $1.4 million to $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $4.0 million to $4.5 million. The first quarter guidance is reflective of the seasonality of the SinfoníaRx business, which generally has a lighter first quarter as the business qualifies the members that will be eligible to receive a medication therapy management benefit.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance: Revenue for fiscal year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $185 million to $195 million. TRHC expects net income in the range of $2.4 million to $6.4 million. The net income projection for 2018 does not include any tax effects related to the vesting of restricted stock issued at the time of the initial public offering in the second quarter, the amount will be dependent upon TRHC’s stock price on May 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $28.0 million to $32.0 million.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nAs previously announced, TRHC will hold a conference call with members of executive management to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance today, Monday, March 12, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET. Stockholders and interested participants may listen to a live broadcast of the conference call by dialing 844-413-0947 or 216-562-0423 for international callers, and referencing participant code 1999073 approximately 15 minutes prior to the call. A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the investor relations section of TRHC’s website ( ir.trhc.com ) and an audio file of the call will also be archived and available for replay approximately two hours after the live event for a period of 90 days thereafter at ir.trhc.com . After the conference call, a replay will be available until March 20, 2018 and can be accessed by dialing 855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406 for international callers, and referencing participant code 1999073.\nAbout Tabula Rasa HealthCare\nTRHC (NASDAQ:TRHC) is a leader in providing patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions that enable health care organizations to optimize medication regimens to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs and manage risk. TRHC provides solutions for a range of payers, providers and other healthcare organizations. For more information, visit: www.TRHC.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting all financial information required in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), TRHC is also reporting gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization expense, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus certain other expenses, which includes interest expense, provision (benefit) for income tax, depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration (income) expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, acquisition-related expense, payroll tax expense related to stock option exercises and stock-based compensation expense. TRHC defines Adjusted Diluted EPS as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock, fair value adjustments related to the remeasurement of warrant liabilities, loss on extinguishment of debt, fair value adjustments for acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition-related expense, payroll tax expense related to stock option exercises, stock-based compensation expense, and the tax impact of those items as well as adjustments for tax benefits related to the partial release of our valuation allowance and recognition of tax windfall benefits expressed on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. TRHC believes the exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of the company’s underlying operations results and trends and allows for comparability with TRHC’s peer company index and industry and to be more consistent with TRHC’s expected capital structure on a going forward basis. Please note that other companies might define their non-GAAP financial measures differently than TRHC does.\nTRHC presents these non-GAAP financial measures in this release because it considers them to be important supplemental measures of performance. TRHC uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and determination of appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. TRHC believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's financial and operational performance. TRHC also intends to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of the company's future earnings discussions and, therefore, their inclusion should provide consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures provided in this release, including in the accompanying tables.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements that we believe to be reasonable as of today’s date.

calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS for periods with a non-GAAP net loss because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect.\n(2) In computing Adjusted Diluted EPS, net income attributable
