In light of the successful consummation of those transactions, its distribution of a substantial portion of the net proceeds from those transactions, and its desire to cease operations, Actua’s Board has recommended that Actua wind down its operations, monetize its remaining holdings and other assets and enter into a formal plan of dissolution. The Board has unanimously determined that the plan of dissolution is advisable, and encourages Actua stockholders to vote to approve it.\nThe special meeting of stockholders is scheduled to be held on April 18, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET at The Radnor Hotel, 591 East Lancaster Avenue, St. Davids, Pennsylvania 19087. Actua stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2018 will be entitled to vote their shares at the special meeting either in person or by proxy.\nFor more information on the definitive proxy materials and the special meeting of stockholders, please go to www.actua.com and look for the icon labeled “Special Meeting of Stockholders.”\nSafe Harbor Statement under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThe statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
