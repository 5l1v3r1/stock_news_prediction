Food and Agriculture Organization and the Paraguay government, will support a shift to sustainable forest management to reduce tree loss and improve quality of life for some 17,000 families, many of them indigenous, in eastern Paraguay.\nThe effort received a $25 million GCF grant.\nSwedish diplomat Lennart Båge, one of two new board co-chairs appointed this week, said the adoption of the indigenous people’s policy and another on environmental and social considerations was an“important step” toward completing the policy framework of the fund, which began allocating cash in 2015.\nThe GCF now has a portfolio of 76 projects and programs, to which it has committed about $3.7 billion. The fund aims to help countries develop on a low-emission and climate-resilient path, although the vast majority of the cash has yet to reach the ground.\nThe new projects approved at the meeting that ended on Thursday include efforts to build water resilience in Grenada and Barbados and set up financial instruments for energy-efficient cities in Brazil.\nThey also include a credit line for rooftop solar systems in India, a clean cooking program in Bangladesh, and help for rural communities in northern Rwanda to overcome climate pressures.\nThe board meeting this week delayed a decision on adopting an updated policy on gender equality and social inclusion after board members from three countries - Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Cuba - raised objections over its wording on sexual orientation.\nThere was also a call to insert language so that application of the policy would depend on a country’s stance on the issues, observers said.\nCivil society groups were concerned that allowing such caveats could set a bad precedent, enabling national agencies to ignore gender balance and the interests of LGBT or disabled people in their GCF-funded work.\n“That is basically a slap in the face in terms of an acknowledgement that human rights and women’s rights apply internationally and in the same way,” said Liane Schalatek, associate director at the Heinrich Boell Foundation North America, who was at the board meeting.\nThe fund already has an interim gender policy, and there have been practical moves to apply that, such as requiring a new private-sector project that aims to help African farmers adapt to climate change put in place a plan to ensure it reaches both women and men.\nReporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Laurie Goering.
