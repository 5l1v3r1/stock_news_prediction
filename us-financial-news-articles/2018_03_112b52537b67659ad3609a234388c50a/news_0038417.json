PMV Pharma is developing first-in-class p53 and p53 pathway modulators for the treatment of cancer. Bringing together leaders in the field to utilize over three decades of p53 biology, PMV Pharma combines unique biological understanding with pharmaceutical development focus.\nCancer cells often have mutations in p53 that enable them to escape death. PMV Pharma's unique mechanism of action promises to restore p53 to its normal function, eliminating this escape route and selectively killing the mutant cancer cells without affecting normal tissues. The protein plays a pivotal role in the body's natural defense mechanism against cancer and induces a highly-organized program of cellular death to prevent the proliferation of potentially cancerous cells.\nPMV Pharma is headquartered in Cranbury, New Jersey. The Company has raised over $100 million since its founding in 2013 through investments from Topspin Biotech in association with Euclidean Capital and OrbiMed Advisors and from founding investors InterWest Partners and Osage University Partners.\nContact:\nDavid H.
