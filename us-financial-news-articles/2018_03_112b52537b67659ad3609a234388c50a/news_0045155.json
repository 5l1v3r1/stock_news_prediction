The New York Yacht Club was founded in 1844.\n“American Magic builds on the legacy of those two yachts,” said Philip Lotz, commodore of the New York Yacht Club, in a statement.\n“The name embodies the mission of our campaign, which is to win the Cup and in the process build the foundation for a stronger competitive sailing culture in the United States.”\nThe team expects to establish its primary base in Newport, Rhode island.\nThe 36th edition of the America’s Cup is set to be sailed off Auckland in fully foiling 75-foot monohull boats, a departure from the catamarans used during the 2017 competition in Bermuda.\nNew Zealand crushed Oracle Team USA last June with a stunning 7-1 victory in Bermuda’s Great Sound.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T18:20:16.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
