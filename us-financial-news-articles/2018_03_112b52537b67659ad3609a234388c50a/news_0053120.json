The company also consults with government and economic development organizations and is a leading provider of economic impact modeling services.\nBased in Cleveland, Silverlode works across all industries and serves companies ranging in size from middle market to Fortune 100, as well as local, regional, and state government and economic development organizations.\n\"We are very pleased to join forces with GBX Group whose unique strengths complement our own,\" said Silverlode President Dennis McAndrew. \"Linking our firms opens up tremendous opportunities for our clients.
