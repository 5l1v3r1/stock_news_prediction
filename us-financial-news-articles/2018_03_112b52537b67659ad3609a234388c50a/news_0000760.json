DNZOY, +0.85% and Aisin Seiki Co. 7259, -2.93% will create a new Tokyo-based company, called Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development and invest 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) into it. A Toyota spokesman declined to say over what time period the investment would be made. The company will start with around 300 employees and aim to grow to around 1,000. \nThe new company’s goal will be to create autonomous-driving software of sufficient quality to be used passenger vehicles. \nToyota is nearing a self-imposed deadline of 2020 for selling cars that can pilot themselves on freeways, with city-street capability a few years later. The new company will try to bridge the gap between researchers at the Toyota Research Institute in California and the engineers who design the vehicles in Japan, said Jean-Yves Jault, a Toyota spokesman. \nThe company will be led by James Kuffner, now the chief technology officer at Toyota Research Institute in California.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T17:06:01.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
