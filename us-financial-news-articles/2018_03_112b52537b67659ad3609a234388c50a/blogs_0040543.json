The layoffs are part of Meredith's plan to cut $400 to $500 million in costs following its $2.8 billion acquisition of Time in January. \n\"These are attractive properties with strong consumer reach. However, they have different target audiences and advertising bases, and we believe each brand is better suited for success with a new owner,\" Meredith President and CEO Tom Harty said in a statement. \nMeredith boasts reaching nearly 80 percent of millennial women with publications, like Country Life, Better Homes and Gardens and Woman's Weekly. Its roster also includes 17 television stations. Its content primarily focuses on entertainment, food, lifestyle, home, parenting, beauty and fashion.
