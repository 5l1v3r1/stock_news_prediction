The Company also announced today that it has increased the maximum aggregate consideration (excluding accrued interest) that may be paid by the Company in the Tender Offers to $1,604,148,900 (the “Aggregate Purchase Price”), subject to the Acceptance Priority Levels and the Acceptance Sublimits described above.\nThe Tender Offers will be funded using available cash on hand and the net proceeds of the Company’s previously announced private offering of $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.500% Second Lien Secured Notes due 2026 (the “Second Lien Notes”). The settlement of the Second Lien Notes occurred on March 19, 2018.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers, holders who tendered their Notes on or prior to the Early Tender Date and whose Notes are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable total consideration set forth in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes purchased pursuant to the Tender Offers (the \"Total Consideration\"), which includes an early tender premium of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (the \"Early Tender Premium\"). In addition to the applicable Total Consideration, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date will receive accrued and unpaid interest on their Notes purchased from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date.\nThe aggregate amount of Total Consideration relating to the Notes tendered as of the Early Tender Date exceeded the Aggregate Maximum Consideration, which has the following consequences based on the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers:\nall of the 8.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “8.875% Notes”) that were tendered as of the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date; all of the 6.250% Senior Notes due 2021 that were tendered as of the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date; all of the 9.250% Senior Notes due 2021 that were tendered as of the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date; all of the 8.500% Senior Notes due 2020 that were tendered as of the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date; none of the 8.750% Senior Notes due 2022, 10.500% Senior Notes due 2022 or 7.125% Senior Notes due 2023 will be accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers; and no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date and prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below) will be accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers.\nAny Notes tendered but not accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will be promptly credited to the account of the registered holder of such Notes with The Depository Trust Company and otherwise returned in accordance with the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal and Consent.\nAlthough the Tender Offers are scheduled to expire at 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on April 2, 2018, because holders of Notes subject to the Tender Offers validly tendered and did not validly withdraw Notes on or before the Early Tender Date in an amount that exceeds the Aggregate Purchase Price, the Company does not expect to accept for purchase any tenders of Notes after the Early Tender Date.\nIn conjunction with the Tender Offers, the Company also solicited (the “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the 8.875% Notes consents to proposed amendments (“Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the 8.875% Notes (the “8.875% Notes Indenture”), to eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants, certain events of default and certain other provisions contained in the 8.875% Notes Indenture. The adoption of the Proposed Amendments required the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of 8.875% Notes (the “Requisite Consents”). Each tendering holder of 8.875% Notes was deemed to have consented to the Proposed Amendments. As of the Early Tender Date, the Company had received the Requisite Consents and the Company will execute a supplemental indenture to the 8.875% Notes Indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) on the Early Settlement Date. The Supplemental Indenture will be effective upon execution thereof by the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for the 8.875% Notes Indenture, and the Proposed Amendments will become operative when the Company purchases in the Tender Offers at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 8.875% Notes on the Early Settlement Date.\nFull details of the terms and conditions of the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation are described in the Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal. Holders of the Notes are encouraged to read these documents, as they contain important information regarding the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.\nThe Company has retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to act as the Dealer Managers for the Tender Offers and Solicitation Agents for the Consent Solicitation and Ipreo LLC as the Tender Agent and Information Agent for the Tender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.
