I arrived at the course 25 minutes before my tee-time.\n“The adrenaline didn’t help. After hitting 10 balls on the range, I told my caddie that I had to stop because I was nervous. Delhi’s traffic is quite tough. I got lucky that we didn’t have traffic.”\nManassero made the turn in 36 but then came to life on the front-nine with birdies on the first, third, fourth and sixth before a ten-foot putt on the seventh briefly gave him a share of the lead.\nHe dropped a shot on the next but regained it on the ninth to stay in contention after finishing third last year.\nIndia’s Shubhankar Sharma, who will make his major debut at next month’s U.S. Masters after finishing tied-ninth at the WGC-Mexico Championship, started poorly but recovered on the front-nine with four birdies to sit eight shots off the lead.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:34:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
