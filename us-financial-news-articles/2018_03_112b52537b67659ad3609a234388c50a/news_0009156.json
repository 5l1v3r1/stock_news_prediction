Manning said air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State had not been affected and the SDF continue to hold territory taken back from the militant group.\nWhile much of the fighting against Islamic State has moved to small pockets, the United States still needs the YPG to hold territory, ensuring that the Islamist militant group does not re-emerge.\nMajor Adrian Rankine-Galloway, another Pentagon spokesman, said the U.S. military had seen SDF fighters leave the fight against Islamic State.\n“Some fighters operating within the SDF have decided to leave operations in the middle Euphrates river valley to fight elsewhere, possibly in Afrin,” Galloway said.\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hundreds of SDF fighters had left the middle Euphrates river valley in the past two weeks.\nTurkey has been enraged by U.S. support for the YPG, which Ankara views as a terrorist organization. Washington has backed the YPG in the fight against Islamic State in Syria.\nLast week, U.S. Army General Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command, said Turkish activity in Afrin was distracting from the fight against Islamic State.\nThe United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Feb. 24 demanding a full month-long ceasefire across Syria excepting only groups that it had designated as terrorists.\nTurkey has said the ceasefire resolution does not apply to the YPG and has rejected Western calls for it to implement the truce.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:13:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
