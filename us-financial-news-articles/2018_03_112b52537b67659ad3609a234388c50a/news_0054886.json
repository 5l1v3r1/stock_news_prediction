Sisi said he had nothing to do with opposition candidates pulling out, and has urged people to vote in great numbers. The election commission pledged the vote would be free and fair. \nIn Cairo, some voters found it hard to voice enthusiasm. \nMostafa Abdel Kader, a 35-year-old delivery man, said he did not vote because there were no choices and he was “unhappy with the situation of the country”. \nHe expressed anger at some Sisi loyalists distributing food to persuade people to cast their ballots, saying he would not vote “for a box of food”. \nHussain al-Sayed, a 53-year-old tailor, did vote, although without much enthusiasm. “Sisi will win anyway, there is no one else ... we hope he is right. At least if we don’t see change, our children will.” \nSisi, who led the military overthrow of freely-elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013, has promised security and stability and to revive the economy after unrest that followed a 2011 popular uprising. INCENTIVES \nSome voters interviewed by Reuters over the first two days of polling said they had been offered money, boxes of food, and services to cast their ballots.

Employees at the institution were told to “not come back without ink on their fingers” and had their hands inspected the next day, the employee said. \nAsked for comment, the presidency spokesman said this was not a matter for the presidency to address and referred Reuters to the National Election Commission and spokespeople for the presidential campaigns. \nOfficials at the election commission and the government’s foreign press centre did not respond to calls and Whatsapp messages requesting comment. \nSome people needed no inducement to vote. Noha al-Nemr, voting in Cairo’s middle-class Mohandiseen district, said: “I voted for Sisi of course, because it’s enough that because of him, my family and I live in safety - even if there’s hardship.” \nIncentives for voting were made more public in other areas. \nIn Beheira province, governor Nadia Abdou told Mehwar private TV channel on Monday: “Whichever municipality has the most votes, we will fix their water, sewage and electricity ... We will reward those people who came out in large numbers.” Slideshow (4 Images) \nPro-government media portrayed failure to vote as a betrayal of Egypt. \nHosts of state-run radio programmes told listeners that if they did not vote, they would be “betraying the blood of the martyrs in Sinai”, a reference to a military campaign against Islamist militants in the northern Sinai Peninsula.
