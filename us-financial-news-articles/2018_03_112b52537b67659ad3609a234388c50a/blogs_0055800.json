Ryan Dillon said Islamic State still held territory at two locations in Syria – near Hajin along the Euphrates River and at Dashisha near the border with Iraq. \nHe said coalition offensive operations had been limited as a result of events in northwest Syria, where the SDF and YPG have been fighting a Turkish incursion targeting the YPG in the Afrin region. \n“The coalition and the SDF continue to find opportunities to exploit ISIS weaknesses and conduct strikes against the remaining terrorists,” he said.
