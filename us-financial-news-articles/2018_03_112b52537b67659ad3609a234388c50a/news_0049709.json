All three report to head of fixed income and currencies sales and trading Ram Nayak.\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment.\nWisnia joined Deutsche in November 2014 from private equity firm DMC Partners and previously worked as head of macro structuring at Goldman Sachs. A report said Wisnia would be joining Eisler Capital, a hedge fund set up by former Goldman and DMC colleague Edward Eisler.\nEisler Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast May Wisnia was appointed to his current position, with Askar, Tinker and Lascala all reporting to him. It is understood that Wisnia will not be replaced immediately. Wisnia was also on the corporate and investment bankâ€™s executive committee.
