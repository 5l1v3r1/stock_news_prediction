Mexican infrastructure, real estate and automotive stocks also climbed, fueled by hopes that talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) could edge closer to a conclusion after dragging on longer than expected. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday said that talks with Canada and Mexico were \"starting to converge\" on auto content requirements, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a successful renegotiation was likely. The peso was up nearly 2 percent, far outpacing gains among other Latin American currencies. In a report, Grupo Banorte cited \"speculation of a looser stance and the prospect of a swift agreement\" as driving sharp gains. Mexico's benchmark S&P/BVM IPC stock index jumped around 1 percent on a day when MSCI's emerging market index was nearly flat. The market advances suggest that concerns are fading that U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist leanings could threaten Mexico, which sells around four-fifths of its exports to the United States. Shares of auto parts maker Nemak SAB de CV and its controlling shareholder Alfa SAB de CV rose around 4 percent, putting them among the top IPC gainers. Optimism over the NAFTA talks outshone a cautious stance in broader emerging markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon raised interest rates and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018.
