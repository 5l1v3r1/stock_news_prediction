Leger has been an innovator in marketing helping fast-growing global companies scale for more than 20 years. He will be responsible for overseeing Checkmarx's worldwide marketing organization.\n“Bernd’s strong track record in helping companies manage hyper-growth and disrupt their markets, combined with a deep understanding of security marketing, a global background and a results-driven mentality is the perfect fit at Checkmarx,” said Emmanuel Benzaquen, CEO of Checkmarx. “Bernd’s leadership will be instrumental as we continue on our path of enabling companies to bring their products to markets faster with security built-in from the start.\"\nBefore joining Checkmarx, Leger was the CMO of CloudLock, a leading provider of cloud access security broker (CASB) solutions. After the company was acquired by Cisco in August 2016 for $293 million, Leger stayed on board to serve as the head of product marketing and insights in Cisco’s Cloud Security Business Unit. At CloudLock, he was instrumental in positioning the company as a leader in the CASB space and helping drive the culture that led to the company being named one of the three best places to work in the U.S. by Glassdoor. In addition, Leger has held vice president of marketing positions at mobile engagement platform provider Localytics, security companies Rapid7 and Veracode as well as IT software solution provider Oblicore and managed service provider Navisite. Five of the organizations that he has held leadership positions in have been named “Best Places to Work” and were listed on the Inc. 5000 of fastest growing companies.\n“The application security space is going through a rapid transformation as more companies are adopting continuous integration and development strategies,” said Leger. “This transformation requires a fundamentally different approach to security that focuses on speed, flexibility and developer enablement without disrupting the core business goals of the organization. No one in the market is better positioned than Checkmarx to help them manage this massive transformation.”\nA native of Germany, Leger has been living in the Boston area with his family for the past 20 years. He earned an MBA from the University of Munich and has completed studies at Georgetown University.\nAbout Checkmarx\nCheckmarx is an application security software company, whose mission is to provide enterprise organizations with application security testing products and services that empower developers to deliver secure software faster.
