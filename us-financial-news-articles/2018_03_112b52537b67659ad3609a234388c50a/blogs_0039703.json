She previously worked at Donna Karan International, also leading the company's accessories and footwear departments. \n\"Anna's focus on product innovation — notably in the key categories of accessories and footwear — will be a key pillar of the Kate Spade growth strategy,\" Luis said. \nIn acquiring the Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands, Tapestry aims to amass a portfolio of names with global reach, selling not just handbags but apparel and other lifestyle accessories. \nThe parent company of late has focused on gaining more control of its distribution overseas. It reported holiday sales results that exceeded analysts' expectations, a sign that the turnaround efforts are working. \nTapestry shares are up a little more than 17 percent this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T15:59:22.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
