REUTERS/Stefanie Loos Enders told shareholders last month he still held the reins and sought to address concerns about continuity as a raft of industrial executives prepare to leave or retire from Airbus.\nIt remains unclear who will succeed Enders in 2019. Although Airbus officials insist that should not be an issue until later this year, industry sources call it a potential distraction.\nThe main internal candidate is Guillaume Faury, a French citizen and the former helicopter unit chief who recently replaced Ender’s previous No. 2 Fabrice Bregier.\nBut the board is also expected to examine fresh blood such as Thales ( TCFP.PA ) CEO Patrice Caine, two industry sources have told Reuters.\nLe Figaro newspaper has also identified former Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) chief Alexandre de Juniac, currently head of the International Air Transport Association, as a contender.\nSome German company officials, including Airbus defense chief Dirk Hoke, have also been named as possible successors.\nReporting by Rene Wagner and Andrea Shalal; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Paul Carrel and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T12:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T12:52:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
