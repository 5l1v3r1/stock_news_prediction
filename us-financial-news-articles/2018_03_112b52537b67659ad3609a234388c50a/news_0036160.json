The airline had previously expected a revenue increase of 1 to 2 percent.\nShares were down more than 5 percent in late-morning trade.\nRevenue trends outside peak demand periods, such as holidays, \"have been below the company's previous expectations primarily due to the competitive fare environment that continues to pressure passenger revenue yields,\" Southwest said in a filing.\nIt also blamed a \"sub-optimal\" first-quarter flight schedule on the retirement of its Boeing 737-300 fleet, which it is replacing with Boeing's new 737 MAX line, a more fuel-efficient model.\nSouthwest said it still expects to grow revenue per seat mile in 2018.\nFare wars are a core concern of airline investors, who worry that despite strong travel demand airlines will have to continually lower prices in order to compete.\nThe United effect Competitor United Airlines ' aggressive growth plan to expand service 4 to 6 percent might be having an impact, said Cowen & Co. That plan spooked investors when it was announced, sparking fears of a fare war.\n\"We suspect the [Southwest guidance] reduction is a direct result of United's domestic capacity expansion plans,\" it said in a note.\nUnited and Southwest have a lot of overlap in each other's hub cities such as Denver, Chicago and Houston.\n\"We expect the shares to be down today on the guidance reduction led by weakness\nduring off-peak travel periods which screams United's strategy negatively impacting the\nbusiness in the near-term,\" said Cowen.\nShares of all large U.S. airlines fell. United shares were down around 1 percent, American and Alaska shares were each down about 3 percent, and Delta was off more than 2 percent in late-morning trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T16:05:37.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
