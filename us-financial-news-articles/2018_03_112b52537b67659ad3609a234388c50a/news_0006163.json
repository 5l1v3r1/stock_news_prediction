Rehabilitation of five of the six affected villages has been completed,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAlmost 2,000 hectares of land, of which a third is forest, have been flooded, said Jiten Yumnam of the Center for Research and Advocacy Manipur, an indigenous rights organization.\nAbout 8,000 people in half a dozen villages are directly affected, with buildings and fields inundated by rising waters, he said.\nAs the Thoubal River dried up, thousands more lost their livelihoods, including fishing and collecting and selling sandstone that used to be washed downstream, according to Yumnam.\nThe dam has an annual irrigation potential of about 33,000 hectares, and will increase the drinking water supply to the state capital Imphal and surrounding areas by more than 45 million litres a day, according to a government audit.\nThe project will generate 7.5 megawatts for rural electrification.\nYumnam said authorities did not assess the dam’s impact on the environment and residents, who he said were not consulted.\n“We should not proceed with this until we can be sure of its impact,” he said.\nHe added that a petition against the dam is still pending before the National Green Tribunal, a government body that deals with conservation cases.\nOf nearly 600 ongoing conflicts over land affecting nearly eight million people in India, more than a fifth relate to infrastructure projects, according to Land Conflict Watch, an Indian research organization.\nAt least a dozen conflicts relate to hydroelectric dam projects, its data showed.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
