After the intervention, it traded at 118.1, Reuters data showed.\nSo far in 2018 the central bank, which operates a managed float of the dinar against the euro, has sold 180 million euros and purchased 150 million to keep the local currencyâ€™s exchange rate in check.\n$1 = 0.8185 euros Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Ivana Sekularac\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:16:53.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
