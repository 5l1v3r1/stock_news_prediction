As a U.S. diplomat, I was reporting back to Washington on the unfolding political situation. The streets of al-Midan began to fill around 1 p.m. as Friday prayers concluded and hundreds of worshipers went straight from their local mosques to the al-Hassan mosque, a common protest location. \n“The Syrian media lies, lies, lies,” the crowd thundered in unison, before security forces began beating the protesters. I saw unconscious demonstrators lying in pools of blood. Some in the crowd were filming with smartphones. The security forces soon spotted them and headed right for where I was standing. We ran for our lives. My heart was pounding as I scurried through the old streets. I heard gunfire but didn’t stop to look back.\nI learned a valuable lesson that day: The Syrian regime does not want anyone documenting its systematic abuses. Documentation is a serious threat to a regime that thrives on promulgating false narratives.\nPhoto: istock/getty images More recently, as a U.S. diplomat to the United Nations, I regularly saw deeply troubling images presented to the Security Council from conflicts in Burma, Syria and elsewhere. Unfortunately, in most cases the council wouldn’t act. Some members argued that images and videos from the brutal chemical attacks in Syria in 2013 and 2017 couldn’t be verified, and therefore the truth of what happened couldn’t be established. Unfortunately, these members succeeded in preventing international action and ensuring that bad actors can continue violating international norms. \nTechnological advances now make it possible to disseminate images and videos around the world in seconds. Journalists and observers can send authenticated, encrypted digital media over local cellular networks or high-speed internet connections. Device sensor data can verify precisely where a photo or video was taken, and the blockchain can ensure its integrity in perpetuity. All of this information can be stored securely in the cloud. \nIn Syria, civic groups and international organizations such as the Syrian American Medical Society are using these tools to document events far worse than anything I witnessed. Their goal is to highlight and preserve the truth. Their efforts will make it harder for the regime to hide its crimes and more difficult for the international community to ignore them. \nThe ability to authenticate the provenance of digital media could do more than enable documentation of atrocities. It could help international efforts to monitor elections, fight fraud, audit supply chains and enforce anticorruption measures. It could also provide a defense against new technology that lets users manipulate and doctor videos in a way that looks real. \nImage authentication is not a silver bullet and won’t prevent conflict from happening, but it may improve the speed of the international response to crises when they occur. It may also help bring accountability to rogue regimes and justice for their victims. \nMr. Ibrahim is vice president of strategic initiatives for Truepic and a former U.S. foreign service officer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T09:48:36.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
