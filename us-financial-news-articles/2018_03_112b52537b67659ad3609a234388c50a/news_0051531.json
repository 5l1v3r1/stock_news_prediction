General Dynamics is hoping that CSRA will help it grab more of the recently increased U.S. defense budget.\nWhile CACI has been trying to scale up through acquisitions, General Dynamics expects a deal with CSRA to help grab more of the U.S. defense budget.\nInformation technology and services spending by the Department of Defense is down sharply over the past few years but is expected to pick up as President Donald Trump seeks to bolster military spending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T22:35:27.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
