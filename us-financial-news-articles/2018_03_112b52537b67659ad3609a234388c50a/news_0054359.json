(Nasdaq:STAF), (“STAF 360” or “the Company”), a staffing solutions company executing an international buy-and-build strategy in the U.S. and the U.K., today announced audited financial results for the fourth quarter (“Q4 2017“) and year (“FY 2017“) ended December 30, 2017. Financial results for both reporting periods include the full impact of the two acquisitions, CBS Butler Holdings Limited in the U.K. and first PRO Georgia in the U.S., completed in September 2017.\nQ4 2017 vs. Q4 2016 FY 2017 vs. Comparable 2016 Q4 2017 Change FY 2017 Change Revenue $59.5 million +29% $192.7 million +6% Gross profit $11.9 million +50% $36.7 million +16% Gross margin 20% +280bps 19.1% +170bps Net loss * $7.5 million NM $18.5 million NM Adjusted EBITDA $2.8 million +130% $7.4 million +46% Pro forma adjusted EBITDA $10.9 million * Net loss for both reporting periods include certain one-time charges (for more details see discuss below and our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 2018).\nBrendan Flood, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “2017 marked a major turning point in the evolution of the Company. We expanded our global presence, both organically and via acquisitions, refinanced and streamlined our balance sheet, positioned the Company to generate positive cash flow beginning in 2018, and advanced towards our goal of becoming a $500 million revenue company within the next two years. More immediately, these initiatives allowed us to report record revenue, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year.”\n“We started 2018 on a very strong note. Since the beginning of the year, we have engaged new clients, signed up new contracts, expanded our sales team and expanded to new locations. Following the reorganization of our business segments, we have set a number of internal goals and initiatives designed to drive organic growth, further improve margins and productivity per employee, remove duplicated overhead, and develop a stronger sense of unity across each business unit.”\nDavid Faiman, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “The refinancing of our balance sheet and the M&A transactions which we completed during 2017 have fortified our capital structure. We remain committed to our goal of achieving sustainable, profitable enterprise-wide growth, beginning in 2018.”\nThe results for Q4 2017 and FY 2017, are as follows:\nQ4 2017 revenue was $59.5 million (including $17.7 million from acquisitions), an increase of approximately 29% from the $46.1 million reported in the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, revenue increased by $11.2 million, or 6%, to $192.7 million from $181.5 million reported in 2016. The increase was mainly due to $24 million of revenue generated from the acquisitions of CBS Butler Holdings Limited and first PRO Georgia, offset by $1.5 million attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation and the $4.5 million impact of low margin business that we exited during the year, as previously discussed. Q4 2017 gross profit improved to $11.9 million, a 50% increase from gross profit of $7.9 million reported in the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, gross profit increased by $5.2 million, or 16%, to $36.7 million from gross profit of $31.6 million reported in 2016. Q4 2017 gross margin improved to 20% from 17.2% for the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, gross margin increased to 19.1% from 17.4% in 2016. The gross margin improvement, for both reporting periods, was due to exiting specific low margin business, the acquisition of two higher margin businesses, the strengthening of our permanent placement business, and the continued safety improvements we’ve realized within our Commercial Staffing business. Q4 2017 net loss was $7.5 million, which included $6.9 million of non-cash costs, a $1.4 million credit for non-recurring transactions and $0.8 million associated with the Company’s reorganization, as compared to a net loss of $1.4 million in the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, net loss was $18.5 million, which included $18.3 million of non-cash costs, $2.1 million of acquisition-related and non-recurring charges and $0.8 million associated with the Company’s reorganization, as compared to a net loss of $7.6 million reported in the prior year. The company took a one-time, non-cash, impairment of goodwill charge of $4.8 million related to its PeopleSERVE operation, and $6.1 million of non-cash debt extinguishment costs mostly related to the September 2017 refinancing, both of which are included in the $18.3 million number above. Certain non-cash adjustments have required a restatement of the results of Q3 2017. The filing of this revised Form 10-Q is expected on or before April 20, 2018. These adjustments are included in the full-year numbers that were pre-announced on March 19, 2017. None of these adjustments result in a net impact to cash or cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. These non-cash adjustments do not relate to the Company’s operating performance or impact the key corporate performance metrics used by the Company, including total and segment revenue and gross profit or non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA, nor do these adjustments impact the determination of compensation for the Company’s senior management. Q4 2017 adjusted EBITDA is $2.8 million, an increase of greater than 130% as compared to $1.2 million in the same period of 2016. FY 2017 adjusted EBITDA is $7.4 million, an increase of 46% from $5.1 million in 2016. Pro Forma FY 2017 adjusted EBITDA is $10.9 million; this includes adjusted EBITDA of the two acquisitions for the pre-acquisition period.\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call on Monday April 2, 2018 at 10:00am ET.
