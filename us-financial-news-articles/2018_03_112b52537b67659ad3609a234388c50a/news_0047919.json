It immediately offers a major presence in the U.S., a clear next step to further increase our global scale,\" its Executive Chairman Peter Cowgill said.\nShares in JD Sports rose up to 3.9 percent in early trading.\n\"The deal looks a sensibly-priced entry point into a market that JD must embrace to be considered a genuinely global player,\" said Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard, who has a \"buy\" rating on the stock.\nFinish Line is also the exclusive retailer of athletic shoes, both in-store and online, for Macy's, operating 375 branded and 188 unbranded concessions within Macy's stores.\nIts revenue in the year to March 3, 2018, was $1.84 billion.\nPritchard said the deal will enhance JD's relationships with the big manufacturers, especially Nike, which represents 71 percent of Finish Lines sales.\nJD Sports has agreed to pay $13.50 per share for Finish Line, compared to its $10.55 close on Friday, which gave it a market capitalisation of $425 million versus JD Sports' 3.5 billion pound value.\nThe British firm is funding the deal through a new revolving credit facility and a new asset backed lending facility secured against Finish Line's inventory and receivables.\nJD Sports forecast the acquisition would make a small incremental positive contribution to its results and earnings per share in the year to Feb. 2 2019.\nThe deal, which requires the approval of both companies' shareholders, is expected to complete no earlier than June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T13:53:08.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
