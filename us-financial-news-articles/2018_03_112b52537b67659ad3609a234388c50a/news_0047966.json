Should you fly commercial or private?\nStudy says we have an undiscovered organ. It's called the interstitium\nDon't add citizenship question to Census. That's anti-immigrant and crassly political.\n\"This is a mockery of taking the Lord's name in vain and also highly offensive to Christians,\" said the petition, started by a person identifying himself as Ian O'Sullivan.\nThe petition added that the imagery used to promote the band is \"anti-Christ\" and \"anti-Christian.\"\n\"God forbid the name of the prophet Muhammad was used in this manner or the name of Allah against Muslims,\" the statement continued. \"So why is it that the name of Jesus Christ can be openly mocked in our so-called fair, equal, and democratic society?\"\nAnother petition, on the Canadian website CitizenGO , had garnered more than 11,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.\nThe company, whose product is soft-serve and covered in colorful toppings, said it does not mean to offend. In a statement on its website, it said the name \"was created from the popular phrase that people use as an expression of enjoyment, surprise or disbelief. Our aim is not to offer commentary on anyone's religion or belief systems. Our own organization is made up of amazing people that represent a wide range of cultural and religious beliefs.\"\nMeanwhile, Sweet Jesus co-owner Andrew Richmond told the Toronto Star the name originated when an employee at a taco restaurant he ran kept saying \"sweet Jesus\" when he served the ice cream prepared there. The popularity of the dessert spurred the chain to open in 2015.", "external_links": ["http://citizengo.org/en-ca/sc/158645-toronto-based-ice-cream-parlours-serve-blasphemy?tc=tw&tcid=46340144", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2018/03/28/traveling-pet-should-you-fly-commercial-private/465397002/", "https://www.change.org/p/change-org-change-the-name-of-sweet-jesus-ice-cream-remove-offensive-antichrist-imagery-immediately", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/27/dont-mess-census-editorials-debates/463645002/", "https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2016/01/13/sweet-jesus-serves-giant-decorated-cones-of-soft-serve-ice-cream-sourced.html", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/03/28/study-says-we-have-undiscovered-organ-its-called-interstitium/465173002/"], "published": "2018-03-29T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:15:10.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
