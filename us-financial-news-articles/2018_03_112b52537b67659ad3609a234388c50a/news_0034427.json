(NYSE: CSRA), a leading provider of next-generation IT solutions and professional services to government organizations, for $44.00 per share in cash and stock.\nCACI’s proposal includes a cash component of $15 per share and a stock component in the form of CACI stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.184 shares of CACI common stock for each share of CSRA stock.\nThe acquisition of CSRA by CACI would unite two businesses with long-term customer relationships, complementary capabilities and substantial presence in high-growth markets. Bringing together CACI’s mission solutions and services with CSRA’s broad range of next-generation enterprise capabilities would create a company able to provide customers with solutions that link domain and mission knowledge with industry-leading enterprise support offerings. The combination with CSRA would further capitalize on this opportunity for growth, amplifying both CACI’s and CSRA’s position in key market areas and improving the value proposition and customer footprint.\nThe acquisition proposal represents an 8% premium over the price CSRA’s shareholders would receive in the announced transaction with General Dynamics (GD). The combination would allow CSRA’s shareholders to participate in the long-term growth of the combined company. CACI expects to realize $165 million annually in net run-rate cost synergies—a substantially greater figure than the synergies contemplated by the GD transaction, affording both CACI’s and CSRA’s shareholders the opportunity to participate in additional value creation.\nAs announced in a separate press release today, CACI is in a strong position for future growth, and is raising its net income and diluted earnings per share guidance, as well as the lower end of its annual revenue guidance for Fiscal Year 2018. CACI’s strong financial outlook underscores the significant value-creation opportunities in the proposed transaction.\nAdditional information regarding CACI’s proposal is included in a letter that CACI delivered to CSRA’s Board of Directors on March 16, 2018, which CACI is furnishing as an exhibit to a Form 8-K.\nCACI has committed financing in place for the proposed transaction and therefore its proposal is not subject to any financing contingency. CACI’s Board of Directors unanimously approved the proposal, which is not subject to any further due diligence. CACI expects that a transaction could close by July 31, 2018, subject to approvals by CACI’s and CSRA’s shareholders.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as lead financial advisor to CACI. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP is acting as legal advisor to CACI.\nAbout CACI\nCACI provides information solutions and services in support of national security missions and government transformation for Intelligence, Defense, and Federal Civilian customers.
