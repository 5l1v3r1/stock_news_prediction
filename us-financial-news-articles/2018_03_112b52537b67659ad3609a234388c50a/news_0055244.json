And the bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of overall demand, clocked in at 2.34, below the average of 2.54, according to BMO Capital Markets.\nConcerns that a wave of new debt could weigh on the prices of outstanding bonds had kept many investors on edge heading into the week. Still, Treasurys managed to hold their ground, with the yield on the 10-year note notching its fourth decline in five trading sessions.\nContinued swings in the stock market should keep pressure on bond yields heading into quarter-end, analysts say, even as many investors believe a pickup in inflation will ultimately stall the bond rally.\n“While the bond market is not likely to regain its horns anytime soon, it does indicate how vulnerable the equity market is to bad news, and how quickly investors will seek the safety of U.S. Treasurys when that bad news hits the tape,” said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James.\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T02:16:10.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
