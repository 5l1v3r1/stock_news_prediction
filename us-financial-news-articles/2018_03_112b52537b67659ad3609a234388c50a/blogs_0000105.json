But that company later decided not to invest in the Kushner Companies' building at 666 Fifth Avenue.\nA spokesman for Kushner's lawyer told NBC News in a prepared statement that \"time and again, unnamed sources seeking only mischief have misled the media about what the Special Counsel is doing.\"\n\"Mr. Kushner's role in the campaign and transition was to be a point person for completely appropriate contacts from foreign officials and he did not mix his or his former company's business in those contacts and any claim otherwise is false,\" the spokesman said.\nMueller's office declined to comment to NBC News for its story.\nMueller was originally appointed as special counsel last year to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, as well as the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians during that campaign. Trump has repeatedly denied there was any collusion.\nBut since then, Mueller's probe has expanded to include investigations of consulting work that former Trump campaign officials did for a pro-Russia leader of Ukraine, as well as Kushner's business dealings.\nRead NBC News' story here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T22:18:17.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
