He says he was fired in November for complaining to his managers and human resources about the \"illegal and discriminatory hiring practices.\"\nMore from USA Today:\nGoogle engineer says he was fired for fighting racism, sexism\nFormer Google preschool teacher alleges gender pay discrimination\nEx-Google engineer Damore sues alleging discrimination against white, conservative men\nGoogle spokeswoman Gina Scigliano said the company will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit.\n\"We have a clear policy to hire candidates based on their merit, not their identity,\" she said in an emailed statement. \"At the same time, we unapologetically try to find a diverse pool of qualified candidates for open roles, as this helps us hire the best people, improve our culture, and build better products.\"\nThe lawsuit comes amid heated debate over the technology industry's efforts to increase the low numbers of women, African Americans and Hispanics in its ranks.\nFacing pressure to diversity its workforce, Google began publicly sharing data on the racial and gender make-up of its ranks in 2014. The Silicon Valley company's attempts to re-engineer its mostly white-and-Asian male demographics to include more women and people of color have put Google in the cross hairs of the nation's culture wars.\nFormer Google engineer James Damore sued Google in January, alleging the company discriminates against conservatives and white men. Damore was fired last year for distributing a memo that argued Google's efforts to increased diversity were misguided, in part, because of the biological differences between men and women.\nSome Google employees who advocate for diversity allege the company is not doing enough to protect them from a harassment campaign by their co-workers following Damore's firing that has subjected them to hateful comments and violent threats — and one former employee has sued for pushing back against racism and sexism. Google also has been targeted by a lawsuit and a Department of Labor investigation into whether it underpays women.\nThe lawsuit brought by Wilberg was first reported by Bloomberg News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T13:48:34.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
