The Observatory said the Turkish army was in control of about 70 percent of the town, about 25 km (16 miles) northwest of Afrin city.\nThe SDF statement said a group of Turkish forces and allied Syrian factions had infiltrated Rajo, where it said clashes were continuing between SDF forces and the attackers.\nTurkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency in Turkey and is deemed a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union and Turkey. The YPG has been an important ally for the United States in the fight against Islamic State.\nWriting by Tom Perry; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T15:06:08.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
