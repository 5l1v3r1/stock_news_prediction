A key element of the Company’s strategy will be to build upon its partner sales model and increase the Company’s effectiveness. The Company’s work is on track and it expects to provide more details during the fiscal year-end conference call. Details below.\nConference Call\nA conference call and webcast for the investment community is scheduled for Thursday, March 22, 2018 at 9 a.m. ET (7 a.m. MT) to discuss the fourth quarter and year-end results in greater detail.

These forward-looking statements are based upon information which is currently available to the Company and which is believed to be reasonable in the circumstances; however, such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements. In particular, the Company’s ability to predict future financial performance is highly uncertain due, in part, to the lumpy nature of customer orders, the variability of product mix, and the timing of the underlying construction projects that DIRTT is selling in to. The Company’s success will depend, in part, on its ability to maintain and manage growth effectively and for management to work cohesively. To take advantage of future growth opportunities and manage the growth of the Company’s operations and personnel, DIRTT will need to continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty in implementing products or securing customers and Partners; declines in quality or customer satisfaction; increases in costs; and difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact the Company’s business performance and results of operations. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required under the Company's continuous disclosure obligations.\nAbout DIRTT | www.DIRTT.net\nDIRTT Environmental Solutions uses its proprietary 3D software to design, manufacture and install fully customized, prefabricated interiors.
