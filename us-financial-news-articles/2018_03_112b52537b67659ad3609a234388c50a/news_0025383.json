Paper Excellence's bid values Fibria at 40 billion reais, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Fibria shares jumped 2.95 percent to an all-time high. Shares of Suzano Papel e Celulose SA, which is also negotiating a tie-up with Fibria, dropped 4.45 percent. The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 0.61 percent. Also helping to drive equity markets higher, shares of JBS SA rose over 4 percent as bargain-hunting lifted shares of food processors for a second straight day. The sector suffered large losses earlier this month after Brazilian police unveiled a probe into suspected fraud to evade food safety checks at BRF SA, the world's largest poultry exporter. More widely, most Latin American stock and currency markets were range-bound as traders awaited further developments of U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist plans, after he slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. How such policies will affect emerging market currencies is not yet clear. While higher prices of imported goods could stoke inflation and drive interest rates higher, they could also weaken the ongoing economic recovery.
