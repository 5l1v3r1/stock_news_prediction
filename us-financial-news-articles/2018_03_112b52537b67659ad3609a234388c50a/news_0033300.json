(NASDAQ:SND) announced today that, in anticipation of its recent acquisition of the rights to a unit train capable transloading terminal in Van Hook, North Dakota, it entered into a multi-year Master Product Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with a large exploration and production company. The products will be sold through the newly acquired transloading terminal, and the obligations under the Agreement will commence after such facility is operational, which we expect will be in April 2018. The Agreement is structured as a take-or-pay agreement.\n“We are excited to have an anchor contracted customer for our new Van Hook transloading terminal located in the Bakken,” stated Charles Young, Smart Sand’s CEO. “We continue to believe that, over the long term, many customers want a sand service company that can not only provide high quality sand, but also offer efficient and cost-effective solutions for delivering that sand to the wellhead. The addition of our unit-train capable Van Hook terminal, along with our new customer relationship, is Smart Sand’s first step in executing its initiative to expand its geographic and product delivery footprint.”\nForward-looking Statements\nAll statements in this news release other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements that contain our current expectations about our future results.
