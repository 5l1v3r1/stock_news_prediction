BuzzFeed has been seeking to diversify its revenue streams for some time now to ensure it isn’t over-reliant on the volatile online ad market. The latest effort? Its Tasty brand has partnered with Walmart to sell a line of kitchen tools and gadgets at around 4,000 stores and on Walmart.com. Ben Kaufman, the head of BuzzFeed’s commerce group, predicts the kitchen tools will generate around 25% of his division’s revenue this year. Pivot to...spatulas?\nDigital Footprint There’s no doubt Procter & Gamble marketing chief Marc Pritchard’s various high-profile speeches about the “murky” digital ad supply chain over the last year made an impact. But the real issue of interest is what the company is doing with its spending. CMO Today reports the consumer products giant slashed its spending on digital ads by more than $200 million last year, with little impact on its business. Some of the pullback was in the “long tail,” but Mr. Pritchard said P&G also reduced spending with “several big digital players” by 20% to 50% last year (not that you’d notice if you look at the biggest players’ quarterly earnings.) He declined to name which ones, but we do know that P&G has yet to return to YouTube since pulling its brands from the video service in March last year. Haircuts aside, Mr. Pritchard did say big tech companies have met 90% of his demands--he’s just waiting for the Media Rating Council to finish auditing some of Google and Facebook’s ad metrics—so there’s a possibility P&G could ratchet up its digital spend again once those platforms have achieved the full set.\nZombie Bites “The Walking Dead” is beginning to show its age. Ad revenue for AMC’s U.S. networks dropped nearly 10% in its fourth quarter as ratings for the program and its spinoff talk show “Talking Dead” fell, WSJ reports. To be sure, AMC still had 4 of the top 10 dramas on cable last year, (“The Walking Dead,” “Fear the Walking Dead,” “Into the Badlands” and “Better Call Saul”) but the company is still battling the cord-cutting shift and the willingness of streaming rivals to spend big dollars betting on the next breakout hits. AMC said advertiser demand remains strong as the network continues to covet the attractive 18-to-49 demographic. At this year’s upfront, AMC says, it’s looking to demand an advertising premium around new tools that will help marketers better target specific audience segments. Those better be some golden segments!\nOur Moles At Fox CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports : Fox Networks hosted a closed-door event on Thursday in L.A., bringing together rivals from networks including NBC and Turner, plus advertisers and agencies, to discuss the fast-changing and challenging TV ad business. The consensus from our spies at the event? Advertising needs work. Fewer, more engaging ads, better attention metrics...stop me if this sounds familiar. FX Networks Chief Executive John Landgraf disparaged the current ad-supported business model, our sources said. Meanwhile, Fox Networks Group ad sales chief Joe Marchese continued with his shtick about “ attention coins ” — an analogy to cryptocurrencies and a way to emphasize the value of time spent with an ad, rather than counting impressions. He even presented a symbol for the coins. One ad buyer described it as an “A” with two lines through it. Another buyer described the event, plus NBC’s cross-industry powwow a few weeks before, as a “pre-upfront,” or a time for the networks to remind buyers why linear TV still matters. As with the traditional upfront, Fox’s event had star power: Sean “Diddy” Combs was there to talk about disruptive brands. Fox representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reminder: Fox Networks parent 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.)\nSilver Surfer The draft has been drawn in the competition to take Nate Silver’s stats site FiveThirtyEight off ESPN’s hands. The final contenders include another Disney unit, ABC News, plus The Athletic and The Atlantic , CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports. Mr. Silver may be a big name in data-driven journalism, but his site is a small commercial enterprise: Potential buyers have been told it’s losing $6 million annually on revenue of around $3 million. A person close to ESPN said the company does not break out FiveThirtyEight’s financials separately and believes the site has been valuable to ESPN as a whole. There was concern among some people close to FiveThirtyEight that ESPN didn’t monetize the site properly because politics isn’t the sports network’s a-game. The site had achieved a huge “Trump Bump” around the U.S. presidential election, reaching around 21 million uniques in November 2016, but it’s since shed that audience and has averaged between 4 million and 6 million visitors over the past year. Still, there’s another election coming up!\nBest of the rest Some Snap employees were reportedly told they won’t get their cash bonuses this year, after missing internal goals.

In a Thursday tweetstorm, Mr. Dorsey said he wasn’t proud of how his company has handled malicious activity and abuse on Twitter. [ WSJ ]\nSome publishers are switching their domain names to get ahead of Facebook’s algorithm change and dodge advertiser blacklists. [ BuzzFeed News ]\nFacebook has ended its news feed experiment in six countries that separated content from news sites and publishers into their own “explore feed.” Publishers in those countries had complained the experiment had led to a rise in misinformation. [ New York Times ]\nAn investing group backed by investor Ron Burkle and led by businesswoman Maria Contreras-Sweet has reached a last-minute deal to acquire the assets of the Weinstein Company for around $500 million.
