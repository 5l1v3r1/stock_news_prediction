Christo Most activities on the island, known for its beaches and temples, usually come to a standstill on the day of “Nyepi”, including a temporary closure of the international airport. But this is the first time internet providers have been asked to restrict cellular data, according to Telkomsel, the country’s largest mobile network. In a statement, the communications ministry said religious leaders in Bali had appealed for a 24-hour internet blackout from 6 a.m. on Saturday.

It was unclear whether wifi networks at places like hotels or cafes would still operate.
