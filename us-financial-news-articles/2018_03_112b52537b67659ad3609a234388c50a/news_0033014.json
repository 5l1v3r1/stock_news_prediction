What is it with United Airlines and dogs this week? Just days after a dog died on a United flight after a flight attendant told a passenger to place the pet in an overhead bin, the airline accidentally shipped a Kansas-bound German shepherd to Japan . When the owner went to pick up her pooch, she found a Great Dane in his place. United has apologized for the error. It’s another dog’s dinner for a very busy public-relations department.\nOnce Bitten, Twice Shy There are so many idioms and proverbs you can apply to Facebook’s yo-yoing relationship with publishers. For some publishers, when Facebook revealed plans to create a news section in its Watch video hub, it’s a case of, “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.” As CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports, Facebook intends to pay publishers to create the content, but some are wary , as the program sounds very familiar to Facebook’s Live initiative. You may remember the social network didn’t renew many of its Live deals after they expired, leaving publishers without funding to support all the production resources they had just invested in. Aside from their fickle relationship with Facebook, some publishers are skeptical about jumping in because they’re unsure Watch will draw the kind of audiences to make their programs viable. What’s more, questions about advertising haven’t been answered yet, according to one person familiar with the program. All those jitters aside, about 10 publishers are currently testing Watch news shows.\nFakebook WSJ deputy media editor Sarah Rabil reports : Speaking of Facebook’s dwindling fan club, NBC News definitely isn’t a member these days. In a briefing with reporters, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack called the company “Fakebook” and said it’s been a “bad actor” toward the news industry. “Facebook doesn’t have any value to publishers really—that’s the dirty little secret,” he said. Snap Inc., on the other hand, has been much more collaborative. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the network favors Snap, given NBCUniversal’s $500 million investment in the company during its IPO. NBC News says its “Stay Tuned” show on Snapchat has gained a loyal audience, crossing the 5 million subscriber mark Tuesday. And 75% of its audience is under the age of 25, according to Nick Ascheim, senior vice president of digital at NBC News, who noted the company is in conversations about starting to do brand integrations on the platform.\n—Follow Your Streams—\nTo catch the eye of additional young viewers, NBC News is exploring the potential launch of a streaming video channel. The network says it hasn’t worked out whether it would be free or require a subscription. It’s also still sorting out its talent lineup and programming strategy, while being careful not to cannibalize the MSNBC cable network.\nTomorrowland All change aboard good ship Disney. The media giant is reorganizing to better position itself for the streaming generation and a future that won’t one day include Chief Executive Robert Iger but should include the assets of 21st Century Fox the company is hoping to acquire. As WSJ’s Ben Fritz reports, two executives are now positioned as potential successors to Mr. Iger. Kevin Mayer, Disney’s longtime head of strategy, was named chairman of a new direct-to-consumer and international segment, which will include soon-to-be-launched streaming services, plus global ad sales for channels for media properties including ESPN and ABC. Disney says that’ll give advertisers access to a “one-stop shop” to reach audiences across TV, online and its direct-to-consumer platforms. Meanwhile parks chief Robert Chapek added consumer products to his portfolio, giving him oversight of what would be the company’s biggest business unit by revenue and profit.\nWe’re Talking About Money, Money WPP Chief Martin Sorrell’s generous pay package has been called excessive by certain groups of shareholders in recent years. The majority of Mr. Sorrell’s remuneration is based on the holding company’s financial performance that, under the previous “LEAP” incentive program, saw the WPP boss receive almost £210 million ($292 million) in compensation from 2012 to 2016. On Wednesday, WPP disclosed Mr. Sorrell received £10 million in company shares as compensation for 2017, a significant drop from the £41.6 million in shares Mr. Sorrell was awarded a year prior . The cut is mostly because it’s the first time Mr. Sorrell has been compensated under a five-year remuneration program that began in 2013, when the WPP board placed a cap on his pay. But WPP’s recent lackluster performance is also cutting into Mr. Sorrell’s pay packet, WSJ’s Nick Kostov reports. Mr. Sorrell received 73% of the shares he would have been rewarded had he hit all his targets. We’ll find out more about Mr. Sorrell’s total pay when WPP publishes its annual report next month.\nCorrection: Andrea Brimmer is the chief marketing and public relations officer at Ally Financial. Wednesday’s newsletter incorrectly stated her title as chief marketing and financial officer. Apologies for the error.\nBest of the rest Leaked company documents reportedly reveal Amazon’s U.S. audience for all video programming on Prime was about 26 million by early 2017. The company declined to comment. [ Reuters ]\niHeartMedia, owner of the biggest U.S. radio broadcaster, filed for bankruptcy protection after reaching an agreement in principle with investors over a balance-sheet restructuring. [ WSJ ]\nChipotle Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Mark Crumpacker is resigning from the company. Mr. Crumpacker, who has been Chipotle’s CMO since 2009, will leave Thursday. [ Ad Age ]\nAmazon is preparing a new attribution tool for advertisers, and media buyers say they now hear from the company at least twice as often as they did last year. [ Digiday ]\nAd-tech firm Rubicon Project said it laid off 100 staff members during its first quarter as part of a significant cost-reduction effort. The company reported a 57% drop in revenue to $31.4 million in the December quarter, which followed its decision to drop buy-side fees in late in 2017. Rubicon’s share price was up more than 21% in after-hours trading, after the firm forecast it would become adjusted-Ebitda positive in the fourth quarter of 2018.
