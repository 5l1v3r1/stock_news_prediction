It is intended to provide diversity in U.S. immigration, so only individuals from countries underrepresented in the U.S. are encouraged to apply.\nIf a person qualifies and is chosen, the lottery can allow them to receive a green card, which, aside from voting, offers all the benefits of permanent residency in the U.S. But even if you do qualify, only a small number of people who enter the lottery will win.\nPaul J. Richards | AFP | Getty Images International travelers leave the Customs and Immigration area of Dulles International Airport June 29, 2017, outside Washington, DC, in Dulles, Virginia. Each year, the government makes 55,000 permanent resident cards available to people from underrepresented places like Uzbekistan and Ethiopia. To apply, these folks must have the equivalent of at least a high school education or two years of work experience during the past five at a job that required at least two years of training.\nLottery winners randomly chosen by a State Department computer program must submit documents and be interviewed at the U.S. embassy in their home country. Fewer than 1 percent of applicants are selected and undergo background checks, according to The Washington Post . They can obtain a permanent residency visa if they clear the background check.\nshow chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T17:14:09.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
