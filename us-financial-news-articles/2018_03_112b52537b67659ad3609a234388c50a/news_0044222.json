Lack of liquidity and accessibility continue to limit its usage,” he added. \nChina’s currency has some way to go. The yuan’s share of global foreign exchange reserves is just 1.1% of the global total, behind currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars. The U.S. dollar’s share is 63.5%. \nThe yuan makes up only 1.1% share of international payments, placing it behind seven others, according to payments firm SWIFT. That share has dipped in recent years, from as high as 2.8% in August 2015. Currently almost all oil and most commodities are bought and sold in dollars. \nHowever, even in modern history, it hasn’t always been this way. Economists point to the demise of the British pound ’s dominance in world trade as showing that the tide can turn quickly against one currency in favor of another, especially during a crisis. \nThe London Metal Exchange benchmark copper contract was denominated in sterling until 1993. Even today, cocoa trading is priced in sterling. \nThough crude has a longer history of being denominated in dollars, due to the U.S.’s status as a major producer, as late as the 1970s, oil-producing countries received around a fifth of their royalty payments in sterling, according to economic historian Professor \nCatherine Schenk. \nBefore the outbreak of the World War I, dollar-denominated international trade credit was almost nonexistent and British banks dominated the sector. By the mid-1920s, the dollar and sterling-denominated trade credit occupied similar market shares. \nThe economic impact of the First and World War II left London’s influence in international finance and trade dramatically weakened, leaving the dollar firmly in the driving seat by the second half of the 20th century. \nSheer economic heft isn’t enough to guarantee a currency international primacy. The U.S. economy supplanted the U.K.’s as the world’s largest in the 1870s, around half a century before the dollar began to replace sterling as the world’s dominant currency. \nThat is a lesson to China, as its economy catches up with the U.S. and by some measures has already taken over. \nOne factor currently limiting the adoption of the yuan as a global currency is Beijing’s capital controls, which place limits on investment in China. Beijing keeps a tight grip of money coming in and out of the country to maintain control of the country’s economy and prevent sudden outflows of capital. \nCurrently, selling a yuan-denominated future means investors must either exchange the currency back into dollars—partly defeating the purpose of the contract—or find assets denominated in the Chinese currency to invest in. \nThere is no shortage of Chinese assets. The IHS Markit iBoxx Asia China index, a broad index of Chinese bonds, has more than doubled in size in the last 4½ years, to over $11 trillion. \nSome of the government controls have already been loosened. In 2017, China launched a “ bond-connect program ” to allow global investors with trading accounts in Hong Kong to access China’s interbank bond market. \nJust because more foreigners can now buy Chinese bonds, it doesn’t mean they will. Some investors say Beijing will have to open up its economy more for that to happen. \n“Firstly, China will have to remove, or substantially reduce, capital controls for [renminbi] priced oil trading to take off,” said \nHayden Briscoe, \nhead of fixed income Asia Pacific at UBS Asset Management. \nMr. Briscoe added that the inclusion of Chinese bonds in major indexes would boost outside investment in the country’s debt, given investors and passive funds track such benchmarks. \n“When that happens, we’re expecting a major reallocation of capital into China’s onshore bond markets,” Mr. Briscoe said. \nBloomberg LP said Friday it would add Chinese bonds to its Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index in 2019. \nHowever, the country’s controls on capital flows aren’t the only concerns. The Chinese government’s propensity to intervene in domestic commodity markets and the lack of transparency about the country’s monetary policy are also unlikely to find favor among investors. \nWrite to Mike Bird at ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:51:03.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
