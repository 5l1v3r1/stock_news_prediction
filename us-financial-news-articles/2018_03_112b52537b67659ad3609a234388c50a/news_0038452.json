Brent, the global benchmark, rose $1.75, or 2.6%, to $69.17 a barrel.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude inventories declined by 2.6 million barrels in the week ended March 16, in contrast to analyst forecasts for a 2.4-million-barrel increase.\nDraws in product stockpiles also exceeded analyst expectations. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.7 million barrels last week and distillate inventories decreased by 2 million barrels.\n“In the big picture, all three ‘headline’ numbers were much better than expected,” said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group.\nCrude prices closed up more than 2% on Tuesday as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington raised the specter of a harder U.S. line against Iran.\nBoth the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have criticized a 2015 international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and Mr. Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal and reimpose economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Such a move could impact the oil output of one of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ largest members, analysts say.\n“I think the sanctions talk is making people a little bit nervous,” Mr. Saucer said.\nOPEC and 10 members outside the cartel, including Russia, have been holding back crude production by 1.8 million barrels a day since the start of last year, as part of an effort to rein a global supply glut and boost prices. The group said compliance with the cuts reached a record in February and the oil surplus has fallen closer to the five-year average this year.\nOPEC’s efforts to reduce supply along with bullish inventory data in the U.S. have helped offset concerns over steadily increasing shale production. According to the EIA, U.S. production reached a fresh weekly record last week, at 10.407 million barrels a day.\n“This newfound feel-good factor is nevertheless at risk from the unrelenting acceleration in U.S. crude output,” Stephen Brennock, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd., said of the market’s bullish sentiment this week. “We have seen time again how a delicate optimism has been crushed by the U.S. tight oil machine,” he added.\nAn oil rig in the North Sea.
