Any event that leads to a decline in his support ratings is seen weakening his ability to keep Abenomics in place.\n“With worries about the United States and China locking horns on trade issues and Japan’s parliamentary testimony coming up on Tuesday, few participants are willing to buy the dollar,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nAccording to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday, speculators’ net short positioning on the yen shrank rapidly to roughly 22,000 contracts in the latest week, the smallest since November 2016, from a net short position of about 79,500 contracts.\nThe Australian dollar added 0.6 percent to $0.7749 and the New Zealand dollar gained nearly 1 percent to $0.7297, in a further sign that risk aversion was fading from the markets for now.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO; editing by David Stamp and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-03-26T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:43:05.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
