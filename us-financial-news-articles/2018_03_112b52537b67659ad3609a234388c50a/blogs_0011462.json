The company defendants in the pending lawsuits have either publicly denied the allegations in statements to the media, or have declined to comment. \nBut \"the statement of interest does not make the government party to the lawsuit,\" attorney Jesse Gessin told NBC News for a story published Thursday. \nGessin was one of several lawyers quoted by NBC who were skeptical that the Trump administration will get aggressive with drug companies over the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T23:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T23:39:35.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
