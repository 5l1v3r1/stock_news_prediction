FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is seen at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, February 7, 2018 Concerned that it is all too easy for them to avoid tax on profits, the European Commission will instead propose that companies with significant digital revenues in Europe pay a 3 percent tax on their turnover. If backed by EU states and lawmakers, the tax would apply to large firms with annual worldwide revenue above 750 million euros and annual “taxable” EU revenues above 50 million euros. That could hit Google and Facebook but also cover Airbnb, Amazon and Uber. One snag: EU tax reforms need the backing of all member states to become law and that is far from certain. Smaller countries fear becoming less attractive to multinational firms and are resisting; Ireland for one is not happy with the plan. Dutch municipal elections don’t usually garner much attention but today’s vote is being watched in particular for the performance of the new kid on the far-right, populist block. Thierry Baudet, a 35-year-old self-styled intellectual who occasionally brings a grand piano to campaign events, turned his Forum for Democracy (FvD) think tank into a political party and has been doing well in polls recently - even eclipsing his rival Geert Wilders in some of them. Baudet has expressed admiration for Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and backs the Netherlands leaving the EU. The FvD has only got a couple of seats in the national assembly but is hoping for a breakthrough in the local elections - it is fielding candidates in the country’s two largest cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Two important numbers this morning: in Germany, the Ifo economic institute updates its gross domestic product growth forecast for the German economy , currently at 2.6 percent for this year; and UK unemployment data at 0930 will be scrutinised for signs of wage growth, the precondition for future rate hikes. MARKETS As world markets await the Federal Reserve’s first interest rate rise of 2018 later on Wednesday, this week’s jolt to the giant social media and internet stocks continues to reverberate . Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, speaks at the Frontline Club in London, March 20, 2018 Facebook, now facing questioning from U.S. and British regulators about how its users' personal data was mined by a political consultancy hired by President Trump's election campaign, recovered some of its worst intraday losses on Tuesday but still ended down another 2.6 percent – bringing its drop over two days to 9 percent, the worst couple of days in more than two years. Fears that tighter regulation of user data will damage the advertising model of social media companies rippled across the sector, with Twitter dropping 10 percent on Tuesday and Snapchat losing 2.5 percent. The Global X Social Media exchange traded fund lost 0.9 percent and has lost almost 5 percent since early last week. The row compounded worries that this week’s European Union summit will agree a 3 percent turnover tax on large companies with significant digital revenues in the EU such as Google and Facebook. Poor results from business software maker Oracle meantime saw its stock drop almost 10 percent. The overall tech-heavy Nasdaq equity index and the S&P500 steadied, however, and both ended marginally in the black as the wider market braced for today’s Fed hike. Both 10-year Treasury yields and the dollar have broadly firmed ahead of the expected rate rise, with all the attention now on whether the Fed’s ‘dot plot’ on future policy guidance leans towards four rate hikes for this year from the three currently priced in by markets. Trepidation ahead of the decision put Asia markets on the backfoot overnight, with most of the major regional bourses down as much as 0.5 percent. European and U.S. stock futures were flat to a touch higher. Sterling was also firmer ahead of UK jobs and earnings data later this morning. The pound has been boosted this week by the Brexit transition deal , but slipped back on Tuesday after lower-than-forecast inflation numbers that questioned whether the Bank of England needed to pull the interest rate trigger in May, as many have bet on. The earnings component of today’s employment report will be most important as a result. Elsewhere, Italian and other southern European sovereign bond yields continue to push lower after big falls on Tuesday, with traders eyeing ebbing inflation expectations in the euro zone debt markets and what that might mean for European Central Bank policy going forward. The U.S./German 2-year yield gap remains close to its widest in 21 years.
