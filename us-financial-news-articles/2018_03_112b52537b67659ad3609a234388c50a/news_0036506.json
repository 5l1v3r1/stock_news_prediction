(Nasdaq:LIFE), a biotherapeutics company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative medicines based on novel immunological pathways, today announced operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We achieved several key milestones in 2017 that will enable the continued development of our ORCA and ATYR1923 programs, and allows us to actively pursue our mission to develop and deliver innovative therapeutics based on our knowledge of novel immunological pathways,” said Sanjay Shukla, M.D., M.S., President and CEO of aTyr Pharma. “These achievements included initiating the development of a panel of antibodies from our ORCA immuno-oncology program, and initiating the first-in-human clinical trial of ATYR1923 for the potential treatment of immune-mediated lung diseases. We look forward to announcing top-line results from the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers of ATYR1923 in the second quarter of this year, and expect to present and publish additional data in support of ORCA and ATYR1923 as we advance both programs in 2018.”\nProgram Highlights\nIn November 2017, aTyr initiated a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ATYR1923 in healthy volunteers. aTyr expects to announce top-line results from this study in the second quarter of 2018. In December 2017, aTyr selected a panel of antibodies for continued preclinical development and initiated CMC activities from its ORCA program. aTyr expects to initiate patient trials as early as 2019. In January 2018, aTyr presented data from its ORCA program highlighting the potential importance of Resokine in immuno-oncology at the American Society of Clinical Oncology – Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (ASCO-SITC) Clinical Immuno-Oncology Symposium in San Francisco. Identification of Novel Liquid Biopsy Biomarker for Monitoring the Immune Set Point in Both Solid Tumor and Hematological Malignancy Patients In April 2018, aTyr will present additional data on its ORCA program at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in Chicago: April 16, 2018: Circulating levels of Resokine, a soluble modulator of the immune system, are upregulated in both experimental cancer models and in patients across multiple tumor types April 17, 2018: Antibodies targeting Resokine, a soluble immune modulator, inhibit tumor growth in syngeneic mouse models\nCorporate Highlights\nIn November 2017, aTyr appointed Sanjay Shukla, M.D., M.S., as President and Chief Executive Officer. In February 2018, aTyr promoted David J. King, Ph.D. to Chief Scientific Officer and Ashraf Amanullah, Ph.D. to Senior Vice President, Biologics Development and Manufacturing.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses were $5.3 million and $9.1 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease of $3.8 million was due primarily to a $1.3 million decrease related to manufacturing costs incurred in support of ATYR1923 clinical studies, a $1.9 million decrease related to the completion of ATYR1940 clinical studies, a decrease of $0.9 million related to manufacturing costs incurred in support of ATYR1940 clinical studies in the prior year, a $0.2 million decrease related to non-cash stock-based compensation, and a $0.1 million decrease related to discovery research. The decrease was partially offset by an increase related to ATYR1923 Phase 1 clinical study costs of $0.6 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $5.9 million compared to $3.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase was primarily related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to executive transitions.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses were $30.1 million and $42.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease of $12.8 million was due primarily to a $9.6 million decrease related to manufacturing costs incurred in support of ATYR1940, a $6.7 million decrease related to ATYR1940 clinical trial costs, a $0.5 million decrease in discovery projects, and a $0.5 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million related to ATYR1923 Phase 1 clinical studies, a $1.2 million increase related to research and non-clinical development costs incurred for ATYR1923, a $1.1 million increase related to ORCA pre-clinical and research activities and an increase of $0.8 million related to manufacturing costs incurred in support of ATYR1923.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $17.1 million and $15.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $2.0 million was due primarily to a $2.2 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to executive transitions, which was partially offset by a reduction of $0.2 million in professional fees.\nFinancial Guidance\nAs of December 31, 2017, aTyr had $85.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and 41.2 million shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis (includes 29.8 million shares of common stock and 11.4 million shares of common stock if converted from Class X Preferred stock).\naTyr expects that its cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund its anticipated operations into the third quarter of 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\naTyr Pharma will host a conference call and webcast today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results and provide a general corporate update.
