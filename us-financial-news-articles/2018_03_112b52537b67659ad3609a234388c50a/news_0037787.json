If investors have a better sense of what developments might change the outlook for monetary policy, that could help give the Fed better control over interest rates.\nBernanke's 11 news conferences lasted about 57 minutes on average, according to information posted on the Fed Board's YouTube page.\nBernanke, who like Yellen was a PhD economist with a background in academia, held the second-briefest quarterly news conference so far at 45 minutes.\nPowell's career before the Fed included roles in investment banking and on corporate boards. He was a managing partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. Powell was also a senior official at the Treasury Department during former President George H.W. Bush's administration.\nPowell said he would be \"carefully considering\" doing more press conferences, adding that while he and his colleagues want to communicate as clearly as possible, he wanted to \"make sure that no one would take more frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy.\"\nSome analysts said that is exactly how markets would take it, given that since the Fed began raising rates in 2015, it has only done so at meetings when the Fed's leader was scheduled to speak. The Fed meets eight times a year.
