The data also showed that tafamidis was generally well tolerated by the enrolled patients.\nTafamidis was being tested for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy, a condition that results from deposits of transthyretin protein in the heart, which leads to eventual heart failure.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted tafamidis a 'fast track' designation in June last year. The designation aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review process for certain drugs and vaccines for serious conditions.\nCurrently, there are no approved medications in the United States for the treatment of transthyretin cardiomyopathy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T21:52:31.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
