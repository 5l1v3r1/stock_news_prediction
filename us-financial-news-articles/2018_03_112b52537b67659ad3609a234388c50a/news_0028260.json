Blue Apron reported it had 746,000 customers at the end of 2017, down from 879,000 a year earlier. Formidable rivals have entered the market, including Weight Watchers International and Walmart Inc.\nThe increased competition has weighed on Blue Apron shares, which have lost more than three-quarters of their value since an initial public offering last June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T20:07:34.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
