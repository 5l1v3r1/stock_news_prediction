Globally, the company trails Samsung and Apple in handset shipments but leads in China, the biggest market, and says it expects to ship a total of 150 million this year.\nHuawei, the world's biggest maker of network gear used by phone companies, suffered earlier setbacks in the American market when a congressional report in October 2013 said it was a security risk and warned telecom carriers not to use its equipment.\nMore recently, a new global struggle for influence over next-generation \"5G\" communications technology has brought Huawei under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government. Many American officials are concerned that Chinese companies such as Huawei could take a larger, or even a dominant, role in setting 5G technology and standards and practices.\nKevin Ho, president of Huawei's handset product line, said they'll instead focus on Europe and developing markets in Asia, especially India, where Huawei sees opportunities to expand the Shenzhen-based company's market share.\n\"There are still some big countries where our market share is very, very low,\" Ho said. \"This is a hint of where we can raise our market share globally.\"\nOn Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump blocked Singapore chipmaker Broadcom from pursuing a hostile takeover of prominent U.S. rival Qualcomm , a deal which officials believed could have hobbled the U.S.'s ability to make a quick transition to 5G.\nWhen asked about the blocked deal, Xu declined to comment.\nSeparately, lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a bill on Jan. 9 that would prohibit government purchases of telecoms equipment from Huawei Technologies and smaller rival ZTE, citing their ties to the Chinese military and backing from the ruling Communist Party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T16:33:31.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
