McLean in the late 1970s and confronted by a spanner-wielding Murdoch, who advised him to “get back on the bus”. \n“I got back on the bus,” McLean wrote at the time. \nHe was found again in rural Queensland in the 1990s by journalist Margot McRae, but declined to be interviewed on camera. McRae wrote a play about the encounter. \nMurdoch was last seen in public in 2001 when he appeared as a witness at a coronial inquest in the Northern Territory over the death of a young Aboriginal man who had been caught breaking into Murdoch’s home. \nMurdoch was never named as a suspect, but said little during the inquest and then disappeared from public sight again.
