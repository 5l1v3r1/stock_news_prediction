Picture taken May 16, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer The widely read Global Times is run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, although its stance does not necessarily reflect Chinese government policy.\nThe editorial excoriated Ottawa for what it characterized as vacillation between the U.S. and China, referring to recent comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about steel and aluminum dumping.\nCanada has “sound trade ties and ... no major disputes,” with China, it said.\nCanada’s imports of Chinese steel make up a small proportion of its total imports, and it imports nearly no aluminum from China, the editorial said, adding that “Canada is more like a U.S. colony economically.”\nHowever, a “self-seeking and greedy Canada” would be unlikely to cut itself off from the Chinese market completely, it said.\nOn Tuesday, Trudeau said that Canada will act to prevent the smuggling of cheap steel and aluminum into the North American market.\n“By following the U.S. suit, Canada is acting like a crafty merchant. Chinese people used to hold full respect for Western countries. But as their exchanges grow, these countries begin unveiling their selfish and cunning nature,” the editorial said.\n“We have professional teams to cope with small countries of this kind,” the editorial said.\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:01:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
