Human Rights Council.\n“Also, when you are prepared to kill your own people so easily, lying is easy too. Claims by the Government of Syria that it is taking every measure to protect its civilian population are frankly ridiculous.”\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay, editing by Tom Miles\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:32:15.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
