Group full-year revenue rose by 49 percent to 166.5 million euros in 2017, with revenue in Germany up 57 percent.\nThe company spent 71 million euros on marketing in Germany, where sales totaled 58 million euros last year.\nTakeaway has exited Britain and France and is using funds from its 2016 initial public offering to focus on building its presence in Germany.\nGroen repeated on Wednesday his company would be interested in combining operations with other companies in Germany, but said a deal was not necessary.\nConsolidation in Germany “depends on negotiations with parties that do not necessarily want to negotiate,” he said on a conference call.\nEarlier this month, Delivery Hero Chief Executive Niklas Ostberg said no deal with Takeaway was imminent.\nDelivery Hero is larger overall, with operations across 40 countries.\nTakeaway’s shares were 3.2 percent lower by 1352 GMT.\nReporting by Manon Jacob.
