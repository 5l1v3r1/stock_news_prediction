Once Schultz gained possession, he fed Crosby, who was racing down the right wing.\nCrosby gained the puck in the right circle and deked goaltender Christopher Gibson. Crosby then fired a slap shot under the goalie’s pads as New York defenseman Adam Pelech was hesitant in providing coverage.\nIt was Crosby’s 22nd goal of the season and the 34th of his career against the Islanders.\nPatric Hornqvist and Derick Brassard scored for the Penguins, who rebounded from an 8-4 loss at Boston on Thursday.\nTristan Jarry made 25 saves, including two in overtime during an Islanders power play when the Penguins were called for too many on the ice.\nDefenseman Brandon Davidson and Anders Lee scored for the Islanders, whose losing streak reached a season-high six games.\nGibson made a career-high 47 saves in his fifth career NHL appearance. He became the third Islanders rookie to face at least 50 shots, and moments before the game ended, Gibson made a point-blank stop on Crosby.\nThe Islanders took a 2-1 lead 4:59 into the third when Tavares made a strong individual effort, diving head first for a loose puck and moving toward Lee. Lee poked it into the net off Pittsburgh defenseman Jamie Oleksiak and under Jarry’s blocker for his 31st goal.\nPittsburgh tied the game when Brassard converted Phil Kessel’s cross-ice feed with 8:31 remaining in regulation. Brassard was alone in front of Gibson and simply backhanded the puck into the net for his 19th goal.\nThe Islanders took a 1-0 lead 71 seconds into the game on an odd play. Davidson was attempting to backhand a pass for Lee but the puck went under Jarry, who lost his balance and fell down attempting to make the save.\nThe Penguins tied the game with 1:56 remaining in the second period after Cal Clutterbuck was whistled for boarding. Kessel started a rush up the ice, got the return pass from Evgeni Malkin and whipped a backhand pass from the left circle to Hornqvist, who blew by Brock Nelson and put the shot under Gibson’s legs.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:55:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
