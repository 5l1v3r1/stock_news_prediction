But retaliatory tit-for-tat measures would weigh against market access, a cost to growth with increases in trade prices, costs, and inflation.”\nInvestors will keep an eye on a deluge of data this week, culminating in the U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. The annual opening of the National People’s Congress in China was another focus for investors. China’s parliament has kept the economy’s growth target at 6.5 percent for this year.\nIn commodities, oil prices climbed ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global glut.\nBrent crude was up 25 cents at $64.63 a barrel while U.S. light crude added 23 cents to $61.48.\nSpot gold climbed 0.3 percent to $1,326.46.\nEditing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:10:57.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
