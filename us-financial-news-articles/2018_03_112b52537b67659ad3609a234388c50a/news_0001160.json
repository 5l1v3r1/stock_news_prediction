(NASDAQ: PZZA) (the “Company”), today announced that it has entered into a $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“BofAML”). The Company will acquire shares under the ASR Agreement as part of its $500 million share repurchase authorization previously announced on August 1, 2017.\nPursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, the Company will pay BofAML $100 million in cash and will initially receive a substantial majority of the shares of the Company's common stock it expects to repurchase under the ASR Agreement. The total number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock during the term of the transaction, less an agreed discount and subject to potential adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR Agreement. At final settlement, BofAML may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to the Company, or under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to deliver shares of common stock or to make a cash payment, at its election, to BofAML. The final settlement of the transaction under the ASR is expected to occur no later than the third quarter of 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking information related to the Company’s plans with respect to an accelerated share repurchase that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.
