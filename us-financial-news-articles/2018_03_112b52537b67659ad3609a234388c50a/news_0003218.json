Dozens of armed militia continue to operate there, preying on local populations and exploiting reserves of minerals and other resources.\nReporting By Fiston Mahamba; Additional reporting by Amedee Mwarabu; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:57:59.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
