SURPRISE CAPTAINCY \nThe extraordinary elevation of wicketkeeper Tim Paine as the team’s 46th test captain is a remarkable tale, even considering the circumstances, having last year considered quitting the game after finding himself out of the Tasmania side. \nIt is ironic that Paine made his test debut alongside Smith against Pakistan in 2010, but while the latter soared, he stagnated, only for their roles to be dramatically reversed this week. \nPaine admits the fourth test will not just be about how the Australian team perform, but how their behaviour is viewed by the watching world as they look to put the recent scandal behind them. \n“The one positive that may come of it is guys are going to get an opportunity to play for their country,” Paine told reporters. \n“The whole opportunity for us going forward now is something we can learn from and something we can try to control (is) how we are seen going forward by our Australian public, and become the team that we want to become and they want us to be seen as.” \nSouth Africa have kept the same squad that did duty in Cape Town, with their only real question what to do about the number six batting position, where Theunis de Bruyne and Temba Bavuma have both failed in the series so far. \nIt will be a final international match for fast bowler Morne Morkel, 33, who announced his retirement from international cricket prior to the series. \nHis match-winning aggregate of 9-110 in the last test took his tally of wickets to 306 in 85 tests.
