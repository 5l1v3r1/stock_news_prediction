(NASDAQ:TTPH), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel antibiotics to treat life-threatening multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, today announced the promotion of Larry Edwards, Chief Commercial Officer, to Chief Operating Officer. In his new role as COO Larry will also continue to oversee all aspects of pre-commercialization activities for eravacycline in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).\n“Larry is a natural leader and the best candidate for the role of Tetraphase’s Chief Operating Officer, with his expertise in commercializing and marketing antibiotics and a solid track record of leadership within the company,” said Guy Macdonald, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tetraphase. “As we continue to prepare for the potential commercialization of our lead candidate, eravacycline in cIAI, Larry’s guidance in both the pre-commercial activities, as well as overseeing operations, will be essential in ensuring that we are poised for a strong commercial launch in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of the year, assuming regulatory approvals.”\n“I am thrilled to be taking on this new leadership role at Tetraphase,” said Larry Edwards. “We believe there is significant opportunity for eravacycline in cIAI, and I look forward to continuing to work with the rest of management to prepare to commercialize eravacycline as a new treatment option for patients suffering from these serious, and often life-threatening, MDR gram-negative infections.”\nLarry Edwards joined Tetraphase in 2015 as Vice President of Marketing, became Vice President of Commercial Operations in 2016, and was appointed Chief Commercial Officer in the beginning of 2017.
