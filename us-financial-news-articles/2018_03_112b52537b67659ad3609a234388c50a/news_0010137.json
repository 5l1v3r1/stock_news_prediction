For the same reasons, male survivors rarely receive medical care or psychological support, she said.\n“You’re looking at a situation where no one’s asking men if they were abused,” she said.\nHuman Rights Watch has documented hundreds of cases of women and girls being raped in CAR, but researcher Lewis Mudge said he had encountered only“a handful” of male victims.\nMore research would be needed to show whether rape of men and boys had been systemic, but it was possible, he said.\n“In many ways we don’t tend to think of sexual assault as being something that can affect males,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“I hope that this report gets people to start thinking about that.”\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
