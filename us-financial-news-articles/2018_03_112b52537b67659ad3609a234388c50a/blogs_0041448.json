He cited how Trump at first proposed tariffs that applied to aluminum and steel imports across the board, but subsequently took Mexico and Canada \"off the table.\"\nAsked specifically about China, Priebus cited how the world's second biggest economy sometimes requires importers to transfer proprietary technology to Chinese control — so-called technology transfers. China has weak intellectual property protections, he added.\nThe bigger problem, Priebus indicated, is how the United States doesn't impose big import duties on products such as cars, but U.S. manufacturers must pay tariffs sometimes amounting to \"25 percent, 50 percent\" to other countries. Priebus did not name those countries.\nOther times, he continued, U.S.-made products have to be shipped overseas in components and then reassembled so that U.S. manufacturers can get around tariffs.\nThroughout the interview with CNBC, the former chief of staff had emphatic compliments for his old boss, saying the president \"is a force in and of himself, which the Republican Party has benefited from.\"\nTrump announced over Twitter that he had replaced Priebus with John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who had been serving as Homeland Security secretary, in July of last year .\nPrior to that move, Priebus had become a target of Trump's ire — the president reportedly gave him various deadlines to get a tumultuous White House in order.\nPriebus had led the Republican National Committee before coming to the White House — a job he'd held since 2011.\n—CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T02:08:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
