Merlin, which also runs Legoland, the London Eye, Sea Life and theme parks such as Alton Towers in Britain, had warned on profit in October, saying a series of militant attacks in Britain had hit demand. Its shares have fallen 31 percent over the last year. The world’s second-biggest visitor attractions group behind Walt Disney said on Thursday it made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 474 million pounds - in line with company guidance of 470-480 million pounds and ahead of 433 million pounds made in 2016. Merlin said globally it had a record 66 million visitors in 2017, up 3.5 percent, and was “highly confident” in the long term prospects for the business.
