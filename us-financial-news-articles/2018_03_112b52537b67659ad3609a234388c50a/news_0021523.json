Currency-adjusted operating profit, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before one-offs, is expected to be flat or increase by up to 5 percent, it said on Thursday. Lindeâ€™s on-site business, which supplies gases to large steel or petrochemicals plants, would benefit from a solid project pipeline in 2018 while the healthcare business would be burdened by price reductions, the company said.
