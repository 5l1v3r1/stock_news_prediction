REUTERS/Toby Melville/Pool The Foreign Ministry has invited foreign ambassadors to attend a meeting with arms control experts later on Wednesday to discuss British allegations that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning in southern England, something Russia denies. “The ambassador will not attend and we are considering whether to send a representative at working level,” the embassy spokesman said. Speaking on a visit to Japan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Wednesday that Russia wanted Britain to tell it where Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were currently located. Lavrov said Moscow also wanted to know why the British government had accused Russia of responsibility when the police investigation into the Salisbury incident was incomplete. “Overall there is no doubt that the current British leadership has consciously taken a course to undermine Russian-British relations,” Lavrov said at a news conference with his Japanese counterpart Taro Kono in Tokyo. “If this will continue in the form of any tangible new anti-Russian actions then of course nobody has cancelled the principle of reciprocity. It would be good for everyone and for (the British government) if they stopped getting agitated and calmed down.” Reporting by Andrew Osborn, Maria Kiselyova and Denis Pinchuk; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T12:22:39.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
