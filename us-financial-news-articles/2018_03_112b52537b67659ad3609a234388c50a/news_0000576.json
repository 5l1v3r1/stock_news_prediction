Reuters was not able independently to verify either account.\nThe public prosecutor ordered Mohamed to be detained for 15 days pending investigations, the statement said. It said Mohamed had already been arrested by security forces in the days after the BBC report was published.\nEgypt’s government press centre said this week the BBC report was“fraught with lies” and called for a boycott of the British broadcaster. The BBC said:“We are aware of the reports about this BBC story on Egyptian TV and of the comments of the head of the State Information Service. We stand by the integrity of our reporting teams.”\nEgypt has stepped up a crackdown on media outlets it deems to be publishing reports which might harm national security, as the country approaches a presidential election where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is virtually guaranteed a second term, and the military fights to crush Islamic State militants in the Sinai Peninsula.\nThe public prosecutor earlier this week urged action against outlets publishing what it called false news, and Sisi said defamation of the army or police was tantamount to treason.\nThe public prosecutor also accused Mohamed of joining an illegal group that aimed to undermine state institutions, which a pro-government Egyptian news outlet, Ahram Online, said was a reference to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.\nRights groups say that during Sisi’s presidency, which began a year after he led the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi in 2013, there is a growing crackdown on dissent, including against opposition figures in the upcoming election.\nEditing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T18:47:45.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
