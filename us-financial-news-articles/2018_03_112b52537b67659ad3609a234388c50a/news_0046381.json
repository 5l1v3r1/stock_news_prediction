The House had previously passed a similar version of the measure but had to approve changes the Senate made. Both bodies are controlled by Republicans.\nThe matter will now go for final approval to Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican who has described himself as “100 percent pro-life.” Officials at Bevin’s office could not immediately be reached for comment.
