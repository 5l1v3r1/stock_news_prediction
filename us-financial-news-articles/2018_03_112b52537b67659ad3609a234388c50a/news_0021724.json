As long as you’re not in the water or standing by the edge, then you should be fine.”\nOn Sunday morning, a group of school students and teachers stranded by floods were rescued from a isolated campsite south of the town of Tully, a Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) spokesman said.\nQueensland state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told media on Sunday that it would take several weeks to determine the full extent of the damage, especially on banana and sugar cane crops.\nThe Queensland state government has declared the area a “disaster” zone, while the Insurance Council of Australia has declared it a “catastrophe”, which means that insurance claims will be fast-tracked.\nReporting by Alana Schetzer in MELBOURNE; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T08:21:22.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
