McCabe, who resigned as deputy director in January , remains on the federal payroll and is set to retire Sunday. If he were fired before then, his pension would be at risk. \nSessions is expected to act on the finding soon, and he will likely accept the recommendation, NBC News reported, citing officials familiar with the situation. \nPresident Donald Trump and some congressional Republicans accused McCabe of political bias in his role at the FBI during investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. \nTrump weighed in on McCabe's pending retirement in a December tweet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T21:00:15.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
