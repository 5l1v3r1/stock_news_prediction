We want to know what the news is. Announcing at the beginning of the trading day this would happen at the end was not great for market action. It ramped up uncertainty,” said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital in Pittsburgh.\n“He has a pattern of coming out hard and walking it back. Now we’ll see what he means.”\nAt 2:10 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.67 points, or 0.28 percent, to 24,731.69, the S&P 500 lost 2.32 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,724.48 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.45 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,395.20.\nMajor trading partners Europe and China have warned they would respond to any action by the United States.\n“If he (Trump) does announce much more draconian measures that are going to knock on to other products, I think there will be a sell-off,” said Dec Mullarkey, managing director at Sun Life Investment Management based in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\nExpress Scripts was among the top boosts for the S&P 500, rising 8 percent after health insurer Cigna agreed to buy the pharmacy benefits manager for almost $53 billion. Cigna shares were the biggest drag with a 11.2 percent drop.\nKroger fell more than 12 percent after the supermarket chain’s disappointing full-year profit forecast.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters fell 9.5 percent on concerns over falling margins.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 19 new lows.
