Members of the local New York-North Jersey chapter of the AMC were only informed of the pending sale on Friday, March 2. A vote to approve the sale is scheduled for March 15 th at AMC headquarters in Boston.\nMembers are decrying the move and have mobilized with lawyers, petitions and a protest planned at AMC's headquarters on the 15 th to preserve this treasured spot, situated on 1.4 acres on Long Island's Great South Bay.\nThe property was donated to the AMC in 1928 and is the only 100% volunteer run and led facility in the AMC portfolio. The sale represents a departure from AMC's core values of stewardship and conservation and stands in contradiction to its mission statement to \"protect the places we love, ensuring ongoing access to the Northeast's most precious natural resources for recreation and education.\"\n\"The AMC seems to have turned its back on the stewardship of a precious barrier island ecology,\" said John Maier, a sailing program instructor at the organization. \"The programs and experiences available at the Fire Island Cabin are unlike those at any other AMC property. Selling the property will only increase development in this precious ecosystem. It would be a direct negation of the mission of the AMC to turn the property over to private hands, and it would be unconscionable to do so without an open dialogue with the members of the AMC.\"\nThe Atlantique property includes a main house, which sleeps 24, and an education center. It is open from May to October, and more than 2,000 people enjoy the facilities every season. It offers members an accessible and affordable way to explore a unique destination, educate themselves about ocean and bay ecology, and utilize the Cabin's fleet of kayaks, canoes and sailboats.\nMembers and their guests have attended workshops led by the Fire Island National Seashore, the Littoral Society, Audubon Society and others. Monarch butterflies and horseshoe crabs use the property on their annual migrations. Select weekends are devoted to families and young members to educate them about this unique ecosystem.\nMembers have started a petition on Change.org to stop the sale: http://bit.ly/2Fwa6We . They're also hitting back on social media with #StopAMCSellout and are organizing a trip to Boston on March 15 th to attend the Board of Directors Meeting. Individuals can register to participate on Eventbrite: http://bit.ly/2FufNAU\nThe Fire Island Cabin Committee is a group of volunteers responsible for the financial, administrative and programming decisions of the Cabin.\nMedia Contact:\nHelen Patrikis\nHP-PR\nHelen@hp-pr.cm\n631-553-1370\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/controversial-sale-by-conservation-group-threatens-future-of-fire-island-eco-property-300611474.html\nSOURCE Fire Island Cabin Committee of the Appalachian Mountain Club", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2Fwa6We", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/controversial-sale-by-conservation-group-threatens-future-of-fire-island-eco-property-300611474.html", "http://bit.ly/2FufNAU"], "published": "2018-03-09T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:25:46.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
