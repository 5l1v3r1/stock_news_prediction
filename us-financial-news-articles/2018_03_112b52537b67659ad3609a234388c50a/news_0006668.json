(Nasdaq:LOCO) today announced financial results for the 13-week period ended December 27, 2017.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter ended December 27, 2017, compared to the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2016 were as follows:\nTotal revenue increased 2.9% to $95.2 million compared to $92.5 million. System-wide comparable restaurant sales increased 1.4%, including a 0.9% increase for company-operated restaurants, and a 1.9% increase for franchised restaurants. Net loss was $38.0 thousand, a decrease compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year. Fourth quarter of 2017 included a $16.4 million pre-tax expense related to the full impairment of the assets of 12 restaurants, net of closed-store reserve. Pro forma net income (1) was $4.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to $4.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $13.4 million, compared to $14.3 million.\n(1) Pro forma net income and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to each of these measures is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nSteve Sather, President and Chief Executive Officer of El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc., stated, \"Fourth quarter results included system-wide comparable store sales growth of 1.4%, as well as adjusted EBITDA of $13.4 million. In the face of the current challenging environment, we are focused on increasing sales by driving our differentiation through our authenticity media message and new value initiatives. We also continue to invest in restaurant training and the development of our technology platforms, including delivery and loyalty. We are confident that these will deliver consistent sales growth over the long term.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nCompany-operated restaurant revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 3.3% to $89.3 million, compared to $86.5 million in the same period last year. The growth in company-operated restaurant revenue was largely driven by the 24 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by 5 restaurant closures during the same time period.\nComparable company-operated restaurant sales in the fourth quarter increased 0.9%, driven by a 1.9% increase in average check, partially offset by a 1.0% decrease in transactions.\nFranchise revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 1.5% to $5.9 million, compared to $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in franchise revenue was largely driven by a decline in franchise and development agreement fees. This was partially offset by the contribution from the 14 new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by 2 restaurant closures during the same period, and a 1.9% increase in franchised comparable restaurant sales during the quarter.\nRestaurant contribution was $16.6 million or 18.5% of company-operated restaurant revenue, compared to $16.0 million, or 18.5% of company-operated restaurant revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. The restaurant contribution margin was consistent between the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, primarily due to lower commodity costs, mostly related to chicken pricing, and lower group insurance costs due to lower claims activity, offset by higher labor costs, due to increased minimum wage, and higher other operating expenses associated with new restaurants opened in 2016 and 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $16.4 million expense related to the impairment of the assets of 11 restaurants in Texas and one in Arizona, net of closed-store reserve. This impairment charge included the entire remaining value of capitalized assets of all of our company-operated restaurants in Texas, net of previously recorded depreciation.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $38.0 thousand, compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Pro forma net income was $4.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation between GAAP net income and pro forma net income is included in the accompanying financial data.\n2018 Outlook\nBased on current information, the Company is providing the following earnings guidance for the fiscal year 2018.\nThe Company expects 2018 pro forma diluted net income per share ranging from $0.68 to $0.73. This compares to pro forma diluted net income per share of $0.63 in 2017. Pro forma net income guidance for fiscal year 2018 is based, in part, on the following annual assumptions:\nSystem-wide comparable restaurant sales growth of approximately flat; The opening of 6-8 new company-owned restaurants and 6-8 new franchised restaurants; Restaurant contribution margin of 18.7% to 19.6%; G&A expenses of between 8.8% and 9.0% of total revenue excluding CEO transition costs and legal fees related to securities related litigation; Pro forma income tax rate of 26.5%; and Adjusted EBITDA of between $61.0 and $64.0 million.\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\nComparable restaurant sales reflect the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable company, franchised and total system restaurant base. The comparable restaurant base is defined to include those restaurants open for 15 months or longer. For the 52 week period ending on December 27, 2017, there were 181 restaurants in our comparable company-operated restaurant base and 424 restaurants in our comparable system restaurant base.\nRestaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company-operated restaurant revenue less company restaurant expenses, which are food and paper costs, labor and related expenses and occupancy and other operating expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of net company-operated restaurant revenue. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as identified in the GAAP reconciliation in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nPro forma net income is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Pro forma net income represents net income adjusted for (i) costs (or gains) related to loss (or gains) on disposal of assets and asset impairment and closed store costs, (ii) amortization expense and other estimate adjustments (whether expense or income) incurred on the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) completed at the time of our IPO, (iii) legal costs associated with a securities class action lawsuit, (iv) expenses and gains on the recovery of insurance proceeds for the reimbursement of property and equipment, and expenses related to a fire at one of our restaurants in 2015, (v) insurance proceeds received related to securities class action legal expenses, (vi) costs associated with the transition of our CEO and (vii) provision for income taxes at a normalized tax rate of 39.5% and 40.0% for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 27, 2017 and December 28, 2016, respectively, which reflects our estimated long-term effective tax rate, including both federal and state income taxes. See the GAAP reconciliation in the accompanying financial data and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.
