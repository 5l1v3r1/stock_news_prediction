Determined to make an honest living, he takes a series of menial jobs before spiraling into binge drinking and joining a burglary ring. One of the thieves has a grudge against Franz, and is determined to crush his body and spirit. We observe as Franz, battered by forces beyond his control, is broken down, and as he builds himself up again.\nFranz’s fate unfurls around the Weimar era’s famously down-at-the-heels Alexanderplatz, and Döblin intersperses his story with overheard conversations, weather reports, advertisements, parallel mini-narratives and interjections by the narrator. “Franz Biberkopf is not just anyone,” Döblin advises us in Michael Hofmann’s bold new translation. “I have not summoned him for my own amusement, but for his heavy, true and illuminating fate to be experienced.” In truth, though, we care about his fate precisely because he is “just anyone”; Franz is a low-life, and he lives and talks like one.\nWalter Benjamin said of “Berlin Alexanderplatz”: “The book is a monument to all things Berlin because the narrator doesn’t care about promoting the city like some local partisan. He speaks through it. Berlin is his megaphone.” Yet in English the reception of Döblin’s cacophonous, colloquial Berlin has been fraught: It can be fiendishly difficult to translate his dialogue, which in German edges just beyond common usage, freely throwing around slang and melting into malapropisms. Because of its use of collage, stream of consciousness, and colloquial speech, “Berlin Alexanderplatz” has frequently been compared to Joyce’s “Ulysses” and John Dos Passos’s “Manhattan Transfer,” comparisons that do much to assert its status as a “great book” but little to aid deeper understanding of it.\nBerlin Alexanderplatz By Alfred Döblin\nNYRB, 458 pages, $18.95\n“Berlin Alexanderplatz” was an instant classic in its homeland, but English critics responded tepidly to Eugene Jolas’s 1931 translation. “Many will feel,” grumbled the New York Times, “not that it is a great novel—as the German critics insist—but that it is, rather, an audacious adventure.” Nearly 80 years later, Ian Buruma in the New York Review of Books was still accusing Jolas of rendering the Berlin dialect in “Brooklynese,” though to my ear his characters sound more like displaced farmhands. (Jolas’s conversations are sprinkled with jarring instances of “pardner” or “m’boy,” an unhappy proportion of contractions like “’y’know” and “y’see,” and even a “Hop to it, little filly!”—all of which mark it as spoken speech that is nonetheless impossible to imagine anyone speaking.) Susan Sontag remarked that on a list of the 10 best novels of the 20th century, “probably the least familiar title on it is Berlin Alexanderplatz .” Today, the novel’s memory is alive in the English-speaking consciousness mainly due to Rainer Fassbinder’s 15-hour-long film adaptation, arguably its definitive translation.\nBeneath the book’s innovative style, the reader can hear the gears of ancient narrative elements grinding: evocations of folk songs, myths and Old Testament stories, and themes of tragedy and fate. For as jarring as Döblin’s tactics may be, Franz is as complex as any character in a traditional novel. In Mr. Hofmann’s translation, we learn that Franz, previously “a cement worker, then furniture removal man and so forth, currently newspaper seller, weighs nigh on two hundredweight. He has the strength of a cobra snake and has joined an athletics club again. Decked out in green puttees, hobnail boots and a bomber jacket. You won’t find much money on him, it only comes to him in small amounts, but even so it’s worth trying to get to know him. Is he prey to conscience from back then . . . ? Uh uh .” The novel’s namesake, Alexanderplatz, looms as large as Franz. It is the seedy milieu of criminality and poverty, old temptations and familiar faces, a place whose fetid atmosphere reabsorbs him with nearly literal physicality: “He immersed himself happily in the street. A chill wind blew, mixed with the aromas of each respective building, cellar fug, domestic and imported fruit, petrol.”\nTranslating this book is not really about finding le mot juste because Döblin, who despised Thomas Mann’s fussy aestheticism, often seems little interested in the exercise himself. “Berlin Alexanderplatz” is a lumbering leviathan, all rough edges, and the translator’s challenge is to master its crude, prodigious energies. There are many passages in Mr. Hofmann’s translation that I do not like, but few that I can truly call wrong. The translator has instincts all his own, and it’s a good thing, too. His excesses are appropriate to Döblin’s own. Even attempting to translate “Berlin Alexanderplatz” took something whose vocabulary seems increasingly antiquated to us: gusto, chutzpah, guts.\nInterestingly, in his afterword Mr. Hofmann reveals himself to be one of Jolas’s few defenders. He points out that reviewers in his own time tended to pillory Jolas for what they didn’t like about Döblin; English-speaking readers today are more accustomed to the modernist techniques Döblin was just introducing. Reading Jolas’s translation today, it doesn’t seem particularly bad—except for the dialogue. But in a book like this, that’s too important to get more than a little wrong. Mr. Hofmann captures more of the suppleness of the way people really talk, and he benefits from being less literal than Jolas and less tied down by the English idioms of his time. Ultimately, Mr. Hofmann’s better translation condemns Jolas’s to the dustbin, so Mr. Hofmann can afford to be gracious in delivering his coup de grâce.\nTranslation is always an act of demystification, and always incomplete: Success belongs to those who understand they are playing a game of compromises, of defeat conceded a sentence at a time. But translating is also a game of bold bluffs and canny sleight-of-hand. And Mr. Hofmann is an excellent bluffer. Toward the end of the book, Franz laments, “I know God made the world, but I wish a priest would tell me why.” Now we have another chance in English to contemplate the largeness of Franz’s small fate. Döblin made a world, and the point of a good translation is to let us begin to understand what it all means.\n—Ms. DeMarco is a translator living in Berlin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T15:01:43.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
