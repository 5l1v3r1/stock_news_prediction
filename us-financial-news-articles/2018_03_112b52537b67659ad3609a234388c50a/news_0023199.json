The trends are clear,” said Zhou, referring to high debt ratios.\nZhou pointed to a moderation in China’s broad M2 money supply growth last year as evidence that the official “de-risking” and “de-leveraging” campaign was working.\nThe PBOC said on Friday that M2 growth was 8.8 percent on-year in February, higher than January’s 8.6 percent growth but down from 11.1 percent in the year-ago period.\nFinancial risks from private financial conglomerates that used highly leveraged acquisitions to expand rapidly in recent years have come to forefront with the government seizure of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd.\nThe central bank is drafting rules on financial holding companies, PBOC Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng said at the same news conference.\nEarlier this week, Premier Li Keqiang announced a growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, the same level that it handily beat in 2017 thanks in part to massive government infrastructure spending and record bank lending.
