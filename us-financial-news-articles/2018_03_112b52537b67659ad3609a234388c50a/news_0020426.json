The property is approximately one mile from LaGuardia Airport at 1 Bulova Avenue, provides six dock-high and one grade-level loading positions, parking for 168 cars and is 23% leased to one tenant on a short-term basis. The estimated stabilized cap rate of the property is 5.7%.\nEstimated stabilized cap rates are calculated as annualized cash basis net operating income stabilized to market occupancy (generally 95%) divided by total acquisition cost. Total acquisition cost includes the initial purchase price, the effects of marking assumed debt to market, buyer’s due diligence and closing costs, estimated near-term capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to achieve stabilization.\nTerreno Realty Corporation acquires, owns and operates industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets: Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, D.C.\nAdditional information about Terreno Realty Corporation is available on the company’s web site at www.terreno.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
