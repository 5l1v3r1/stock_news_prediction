Miami Subs continues to transition to the upscale, fast-casual format of Miami Grill, with a South Beach vibe and an \"Everything Goes\" menu.\nFourth quarter blows away sales projections with comparable store sales up double digits and transactions significantly increasing. The momentum of the sales increase from 2017 has continued at a record-shattering pace in 2018, with both comp sales and transactions up double digits in January and February.\nAccording to Black Box Intelligence, a financial performance benchmark company for the restaurant industry, the industry's same-store sales for January and February were down three-tenths of a percent and eight-tenths of a percent respectively. Industry transactions were down three percent in January and 3.1 percent in February. By contrast, Miami Grill experienced a 15 percent positive same-store sales swing in January and 16.6 percent swing in February. Transactions were a positive 14.6 percent same-store swing in January and 17 percent swing in February.\nAccording to Jonathan H. Vogel, Miami Grill's chief operating officer, \"Performance was aided by strategic marketing campaigns, improved restaurant operations, technology innovations, continuing renovations and a strong alliance with UberEATS, creating an incremental revenue channel for our franchisees and exceeding our financial objectives.\"\nMiami Grill's partnership with UberEATS has contributed an 11 percent incremental revenue stream system-wide. Check averages for UberEATS are 40 percent greater than current guest check averages, far surpassing Miami Grill's financial goals for the delivery platform.\nIn the fourth quarter, the brand returned to the very loyal and successful market of Jacksonville. This marks the beginning of a concentrated expansion plan into Central and North Florida including new locations in Gainesville, Daytona Speedway and Orlando all under construction. The brand continues to aggressively develop markets both nationally and internationally.\nAbout Miami Grill\nSouth-Florida based Miami Grill is the hottest fast-casual concept to hit the market, developed by the same owners as Miami Subs, Miami Subs Capital Partners 1 Inc. and key equity partner Armando Christian \"Pitbull\" PÃ©rez.
