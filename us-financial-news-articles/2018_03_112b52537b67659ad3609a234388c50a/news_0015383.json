A reading above 50 indicates an increase in the pace of activity.\nOn an adjusted basis, supplier deliveries climbed to 53.7 from 46.4. But employment pulled back to 52.4 from 56.5, while inventories also declined to 52.4 from 58.4.\nPrices paid for inputs declined to 64.2 from 66.6, suggesting pressure on firmsâ€™ operating margins may ease.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:30:54.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
