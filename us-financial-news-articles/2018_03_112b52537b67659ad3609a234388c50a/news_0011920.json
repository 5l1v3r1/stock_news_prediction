It is encouraging to see an accelerated revenue growth of 33.0% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2017, which exceed our previously issued guidance. The solid topline growth was primarily driven by our growing student base in professional education, with a 27.2% enrollment growth in the quarter. Additionally, student enrollment in kid education programs continued to achieve robust momentum, up by 270.4% year over year in the fourth quarter.\"\n\"Despite challenging market conditions in the year, fiscal year 2017 as a whole was a year of successful business expansion and enlarged market presence. We added a net of 39 learning centers and rolled out to thirteen new cities during the year. At the same time, we undertook new content initiatives to enhance our core competency as a top level comprehensive education services provider. Our course portfolio has been further extended and upgraded to best cater to the market demand for new technology through our proprietary curriculum development platform, strategic alliances with well-known international enterprises and joint major programs with universities and colleges. In particular, Python and other AI related courses are gaining popularity, which we believe will gradually become the new driver for future enrollment growth.\" Mr. Han continued.\n\"We are also proud to see that our investments in Tongcheng and Tongmei started to bear fruit. Leveraging on the teaching resources and facilities with professional education business, our k-12 business has quickly expanded into 24 cities, with 30 separate centers and 28 shared centers nationwide by the end of 2017. As a result, total number of kid student enrollments more than tripled in 2017. Looking ahead, we will continue the well-paced expansion plan and further optimize center network with more refined assessment metrics at each level of organization to quicken the mature period of new centers. We believe our growth strategy will strengthen the solid foundation for our long term growth for both topline and bottom line.\" Mr. Han concluded.\nMr. Yuduo Yang, Tarena's Chief Financial Officer added, \"Fourth quarter recovered enrollment growth in professional education business and exciting performance in k-12 education reflected our ability to harvest from capacity expansion and new course development efforts in recent quarters. We allocated more advertisement and marketing resources at the end of fourth quarter to improve utilization of facilities. The year-over-year decline of utilization rate narrowed to approximately 210 basis points from 340 basis points in the previous quarter. Despite the fact that our costs associated with the marketing efforts were incurred ahead of the revenue ramp and most of the tuition fees from new student enrollment in the fourth quarter will be recognized next quarter, we will increasingly benefit from economies of scale and margin pressure will gradually lessen over the coming quarters. With solid business execution and strong market demand, we are confident to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.\"\nDividend\nThe Company announced today that its board of directors has approved and declared a cash dividend of US$0.12 per ordinary share, including both Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares.

The increase was primarily due to increased course enrollments and to a lesser extent, an increase in the standard tuition fees.\nTotal course enrollments[6] in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 26.0% to 35,145 from 27,897 in the same period in 2016, which was mainly driven by the expansion in seat capacity and the popularity of our course offerings. The number of our course offerings increased to 20 from 18 in the fourth quarter, while the total seat capacity[7] in our learning centers increased by 11.5% to 56,984 as of December 31,2017 from 51,127 as of December 31, 2016 to cater to the increased demand for our courses.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2017, we raised the standard tuition fees on some of our courses by RMB1,000 to RMB 2000 per course. We charge students enrolled through the retail channel our standard tuition fee and provide students enrolled through the university channel a discount of approximately RMB4,000 per person per course. Our student enrollment mix from retail and university channel was 84%/16% and 81%/19% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues increased by 37.4% to RMB169.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB123.4 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses resulting from growing number of teaching and advisory staff at our learning centers, rental cost resulting from higher seat capacity, as well as depreciation expenses for the growing number of learning centers.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit increased by 31.3% to RMB447.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB340.6 million in the same period in 2016. Gross margin was 72.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 73.4% in the same period in 2016. The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to expansion in center network. Our overall center utilization rate[8] in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 69.6%, compared with 71.7% in the same period in 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by 53.1% to RMB374.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB244.6 million in the same period in 2016.

Total share-based compensation expenses allocated to the related operating expenses increased by 18.5% to RMB26.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB22.2 million in the same period in 2016.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased by 58.6% to RMB219.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB138.5 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses related to the growth in our selling and marketing headcount, and expanded marketing efforts as we expanded our course offerings and network of learning centers.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 44.7% to RMB122.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB84.6 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses for our increased number of general and administrative personnel to support our growing operations. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 50.1% to RMB102.7 million, from RMB68.4 million in the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses increased by 50.6% to RMB32.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, from RMB21.5 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses of our instructors and teaching assistants allocated to their system and content development activities for our courses, as well as growing number of research and development staff as we expanded our course offerings and operations.\nOperating Income\nOperating income was RMB72.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB96.0 million in the same period in 2016. Operating margin was 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 20.7% in the same period in 2016.

Interest income in both periods consisted of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and time deposits in commercial banks and interest income recognized in relation to our installment payment plan for students. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher tuition interest income in relation to our installment payment plan for students, as well as higher bank deposits.\nForeign Exchange Gain (Loss)\nForeign exchange loss was RMB1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB6.2 million foreign exchange gain in the same period in 2016. The loss was mainly attributable to the appreciation of China's RMB against U.S. Dollar as the Company had converted its offshore bank deposits previously in RMB into US dollars in May 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe Company recorded an income tax expense of RMB12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB9.9 million in the same period in 2016.

Non-GAAP net income, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, was RMB101.3 million, compared to a non-GAAP net income of RMB126.7 million in the same period in 2016.\nCash Flow\nNet cash inflow from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB36.3 million, compared to RMB55.5 million in the same period in 2016. The change was mainly due to lower net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 and longer credit granting and tuition payment procedures from third party financing institutions for students. Capital expenditures for the quarter were RMB53.1 million.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income per ADS\nBasic and diluted net income per ADS in the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB1.33 and RMB1.28, respectively.

For further information, please visit http://ir.tedu.cn .\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2016, the Company revised its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact, in addition to its historical practice of excluding share-based compensation expenses for non-GAAP results.\nTo supplement Tarena's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Tarena's management uses non-GAAP measures of cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and basic and diluted net income per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\nTarena's management believes that excluding the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items identified as non-recurring and infrequent in nature, and non-cash charges. The amount of share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact are not built into the Company's annual budgets and quarterly forecasts, which generally will be the basis for information Tarena provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of Tarena's current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), excluding the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact is that the share-based compensation charge has been and will continue to be a recurring expense in the Company's business for the foreseeable future, and gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact may recur in the future. In order to mitigate these limitations the Company has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.\nFor further information, please contact:\nHelen Song\nInvestor Relations\nTarena International Inc.\nTel: +8610 56219451\nEmail: ir@tedu.cn", "external_links": ["http://ir.tedu.cn/"], "published": "2018-03-06T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T02:44:56.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
