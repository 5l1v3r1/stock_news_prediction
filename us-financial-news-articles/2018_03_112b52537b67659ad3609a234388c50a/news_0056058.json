Last week EU leaders condemned what they described as ‘continued illegal actions’ by Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean.\nThe encounter between Akinci and Anastasiades will take place at the residence of the U.N. envoy on the island, Elizabeth Spehar, in a ‘buffer zone’ compound used by peacekeepers straddling the two sides in Nicosia, the divided capital.\nA U.N. mission has been on the island since the early 1960s, when a power-sharing administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots crumbled amid violence just three years after independence from Britain.\nWriting By Michele Kambas; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T19:11:30.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
