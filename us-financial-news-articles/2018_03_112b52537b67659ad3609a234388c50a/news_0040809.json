Australia, a staunch U.S. ally with no claim to the South China Sea, has long maintained its neutrality in the dispute to protect its economic relationship with China.\nBut bilateral relations have soured in recent months after Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said China was improperly interfering in Canberra's affairs, an accusation that triggered a rare protest from Beijing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T05:40:09.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
