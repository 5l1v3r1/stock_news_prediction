Cutting them would free up more capital to fund productive sectors of the economy. \nGreek lenders had NPEs totaling 14.5 billion euros ($16.32 billion), or 5.5 percent of loans, when the global financial crisis began in 2008. \nWhile NPEs soared to 106.9 billion or 50.5 percent of loans at the end of June 2016, banks have agreed with European Central Bank regulators to shrink them to 64.6 billion by end-2019, meaning the NPE ratio will fall to 35.2 percent of their loan books. \nThe agreed targets are back-loaded, meaning most of the reduction will take place this year and in 2019. \nThe reduction in the fourth quarter was the highest quarterly drop since the start of the crisis, the central bank said, brought about mainly by write-offs of 2.1 billion euros and loan sales of 1.8 billion. \nThe fourth quarter also saw improved collections and liquidations. Default rates slowed and were lower than the pace of restoring loans back to performing status (cure rate), it said. \nThe central bank noted more progress on consumer and business loan NPEs compared to sour mortgages during the fourth quarter. \nAt the end of December 2017, the NPE ratio of mortgages was 43.4 percent, that of consumer loans 49.3 percent with sour business loans at 41.8 percent. Coverage by loan-loss provisions was 47.4 percent, slightly down from the third quarter. \nGreece’s four major banks - Piraeus, National , Eurobank and Alpha - and three less systemic banks submit data on nine operational targets.
