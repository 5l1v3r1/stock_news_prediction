Cricket - England Nets - Brightside Ground, Bristol, Britain - September 23, 2017 England's Alex Hales during nets Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra \nWarner was stood down as Sunrisers captain and banned from this year’s IPL following the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. \n“Welcome @AlexHales1 look forward to seeing you in Hyderabad. #OrangeArmy #SRH,” Sunrisers coach Tom Moody tweeted following the announcement. \nHales, who was signed for his base price of 10 million Indian rupees ($153,586), went unsold in the players auction in January. \nHales is the only England player to have scored a Twenty20 International century. The 29-year-old was previously picked by the Mumbai Indians but has not played a game in the IPL. \nWarner led the Sunrisers to their maiden IPL title in 2016 and had agreed a 120 million Indian rupees deal in January to remain with the team in 2018. \nSunrisers will be led by New Zealand’s Kane Williamson this season.
