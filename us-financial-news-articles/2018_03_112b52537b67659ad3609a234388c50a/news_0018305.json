In others, it's easy. And in others like New Hampshire, it takes extra planning to protect the winner's identity. \nHere are some other tips for lottery winners. 1. Take a deep breath \nTypically, lottery winners have three months to stake their claim. Before you decide to prove you've won, however, it's best to first enlist the help of a team of pros: an attorney (this should be your first call), a financial planner and an accountant. Make sure you choose these professionals carefully. 2. Remain anonymous if possible \nIt's best not to announce to the world that you've won. An attorney can help create a legal entity — i.e., a revocable trust or a family limited partnership — that protects your identity . \nIf you can't avoid publicity (some states require publishing your identity), consider changing your phone number, or living somewhere else temporarily. That will help avoid media attention and sudden money requests from long-lost friends or relatives you never knew you had. show chapters 10:30 AM ET Sun, 8 Oct 2017 | 01:15 3. Choose a lump sum or annual payments \nFigure out whether to take the lump sum or 30 allotments over 29 years. This decision is often made based on your tax situation. This is when relying on the advice of pros (and not family) makes sense. 4. Consider the big picture \nBefore spending a dime, think about what this sudden wealth means — not only financially, but emotionally. \nGive yourself time to process the magnitude of your win. This is often when winners begin to think about their legacy and what societal contributions they want to make. Some even set up their own charitable organizations. \nMore from Personal Finance:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T22:07:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
