S&P Global Ratings and Fitch already rate South African debt as “junk”.\nA downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody’s could see South African debt lose its place in Citi’s World Government Bond Index, the biggest of the global benchmarks and tracked by $2 trillion to $3 trillion of funds.\nOn the stock market, the Top-40 index rose 2.4 percent to 52,257 points while the broader all-share index finished 2.3 percent up at 59,242.\nTiger Brands’ shares rose 2.5 percent to 403 rand, having hit a three-month low on Monday after it recalled products produced by its Enterprise unit after the source of a listeria outbreak that has killed 180 people was traced to its manufacturing facility.
