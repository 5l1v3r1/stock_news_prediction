That, I think, is the revelation.\" \nWaldinger, the director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development , said in a viral 2015 \" TED Talk \" released in 2015, that \"good relationships keep us happier and healthier.\" \nThe ongoing Harvard study is considered one of the world's longest studies of adult life, having started in 1938 during the Great Depression. \n\"Our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships, with family, with friends, with community,\" Waldinger said in the TED Talk. \nThe study aims to shed light on how \"psychosocial variables and biological processes from earlier in life predict health and well-being in late life (80's and 90's), what aspects of childhood and adult experience predict the quality of intimate relationships in late life and how late-life marriage is linked with health and well-being,\" according to the study's website. \n\"Most of what we know about human life, we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20,\" Waldinger said. \"We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life and sometimes memory is downright creative.\" \nIn the past 79 years, the researchers tracked the lives of 724 men, following up with each one on an annual basis to ask about their work, home lives and health. \nThey not only received questionnaires, Waldinger said, but they were also interviewed in their homes, provided their medical records from their doctors, got their blood drawn, their brains scanned and let the researchers talk to their children. show chapters 11:54 AM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 | 01:01 \nThe participants were broken up into two groups: The first group started in the study as sophomores at Harvard College and finished college during World War II, with most heading off to serve in the war. The second was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, selected specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s, Waldinger said. \nAfter gaining tens of thousands of pages of research data based on these participants, Waldinger said, the clearest message from the study is that \"good relationships keep us happier and healthier.\" \nHere are the three lessons you can learn about relationships from the study, according to Waldinger: Social connections are 'really good' for you \nWaldinger said the first lesson you can take is that \"social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills.\" \n\"It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community are happier, they're physically healthier and they live longer than people who are less well connected,\" he said. \nOn the contrary, keeping to yourself and experiencing loneliness is toxic. Waldinger points out that people can even feel lonely in a crowd of people or in their marriage. \n\"People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely,\" Waldinger explained.

Meanwhile, those in unhappy relationships had their physical pain magnified by being in more emotional pain. Good relationships actually protect your brain \nWaldinger explained that in addition to positively affecting your physical and emotional health, good relationships have the power to sharpen your memory. \nPeople who are in relationships where they feel they can count on their partner in times of need actually have a sharper, longer-lasting ability to remember things. \nAll the same, those who were in a relationship where they felt they couldn't count on their partner experienced early memory decline.To clarify, it's not that the researchers found that people in good relationships were flawless or had to be easygoing all the time. \n\"As long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories,\" Waldinger said. \nIf you want to be happier and have stronger, positive relationships, Waldinger recommended \"replacing screen time with people time,\" \"livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,\" such as long walks or date nights, or \"reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years.\" \n\"Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous,\" he said. \"It's also lifelong. It never ends.\" ", "external_links": ["https://embed.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness", "http://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/", "https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness", "https://www.facebook.com/CNBCMakeIt/", "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/"], "published": "2018-03-20T16:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T16:14:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
