The Altan brothers were accused of giving coded messages on a television talk show a day before the coup attempt.\nThe verdict drew criticism from rights groups and international bodies, including the United Nations. It is widely seen as the latest example of a crackdown under President Tayyip Erdogan. Since the coup more than 50,000 people have been jailed and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs.\nOn Wednesday, a court sentenced Altan to a total of five years and 11 months on two different charges related to an article he wrote for the Haberdar news website, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.\nThe court ruled the language he used to describe the Kurdish conflict in southeast Turkey - where he wrote of “children” digging trenches to fight Turkish soldiers - attempted to portray the actions of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) as innocent, Anadolu said.\nThe PKK, considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, the European Union and Turkey, has waged a three-decade insurgency in the largely Kurdish southeast.\nThe court also ruled the same article had insulted Erdogan, Anadolu said. Insulting the president is a crime in Turkey.\nAltan, a well known journalist and author who had previously been editor of the now-defunct liberal newspaper Taraf, was detained for some 17 months before his life sentence was handed down this month.\n“We will spend the rest of our lives alone in a cell that is three meters long and three meters wide. We will be taken out to see sunlight for one hour a day,” he wrote in a New York Times essay published on Wednesday.\n“We will never be pardoned and we will die in a prison cell.” (Editing by David Dolan)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:26:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
