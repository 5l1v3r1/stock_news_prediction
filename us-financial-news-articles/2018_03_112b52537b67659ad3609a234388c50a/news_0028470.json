The company reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of $0.08 per share compared to earnings of $0.05 per share in the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.05 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We are pleased with the growth in revenue driven by healthcare, materials, software and on demand manufacturing, as well as more balanced regional execution experienced in the fourth quarter,” commented Vyomesh Joshi (VJ), chief executive officer, 3D Systems. “While we still have work to do, we made significant progress last year, and we believe our investments in go-to-market combined with improved processes and better execution have started to show returns and position the company well going forward.”\nDemand across categories fueled growth during the fourth quarter, driven by strong execution in EMEA and improved execution in the Americas and Asia. The company reported revenue growth in healthcare, materials, software and on demand manufacturing as well as higher printer unit sales in the fourth quarter.\nThe company reported gross profit margin of 48.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 50.0 percent in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Gross profit cost reduction initiatives in 2017 were offset by additional investments in services and on demand manufacturing.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, operating expenses were $91.2 million compared to $78.8 million in the prior year period. SG&A expenses increased 18 percent to $68.2 million, which included continued investment in go-to-market and IT transformation. R&D expenses increased nine percent over the fourth quarter of 2016 to $23.0 million, including continued investments in support of several new products the company unveiled in November 2017, which are planned to be commercially available over the coming months.\n”We continued our strategic investments in organizational and operational improvements which we believe are critical for long term success,” commented John McMullen, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “We made progress in many areas this year, from better analytics, processes and operational cadence to IT infrastructure and supply chain optimization. We continue to be focused on the decisions and actions needed to drive appropriate cost structure, while at the same time, positioning the company for long term growth.”\nDuring the quarter, the company generated $8.2 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with $136.3 million of cash on hand.\nFor the full year 2017, revenue increased two percent to $646.1 million compared to $633.0 million in 2016. The company reported a GAAP loss of $0.59 per share for the full year 2017 compared to a loss of $0.35 per share in the prior year, and reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.02 per share for the full year 2017 compared to a non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share in 2016.\n“We made significant progress in 2017 to stabilize and turn around the company, and we put in place the foundation for scalable growth. This is a multi-year transformation process, but we are pleased with the progress we have made thus far to position the company for long-term growth and profitability. We are focused on execution, driving operational efficiencies and bringing our new innovative and disruptive products to market to drive the shift to 3D production,” concluded Joshi.\nQ4 2017 Conference Call and Webcast\nThe company expects to file its Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2018. 3D Systems plans to hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss these results on Wednesday, March 14, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nDate: Wednesday, March 14, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time\nListen via Internet: www.3dsystems.com/investor\nParticipate via telephone:\nWithin the U.S.: 1-877-407-8291\nOutside the U.S.: 1-201-689-8345\nA replay of the webcast will be available approximately two hours after the live presentation at www.3dsystems.com/investor .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The value of each of these investments is assessed periodically, and impairment recorded when required. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, the adjustment included $1.7 in interest and other expense, net. The Company excluded this amount as it is not related to on-going operations, and intends to exclude these impairment amounts from non-GAAP net income going forward.

Tax effect for each quarter ended after March 31, 2016 was calculated based on the Company's quarterly U.S. tax rate of 0%, which is due to valuation allowances in connection with GAAP net losses. The amount in the fourth quarter of 2016 also includes $1.2 related to an adjustment for a prior period. 6 Denominator based on weighted average shares used in the GAAP EPS calculation.\nInvestor Contact: Stacey Witten Media Contact: Greg Caldwell\nEmail: investor.relations@3dsystems.com Email: press@3dsystems.com\nSource:3D Systems Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yBqkQMqKBI0_SWXF1Yx9Rvuhh3bAtmf3J_fKlKNkdNUtvAI9RmqE2uHW1qhzaarvznrzy6ST6xtbS0-pYRLGrY1_6pBf4SbGgJTiHXWjECirEh8mp6e2zkyBRWR80PqW", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c1fe14d5-b586-4dca-a30b-fdfd171ae76f", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yBqkQMqKBI0_SWXF1Yx9Rvuhh3bAtmf3J_fKlKNkdNVyac-5BGEonih3HEFx5SGchk1k709RUg9XYK_lSfYgXmZDFB3bQF3MxegYQWBsoEo0Oo9kSjNKhdUTzuybmfM9", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M-N2djk1u_G2CXCHYHabDC30Zl8xWpsNlBcBQ7_JJ07DrNNHft1BRHkekNiwwlGv8IRsquil2XVrHcYylvC2roeWJiNxKG5pWr6jYNVlLiw=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yBqkQMqKBI0_SWXF1Yx9RlSwVmkM3F11o4YKQ9rMbJQIZG6rKtBeulhCmfpdpvRb66XPfB8W91ECj2ZF5b6BkIRzYwJf0FFSlRa6W0-YyoA="], "published": "2018-03-14T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T02:11:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
