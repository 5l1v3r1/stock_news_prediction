(NASDAQ:VYGR), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing treatments for severe neurological diseases today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, provided corporate highlights, goals and financial guidance and will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results.\n“Our strong performance in 2017 was underscored by advancing our lead program VY-AADC for advanced Parkinson’s disease including successfully manufacturing our gene therapy product candidate using our baculovirus/Sf9 cell process and commercial-scale GMP runs, completing our dose-ranging Phase 1b clinical trial as well as our posterior trajectory trial to select both an optimal dose and delivery protocol for the planned pivotal trial, and reporting longer-term Phase 1b data with clinically meaningful and durable responses with this one-time treatment,” said Steven Paul, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Voyager Therapeutics. “This performance sets us up to initiate a planned pivotal program in the middle of this year, moving this potential treatment closer to the hundreds of thousands of advanced Parkinson’s disease patients who require better control of their motor function in order to improve their quality of life. Our preclinical pipeline targeting other severe neurological diseases continues to advance towards the clinic and with our recently announced collaboration with AbbVie, we continue to successfully leverage our gene therapy platform and expertise towards an exciting new area of vectorized immunotherapy initially to deliver monoclonal antibodies directed against tau for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative diseases.”\n2017 and Recent Key Pipeline and Corporate Highlights\nAnnounced updated results to the ongoing, dose-ranging Phase 1b program of VY-AADC for advanced Parkinson’s disease. At our mid-dose studied in Cohort 2 at 18 months, patients had a mean increase of approximately five hours a day of on-time without any dyskinesia and experienced 65% less off-time, making this the likely dose for the pivotal Phase 2-3 program.\nInvestigational New Drug (IND) application cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for VY-AADC in January 2018, allowing the Company to formally initiate clinical trial sites and screen and begin dosing patients for its pivotal Phase 2-3 program for advanced Parkinson’s disease. As part of this IND, the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) section included data demonstrating comparability between VY-AADC produced under good manufacturing process (GMP) using Voyager’s baculovirus/Sf9 manufacturing process and VY-AADC produced using a mammalian cell system consisting of triple-transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells similar to that used in Voyager’s Phase 1b clinical trial.\nInitiated a separate Phase 1 trial and successfully dosed seven patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with a posterior (i.e., back of the head) infusion trajectory of VY-AADC. A posterior trajectory better aligns the infusion of VY-AADC with the anatomical structure of the putamen and resulted in higher total volume of coverage of the putamen and shorter total procedure time compared to Cohorts 1 through 3 from the ongoing Phase 1b trial that employed a transfrontal, or top of the head, delivery approach into the putamen.\nIn February 2018, FDA granted VY-AADC Fast Track designation for advanced Parkinson’s disease. Fast Track designation is granted for programs that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for a serious or life-threatening disease and is intended to facilitate development and expedited regulatory review, including the ability to submit completed sections of a Biologics License Application for a “rolling” review or submission.\nGained worldwide development and commercial rights to VY-AADC for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. Voyager is on track to dose the first patient in its planned global, pivotal Phase 2-3 program during mid-2018.\nEntered into an exclusive strategic collaboration and option agreement with AbbVie to develop and commercialize vectorized antibodies directed against tau for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, combining Voyager’s gene therapy platform with AbbVie’s monoclonal antibody expertise, global clinical development and commercial capabilities. The research period is underway for each company to identify up to five antibodies for inclusion in the collaboration. Voyager received $69 million upfront cash payment and is eligible to receive potentially up to $155 million in preclinical and Phase 1 option payments as well as development and regulatory milestone payments and royalties.\nFurther strengthened the balance sheet with approximately $127 million of additional capital raised from the upfront cash payment from the AbbVie collaboration and a follow-on public equity offering in November, extending Voyager’s expected ability to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into early 2020.\nAnnounced plans during 2018 for Steven Paul, M.D., to transition from president and chief executive officer to executive science advisor where he will focus on preclinical discovery research and portfolio development including progressing the AbbVie collaboration. In addition to the executive science advisor position, Dr. Paul will continue to serve on Voyager’s Board of Directors, and as a member of Voyager’s Science & Technology Committee.\nStrengthened the management team with the additions of Matthew P. Ottmer as Chief Operating Officer and Luis Maranga, Ph.D. as Chief Technical Operations Officer. Mr. Ottmer brings to Voyager more than 18 years of biotechnology industry experience, including executive leadership of business operations, product development, and commercialization across multiple therapeutic areas and all stages of development. Dr. Maranga joins Voyager with over 20 years of biotechnology industry experience, focused on bioprocess development, CMC, GMP, process validation and regulatory submissions, and facilities management including extensive work with the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system.\nCorporate Goals and 2018 Financial Guidance\nVoyager is committed to becoming the leading gene therapy company focused on severe neurological diseases with expertise in discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization of gene therapy products for people living with these devastating diseases. During 2018, Voyager plans to achieve the following corporate goals towards fulfilling this commitment:\nDuring the second quarter of this year, complete a Type C meeting with the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies division of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and incorporate feedback from this meeting into the Phase 2-3 pivotal program for VY-AADC for advanced Parkinson’s disease.\nDuring the second quarter of this year, provide six-month safety and motor function data from the Phase 1 trial of VY-AADC using the posterior infusion trajectory. Seven patients have been dosed using this trajectory as the likely preferred surgical approach for the Phase 2-3 pivotal program.\nDuring mid-2018, dose the first patient in the planned Phase 2-3 pivotal program for advanced Parkinson’s disease. Neurosurgical and neurology clinical trial sites have been identified and are being activated through institutional review board processes, after which, patient referral, screening and dosing can proceed.\nDuring the second half of 2018, provide longer-term safety, biomarker, motor function and quality of life data from Cohorts 1-3 and from patients in the posterior trajectory trial of VY-AADC for advanced Parkinson’s disease.\nAdvance multiple preclinical programs towards clinical trials through further vector optimization and exploration of additional routes of administration, to support filing two IND applications from the ALS SOD1, Huntington’s disease, and Friedreich’s ataxia programs during 2019.\nContinue to identify, evaluate and progress collaborative business development opportunities for certain Voyager programs, technology platform capabilities, or both.\nBased on the Company’s current operating plan, Voyager expects to end 2018 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of approximately $125 million to $135 million, which includes the $69 million upfront payment from AbbVie, and projects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities will be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into early 2020.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, Voyager reported:\nA GAAP net loss of $11.8 million, or $0.40 per share, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a GAAP net loss of $14.7 million, or $0.57 per share, for the same period in 2016. The Company reported a GAAP net loss of $70.7 million, or $2.64 per share, for the full year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $40.2 million, or $1.59 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nCollaboration revenues of $6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to collaboration revenues of $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Collaboration revenues of $10.1 million for the full year ended December 31, 2017 compared to collaboration revenues of $14.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. Collaboration revenues reflect recognition of payment for research and development services provided by Voyager for various programs under the Sanofi Genzyme collaboration agreement. Collaboration revenues can vary based on quarterly assessments of expected or anticipated efforts under the collaboration. The increase in collaboration revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 reflect revenue recognition as a result of Sanofi Genzyme’s decision not to exercise its option to the ex-U.S. rights to the Parkinson’s disease program and Voyager’s recognition of the portion of the agreement allocated to that license option. The decrease in collaboration revenues for the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 reflects the change in the estimated period for reaching development milestones for certain preclinical programs under the collaboration agreement.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses of $13.3 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.7 million for the same period in 2016. R&D expenses of $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $42.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses related primarily to expenditures associated with the development of Voyager’s pipeline including the ongoing Phase 1 trial for VY-AADC, and increased personnel and facility costs to support the advancement of the pipeline programs.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses of $5.4 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2016. G&A expenses of $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $13.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to personnel and facility costs to support Voyager’s pipeline programs.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2017 were $169.1 million.\nConference Call Information\nVoyager will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. ET.
