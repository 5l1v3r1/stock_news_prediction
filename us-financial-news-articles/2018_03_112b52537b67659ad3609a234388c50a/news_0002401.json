The Nikkei index fell 2.5 percent in Tokyo and the Hang Seng index fell 1.5 percent in Hong Kong.\nAsian steelmakers were hit hard, with South Korea’s Posco down 3.6 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel off 3.8 percent. Toyota Motor shares slid 2.4 percent after it said tariffs would substantially raise production costs and the price of cars and trucks sold in America.\nTrump’s move could herald the tough trade actions he had promised during the electoral campaign as a way to incentivize companies to just“buy American, hire American,” said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc. in Washington.\n“The U.S. dollar may face some scrutiny and as a result struggle to hold on to recent gains,” Doyle said.“It is the type of scenario that is unprecedented, thus wild swings may occur as this is digested and analyzed the next few days.”\nVolatility will continue until investors get some clarity on the path of U.S. interest rates, inflation, global trade policy and the international response, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.\n“Investors do not like uncertain outcomes, they just don’t,” Arone said.“If we could just eliminate some of this noise, there’s a really healthy underlying stock market.”\nMSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.29 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 2.13 percent to close at 1,437.14.\nThe sell-off in European stocks weighed particularly on the export-oriented German DAX index, which fell 2.27 percent to a six-month low.\nArcelorMittal SA, the world’s biggest steelmaker, fell 3.7 percent while euro zone automakers and parts companies fell 2.29 percent.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 210.36 points, or 0.85 percent, to 24,398.62. The S&P 500 lost 3.59 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,674.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.30 points, or 0.35 percent, to 7,205.87.\nThe dollar index fell 0.41 percent, with the euro up 0.49 percent to $1.2327. The Japanese yen firmed 0.66 percent versus the greenback at 105.56 per dollar.\nThe Mexican peso lost 0.13 percent to 18.86, while the Canadian dollar fell 0.43 percent versus the greenback at 1.29.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield bouncing back from a three-week low as the Bank of Japan’s chief hinted at a possible exit from its ultra-easy policies if inflation hits its target in its fiscal 2019.\nBenchmark 10-year notes fell 14/32 in price to push its yield up 2.8552 percent.\nGermany’s benchmark 10-year Bund yield dropped as low as 0.606 - its lowest since late January - before inching up to 0.648 percent.\nOil prices rose as Wall Street stocks bounced off session lows, but crude benchmarks declined for the first time in three weeks on fears U.S. plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium could squeeze economic growth, and as U.S. crude inventories climbed.\nU.S. crude rose 26 cents to settle at $61.25 per barrel and Brent settled up 54 cents at $64.37 per barrel.\nReporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York Editing by Bernadette Baum and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T07:58:58.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
