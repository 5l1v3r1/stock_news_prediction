REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian A multi-decade-old international consensus over international trade has come under threat from U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist stance, which includes plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium. But representatives from Europe’s largest economy, Germany, and host country Argentina will insist on maintaining in the communique of a G20 summit on March 19-20 the language of the group’s previous gathering, which stressed “the crucial role of the rules-based international trading system.” “We aim to reach an agreement in terms of maintaining the wording of the Hamburg communique (about) sustaining the benefits of free trade,” Argentina’s Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne, the host of the G20 summit, said. His words were echoed by Germany’s new Social Democratic finance minister Olaf Scholz, who was speaking alongside him at a press conference after a bilateral meeting.

Speaking to reporters earlier, Scholz had also warned that protectionism could harm future economic prospects and said Germany would continue talks to dissuade the United States from imposing planned punitive tariffs.

This marked a departure from his predecessor, austerity champion Wolfgang Schaeuble.
