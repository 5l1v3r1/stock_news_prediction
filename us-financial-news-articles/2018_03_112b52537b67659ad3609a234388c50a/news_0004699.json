Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). FSIC uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends and in comparing FSIC's financial results with other BDCs.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with FSIC's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 1\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nGAAP net investment income per share\n$0.22\n$0.21\n$0.21\nPlus capital gains incentive fees per share\n—\n—\n—\nPlus excise taxes per share\n0.02\n—\n0.02\nPlus one-time expenses per share\n—\n—\n—\nAdjusted net investment income per share 2\n$0.24\n$0.21\n$0.23\n1)\nPer share data was derived by using the weighted average shares of FSIC's common stock outstanding during the applicable\nperiod. Per share numbers may not sum due to rounding.\n2)\nAdjusted net investment income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted net investment income is presented for all\nperiods as GAAP net investment income excluding (i) the accrual for the capital gains incentive fee for realized and\nunrealized gains; (ii) excise taxes; and (iii) certain non-recurring operating expenses that are one-time in nature and are not\nrepresentative of ongoing operating expenses incurred during FSIC's normal course of business (referred to herein as one-\ntime expenses). FSIC uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that the use\nof this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends and in\ncomparing its financial results with other business development companies. The presentation of this additional information is\nnot meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A\nreconciliation of GAAP net investment income to adjusted net investment income can be found above.\n3)\nThe per share data for distributions reflects the amount of distributions paid per share of our common stock to stockholders of\nrecord during each applicable period.\n4)\nSee FSIC's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a description of FSIC's investment\nstrategies.\n5)\nGross portfolio yield represents the expected annualized yield of FSIC's investment portfolio based on the composition of the\nportfolio as of the applicable date. FSIC's estimated gross portfolio yield may be higher than an investor's yield on an\ninvestment in shares of FSIC's common stock because it does not reflect sales commissions or charges that may be incurred\nin connection with the purchase or sale of such shares, or operating expenses that may be incurred by FSIC. FSIC's estimated\ngross portfolio yield does not represent an actual investment return to stockholders, is subject to change and, in the future,\nmay be greater or less than the rates set forth herein.\n6)\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis. See FSIC's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2017 for a description of FSIC's revenue recognition policy.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fsic-reports-fourth-quarter-and-annual-2017-financial-results-and-declares-regular-distribution-for-first-quarter-300606939.html\nSOURCE FS Investment Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.fsinvestmentcorp.com/", "http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fsic-reports-fourth-quarter-and-annual-2017-financial-results-and-declares-regular-distribution-for-first-quarter-300606939.html", "http://www.fsinvestments.com/"], "published": "2018-03-02T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T01:53:43.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
