(Nasdaq: WBA) pursuant to the previously disclosed Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2017 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). As of March 27, 2018, Rite Aid has completed the store transfer process, and all 1,932 stores and related assets have been transferred to WBA in exchange for cash proceeds of $4.157 billion. The transfer of the three distribution centers and related inventory is expected to begin after September 1, 2018.\nThe majority of the closing conditions have been satisfied, and the transfers of Rite Aid distribution centers and related assets remain subject to minimal customary closing conditions applicable only to the distribution centers being transferred at such distribution center closing, as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement. Additional details regarding today’s announcement have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K.\nRite Aid also announced that its Board of Directors has terminated the tax benefits preservation plan (the “Plan”) that it adopted on January 3, 2018. As a result of the Plan, Rite Aid protected approximately $2.2 billion of Rite Aid’s net operating losses. The Plan was originally scheduled to expire on January 3, 2019.\nRite Aid Corporation is one of the nation's leading drugstore chains with fiscal 2017 annual revenues of $32.8 billion.
