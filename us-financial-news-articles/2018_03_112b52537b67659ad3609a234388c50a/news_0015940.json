Photo supplied by Mattel The doll is not available for sale, and Mattel could not say whether it would go into production.\nSeveral previous Sheroes, including African-American ballerina Misty Copeland and American fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad - the first hijab-wearing Barbie - have gone into production.\nLisa McKnight, Barbie general manager, said in a statement that the company had chosen to honor the role models “because we know that you can’t be what you can’t see”.\n“Girls have always been able to play out different roles and careers with Barbie, and we are thrilled to shine a light on real-life role models to remind them that they can be anything.”\nOther dolls being launched for International Women’s Day on Thursday include a Turkish windsurfer, a German entrepreneur and a Polish journalist.\nParents and feminists have long criticized the traditional Barbie doll, with its impossibly busty and narrow-waisted physique, for setting an unrealistic body image for girls.\nMattel released new bodytypes in 2016 - petite, tall and curvy - as well as a range of skintones.\nA spokeswoman said the Adams doll had been designed in close collaboration with the boxer’s team.\nMattel also announced on Tuesday the launch of a series of historical dolls that come with educational information.\nThe first three “Inspiring Women” are Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart, and mathematician Katherine Johnson, who worked on the U.S. space program.\nWriting by Emma Batha, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
