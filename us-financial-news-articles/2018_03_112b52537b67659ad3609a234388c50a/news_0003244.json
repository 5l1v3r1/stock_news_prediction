U.S. gold futures for April delivery were 1.03 percent higher at $1,318.70 an ounce.\nGold was, however, down 0.4 percent this week and on track for a second consecutive weekly loss. It touched $1,302.61, the lowest since Jan. 2, on Thursday, pushed down by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more aggressively than previously thought.\nHigher interest rates are negative for gold because they raise bond yields, reducing the attractiveness of non-yielding gold, and tend to boost the dollar.\nshow chapters This is what a potential trade war with China means for the markets 19 Hours Ago | 05:12 But the threat of a trade war overpowered fears of interest rate increases, Hansen said. \"If a trade war becomes a reality it could push inflation up and growth down and that should ease the aggressiveness of the Fed. That's why it has become the focus (of the gold market),\" he said.\nAlso positive for gold was its ability to hold above its technically important 100-day moving average price at $1,300, also a key psychological level for investors.\nNear-term technical resistance was at the 50-day moving average at $1,324.60, analysts at ScotiaMocatta said. Supporting bullion prices was an increase in holdings of gold in exchange-traded funds tracked by Reuters of nearly 17 tons, or 1 percent, since mid-February.\n\"Evidently some investors viewed the low price level as a buying opportunity,\" analysts at Commerzbank wrote.\nIn other precious metals, silver was down 0.09 percent at $16.456 an ounce after touching a two-month low on Thursday. It was 0.2 percent lower for the week.\nPlatinum was 0.25 percent lower at $963.80 an ounce, near two-month lows and down 3.2 percent this week. Palladium was down 0.03 percent at $988.90 an ounce but down 5 percent this week after suffering its biggest fall in more than a year on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T05:08:46.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
