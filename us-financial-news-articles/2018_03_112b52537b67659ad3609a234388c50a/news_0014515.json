SoftBank Group Corp’s emergence as Uber’s largest shareholder in January through a multi-billion dollar funding with a group of investors had increased the possibility of a consolidation with Grab, industry sources had previously said. Grab declined to comment while Uber did not immediately respond to Reuters’ queries. During a visit to India last month, Uber’s CEO pledged to continue investing aggressively in Southeast Asia.
