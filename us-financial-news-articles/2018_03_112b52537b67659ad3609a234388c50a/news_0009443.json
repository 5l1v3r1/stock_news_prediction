PolySwarm’s advisory board includes former McAfee CIO Mark Tonnesen, alongside renowned information security experts Dan Guido, Chris Eagle, Dr. Sergey Bratus, and Carl Hoffman.\nThe PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments.
