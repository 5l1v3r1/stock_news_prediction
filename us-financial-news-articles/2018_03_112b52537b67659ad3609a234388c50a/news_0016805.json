Hamill, 66, was introduced by “Star Wars” actor Harrison Ford and director George Lucas along with the customary beeps and squeaks of the saga’s robot R2-D2. “It’s hard to convey my gratitude, my joy, the exhilaration of being recognised in this way,” Hamill told the scores of fans who surrounded the unveiling of the emblematic terrazzo and brass star in front of El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood’s heart. Only a few years ago, Hamill’s star was barely at a flicker. Long eclipsed by castmates Ford and the late Carrie Fisher, he was never able turn himself into the leading man of the big screen after 1982’s “Return of the Jedi.” But reviving the Skywalker role in two recent iterations of Disney’s “Star Wars” films and an active presence on Twitter has helped bring Hamill back into the spotlight.

He proved his mettle well.” Hamill, who also starred on the stage in “Amadeus” and voiced the Joker in the animated “Batman” TV series, returned the favour to Lucas.
