He and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.\nLow's whereabouts are unknown and a spokesman at a U.S.-based public relations firm that has represented him did not respond to requests for comment.\nLow had previously denied wrongdoing, saying it was \"disappointing that, rather than reflecting on the deeply flawed and politically motivated allegations, the DOJ is continuing with its pattern of global overreach\".\nIn a separate filing on Monday, the claimants' lawyers also applied for an emergency order to keep the Equanimity in Indonesia for 30 days, saying that moving it to the United States would endanger the lives of the crew and lower the value of the yacht.\nThe claimants also said the government intended to sell the vessel in a way that would \"wholly fail to maximise its value\".\nThe DOJ filed a response on Tuesday saying keeping the yacht in Indonesia could risk interfering with sovereign rights.\nOther Low assets sought by the department include a private jet, a hotel and real estate in New York, and a $107 million interest in EMI Music Publishing.
