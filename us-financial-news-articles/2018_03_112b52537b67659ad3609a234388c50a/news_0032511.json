Our ongoing strength continues to validate the success of our strategy and the strong execution of our initiatives by our team with continuous innovation across our powerful global brands leading to strong acceptance of our product offerings around the world. The fourth quarter saw us direct our growth toward our higher margin core brands, channels and businesses which resulted in core brand sales increasing 19%, international growth of 33%, ecommerce sales rising and positive comparable sales. We remain excited about our outlook as we begin fiscal 2019 and expect the execution of our strategy along with the disciplined management of expenses and our balance sheet to result in another strong year for Perry Ellis International and its shareholders.”\nFiscal 2018 Fourth Quarter Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $227 million, an 11.3% increase (10.1% increase on constant currency) compared to $204 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This reflected increases across all segments, with particular strength in Men’s Sportswear and Nike swim.\nThe disciplined management of inventory along with increased sales of higher margin core brands led to a 50 basis point expansion in GAAP gross margin to 38.9% in the fourth quarter from 38.4%. Strength in the Company’s Perry Ellis, Golf Lifestyle Apparel and Nike swim business led to the margin increase. Adjusted gross margin was 38.9% compared with adjusted gross margin of 38.7% in the comparable period of the prior year. (Adjusted gross margin excludes certain items as outlined in Table 2 Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin).\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $21.2 million as compared to $17.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year. (Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items as outlined in Table 3, Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.)\nAdjusted pre-tax income was $15.8 million, increasing 36.9% from $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP pre-tax income was $12.8 million compared to GAAP pre-tax income of $6.7 million in the comparable period of prior year. (Adjusted pre-tax income excludes certain items as outlined in Table 4 Reconciliation of Net Income before taxes to Adjusted Net Income before taxes.)\nAs reported under GAAP, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 net income was $39.7 million or $2.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $13.6 million or $0.88 per diluted share as compared to $10.1 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. (Adjusted net income and adjusted income per diluted share exclude certain items as outlined in Table 1 Reconciliation of net income and income per diluted share to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share.)\nFiscal 2018 Results\nFiscal 2018 total revenue was $875 million, a 2% increase (2% increase on constant currency) compared to $861 million in fiscal 2017. This reflected growth in core brands, particularly Men’s Sportswear and Nike swim.\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2018 were $2.13 compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.04 in fiscal 2017. (Adjusted earnings per diluted share exclude the items outlined in the attached Table 1 for both fiscal periods.)\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for fiscal 2018 was $56.7 million, or $3.68 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net income of $14.5 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, for fiscal 2017.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairments, as adjusted (“adjusted EBITDA”) for fiscal 2018 totaled $59.2 million, or 6.8% of total revenues, as compared to $57.2 million, or 6.6% of total revenues, in fiscal 2017. (Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items as outlined in Table 3, Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” for a reconciliation of net loss/income to adjusted EBITDA.)\nAdjusted gross margin for fiscal 2018 was 37.8% compared to adjusted gross margin of 37.2% in fiscal 2017. Gross margin was positively impacted during fiscal 2018 by favorable product performance, which led to increases in merchandising margin in the Company’s domestic businesses. (Adjusted gross margin excludes certain items as outlined in Table 2, Reconciliation of Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin.)\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses totaled $274.7 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to $280.0 million in fiscal 2017. SG&A in fiscal 2018 included $3.7 million related to consolidation of operations and strategic initiatives. SG&A in fiscal 2017 included $10.1 million in pension plan termination expense, as well as $8.6 million related to exited brands, consolidation of operations and strategic initiatives.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company's financial position continues to be very strong. Fiscal 2018 year-end cash and investments totaled $49.3 million. The Company’s net debt to total capitalization stood at 10.7% at fiscal 2018 year-end as compared to 17.2% at the end of fiscal 2017. Working capital management continues to be a critical focus across the organization as inventory turned at approximately 3.8x for fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2019 Guidance\nThe Company is providing revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2019. For comparability, the Company has recast its fiscal 2018 sales and earnings to remove the sales, income/losses related to the transition of the Laundry dress business to a license model and the elimination of Bon-Ton sales due to its bankruptcy and liquidation.\nFor fiscal 2019, the Company currently expects total revenue to be in the range of $855 million to $865 million from core sales of $843.6 million in fiscal 2018. Excluding any potential expenses (which could be significant) to be incurred by the Company in connection with the Board of Director’s exploration and evaluation of potential strategic alternatives and the related February 9, 2018 proposal to acquire the Company, diluted earnings per share are currently expected in the range of $1.80 to $1.90 assuming a tax rate of 25%, which compares to core adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.70 in fiscal 2018.\nAbout Perry Ellis International\nPerry Ellis International, Inc. is a leading designer, distributor and licensor of a broad line of high quality men's and women's apparel, accessories and fragrances.
