It disclosed it had petitioned a Singapore court on March 9 to order the convening of a special shareholder meeting to approve the redomiciliation. This meeting will be held on March 23, the company said. The Singapore Court will then have to greenlight the redomiciliation.\n\"We are aware of the terms in the (CFIUS) order and are in full compliance,\" a Broadcom spokeswoman said by email when asked whether the company had given CFIUS the required five-day notice on action to redomicile.\nThe anonymous sources asked not to be identified because details of CFIUS' order to Broadcom and Qualcomm are classified. Qualcomm and a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, declined to comment.\nCFIUS in its order on Sunday also instructed Qualcomm not to take any action that could lead to a deal with Broadcom during the panel's review, according to the sources. Broadcom has nominated six directors for election to Qualcomm's 11-member board as a way to force negotiations between the two companies.\nCFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, rarely reviews mergers before a deal has been clinched. The review of Broadcom's bid illustrates the U.S. government's expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances.\nThe U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, would take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G.\n\"As a U.S. corporation, our future acquisitions in the United States would not be subject to certain regulatory processes required for acquisitions by foreign corporations,\" Broadcom said in a regulatory filing on Friday.
