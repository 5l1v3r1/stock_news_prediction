In recent earnings calls, Iger has touted the company's streaming initiatives.\nIn February, he told analysts that he believes that Disney's streaming service will be able to compete with Netflix . Iger said the company's advantage is that it already has the rights to valuable franchises like \"Star Wars\" as well as content produced by box-office powerhouses like Pixar and Marvel.\nSee Disney's full release below:\n\"The Walt Disney Company Announces Strategic Reorganization\nNew Structure Consolidates the Company's Direct-to-Consumer Services, Technology and International Media Operations into a Single, Worldwide Business to Capitalize on Growth Opportunities\nParks and Resorts and Consumer Products Operations Combined to Create New Hub Where Disney's Stories, Characters and Franchises Come to Life\nKevin Mayer Named Chairman of Direct-to-Consumer and International Segment\nBob Chapek Named Chairman of Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products Segment\nBURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--To capitalize on today's rapidly changing media landscape and more closely align with the Company's priorities for future growth--including creating high-quality content, technological innovation, global expansion and direct-to-consumer distribution--The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today announced a strategic reorganization of its businesses into four segments: the newly-formed Direct-to-Consumer and International; the combined Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products; Media Networks; and Studio Entertainment.

It will also feature an impressive array of original and exclusive series and movie programming, along with thousands of titles from the Disney film and television libraries. Senior Vice President Agnes Chu will move to the Direct-to-Consumer and International segment and will continue to oversee programming for the upcoming Disney-branded streaming service.\nBAMTECH, which is headed by Michael Paull, is developing both the Disney-branded and ESPN+ streaming platforms and will now house all consumer-facing digital technology and products across the Company as part of the Direct-to-Consumer and International segment.

Ms. Marinelli will report directly to Mr. Mayer.\nThe Company's International Channels--including the international Disney Channels--will also be consolidated into the new business segment. Disney's International Channels are renowned for providing incomparable branded entertainment programming that is both universally appealing and locally relevant, and the production of localized content will continue to grow under the new structure.\nThe new Direct-to-Consumer and International business segment will also be responsible for the distribution of all direct-to-consumer services globally.\nThe Walt Disney International team of regional managers across EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), Asia and Latin America will now report to Mr. Mayer.\nDuring Mr. Mayer's tenure at Disney, he has overseen the Company's key strategic acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and most recently, its pending deal for 21st Century Fox. Prior to becoming Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, Mr. Mayer served as Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business Development.\n\"I want to thank Bob for giving me the opportunity to lead the talented teams who, through the power of new technology and innovation, are creating the future of entertainment viewing,\" Mr. Mayer said. \"Delivering our great stories and characters directly to consumers on all high-quality devices around the world will provide the Company with meaningful new revenue streams and opportunities for growth.\"\nPARKS, EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS\nThe new Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products segment will become the hub where Disney's stories, characters and franchises come to life.
