We’ve got an engine failure over the East River.”\nTwo of the five passengers died at the scene and three were taken to two area hospitals where they later died, New York City Police and fire department officials confirmed early Monday.\nThe pilot freed himself and was rescued and later was treated and released in good condition from a hospital, police said.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the Eurocopter AS350 went down near the northern end of Roosevelt Island at about 7 p.m. and was investigating. The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigative team would arrive on Monday.\n“It’s a great tragedy,” said New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro at a press conference late Sunday. “It took a while for the divers to get these people out.”\nNigro said when the divers reached the helicopter it was inverted and in 50 feet of water with below 40-degree Fahrenheit water temperatures and four-mile-an hour currents.\nParamedics and members of the NYFD perform CPR on a victim of a helicopter crash in New York, U.S., March 11, 2018.
