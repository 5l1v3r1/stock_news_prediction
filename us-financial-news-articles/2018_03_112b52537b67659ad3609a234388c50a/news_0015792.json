Infosys Ltd was 1 percent higher.\nTelecom stocks such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd rose on the Indian government’s move to raise the cap on airwaves that a mobile operator can hold to 35 percent from 25 percent earlier.\nBharti Airtel was 1.6 percent higher, while Idea Cellular edged up 0.06 percent.\nThe NSE Metal index slipped 1.1 percent after rising as much as 1.6 percent in early trade.
