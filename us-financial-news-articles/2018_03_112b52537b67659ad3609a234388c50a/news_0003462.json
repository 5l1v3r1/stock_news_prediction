Hip-hop’s third-wealthiest figure, Dr. Dre, is expected to add a nine-figure windfall of Apple stock to his estimated $770 million wealth this summer, Forbes said. Apple acquired Dr. Dre’s headphone and audio speaker company Beats in 2014.\nDrake and Eminem rounded out the latest top five, tied with an estimated $100 million fortune each.\nForbes compiled the list by valuing major assets, examining financial documents and consulting analysts, attorneys, managers and other industry players.
