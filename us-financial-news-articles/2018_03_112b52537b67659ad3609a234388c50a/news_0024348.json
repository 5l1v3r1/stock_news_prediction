Prime is the world’s largest online retailer’s customer loyalty plan that costs an annual 999 rupees ($15) and offers faster deliveries, access to early deals and a subscription to its video and music streaming services.\nIndia is key to Amazon’s global ambitions. Online retail is booming in the South Asian nation and its media and entertainment market is tipped to grow to more than $31 billion in two years, from $22.7 billion in 2017.\nCheap data has spurred the rise of streaming video usage in India, the world’s fastest growing web services market, and turned it into a battleground for content wars between global giants such as Amazon and Netflix as they look for growth beyond a saturated U.S. home market.\nOther prominent players include Twenty-First Century Fox-backed Hotstar, which exclusively streams HBO’s hit “Game of Thrones” show in India; Voot, a joint venture between Network18 Media & Investments Ltd and U.S. peer Viacom Inc; SonyLIV from Japan’s Sony Corp; Zee Entertainment’s ZEE5 and production house Balaji’s ALTBalaji.\nAsked if Amazon could begin streaming cricket in India, a country of 1.2 billion people famously obsessed with the sport, the executives said they were looking at sports content opportunities globally.\n“It’s day one in sports for us and we’re getting involved in it,” Leslie said, adding the company had begun streaming U.S. football games globally and was striking deals for sports such as tennis. Amazon does not stream sports in India currently.\nLast year, Star India agreed to pay 163.48 billion rupees ($2.5 billion) for the television and digital rights of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket for five years. Bidders for digital rights included Facebook Inc.\n$1 = 65.1200 Indian rupees Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T08:54:27.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
