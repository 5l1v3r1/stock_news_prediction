But in England I am not quite sure, and I don’t think that would go down well in Germany at all.” (Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker; editing by Ken Ferris)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:31:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
