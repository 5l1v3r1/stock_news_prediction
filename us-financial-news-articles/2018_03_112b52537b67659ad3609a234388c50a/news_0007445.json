That followed a Wall Street rout, based in part on inflation worries that have boosted yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note US10YT=RR to a four-year high.\nBut the Nikkei has regained momentum along with U.S. stocks.\n“We know that high volatility and high yields do not mean an economic slowdown,” said Fumio Matsumoto, a senior fund manager at Dalton Capital Japan, one of the more bullish respondents in the poll, forecasting the Nikkei to reach 25,000 at year-end.\nHe added that growth and low-volatility stocks, which have outperformed the broader market in the past, will likely make a turnaround. He said value shares like banks and exporters are likely to be bid up from now on.\nFor its part, the U.S. Federal Reserve, looking past the recent stock market sell-off and inflation concerns, expects economic growth to remain steady and sees no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes.\n“From now to June, we expect U.S. companies to post strong profits thanks to a big tax cut, and shares will likely be strong on the prospect that U.S. rate hikes won’t be (delivered) more than three times” this year, said Akio Yoshino, chief economist at Amundi Japan.\nForecasts for end-2018 ranged from 20,000 to 28,000. They were 22,000 to 25,000 for mid-2018. In the previous poll conducted in October, forecasts were 16,500 to 23,000 for mid-2018, and 14,500-26,000 for end-December 2018.\nSTRONGER YEN BITES A recent Reuters poll showed most analysts predict the Bank of Japan will keep a key part of its super-easy monetary policy -- the long-term bond yield target -- at zero percent throughout the year, despite strength in Japan’s economy.\nJapanese yields would normally move upwards as well, but the BOJ stops that from happening, leading to a widening gap between the United States and Japan.\nThe interest rate difference created greater downward pressure on the yen last year, but analysts say that is over and it will be the dollar instead that will be nudged downward.\n“The U.S.’s twin deficits are to blame,” said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, referring to the United States’ huge and growing budget deficit, as well as the current account deficit.\nIn a separate Reuters poll, more than half the economists said 110-114 yen to the dollar was the optimal exchange rate for Japan’s export-dependent economy. Recently, the yen has strengthened sharply to around 105.50 yen, hurting exporters’ profits.\nFujito said that with the dollar trading at around 106 yen JPY= now, by the time companies release their forecasts in late April-May, their own foreign exchange assumptions may range around 100-105 yen.\n“Earnings for the next fiscal year will likely be break-even or they may just eke out small gains on the year,” Fujito said.\nAnalysts also said volatility still remains a focus point in U.S. shares. Asked about which asset classes would be the most vulnerable if U.S. stocks move sharply, answers ranged from emerging-market shares and bonds, developed market stocks and currencies as well as high-yielding products.\n“We’ve seen that Japanese stocks which have high liquidity got hit a lot as well as the yen in the wake of U.S. stock market’s rout,” said Takashi Ito, an equity market strategist at Nomura Securities.\n(This story corrects Nomura analyst’s name in last paragraph)\n(To read other stories from the Reuters global stock markets poll:)\nAdditional polling by in BENGALURU; Editing by Ross Finley and Subhranshu Sahu\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:11:38.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
