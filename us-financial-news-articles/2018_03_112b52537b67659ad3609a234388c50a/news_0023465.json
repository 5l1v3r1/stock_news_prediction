Benchmark aluminium on the London Metal Exchange (LME) traded down 0.1 percent at $2,118 a tonne in official rings. Prices have slipped around 7.5 percent from a high in early January. Aluminium on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) closed at the lowest in 14 months. Prices have been pressured by sharp increases in stocks in ShFE and LME warehouses, despite restrictions on Chinese smelter production from Nov. 15 to March 15. AL-STX-SGH MALSTX-TOTAL Industry sources say there may be only a limited restart by these smelters from March 15 because prices are not high enough for some to break even. Any increase in output could drive prices lower. “We are going to trend down below $2,100 in the first half of the year because of this China surplus,” ING analyst Oliver Nugent said. But he said prices on the LME would likely rise again later in the year because of a persistent shortage of metal outside China. ALUMINIUM SPREADS: The price of cash aluminium has fallen below the three-month price, suggesting greater nearby availability of metal and taking pressure off prices. MAL0-3 PREMIUMS: Some Japanese aluminium buyers have agreed to pay some global producers a premium of $129 per tonne for shipments in the April to June quarter, the highest in three years. COPPER: LME copper traded down 0.9 percent at $6,897 a tonne after a 10,000-tonne rise in stocks in LME-registered warehouses to 321,125 tonnes suggested ample supply of the metal. Prices remain near 4-year highs hit in December. MCUSTX-TOTAL STRIKE: Workers at Antofagasta’s Los Pelambres copper mine in Chile rejected an offer for a new labour contract, paving the way for a strike. Los Pelambres produced around 350,000 tonnes of copper last year. The potential strike revived concerns that labour disputes will disrupt production this year, supporting prices. POSITIONING: Speculators reduced bets on higher prices, with the net long in Comex copper falling to the lowest since November 2016. CHINA FUNDS: Two Chinese brokerages with the largest long positions in ShFE copper for delivery in May and June sharply scaled back their positions, exchange data showed. NICKEL: Nickel did not trade but was bid down 0.8 percent at $13,750. Prices jumped 4.4 percent on Friday after the number of cancelled warrants in LME warehouses - metal earmarked for deilvery and unavailable to the market - increased to 38 percent of total warrants from 30 percent. MNISTX-TOTAL OTHER METALS: LME zinc was bid down 0.6 percent at $3,259 a tonne, lead traded 1.4 percent lower at $2,343 and tin traded down 0.1 percent at $21,355.
