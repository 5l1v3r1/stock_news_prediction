(NASDAQ: PTI), a development-stage biopharmaceutical company whose market value is based primarily on PTI-428, its lead drug candidate for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Proteostasis's stock price increased ~100% after the FDA granted the drug Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations, but Kerrisdale's analysis demonstrates that PTI-428 is likely ineffective. Kerrisdale also details a pattern of low-quality data and troubling omissions in Proteostasis's public disclosures.\nThe full report can be found at http://kerr.co/pti .\nKerrisdale has a short position in Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc., and stands to benefit if its share price falls.\nConference Call Schedule\nKerrisdale will host a conference call on Tuesday, March 20 at 10:30am ET to discuss the Proteostasis report.\nTo participate in the conference call, dial (866) 834-3313 (United States) or (409) 981-0700 (international) and reference the Kerrisdale Capital call.\nAbout Kerrisdale Capital\nKerrisdale Capital Management, LLC, is a fundamentally-oriented investment manager that focuses on long-term value investments and event-driven special situations.\nContact\nAgnes Cao\nKerrisdale Capital\nacao@kerrisdalecap.com\n212-257-4385\nKerrisdale Capital Management, LLC is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, CRD number 160804.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sahm-adrangis-kerrisdale-capital-issues-negative-report-on-proteostasis-therapeutics-inc-and-announces-conference-call-schedule-300616553.html\nSOURCE Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC", "external_links": ["http://kerr.co/pti", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sahm-adrangis-kerrisdale-capital-issues-negative-report-on-proteostasis-therapeutics-inc-and-announces-conference-call-schedule-300616553.html"], "published": "2018-03-20T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T18:50:40.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
