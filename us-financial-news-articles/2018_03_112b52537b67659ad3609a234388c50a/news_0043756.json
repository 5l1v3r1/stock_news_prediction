To have a trade war or talks, that's the US' call,\" said the newspaper, which is owned by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.\nA broader capital market in China Peterson said he expects that in the next few years, more funds in China will be flowing to pension funds. Capital markets, debt and bond markets will develop further, he said.\nThese developments, he said, \"gives you more ways to finance companies, to understand what will be the evolution of different kinds of investing products. You see more venture capital, you see more long-term investing.\"\nThat is where S&P Global believes China should be going, he said. It's a view that was echoed by regulators and speakers at the China Development Forum.\nCurrently, financing in China continues to be dominated by banks. At the same time, so-called shadow banking and other kinds of debt that are \"not necessarily on banks' balance sheets\" continue in China, Peterson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T01:42:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
