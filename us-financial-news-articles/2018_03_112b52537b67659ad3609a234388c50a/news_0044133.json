Aramco's size and complexities is something that requires time.\"\n* Saudi Arabia is planning to list up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco in the offering. A successful IPO could give the company a total valuation of up to $2 trillion, making it the worlds biggest oil company by market capitalization.\n* The company could be floated either domestically or internationally late this year, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters last week.
