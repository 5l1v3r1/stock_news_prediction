Finally, we are very pleased to continue to call New Jersey home and thank the town and state for their support.\"\nSituated on a 12 acre campus, the new 144,000 sq. ft. facility represents an over $30 million investment by Jaguar Land Rover and offers increased square footage, a showroom with the latest Jaguar and Land Rover models, as well as a 30,000 sq. ft. product research, training and development center. The building hosts 78 conference rooms and meeting spaces, 498 workstations and over 85 indoor and outdoor wireless access points to allow for a more collaborative workspace and open environment.
