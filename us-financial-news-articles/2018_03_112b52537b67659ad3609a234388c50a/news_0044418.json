Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the case was being handled according to “German laws and the provisions around European arrest warrants” and that the Catalan question could only be resolved within framework of Spanish law. “Spain is a democratic state under the rule of law and it remains the (German) federal government’s conviction that this Catalonia conflict must be resolved within Spanish legal and constitutional framework,” Seibert added. “For this reason we have, in these last months, supported the Spanish govenment’s clear position on safeguarding this legal and constitutional system.” (Reporting by Paul Carrel Editing by Michael Nienaber)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T13:36:13.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
