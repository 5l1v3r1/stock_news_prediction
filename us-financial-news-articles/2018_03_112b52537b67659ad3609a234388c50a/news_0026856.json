The name Equinor captures our heritage and values, and what we aim to be in the future.\"\nThe name Equinor will be proposed to shareholders at the company's annual general meeting on May 15. Statoil's majority shareholder, the Norwegian government, is to vote in favour of the resolution. The five unions that represent and organize Statoil employees also said that they supported the proposed name change.\nStatoil has stated that its ambition is to be the world's \"most carbon-efficient oil and gas producer.\" It is also developing renewable energy projects across the globe and expects to invest 15 to 20 percent of total capex in \"new energy solutions\" by the year 2030. In October, the business announced that Hywind Scotland, the world's first floating wind farm, had started to send electricity to the Scottish grid.\n\"As we position ourselves for long-term value creation and to be competitive also in a low carbon future, we have been searching for a name that captures our heritage and values, and at the same time reflects the opportunities we see,\" Saetre said. \"I am confident that the name Equinor will support our strategy and vision to shape the future of energy.\"\nStatoil is the latest big energy business to change its name. Danish energy powerhouse Orsted, for example, was previously known as Dong Energy, with the Dong originally referring to Danish Oil and Natural Gas. That all changed in October. With the business moving towards green energy – it said it would be coal free by the year 2023 – and divesting its upstream oil and gas business, it said that its old name was \"no longer suitable for the company.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T14:38:12.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
