Q4 underground mine production increased to 250,225 tonnes attributable to improved equipment availability and productivity.\nAverage head grades of the tonnes milled in Q4 were 6.02% Zn, 2.56% Pb and 2.32 oz/ton of Ag, with production of 25,021 tonnes of zinc concentrate averaging 47% Zn and 10,644 tonnes of lead-silver concentrate averaging 40% Pb and 21.8 oz/ton Ag.\nThe site cash operating cost during the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to trend lower at $55.14 per tonne milled, reflecting the transition from contracted to owner-operated mining and ongoing efficiencies from optimization initiatives. Direct site cash cost per zinc equivalent payable lb. produced in Q4 was $0.45 per lb.

These initiatives are improving mine site operational efficiencies and will continue throughout 2018.\nPerkoa Mine, Burkina Faso:\nThe acquisition of Perkoa was effective August 31, 2017. All operating costs and concentrate revenues from April 1 to August 31, 2017 have been included as part of the purchase price acquisition allocation (see Note 4 of the 2017 audited Consolidated Annual Financial Statements dated December 31, 2017).\nQ4 production results from Perkoa was 47.7 million payable lbs. of zinc. Mill throughput for the quarter was 180,022 tonnes with recoveries averaging 94% for zinc with an average head grade of 15.04% Zn to produce of 48,579 tonnes of zinc concentrate, averaging 53% Zn. Underground production was 203,635 tonnes over the quarter. Site cash operating cost per tonne milled was $120.85, and direct site cash cost per zinc equivalent payable lb. produced was $0.46 per lb. There was a one-time value added tax of $1.5 million in production costs during the fourth quarter.\n2017 Perkoa Mine production statistics (100 percent basis)\nQ4-2017 2017 (Sept 1-Dec 31) Tonnes Mined 203,635 270,909 Tonnes Milled 180,022 237,832 Average Head Grades: Zinc (%) 15.04 15.09 Average Recoveries (%): Zinc 94 94 Concentrate Produced DMT (dry metric tonnes): Zinc 48,579 64,469 Concentrate Grades: Zinc (%) 53 52 Payable Production: Zinc (lbs.) 47,666,248 62,775.671 Site Cash Operating Costs per ZnEq Payable lbs.

These benefits are expected to continue in 2018.\nThe Company has approved the procurement and installation of a more efficient site power generating system subsequent to the year-end. Phase I of the project will entail the installation of two 2.5MW Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) generators for a total estimated budget, including contingency, of $9.2 million. The project has an anticipated cost savings of approximately $7 per tonne milled. As the Company integrates the assets, further synergies are expected in supply and procurement, operational and technical support efficiencies.\n2018 CONSOLIDATED PRODUCTION AND COST GUIDANCE (1,2,3)\nConsolidated production guidance for 2018 remains unchanged and is estimated between 400 and 427 million pounds of payable zinc, 43.8 and 46.0 million pounds of payable lead and 1.4 and 1.47 million ounces of payable silver. Consolidated operating costs will range from $60-$66 per tonne.\n2018 Consolidated Production and Cost Guidance (1,2,3)\nMine 2018 Zinc Production\n(million pounds payable) 2018 Lead Production\n(million pounds payable) 2018 Silver Production\n(000 ounces payable) Operating Costs\n(per tonne) Caribou 86-90 27.1-28.4 627-658 $55-$61 Perkoa (100%) (3) 155-165 N/A N/A $103-$113 Rosh Pinah (100%) (3) 105-115 5.7-6.0 123-129 $49-$54 Santander 54-57 11.0-11.6 654-687 $38-$42 Total 400-427 43.8-46.0 1,400-1,474 $60-$66 (1) Constitutes forward-looking information; see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”.\n(2) Operating and cash costs are based on various assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to: production volumes, commodity prices (Zn: $1.25/lb Pb: $1.00/lb Ag: $19/lb) and foreign currency exchange rates (N$/USD: 13.00; XOF/USD: 609; PEN/USD 3.25; C$/USD $1.25) and is a non-IFRS measure.
