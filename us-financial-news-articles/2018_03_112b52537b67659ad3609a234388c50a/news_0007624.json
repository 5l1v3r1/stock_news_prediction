The operating ratio is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nCSX shares have risen about 50 percent since January 2017 and about 12 percent since March 2017 after Harrison took over as CEO following a high-stakes push by activist investor Paul Hilal of investment fund Mantle Ridge LP.\nBut CSX’s share growth has come with depleted rail service. Many rail customers have seen persistent service disruptions and delays that have raised shipping costs.\nSeveral shippers have told Reuters that service has been steadily improving from a nadir last summer, although companies like U.S. agricultural firm Cargill Inc and coal company Murray Energy Corp are still struggling with crew and rail car shortages.
