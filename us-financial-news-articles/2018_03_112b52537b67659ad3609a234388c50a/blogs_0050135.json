The stock closed down 12 percent.\"\nAnd even though Cramer has liked the stock of Twitter lately, he said it was proving to be fragile.\n\"Stocks that have moved up a lot can go down a lot. What matters is whether they find their footing,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"For the moment, though, tech has lost some of its most powerful themes and we're still mired in all sorts of big-picture fears from Washington. But the bottom line? We really need to get used to these wild swings that send stocks plunging after any major rally.\"\nWATCH: Cramer unpacks the multi-faceted sell-off show chapters Cramer: Nvidia and Twitter's stocks are the best examples of the unforgiving market      22 Hours Ago | 12:47 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia and Facebook. \nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
