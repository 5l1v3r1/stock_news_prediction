We are now looking forward to another phase of growth through 2022 with the ramp-up of Cobre Panama over 2019-2022, the first phase expansion of Tasiast later this year and the second phase in 2020, the expansion or start-up of a number of smaller mines over 2018 and 2019 and the 50% expansion of Stillwater by 2021. The on-going full-field development of our U.S. oil & gas royalties is tracking ahead of our original expectations. On top of that, our business development team has been very active adding new investments in precious metals, oil & gas and other minerals. Franco-Nevada remains debt free and is well positioned for another 10 years of success.\"\n2017 Financial Highlights\n497,745 Gold Equivalent Ounces 1 (GEOs) sold – a new record and a 7.2% increase year-over-year $675.0 million in revenue — a new record and a 10.6% increase year-over-year $516.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA 2 or $2.82 per share — a new record $194.7 million of net income, or $1.06 per share — a new record $198.3 million of Adjusted Net Income 3 or $1.08 per share $167.9 million of cash and DRIP dividends paid — a new record $511.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at year-end and no debt $356.4 million from the exercise of warrants at C$75 per share\nQ4/2017 Financial Highlights\n119,839 GEOs sold $167.2 million in revenue – a 7.7% increase over Q4/2016 $128.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA 2 or $0.69 per share $43.5 million of net income, or $0.23 per share $52.1 million of Adjusted Net Income 3 or $0.28 per share\nRevenue and GEOs by Asset Categories\n2017\n2016\nGEOs\nRevenue\nGEOs\nRevenue\n#\n(in millions)\n#\n(in millions)\nPrecious Metals\nGold\n371,440\n$\n467.2\n341,379\n$\n425.9\nSilver\n77,426\n98.1\n87,137\n108.5\nPGMs\n34,520\n44.5\n28,958\n37.1\nPrecious Metals -\nTotal\n483,386\n$\n609.8\n457,474\n$\n571.5\nOther Minerals\n14,359\n18.2\n6,909\n8.6\nOil & Gas\n—\n47.0\n—\n30.1\n497,745\n$\n675.0\n464,383\n$\n610.2\nRevenue and GEOs by Asset Categories\nQ4/2017\nQ4/2016\nGEOs\nRevenue\nGEOs\nRevenue\n#\n(in millions)\n#\n(in millions)\nPrecious Metals\nGold\n88,954\n$\n113.4\n93,775\n$\n112.8\nSilver\n18,843\n24.1\n18,650\n21.9\nPGMs\n8,977\n11.7\n7,611\n8.0\nPrecious Metals -\nTotal\n116,774\n$\n149.2\n120,036\n$\n142.7\nOther Minerals\n3,065\n4.0\n1,874\n2.2\nOil & Gas\n—\n14.0\n—\n10.4\n119,839\n$\n167.2\n121,910\n$\n155.3\nFor Q4/2017, revenue was sourced 89.2% from precious metals (67.8% gold, 14.4% silver and 7.0% PGM) and 82.1% from the Americas (46.3% Latin America, 16.1% U.S. and 19.7% Canada). Operating costs and expenses increased year-over-year, reflecting increased stream ounce deliveries. Oil & gas revenue increased 34.6%, reflecting both higher prices and production levels year-over-year. Cash provided by operating activities was $126.3 million, an increase of 3.6% compared to Q4/2016.\nCorporate Updates\nCobre Panama: In September 2017, Franco-Nevada agreed to terms with First Quantum to purchase an additional precious metals stream on the Cobre Panama project for $178.0 million. This agreement was expanded to $356.0 million on January 22, 2018 to also include a precious metals stream on the 10% indirect interest held by Korea Resources Corp. The purchase price will be paid as a one-time advance payment expected to be made before the end of March, 2018. Franco-Nevada now has exposure to the precious metals produced from 100% of the ownership of the Cobre Panama project. Delaware Oil & Gas Royalties: Franco-Nevada finalized the purchase of a royalty portfolio in the Delaware Basin, which represents the western portion of the larger Permian Basin in Texas for $101.3 million on February 20, 2018. The royalties are derived principally from mineral title which provides a perpetual interest in royalty lands. The transaction has an effective date of October 1, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nIn 2018, Franco-Nevada expects attributable royalty and stream production to total 460,000 to 490,000 GEOs from its mineral assets and revenue of $50 million to $60 million from its oil & gas assets. Of the royalty and stream production, 310,000 to 330,000 GEOs are expected from Franco-Nevada's various stream agreements with no GEOs assumed from Cobre Panama in 2018. For 2018 guidance, silver, platinum and palladium metals have been converted to GEOs using assumed commodity prices of $1,300/oz Au, $17.00/oz Ag, $950/oz Pt and $1,050/oz Pd. The WTI oil price is assumed to average $55 per barrel with a $4.80 per barrel price differential between the Edmonton Light and realized prices for Canadian oil. The Company estimates depletion expense of $250 million to $280 million. 2018 guidance and 5-year outlook below is based on public forecasts and other disclosures by the third-party owners and operators of our assets or our assessment thereof.\n5-Year Outlook\nOur outlook to 2022 assumes that the Cobre Panama project will be fully ramped-up by 2022. From 2019-2021, scheduled fixed ounce payments from Midas/Fire Creek, Karma and Sabodala are expected to step down to longer-term royalty payments or stream deliveries. Using the same commodity price assumptions as were used for our 2018 guidance (see above) and assuming no other acquisitions, Franco-Nevada expects its existing portfolio to generate between 565,000 to 595,000 GEOs by 2022. Oil & gas revenues at the same $55 per barrel WTI oil price assumption are expected to range between $80 million and $90 million.\nQ4/2017 Portfolio Updates\nPrecious Metals — Latin America: GEOs from Latin American precious metals assets were consistent year-over-year. Precious metal GEOs earned from Latin America were 60,568 GEOs compared with 60,808 GEOs in Q4/2016.\nCobre Panama (gold and silver stream) – During Q4/2017, Franco-Nevada contributed $89.4 million of its share of construction capital for the Cobre Panama project.

These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see below or the Company's current MD&A disclosure found on the Company's website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR. Comparative information has been recalculated to conform to current presentation.\nGEOs include our gold, silver, platinum, palladium and other mineral assets. GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Platinum, palladium, silver and other minerals are converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the relevant gold price. The gold price used in the computation of GEOs earned from a particular asset varies depending on the royalty or stream agreement, which may make reference to the market price realized by the operator, or the average for the month, quarter, or year in which the mineral was produced or sold. For Q4/2017, the average commodity prices were as follows: $1,274 gold (2016 - $1,218), $16.70 silver (2016 - $17.18), $920 platinum (2016 - $944) and $993 palladium (2016 - $684). For 2017, the average commodity prices were as follows: $1,257 gold (2016 - $1,248), $17.05 silver (2016 - $17.20), $948 platinum (2016 - $987) and $870 palladium (2016 - $613).\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net income and EPS: income tax expense/recovery; finance expenses; finance income; depletion and depreciation; non-cash costs of sales; impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on sale of royalty interests; gains/losses on investments; and foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net income and earnings per share (\"EPS\"): foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses; impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on sale of royalty interests; gains/losses on investments; unusual non-recurring items; and the impact of income taxes on these items.\nReconciliation to IFRS measures:\nFor the three months ended\nFor the year
