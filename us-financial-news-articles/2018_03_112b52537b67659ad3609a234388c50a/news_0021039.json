Even if the start of the year has been weaker than normal, prices are no longer declining,” Chief Executive Christian Vammervold Dreyer said.\n“It looks like the market has gained a better balance in many cities than we’ve seen for a long time,” he added.\nUnadjusted prices rose by 1.1 percent in February from January. The housing data was compiled by Real Estate Norway, FINN and Eiendomsverdi.\nNordea Markets economist Erik Bruce said the seasonally adjusted increase was marginally stronger than the central bank had anticipated.\n“Today’s figure is in line with the view that the housing downturn in Norway is soon over. On the margin an argument for higher rates,” Bruce wrote in a note to clients.
