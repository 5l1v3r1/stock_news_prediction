REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo In a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) unit said it sued LJM Partners Ltd and its commodity pool after being required, in its role as clearing broker, to cover the company’s margin and losses with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\nLJM failed to make contractually required payments to cover the losses, Wells Fargo said, asking the court to help it recover the money.\nLJM, run by Anthony Caine, told clients last week it would return what is left of their money, Reuters reported.\nIt could be the first investment manager to close after complex trades failed spectacularly in the Feb. 5 reversal of fortune in U.S. stocks that some investors called “vol-mageddon.” LJM Partners and an affiliate saw losses of 80 percent or more.\nThe company had profited from a complex options-market trade that printed money during the market’s calm rise in 2017 but later broke down.\nInvestors are suing Caine and Anish Parvataneni, a portfolio manager at the company who previously worked for well-known fund investor Ken Griffin’s Citadel, over what they said were inadequate disclosures about the risks of LJM’s approach.\nLJM, which along with an affiliate managed more than $1 billion earlier this year, is now likely insolvent, Wells Fargo said.\nPhone calls to LJM have not been returned.\nIn letters to clients last month, Caine, a veteran of the 1990s technology boom who later went into finance, attributed the decline to “an extreme outlier event” in the market.\nBut he said LJM sold its portfolio partly at the insistence of its largest futures clearing firm, which came in person to supervise LJM’s trading.\nLJM eventually agreed with that broker that it made sense to liquidate all its clients accounts.\nThey sold at relatively disadvantageous prices, with the fund losing much of its remaining value, “because of the sudden and substantial lack of market liquidity,” Caine said in the letter, without naming the broker.\nLJM had previously identified Wells Fargo as its futures broker in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWells Fargo declined to comment on Caine’s account.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel and Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T00:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T00:54:31.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
