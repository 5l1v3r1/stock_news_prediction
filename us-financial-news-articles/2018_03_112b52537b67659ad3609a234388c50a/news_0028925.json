People supporting gun control attend a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing about legislative proposals to improve school safety in the wake of the mass shooting at the high school in Parkland, Florida, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts By a rare bipartisan vote of 407-10, the House passed the bill, which does not allow any of the $50 million to be authorized annually to be used to arm teachers or other school officials.
