EU antitrust authorities on Monday launched an investigation into whether limits placed by TenneT — a subsidiary of TenneT Holding IPO-TTH.AS, the Dutch government-owned operator of electrical grids in the Netherlands and Germany — on cross-border electricity capacity with Denmark breaches EU antitrust rules. TenneT said the German-Danish border suffered from transmission bottlenecks, adding that transmission capacities were stretched to the limit because of market liberalisation and the transition to renewable energy. A statement from TenneT said the EU investigation will include calculations on whether capacities approved under European law put foreign providers at an unfair disadvantage. “The examination can therefore set a precedent for all border connections in Europe,” it added.
