Increased year-over-year shipping volume and higher average selling prices throughout 2017 contributed to the net sales increase. Full-year 2017 net income (GAAP) improved to $19.0 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.10 per share in 2016.\n“Demand for metals improved during 2017, driven by stronger GDP growth in the U.S. and abroad,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Siegal. “Olympic Steel was, and remains, ideally positioned to support this rebound in U.S. industrial activity. The determined execution by our operations and sales teams resulted in our most profitable year since 2011.”\nStrong pricing dynamics for metals and healthy demand have continued in early 2018, he added.\n“Improving economic conditions have revitalized the U.S. manufacturing sector. Our customers are currently benefiting from recent tax legislation and higher capital equipment spending, and stand to gain further from potential infrastructure investments,” Siegal said. “We enter 2018 primed for growth and expect to prosper in this environment. With diversified products and superior customer service, combined with a strong balance sheet and an energized management team, we are poised for continued success.”\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Results\nFourth-quarter net sales increased 21% in 2017, to $308 million, which was up from $255 million in the same quarter of 2016. GAAP net income rose to $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.19 per share in 2016’s fourth quarter.\nIn addition to increased shipping volume and higher sales prices, 2017 net income also benefited from a fourth-quarter $6.2 million deferred tax liability revaluation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This was partially offset in the 2017 fourth quarter by $2.7 million in LIFO expense, a $1.0 million commercial settlement, and a write-off of $0.2 million in deferred financing expenses related to the Company’s new 5-year $400 million credit facility.\nAfter adjusting for unusual items in 2017, and LIFO income in 2016, the adjusted net loss narrowed to $0.04 per share in 2017’s fourth quarter, compared with an adjusted net loss of $0.23 per share in the same quarter of 2016. Similarly, full-year 2017 adjusted net income increased to $1.18 per diluted share, up from an adjusted loss of $0.18 per share in 2016.\nOlympic Steel, Inc.
