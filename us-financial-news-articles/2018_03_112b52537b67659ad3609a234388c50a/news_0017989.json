(NYSE American:TRXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient to improve minimally invasive surgery, today announced its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nRecent Highlights\nThus far in the quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company has sold two Senhance Systems In January of 2018, the Company filed a FDA 510(k) submission to expand the indications for use of the Senhance System, potentially doubling the Senhance System’s total addressable procedures During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold two Senhance Systems, including its first in the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and restricted cash of approximately $97.6 million On December 18, 2017, the Company announced the sale of its SurgiBot assets, providing the Company with proceeds of at least $29 million as well as the option to commercialize the SurgiBot outside of China. On October 13, 2017, the Company received U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance for the Senhance System for use in colorectal and gynecologic laparoscopic surgery\n“We made incredible progress during 2017, including the receipt of 510(k) clearance for the Senhance, the establishment of a global sales infrastructure, generating commercial momentum, and solidifying our balance sheet, ” said Todd M. Pope, President and CEO at TransEnterix. “As we look to 2018, our focus is driving the commercial adoption of Senhance globally by leveraging our sales infrastructure, expanding our instrument offerings, broadening Senhance’s indications for use, and obtaining additional regulatory approvals in key geographies.”\nCommercial and Clinical Update\nThus far in the quarter ending March 31, 2018, the Company has sold two Senhance Systems. Both of these sales have come from sales to end user hospitals by distributors in the Company's EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region.\nIn January of 2018, the Company filed a 510(k) submission with the FDA to expand the indication for use of the Senhance System to include laparoscopic hernia and gallbladder surgery. The Senhance System is currently cleared for use in the U.S. for laparoscopic colorectal and laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, accounting for approximately 1.5 million procedures in the U.S. annually. Upon clearance, we anticipate these additional indications would bring the Senhance System’s total addressable procedures in the U.S. to approximately 3 million.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold two Senhance Systems for total revenue of approximately $3.4 million.\nThe Company's U.S. sales team currently includes 17 professionals.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to advance the SurgiBot System towards global commercialization. The agreement provides the Company with proceeds of at least $29 million, of which $7.5 million was received in December of 2017. This agreement transfers ownership of the SurgiBot System assets, while the Company retains the option to distribute or co-distribute the SurgiBot system outside of China.\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenue of $3.4 million, primarily related to the sale of two Senhance Systems during the quarter, as compared to revenue of $53 thousand in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, total operating expenses were $17.8 million, as compared to $14.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $76.2 million, or $0.40 per share, as compared to a net loss of $14.0 million, or $0.12 per share, in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, adjusted net loss was $14.1 million, or $0.08 per share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $13.6 million, or $0.12 per share in the three months ended December 31, 2016, after adjusting for non-cash charges related to amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and restructuring and other charges.\nFull Year Financial Highlights\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenue of $7.1 million, primarily related to revenue recognized on the sale of four Senhance Systems.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, total operating expenses were $62.3 million, as compared to $124.1 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $144.8 million, or $0.97 per share, as compared to a net loss of $120.0 million, or $1.07 per share, for the full year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted net loss was $51.2 million, or $0.35 per share, as compared to $45.1 million, or $0.41 per share in the full year ended December 31, 2016, after adjusting for non-cash charges related to amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, inventory write-down related to restructuring, restructuring and other charges, and goodwill impairment.\nThe Company had cash and restricted cash of approximately $97.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nTransEnterix, Inc. will host a conference call on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 at 4:30 PM ET to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 operating and financial results.

The adjustments relate to amortization of intangible assets, change in fair value of contingent consideration, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, inventory write-down related to restructuring, restructuring and other charges, and goodwill impairment. These financial measures are presented on a basis other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"Non-GAAP Measures\"). In the tables that follow under \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures,” we present Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share, reconciled to their comparable GAAP measures. These items are adjusted because they are not operational or because these charges are non-cash or non-recurring and management believes these adjustments are meaningful to understanding the Company's performance during the periods presented. These Non-GAAP Measures should be considered a supplement to, not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThis press release includes statements relating to the Senhance Surgical System and our retained rights following the sale of the SurgiBot assets and our current regulatory and commercialization plans for the Senhance System.

Contingent consideration is measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the probability of achieving each of the potential milestones and an estimated discount rate associated with the risks of the expected cash flows attributable to the various milestones. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of these milestones, respectively, and commensurate changes to the associated liability. The contingent consideration is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nc) The Company’s Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants are measured at fair value using a simulation model which takes into account, as of the valuation date, factors including the current exercise price, the expected life of the warrant, the current price of the underlying stock, its expected volatility, holding cost and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the warrant. The warrant liability is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss\nd) The inventory write-down was related to restructuring as a result of the Company’s decision to reprioritize its efforts to focus on commercialization and regulatory clearance of the Senhance System. The Company implemented a restructuring plan in the 2016 second quarter.\ne) The restructuring and other charges were a result of the Company’s decision to reprioritize its efforts to focus on commercialization and regulatory clearance of the Senhance System.\nf) The goodwill impairment was due to the negative FDA response on the SurgiBot System in April 2016 which obligated the Company to conduct an impairment analysis of the goodwill during the 2016 second quarter. A significant input to this analysis was that the Company’s market value fell below its book value during the 2016 second quarter.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006613/en/\nFor TransEnterix, Inc.\nInvestors:\nMark Klausner, +1 443-213-0501\ninvest@transenterix.com\nor\nMedia:\nJoanna Rice, +1 951-751-1858\njoanna@greymattermarketing.com\nSource: TransEnterix, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.transenterix.com&esheet=51769071&newsitemid=20180306006613&lan=en-US&anchor=www.transenterix.com&index=2&md5=94d85913c264836af1f36a1df65e3fba", "http://ir.transenterix.com/events.cfm", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.transenterix.com%2Fevents.cfm&esheet=51769071&newsitemid=20180306006613&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.transenterix.com%2Fevents.cfm&index=1&md5=bb423991a6bd0807f554684e0397eb55", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006613/en/"], "published": "2018-03-07T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T03:14:24.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
