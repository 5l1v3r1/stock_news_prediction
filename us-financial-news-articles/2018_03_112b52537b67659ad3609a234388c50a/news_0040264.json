For example, the states with the lowest incomes tend to be in the Southern and Midwest regions while the highest incomes are located in the Northeast and the West.\nHowever, there's also a correlation between the cost of living and incomes in every state. For example, Mississippi is the state with the lowest cost of living and the lowest average household income.
