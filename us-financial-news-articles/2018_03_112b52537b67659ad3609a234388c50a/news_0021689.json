(TSX:ETG; NYSE American:EGI – the \" Company \" or \" Entrée \") has today filed its annual operational and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All numbers are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS\nEntrée/Oyu Tolgoi Joint Venture Property, Mongolia\nIn September 2017, Entrée management visited the Oyu Tolgoi project and toured some of the main surface infrastructure, including the concentrator and tailings facilities, as well as underground where they observed some of the development work completed as at the date of the visit. This visit also included a review of plans with Oyu Tolgoi LLC (\" OTLLC \") for the immediate and medium-term future.\nAs reported by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (\" Turquoise Hill \"):\nThe main focus of underground development programs at the Oyu Tolgoi project during 2017 was underground lateral development, sinking of Shafts 2 and 5, support infrastructure and the convey-to-surface system.\nBy the end of 2017, five development crews had been deployed, and the commissioning of a new 3,500 tonne per day development crusher was completed in the third quarter of 2017.\nShaft 5 is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2018. When completed, Shaft 5 will be dedicated to ventilation thereby increasing the capacity for underground activities.\nThe sinking of Shaft 2 has been completed, including reaching final depth, shaft bottom mass excavation and concrete floor installation, marking an early milestone in the development progress of Lift 1. The fit out of Shaft 2 will take place throughout 2018. Shaft 2 will be used for access, production and ventilation.\nTurquoise Hill continues to plan for first draw bell on OTLLC's Oyu Tolgoi mining licence in mid-2020 and sustainable first production from the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence in 2021.\nOn January 15, 2018, the Company reported the results of an updated Technical Report titled \"Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi Joint Venture Project, Mongolia, NI 43-101 Technical Report\" (the \" 2018 Technical Report \") that was completed by Amec Foster Wheeler Americas Limited on its interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi joint venture property in Mongolia (the \" Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property \"). The 2018 Technical Report discusses two development scenarios, an updated reserve case (the \" 2018 Reserve Case \") and a Life-of-Mine (\" LOM \") Preliminary Economic Assessment (\" 2018 PEA \").\nThe 2018 Reserve Case is based only on mineral reserves attributable to the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi joint venture from Lift 1 of the Hugo North Extension (also referred to as \" HNE \") underground block cave.\nThe 2018 PEA is an alternative development scenario completed at a conceptual level that assesses the inclusion of mineral resources from Hugo North Extension Lift 2 and Heruga into an overall mine plan with mineral resources from Hugo North Extension Lift 1. The 2018 PEA includes Indicated and Inferred resources from Hugo North Extension Lifts 1 and 2, and Inferred resources from Heruga.\nLOM financial highlights attributable to Entrée from the 2018 Reserve Case and the 2018 PEA include:\n2018 Reserve Case\n2018 PEA (1)\nHNE Lift 1\nHNE Lift 1 + Lift 2\nHNE Lift 1+2+Heruga\nLOM cash flow\n• Before-tax\n• After-tax\n$ M\n$382\n$291\n$2,132\n$1,595\n$2,078\n$1,522\nNet present value\n• 5%\n• 8%\n$ M\n$157\n$111\n$505\n$277\n$512\n$278\nMine life (2)\nYears\n14\n33\n77*\nMetal recovered (3)\n•Copper\n•Gold\n•Silver\nMlb\nKoz\nKoz\n1,115\n514\n3,651\n5,679\n2,637\n20,442\n10,497\n9,367\n45,378\nNotes:\n1.\nLong term metal prices used in the net present value economic analyses are: copper $3.00/lb, gold $1,300.00/oz and silver $19.00/oz.\n2.\n*The 2018 PEA covers a period from 2021 to 2097 (77 years), but there is an 11 year period (2054-2064) with no mining from the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property\nwhen other mineralization from the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence is being mined and processed.\n3.\nEntrée has a 20% attributable interest in the recovered metal.\nThe 2018 PEA demonstrates that Entrée's interest is multi-generational, with potential to deliver over $2.1 billion in undiscounted before-tax cash flow just from Hugo North Extension Lifts 1 and 2 over the first 33 years of production. After-tax, this equates to a net present value at 8% of $277 million. The 2018 PEA also brings resources from Heruga into the mine plan, but these are not scheduled to be mined until much later in the life of the Oyu Tolgoi project. Although the Heruga deposit provides considerable flexibility for future mine planning and development options, additional technical work is needed to establish the mineral resources and costs with greater certainty and to enable investors to better understand the true value of the Heruga deposit.\nThe economic analysis in the 2018 PEA does not have as high a level of certainty as the 2018 Reserve Case. The 2018 PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the 2018 PEA will be realized. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nCorporate\nIn January 2017, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement of 18,529,484 units of the Company at a price of C$0.41 per unit for gross proceeds of approximately C$7.6 million. Each unit consisted of one common share and one-half of one transferable common share purchase warrant that entitled the holder to purchase one additional common share of the Company for a period of five years following the date of issuance.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Company completed a strategic reorganization of Entrée's business through a plan of arrangement under Section 288 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). Entrée's U.S. based assets, the Ann Mason Project and Lordsburg property, were transferred to a newly incorporated company, Mason Resources Corp. (\" Mason Resources \") (TSX:MNR and OTCQB:MSSNF) and Entrée shareholders exchanged their old Entrée shares for shares of two separate and focused, well-capitalized, debt-free TSX-listed companies, each with a high quality advanced project (the \" Arrangement \"). The reorganization provides new and existing shareholders with optionality as to investment strategy and risk profile.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Company changed its name from Entrée Gold Inc. to Entrée Resources Ltd.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Company entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with Mason Resources, pursuant to which Entrée provides office space, furnishings and equipment, communications facilities and personnel necessary for Mason Resources to fulfill its basic day-to-day head office and executive responsibilities on a pro-rata cost-recovery basis.\nQ4 2017 net loss from continuing operations was $1.1 million as compared to Q4 2016 ($0.5 million). For the full 2017 year, net loss from continuing operations was $3.0 million, which is a reduction of 6% compared to 2016 ($3.2 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, cash on hand was $7.1 million and there was a working capital balance of $7.2 million.\nOUTLOOK AND STRATEGY\nEntrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property\nWith the completion and filing of the 2018 Technical Report, the Company is now focused on:\nAssessing opportunities to crystallize value ahead of production from the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property.\nStreamlining Entrée's joint venture interest.\nEducating the market about the risk profile associated with Entrée's interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property.\nWorking with Entrée's joint venture partners to advance any exploration opportunities on the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property that may exist, including several near surface targets that have been identified.\nCorporate\nWith the completion of the Arrangement in May 2017 and the filing of the 2018 Technical Report in January 2018, the Company's focus will be to maximize investor awareness on the results of the 2018 Technical Report and what this report means to the Company and all stakeholders, both current and potential.\nCorporate costs, which include Mongolian site management, marketing and compliance costs, are estimated between $1.2 million and $1.5 million for the 2018 year.\nSUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, operating loss was $3.1 million and was 3% higher than the comparative period in 2016 due mainly to expenditures of $0.2 million for the 2018 Technical Report. The operating loss for the 2017 year was 51% lower than the comparative period in 2015 due to various cost reductions mentioned below.\nThe Company's exploration costs in 2017 were $0.3 million, comprised of $0.1 million in administration costs for Mongolia, and $0.2 million in holding costs on all other properties. The 2017 expenditures were 32% and 80% lower than the exploration expenditures for the comparative 2016 and 2015 periods, respectively. This was mainly the result of Mongolia camp closures and staff reductions in those years.\nGeneral and administration expenditures in 2017 were $2.3 million, and were comparable to the same period in 2016 and 50% lower than the comparative 2015 period due to a reduction in corporate personnel and overhead costs in 2016 and 2015.\nTotal assets as at December 31, 2017 are $8.3 million and are substantially lower than the comparative periods (2016 - $53.3 million and 2015 - $61.7 million) due to the completion of the Arrangement and the resulting spin-out of the U.S. based assets into Mason Resources.\nThe Company's Annual Financial Statements, Management's Discussion and Analysis (\" MD&A \") and Annual Information Form are available on the Company website at www.EntreeResourcesLtd.com and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . The Company's Annual Report on Form 40-F (\" Annual Report \") has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\" SEC \"), and is available on the Company website at www.EntreeResourcesLtd.com and at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml . Shareholders can receive a hard copy of the Company's audited Annual Financial Statements upon request.\nABOUT THE ENTRÉE/OYU TOLGOI JV PROPERTY\nThe Oyu Tolgoi project includes two separate land holdings: the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence, which is held 100% by OTLLC (66% Turquoise Hill; 34% Government of Mongolia), and the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, which is a partnership between Entrée and OTLLC. Rio Tinto is managing the construction of Lift 1 of the Hugo North underground block cave on both the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence and the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. The portion of the Hugo North copper-gold deposit that lies on the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property is known as Hugo North Extension. The Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property also includes the majority of the Heruga copper-gold-molybdenum deposit and a large prospective land package.\nFirst development production from Hugo North Extension Lift 1 is expected in 2021. When Lift 1 underground mine development is completed, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to become the world's third largest copper mine.\nQUALIFIED PERSON\nRobert Cinits, P.Geo., Entrée's Vice President, Corporate Development, a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has approved the technical information in this release.
