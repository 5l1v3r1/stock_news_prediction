This would represent a yield of approximately 1.5 percent based on today’s closing stock price. The dividend will be payable on or about April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2018. The $0.40 dividend would represent an annualized rate of $1.60 per share, or approximately $40 million in aggregate, equivalent to approximately 33 percent of the company’s fiscal 2017 free cash flow 1 .\nIn addition, the company intends to distribute at least 50 percent of prior fiscal year free cash flow to shareholders on an ongoing basis through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases. This combination would represent at least $60 million, based on the company’s fiscal 2017 free cash flow of approximately $120 million. As of December 31, 2017, the company had approximately $120 million of authorization remaining under its existing share repurchase program.\nDavid Li, President and CEO of Cabot Microelectronics, stated, “Our track record of profitability and strong cash generation has enabled us to execute a balanced capital deployment strategy over the years, including organic investments, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. We are pleased to now significantly increase – by doubling – our regular quarterly cash dividend, and announce our intention to distribute at least 50 percent of our ongoing annual free cash flow to our shareholders through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchases. We believe this clearly demonstrates our confidence in our future performance and cash generation capabilities, as well as our continued commitment to delivering ongoing value to our shareholders. Our capital deployment priorities remain (1) investing in the organic needs of our business, (2) paying dividends, (3) executing mergers and acquisitions, and (4) repurchasing shares.”\nSince becoming a public company in 2000, Cabot Microelectronics has distributed approximately $760 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nSeparately, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“tax act”) in December 2017 , the company intends to repatriate a substantial amount of its approximately $275 million in overseas cash and short-term investments, and utilize a portion to repay its existing term loan. This repayment is expected to save approximately $4 million in interest expense on an annualized basis.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nCabot Microelectronics Corporation’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held Tuesday, March 6, 2018, at 8:00 a.m., Central Time.
