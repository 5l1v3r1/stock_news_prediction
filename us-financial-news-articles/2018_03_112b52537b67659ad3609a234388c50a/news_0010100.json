The agreement provides Onkos Surgical priority access to 3D Systems' VSP ® (Virtual Surgical Planning) Orthopedic product line for surgical planning, as well as 3D printed anatomical models. Additionally, the companies will collaborate on next-generation 510(k) clearances for 3D printed implants and instruments for tumor reconstruction.\nThrough this partnership, the companies aim to advance the delivery of personalized surgical solutions to help improve outcomes for patients with tumors and lesions occurring in the pelvis and long bones (i.e., the large bones found in the arms and legs) associated with musculoskeletal cancers. The combination of VSP and 3D printing allows surgeons to preoperatively plan a surgical procedure, as well as design surgical tools and implants for each patient's unique case.\nEstablished by 3D Systems, VSP technology received FDA market clearance for the cranio-maxillofacial region as a service-based approach to personalized surgery, combining expertise in medical imaging, surgical simulation and 3D printing. The surgeon initiates the process, bringing their clinical knowledge and desired surgical plan to an online web meeting with a 3D Systems biomedical engineer to simulate and plan the surgical procedure. The outcome is a digital plan that is transferred to the operating room via accurate 3D printed patient-specific models, guides and templates.\n\"We are delighted to announce this partnership with 3D Systems, a true visionary and leader in medical device 3D printing and surgical planning,\" said Patrick Treacy, co-founder and chief executive officer, Onkos Surgical. \"As an early stage investor in Onkos, they understand the criticality of our connection to the customer, the unique challenges these surgeons and patients face and the tremendous opportunity we have to make a difference for these patients while building a high value and scalable business.\"\nOnkos Surgical was founded in 2015 to deliver high quality implants and instruments that meet the unique needs of musculoskeletal tumor patients. The company quickly embraced 3D printing as a technology that could address the particular needs of both the cancer patient, and the cancer surgeon. Onkos Surgical realized the profound impact they could make if they combined personalized 3D printed medical devices and instrumentation with patient-specific surgical simulation.\n\"When we launched our Precision Oncology initiative at MSTS 2017 in Denver, it was met with great enthusiasm from the surgeon community,\" said Sean Curry, senior vice president of commercial operations, Onkos Surgical. \"The relationship with 3D Systems enhances our capabilities with product bundles and patient-specific solutions that will deliver on our promise of bringing focus and dedication to this space.\"\n\"3D Systems is pleased to partner with Onkos Surgical delivering adaptive tools designed to provide insights, processes and outcomes for musculoskeletal oncology cases,\" said Kevin McAlea, executive vice president, general manager, Metals and Healthcare, 3D Systems. \"The combination of VSP and 3D printing provides an advantage for surgeons to personalize the surgical plan, instruments and implants for each unique case.\"\nAccording to the NIH – National Cancer Institute ( cancer.gov ), there were 3,260 new primary bone cancer cases reported in 2017. In addition to chemotherapy and radiation, two common surgical options for musculoskeletal cancer patients are amputation and limb salvage. Through limb salvage, the surgeon removes the cancer and some healthy tissue with the goal of leaving the limb largely intact. The section of bone that was removed can be replaced either with a bone graft from the patient or another person, or with an internal prosthesis (i.e., implants) made of metal and other materials.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this release that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
