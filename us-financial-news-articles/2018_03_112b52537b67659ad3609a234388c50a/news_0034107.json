The Wall Street Journal has reported that the administration plans to announce its measures on Thursday.\nMr. Lighthizer, in his formal statement, wrote that actions against China were necessary because the World Trade Organization “has proven to be wholly inadequate to deal with China’s version of a state-dominated economy that rejects market principles.” He didn’t repeat that sentence during his oral remarks.\nMr. Lighthizer said the administration had developed a computer algorithm to help the U.S. trade office decide which Chinese products to hit with tariffs. The goal is to pressure China to change practices, he said, while limiting harm to U.S. consumers and companies.\nHe said the U.S. trade office had spent “tens of thousands of hours” reading Chinese documents to better understand Chinese practices.\n“Our view is we have a very serious problem losing our intellectual property, which is the single biggest advantage of the U.S. economy,” Mr. Lighthizer said. “We are losing that to China in ways that aren’t reflective of the underlying economics.”\nThe U.S. particularly objects to China requirements that many companies, including technology, autos and finance, do business in China through joint ventures. The U.S. contends that Beijing pressures those companies to transfer advanced technology to their Chinese partners.\nThe effort against China stems from a monthslong investigation by the administration into Chinese intellectual-property practices that found the damage to U.S. companies from forced technology transfer is $30 billion annually. The proposed punitive measures that the administration is expected to announce on Thursday include tariffs on imports worth at least that amount, $30 billion.\nThe tariffs wouldn’t be imposed immediately. Rather, U.S. industry would be given an opportunity to comment on which products should be subject to the duties. As part of the package, the White House will announce possible investment restrictions by Chinese firms in the U.S. and will direct the Treasury Department to outline rules governing investment from China.\nMr. Lighthizer was called before House lawmakers Wednesday and will face senators on Thursday to discuss the Trump administration’s trade plans. Lawmakers have also summoned Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for testimony on Thursday.\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have cautioned Mr. Trump in recent days that broad trade barriers risk hurting the economy and that Congress could take steps to rein in his trade authority.\n“The challenge for any president in tariffs is to ensure that ultimately, you don’t punish Americans for China’s misbehavior,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, on Monday. Mr. Brady said he is pushing for tariff exceptions for existing contracts, exclusions for products largely made abroad and exemptions for allies.\nMr. Lighthizer also addressed planned steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the administration, telling lawmakers that several key U.S. allies and trading partners wouldn’t face the levies until negotiations on possible tariff exemptions wrap up next month.\nMore\nEU, Australia, Argentina May Avoid Tariffs for Now China to Target Trump’s Base in Tariff Response Trump to Ramp Up Trade Restraints on China —William Mauldin contributed to this article.\nWrite to Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T20:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T19:34:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
