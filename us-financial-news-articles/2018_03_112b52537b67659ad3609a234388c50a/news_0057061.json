But it’s a decision that I understand is in my best interests.” \nJones made 118 appearances for Wasps after coming through the club’s academy, making his senior debut in 2010. \nHe picked up the injury while preparing for the autumn internationals, where he was expected to make his England debut. \n“For me, getting selected for England based on my club form was a huge achievement and I’m proud that was my last contribution to the game,” Jones added.
