However, investors could reassess their anxiety if Trump's plan excluded the United States NAFTA partners.\n\"I believe a more focused tariff that excludes Canada and Mexico, at the very least, would create a wave of jubilation that would cause a return to our regularly scheduled programming of strong growth with tame inflation,\" Cramer said.\nPeople on Wall Street and in the White House were confused about the timing and extent of the planned tariffs, which would hit allies like Canada and Mexico hard. On Monday , ministers from Canada and Mexico met with the U.S. to wrap up the latest round of NAFTA talks, and were expected to press Trump on the tariffs.\nPresident Trump on Monday dangled the possibility of lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs if NAFTA is renegotiated to terms more favorable to the U.S.\n@realDonaldTrumpWe have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada.

That means Alphabet, which does no business in China anyway, can continue to scream higher as it has been for the last few days.\"\nWATCH: The full Cramer clip on tariffs show chapters Cramer: Trump tariff that excludes Canada and Mexico would create 'wave of jubilation' in the market 17 Hours Ago | 12:55", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade/trump-faces-pushback-on-tariffs-but-says-he-will-not-back-down-idUSKBN1GH26D", "https://vine.co/u/984542302087651328", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/970626966004162560", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel"], "published": "2018-03-07T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T01:27:42.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
