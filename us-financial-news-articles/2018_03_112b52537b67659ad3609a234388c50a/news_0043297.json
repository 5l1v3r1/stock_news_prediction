both clearly at risk in a trade war.”\nChina urged the United States to “pull back from the brink” as the world’s two largest economies moved closer to a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy.\nThe tariffs are on top of additional duties on steel and aluminium on a number of countries including China, which has already hit back with its own plans to slap duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports.\n“Tariffs on China will very likely cause collateral damage in Asia, particularly to smaller open economies,” said Alex Wolf, Hong Kong-based senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.\n“A greater share of value-added in U.S. computer imports comes from Asia ex-China than from China itself,” Wolf added.\n“And the integration of cross-border supply chains means that small open economies like Korea and Taiwan would be highly sensitive to US and/or China trade barriers.”\nIndeed, the Korean won held near one month lows on the U.S. dollar while South Korea’s benchmark share index was off 0.3 percent after being bitterly hammered on Friday.\nU.S. shares were also clobbered last week, with the Dow falling 1.8 percent on Friday, the S&P 500 declining 2.1 percent and the Nasdaq off 2.4 percent.\nIN SEARCH OF SAFETY Amid the uncertain global economic climate, investors seeking safer assets jumped into government bonds in Europe and the United States.\nTreasury futures were a shade firmer on Monday while German Bund futures were stronger too.\nMany investors also turned to the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country’s massive current account surplus.\nThe yen held at 104.79 after last week going below 105 for the first time since November 2016. The euro, another perceived haven for nervous investors, was up 0.1 percent at $1.2364.\nThe dollar index, tracking the greenback against six other major currencies, was unchanged near a one-month low of 89.447.\nIn commodities, U.S. crude rose 53 cents to $66.42. Brent was last at $70.79, up 48 cents. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,349.72.\nReporting by Swati Pandey Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T09:28:16.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
