Russian diplomats in Podgorica were not immediately available for comment.\nRelations between Russia and Montenegro have been strained since October 2016, following an alleged Russian-backed plot to kill Montenegro’s prime minister, overthrow the government and prevent the ex-Yugoslav republic joining NATO. The Kremlin has dismissed the accusation as absurd.\nReporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:05:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
