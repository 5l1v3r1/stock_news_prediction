But, at 10.26 percent in February, it remains one the main imbalances in the economy and well above the bank’s target of 5 percent.\nDespite this, President Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly called for cheaper credit to boost the economy, leading to concerns among investors that the nominally independent central bank is susceptible to political influence.\nThe bank last hiked rates in December, its first tightening in eight months.\nIts monetary policy committee said in a statement that inflation and inflation expectations “continue to pose risks on pricing behaviour”, with underlying indicators displaying “inertia”.\nIt also said recent data indicated economic activity remained robust and domestic demand was continuing to expand.\nFor a second straight meeting, the bank left all four of it policy-setting rates unchanged, as predicted by all 15 economists polled by Reuters.\nNomura International economist Inan Demir said overheating pressures and the susceptibility of the lira to global and Turkey-specific shocks meant “the risks are skewed towards higher rates.”\n“However, we do not expect the Bank to act unless the currency comes under severe pressure,” he said in a note to clients.\nThe lira was little changed at 3.8010 from 3.7987 immediately before the central bank’s announcement.\nThe bank kept its late liquidity window, the highest of the instruments it uses to set policy, at 12.75 percent. The overnight lending rate stayed at 9.25 percent and the overnight borrowing rate at 7.25 percent.\nTurkey’s economy has rebounded strongly from a downturn that followed an attempted coup in 2016, helped by a series of government stimulus measures. It grew by 11.1 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, its fastest expansion in six years.\nAnnual GDP growth is expected to be over 7 percent in 2017.
