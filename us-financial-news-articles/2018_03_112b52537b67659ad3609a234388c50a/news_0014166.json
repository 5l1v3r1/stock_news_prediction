It includes a first cap at openside flank for Scarlets’ James Davies. Coach Warren Gatland has made 10 changes in all to his side, announced on Wednesday, with Gareth Anscombe coming in at flyhalf to replace Dan Biggar and Owen Watkin making his first Six Nations start as partner at centre to Hadleigh Parkes. George North returns to the starting team which means Liam Williams moves to fullback in place of Leigh Halfpenny. “It is a great opportunity for Taulupe, he is a world class player, hugely experienced and this will be great for his development and we are looking forward to seeing those leadership qualities come through,” Gatland said in a statement.

Wales have lost just twice to Italy in 25 previous meetings but never at home.
