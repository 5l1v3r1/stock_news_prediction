The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 724.42 points to close at 23,957.89. The 2.9 percent decline was the worst since Feb. 8.\nTrump called the tariffs the \"first of many\" trade actions. The new measures are designed to penalize China for trade practices that the Trump administration says involve stealing American companies' intellectual property.\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Thursday he doesn't think there will be a trade war with China resulting from the latest tariffs.\n\"There will be some ultimate retaliation [from the Chinese] but I don't think it's going to be the end of the earth,\" he said on \" Power Lunch .\"\nMatt Gold, former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative for North America under President Barack Obama, said China may adopt a wait-and-see attitude.\nBecause Trump's memo gives the U.S. trade representative an option to pursue the World Trade Organization's procedures, China will step back and see if the U.S. follows the proper rules, he explained.\nThat would \"definitely quiet down the rhetoric,\" Gold told \"Closing Bell.\"\nâ€” CNBC's Fred Imbert and Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T00:17:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
