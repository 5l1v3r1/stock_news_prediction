We just don’t know how much and when and where,” Coats said.\nU.S. intelligence determined that Russia sought to influence the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump, the Republican candidate. The finding has shadowed his 14 months in the White House amid multiple congressional investigations and a probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) Daniel Coats prepares to testify to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Worldwide Threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2018.

Trump has denied collusion between his associates and Russia.\nHe told a news conference on Tuesday the United States was studying how to protect elections and would counteract any meddling very strongly.\nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) Daniel Coats prepares to testify to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Worldwide Threats on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Lawmakers, particularly Democrats, have accused the Trump administration of doing too little to combat hacking. Control of the U.S. Congress is up for grabs in November.\nThey especially fault the administration for failing to impose sanctions on Russia that Congress passed overwhelmingly last year. Coats told the hearing the Treasury Department would announce sanctions on Russia as soon as next week.\nSome lawmakers pressed Coats on who was responsible for countering Russian propaganda online, noting administration officials refer to the need for a “whole of government approach.”\nDemocratic Senator Martin Heinrich said, “I fear a ‘whole of government approach’ has been a catch-all for ‘It’s someone else’s job.’”\nTrump’s nominee to lead the National Security Agency, Lieutenant General Paul Nakasone, told Senate Armed Services he did not think Russia expected much of a U.S. response to cyber attacks. Admiral Mike Rogers, the current NSA director, told the panel Trump had not granted him authority to disrupt Russian hacking.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle Additional reporting by Eric Walsh Editing by Franklin Paul and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T19:32:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
