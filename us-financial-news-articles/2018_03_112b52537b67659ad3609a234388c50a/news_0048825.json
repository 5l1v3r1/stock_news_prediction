That’s not Apple,” suggesting Apple’s approach would differ from that of Amazon . Amazon in January announced a list of 20 finalist cities for its new headquarters .\nThe new campus, the location of which has not yet been revealed, will primarily host technical support staff. Unlike Amazon, Apple’s announcement of the new space in January did not come with a large unveiling and request for proposals .\nAccording to a CNBC report, Cook said , “We didn’t want to create this contest. You wind up putting people through a ton of work to select one, that is a case where you have a winner and a lot of losers. I don’t like that.”\nCook also shared some strong words about Facebook during the interview, criticizing the social media company’s approach to privacy, and saying that he “wouldn’t be in this situation” if he were at the helm.\nCook’s full interview will air this Friday evening on MSNBC.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/paayalzaveri/status/979026251171094528"], "published": "2018-03-29T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T20:17:40.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
