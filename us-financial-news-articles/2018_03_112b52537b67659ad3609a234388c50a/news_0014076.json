(NASDAQ:EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nDave Gonyer, R.Ph., President and CEO, stated, “2017 was a critical year for Evoke as we successfully completed our pivotal comparative exposure pharmacokinetic (PK) study for Gimoti™, an important component of our 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). From the results of the PK trial and recent FDA communications, we were able to confirm the proposed dose for women to be submitted in the NDA. The sex-based NDA submission strategy will allow us to seek approval for a product that is specific to the needs of 80% of the patients who suffer from symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis. We continue to work diligently to ensure that we submit a comprehensive NDA next quarter.”\nMr. Gonyer continued, “Financially, we remain conservative with our expenditures and reiterate that we have cash runway into October 2018. We are actively evaluating multiple strategic pathways forward for Gimoti, including debt financing and other potential partnerships.”\nFourth Quarter and Year End Financial Review\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss was approximately $308,000, or $0.02 per basic share, compared to a net loss of approximately $1.5 million, or $0.12 per basic share for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the net loss was approximately $12.2 million, or $0.82 per basic share. This compares to a net loss of approximately $10.7 million, or $1.15 per basic share for 2016.\nResearch and development expenses totaled approximately $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to approximately $1.5 million for 2016. For the full year 2017, research and development expenses were approximately $7.1 million compared to approximately $7.0 million in the prior year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1.0 million compared with approximately $822,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $4.1 million versus approximately $3.6 million for the full year of 2016.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately $2.7 million, compared to total operating expenses of approximately $2.3 million for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total operating expenses were approximately $11.2 million compared to $10.5 million for the full year of 2016.\nIncluded in net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a gain of approximately $2.3 million due to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was a net loss due to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of approximately $1.0 million.
