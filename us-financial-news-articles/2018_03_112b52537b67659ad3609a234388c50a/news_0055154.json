REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo Europe’s biggest automaker also said it would extend incentives for buyers of new diesel cars.\nThe moves come after a German court ruled last month that cities in the country could ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from their streets.\nMany German cities exceed European Union limits on atmospheric nitrogen oxide, known to cause respiratory diseases.\nFears of bans have led to a plunge in demand for diesel vehicles, which are also key to carmakers’ attempts to meet new EU rules on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. While diesel cars are heavily criticized for emitting nitrogen oxide, they spew out less CO2 than gasoline equivalents.\nDiesel car sales plunged 19 percent in Germany last month.\nAt its core VW brand, Volkswagen said its buyback offer applied to new diesels bought between April 1 and the end of 2018 and would kick in if the city in which the buyer lived or worked banned diesels within three years of the purchase.\nIt said its dealerships would buy back diesel vehicles affected by bans at their current value if their owners at the same time bought a new vehicle that was not affected by cities’ driving restrictions.\nAt Czech brand Skoda, the guarantee applies to cars bought between April 1 and the end of June, but will cover bans introduced within four years of the purchase date.\nAt premium brand Audi, the offer only covers leased vehicles.\nVolkswagen also said it was extending to the end of June incentives for customers trading in older diesels for new ones.\nFellow German carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) said earlier this month it would offer to take back leased vehicles if diesels were banned within 100 kilometers (62 miles) of the operator’s home or place of work.\nThere has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests.\nBut Germany’s government is seeking to avoid widespread bans on heavily polluting diesel vehicles, which companies say could cut the resale value of up to 15 million vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market.\nIn Germany, where motorists expect to drive powerful cars on motorways with no speed limits, any restrictions will be unpopular. Yet air quality is also a big concern, with green and consumer groups pushing for action.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Jane Merriman and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T14:11:09.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
