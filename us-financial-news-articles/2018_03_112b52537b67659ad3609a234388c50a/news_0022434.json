Muscat said he feared leaving the EU single market would reduce Britain’s comparative advantage in services although he said predictions of a mass exodus from the City of London after Brexit were overdone. He added though that he expected London and Brussels would find a solution on trade in services post-Brexit. “I think there will be concessions from both sides, but from the European side, I don’t see concessions when it comes to points of principle, such as jurisdiction,” he told reporters on a visit to London. “I see that as a very big, bold and bright red line from the European side,” he added.
