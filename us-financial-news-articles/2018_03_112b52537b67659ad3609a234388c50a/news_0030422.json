Volk, President and Chief Executive Officer of STORE Capital. “Our ability to issue corporate investment-grade term debt expands our borrowing capacity and flexibility. Going forward, we plan to continue to issue both secured debt under our S&P A+ rated Master Funding conduit and access the public unsecured debt market where the volume is greater and the efficiency is extremely high on a relative basis. Together, these will give us the ability to strategically source our debt capital and manage our cost of capital while maintaining well-laddered debt maturities and prudent leverage targets. We welcome our new debt investors and appreciate their support.”\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo Securities, Citigroup, J.P.
