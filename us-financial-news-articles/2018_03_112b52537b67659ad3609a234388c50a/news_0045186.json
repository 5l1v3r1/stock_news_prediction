I got off to a great start and then I was just trying to pound the greens the rest of the way in.”\nGarnett receives a two-year tour exemption for his victory.\nFellow American Kevin Mitchell carded 67 to claim second place on 14 under.\nCanadian Corey Conners, who started the day in second place, faded with a 76 to tie for 13th on 10 under, a double-bogey at the last compounding his misery.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T02:30:43.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
