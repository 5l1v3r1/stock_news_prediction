The U.S. is a different story,” Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet, said.\nThe ECB is due to meet next week, and many investors will be keeping an eye on how forward guidance - a tool used by policymakers to impact rate hike expectations - could be changed, said Lenz of DZ Bank.\nAt the moment, money market investors are pricing in a roughly 30 percent chance of a rate hike by the end of 2018.\nThree sources told Reuters on Wednesday the ECB could discuss tweaking its communication stance at the March 8 meeting, but no major policy shift is expected.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Sujata Rao; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:54:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
