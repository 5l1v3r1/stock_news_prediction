He added the new round with improved bids will be completed in a few weeks. \nSnam declined to comment, while Reganosa did not immediately respond. \nAthens is selling a 31 percent stake and Hellenic Petroleum, Greece’s biggest oil refiner, its 35 percent stake in the grid. \nA share purchase agreement and a shareholders’ agreement for DESFA are due to be signed by April for the sale to conclude by June, before Greece exits its third bailout in August. \nDESFA, which owns and operates Greece’s natural gas network and a liquefied natural gas terminal on an islet off Athens, is considered a valuable asset as gas consumption in Greece rises and the country seeks to boost its presence in the regional energy market. \nDESFA transports gas from the Greek-Bulgarian and Greek-Turkish borders to Greek consumers via a 1,459-km (907-mile) pipeline.
