See explanation of non-GAAP measures below. As announced on November 29, 2017, the Company sold its mobile gaming subsidiary, Big Fish Games Inc. (\"Big Fish Games\"), to Aristocrat Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of approximately $990 million in cash (\"Big Fish Transaction\"). The Company closed the Big Fish Transaction on January 9, 2018. For purposes of our consolidated financial statements and information included in this release prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the Big Fish Games segment is classified as held for sale and discontinued operations. Therefore, Big Fish Games is excluded from GAAP net revenue and operating income. Net income and diluted EPS include the results from Big Fish Games' discontinued operations. For purposes of adjusted EBITDA and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow, the Company has included the results of Big Fish Games. See explanation of Non-GAAP measures below.\nNet revenue and adjusted EBITDA will be discussed in more detail below by Operating Segment.\nThe Company's fourth quarter 2017 net income was $38.2 million, up 43% and diluted EPS was $2.46, up 54%. Our 2017 net income was $140.5 million, up 30% and diluted EPS was $8.77, up 37%. The fourth quarter and total year net income and diluted EPS were impacted by the following items:\n$57.7 million provisional benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Partially offsetting this benefit were:\n- $23.7 million gain on Calder land sale in 2016;\n- $21.7 million of non-cash asset impairments in 2017; and\n- $20.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2017.\nThe Company’s fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income was $5.1 million, up 89% and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.33, up 106% compared to fourth quarter 2016.\nThe Company’s 2017 adjusted net income was $94.1 million, up 16% and adjusted diluted EPS was $5.88, up 21% compared to 2016.\nOPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS:\nWe use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. We utilize the adjusted EBITDA metric because we believe the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring items is necessary to provide a more accurate measure of our core operating results and enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure provided in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nThe operating segment summaries below present net revenue from external customers and intercompany revenue from each of our operating segments:\nRacing Fourth Quarter Years Ended December 31, (in millions): 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenue $ 32.9 $ 33.6 $ 276.6 $ 268.1 Adjusted EBITDA (6.2 ) (4.6 ) 84.5 79.7 For the quarter, net revenue decreased $0.7 million due to one less live racing day at Churchill Downs in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.6 million primarily due to the $0.7 million decrease in revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative and marketing costs at Churchill Downs.\nFor the full year, net revenue increased $8.5 million driven by a $7.5 million increase at Churchill Downs primarily due to a successful Kentucky Derby and Oaks week and a $2.7 million increase at Arlington driven by an increase in handle and admissions. Partially offsetting these increases was a $1.6 million decrease at Fair Grounds primarily due to the impact of a contagious equine outbreak which quarantined horses causing limited field sizes in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $4.8 million primarily driven by:\n$4.5 million increase at Churchill Downs as a result of a successful Kentucky Derby and Oaks week; $1.7 million increase at Arlington driven by increased handle and admissions; $0.7 million decrease at Fair Grounds from the contagious equine outbreak in the first quarter of 2017; and $0.7 million decrease at Calder due to a real estate tax refund received in prior year.\nCasino Fourth Quarter Years Ended December 31, (in millions): 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenue $ 87.2 $ 78.9 $ 350.5 $ 332.8 Adjusted EBITDA 33.7 27.8 146.0 125.8 For the quarter, net revenue increased $8.3 million primarily driven by a $3.5 million increase at Calder, a $2.4 million increase at Oxford, and a $2.1 million increase at Riverwalk.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $5.9 million for the quarter primarily driven by:\n$3.2 million increase from our wholly-owned Casino properties, including a $1.9 million increase at Riverwalk, a $1.1 million increase at Calder, and a $0.9 million increase at Oxford. Partially offsetting these increases was a $0.6 million decrease at Harlow's; and $2.7 million increase in our Casino equity investments. The growth in Casino equity investments was partially attributable to the equity investment in Ocean Downs in January 2017.\nFor the full year 2017, net revenue increased $17.7 million driven by a $6.3 million increase at Calder, a $6.2 million increase at Oxford, a $2.1 million increase at Riverwalk, a $1.6 million increase at Harlow's, and a $1.4 million increase at VSI.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $20.2 million for the full year 2017 primarily driven by:\n$5.1 million increase from our wholly-owned Casino properties, including a $2.1 million increase at our Mississippi properties, a $1.9 million increase at Oxford, and a $1.3 million increase at Calder, and $15.1 million increase in our Casino equity investments. The growth in Casino equity investments was partially attributable to the equity investment in Ocean Downs in January 2017.\nTwinSpires Fourth Quarter Years Ended December 31, (in millions): 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenue $ 57.5 $ 48.8 $ 256.7 $ 222.9 Adjusted EBITDA 13.1 10.6 64.4 56.2 For the quarter, net revenue increased $8.7 million and adjusted EBITDA increased $2.5 million primarily due to an increase in handle of 19%, outpacing the industry by 16.5 percentage points.\nFor the full year 2017, net revenue increased $33.8 million and adjusted EBITDA increased $8.2 million primarily due to an increase in handle of 17%, outpacing the industry by 15.3 percentage points.\nBig Fish Games Fourth Quarter Years Ended December 31, (in millions): 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA $ 22.6 $ 26.0 $ 80.3 $ 82.2 For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.4 million primarily due to an increase in user acquisition spending, partially offset by an increase in revenue.\nFor the full year, adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.9 million primarily due to a decrease in revenue and an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in user acquisition spending.\nTreasury Management\nAs previously announced, the Company executed a new 2017 Credit Agreement consisting of a $700.0 million Revolving Credit Facility (the \"Revolver\") which matures in 2022 and a $400.0 million Term Loan B which matures in 2024. Also, the Company redeemed its $600.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021 in December 2017 and issued $500.0 million 4.75% Senior Notes due 2028. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Big Fish Transaction to pay off the $242.0 million outstanding balance on the Revolver at December 31, 2017 and the Company's Board of Directors authorized $500.0 million of the proceeds to be used to repurchase shares of the Company through a \"modified Dutch auction\" tender offer. The Company completed the tender offer on February 12, 2018 by repurchasing 1,886,792 shares at a purchase price of $265 per share with an aggregate cost of $500 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer.\nConference Call\nA conference call regarding this news release is scheduled for Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 9 a.m. ET. Investors and other interested parties may listen to the teleconference by accessing the online, real-time webcast and broadcast of the call at http://ir.churchilldownsincorporated.com/events.cfm , or by dialing (877) 372-0878 and entering the pass code 99811530 at least 10 minutes before the appointed time. International callers should dial (253) 237-1169. An online replay will be available at approximately noon ET on Thursday, March 1, 2018 and will continue to be available for two weeks. A copy of the Company’s news release announcing quarterly results and relevant financial and statistical information about the period will be accessible at www.churchilldownsincorporated.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP, the Company also uses non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA includes CDI's portion of the EBITDA from our equity investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes:\nTransaction expense, net which includes:\n- Acquisition and disposition related charges, including fair value adjustments related to earnouts and deferred payments; and\n- Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting, and other deal-related expense; Stock-based compensation expense; Asset impairments; Gain on Calder land sale; Calder exit costs; Loss on extinguishment of debt; and Other charges, recoveries and expenses\nFor purposes of segment reporting, adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures as a key performance measure of the results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. The measure facilitates comparison of operating performance between periods and helps investors to better understand the operating results of CDI by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core business or operating results. The Company believes the use of this measure enables management and investors to evaluate and compare, from period to period, the Company’s operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. The non-GAAP measures are a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or diluted EPS (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.\nEffective January 1, 2017, certain revenue previously included in our Corporate segment was deemed by management to be more closely aligned with our TwinSpires segment. Due to the Big Fish Transaction, the Company has presented Big Fish Games as held for sale and discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. The Company has not allocated corporate and other certain expenses to Big Fish Games consistent with the discontinued operations presentation in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Accordingly, the prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nAbout Churchill Downs Incorporated\nChurchill Downs Incorporated, (CDI) (Nasdaq:CHDN), headquartered in Louisville, Ky., is an industry-leading racing, gaming and online entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event - The Kentucky Derby .
