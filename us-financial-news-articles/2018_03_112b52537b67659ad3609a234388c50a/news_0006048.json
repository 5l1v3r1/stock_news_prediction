Trump has repeatedly said the U.S trade deficit is too big and needs fixing.\nAt the same time, Dudley noted that communities that are hurt by free trade need to be provided more support.\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T20:56:33.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
