But the wisdom of a deal split opinion among investors, with some worried about the risk to the company's dividend.\nAcquiring additional consumer health assets at a reasonable price could have been a fairly safe way to boost earnings, since scale is key in over-the-counter remedies, but it could have distracted from fixing GSK's core pharma division.\nThat is a particular headache for Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L'Oreal â€” since she has her work cut out to persuade the market she is the right person to lead Britain's top pharmaceuticals company.\nLast month, in a bid to reassure investors, she spelled out more clearly than before that her first priority was improving performance in prescription drugs, followed by dividend payments and only after that acquisitions.\nThe overhaul of the drugs business, which has produced fewer blockbuster medicines than rivals in recent years, is underway in both the commercial and research fields.\nGSK runs its consumer health-care business via a joint venture with Novartis , which complicates any acquisitions. Novartis has the right to sell down its 36.5 percent stake, valued at around $10 billion, from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T14:51:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
