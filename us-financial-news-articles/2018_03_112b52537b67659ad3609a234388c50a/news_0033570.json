Zuma has denied any wrongdoing.\nThe historical charges were dropped by the NPA just before Zuma ran for the South African presidency in 2009.\nZuma was at the center of a political firestorm earlier this year, forced to resign as president by his ruling African National Congress party in February. He was replaced by his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, who has taken a tough stance on graft within the country.\nSouth Africa's Johannesburg Top 40 Index was close to the flat line on the announcement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T16:40:46.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
