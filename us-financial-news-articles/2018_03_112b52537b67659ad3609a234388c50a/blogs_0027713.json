The brothers cannot leave the country while they answer to charges against them. The Batistas control JBS through holding company J&F Investimentos. \nThe judge who ordered Joesley Batista's release said the reason for his preventive arrest order was no longer valid, since that type of arrest by law should not exceed 120 days. The former JBS chairman had been behind bars for the last six months. \nThe Batistas' testimony was central to charges presented by Brazil's prosecutor general against Temer. In a plea deal, they accused Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the president. \nTemer denied any wrongdoing, and Brazil's lower house of Congress voted against sending the charges to the Supreme Court. \nJoesley was later accused of withholding key information from the plea deal, triggering allegations of obstructing justice that led to his arrest. \nJBS shares jumped 3.6 percent in Sao Paulo on Friday, as the Bovespa index rose 1.5 percent.
