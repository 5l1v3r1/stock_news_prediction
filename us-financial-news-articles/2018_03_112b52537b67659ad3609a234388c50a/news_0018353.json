Weak wage growth has added to the strain on many households while the overall economy has slowed.\nBefore the referendum, the Halifax house price index showed house prices were rising by as much as 10 percent a year.\nRussell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said prices would probably continue to grow slowly because mortgage rates remained low, despite November’s interest rate increase by the Bank of England — its first in more than a decade.\n“The low mortgage rate environment, combined with an ongoing shortage of properties for sale, should continue to support house prices over the coming months,” he said.\nLast week, rival mortgage lender Nationwide also reported a slowdown in the pace of growth in prices.\nBy contrast, data from the BoE showed a stronger picture for the housing market with the sharpest increase in the number of mortgages approved for house purchase in nearly three years in January.\nWriting by William Schomberg Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T17:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:36:41.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
