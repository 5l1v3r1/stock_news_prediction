Non-profit efforts will focus on education issues and the future of cities, according to the former Uber executive's tweet.\nKalanick resigned as CEO of Uber last June , amid reports of combative behavior and an intellectual property lawsuit with self-driving rival Waymo. The company also faced allegations of a toxic work culture that led to widespread sexual harassment and gender discrimination. Kalanick ordered an investigation into those allegations before resigning.\nSince Kalanick's departure as CEO -- and a settlement reached by Uber and Waymo -- the rideshare company has fought to remake its image under new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. And so, too, has Kalanick.\nJust this month, Kalanick joined the board of directors for health startup Kareo. It marked his first public appointment since he resigned as CEO of Uber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T02:36:02.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
