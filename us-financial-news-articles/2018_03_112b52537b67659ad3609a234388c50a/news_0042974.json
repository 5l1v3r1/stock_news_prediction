We gave priority to high-efficiency exploration activities and made new discoveries in the Xinjiang Tahe Basin and the Sichuan Basin. The Company's newly added proved reserve reached 462.73 million barrels of oil equivalent, with crude oil reserve replacement ratio reaching 116.0%. In crude oil development, we constantly adopted a profit-oriented approach, deepened structural adjustment, focused on cost control, reduced natural decline rate and ensured steady production. In natural gas development, we actively pushed forward capacity building in Hangjinqi of Nei Mongol and Dongpo of west Sichuan, and completed 10 bcm(billion cubic meter) per year shale gas capacity building in Fuling. The Company's production of oil and gas was 448.79 million barrels of oil equivalent, with domestic crude production down by 3.2% from the previous year and natural gas production up by 19.1%.\nIn 2017, the operating revenues of this segment were RMB 157.5 billion, representing an increase of 35.9% over 2016. This was mainly attributed to the rise of realised price of crude oil and natural gas as well as expansion of LNG business. The operating loss of the exploration and production segment were RMB 45.9 billion, representing an expanded loss by RMB 9.3 billion as compared with 2016. By deducting the non-operating income from capital injection of Sichuan-to-East China Pipeline Co. in 2016, the Company realized a significant reduction in loss by RMB 11.3 billion in 2017.\nIn 2017, the oil and gas lifting cost was RMB 788.3 per tonne, representing a year on year increase of 0.3%.\nExploration and Production: Summary of Operations\nTwelve-month periods ended 31 December\nChanges\n2017\n2016\n%\nOil and gas production (mmboe)\n448.79\n431.29\n4.1\nCrude oil production (mmbbls)\n293.66\n303.51\n(3.2)\nChina\n248.88\n253.15\n(1.7)\nOverseas\n44.78\n50.36\n(11.1)\nNatural gas production (bcf)\n912.50\n766.12\n19.1\nRefining\nIn 2017, with the market-oriented approach, we optimised product mix to produce more gasoline and jet fuel, and the production volume of high-value-added products have been further improved, with the diesel-to-gasoline ratio further declined to 1.17.
