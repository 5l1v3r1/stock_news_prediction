It currently uses the blockchain programme to trace the production of free-range chicken in the Auvergne region in central France.\nConsumers can use a smartphone to scan a code on the package to obtain information at each stage of production, including where and how the chickens were raised and what they were fed as well as where the meat was processed, added the French company.\nCarrefour is also currently conducting blockchain tests to improve tracing the source of food products in China and could expand it to other countries.\nAlexandre Bompard, who took over as Carrefour’s CEO in July, unveiled in January a five-year plan to boost profits and sales.\nThe plan entails overhauling Carrefour’s French hypermarkets and expanding online operations, with a pledge to invest 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in digital commerce by 2022.\nThe group, which has struggled for years to become less reliant on its French hypermarkets, has promised to revamp its range of food, as customers demand healthier products.\nCarrefour is targeting 5 billion euros in organic food sales by 2022, compared to 1 billion euros generated at present.\n$1 = 0.8101 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:36:26.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
