Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal Most parents coach their children in sports. But Faith Pescatore credits her daughter, Skylar Schambs, with helping fine-tune her flip turn and swim stroke ahead of the 2017 National Senior Games. \nMs. Pescatore, 61 years old, jokes that she went from being a dedicated “swim mom” to a dedicated swimmer. “Now, my daughter is the one cheering me on from the stands during a meet,” she says.\nA lifelong “fitness swimmer,” Ms. Pescatore says she never had the opportunity to compete growing up. When her daughter, now 21, began swimming competitively at age 7, Ms. Pescatore watched enviously from the stands. “I went to every meet and every practice, and lived vicariously through her,” she says. “I’d even steal her workouts.”\nMs. Pescatore, right, with her daughter, Skylar Schambs, and husband, Gary Schambs, at their home in Suwanee, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. Photo: Faith Pescatore Her daughter hung up her Speedo when she went off to college in 2014. But Ms. Pescatore, a retired physician assistant in Suwanee, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, continued to borrow her daughter’s high-school pool workouts. On a whim, she entered the Georgia Golden Olympics in October 2016. Despite not being able to do a flip turn, she placed second in the 55-59 age group in both the 50-yard and 500-yard freestyle competitions. \nThat finish earned her entry to the 2017 National Senior Games in Birmingham, Ala. The biennial event, formerly called the National Senior Olympic Games, hosts around 10,000 competitors in 20 sports, including swimming, track and field, and even pickleball. Participants must be at least 50, with the oldest athletes in their 100s.\nMs. Pescatore at the 2017 National Senior Games in Birmingham, Ala., where she places 7th in the 500-yard freestyle and 13th in the 50-yard freestyle in the 60-64 age category. Photo: Faith Pescatore Leading up to the Games, her daughter provided instruction on how to do a flip turn as well as pointers on more efficient stroke technique. Her time of 8 minutes and 22 seconds in the 500-yard freestyle was a personal best and earned her a seventh-place finish and spot on the podium in the 60-64 age category. \n“My daughter specialized in the 500 free,” she says. “She was my inspiration.”\nMs. Schambs says it’s been exciting to watch her mother get into competitive swimming. “She was very involved and supportive of my swimming, including jumping in for parent and family relays,” she says. “It’s awesome that I can cheer her on after all the guidance she gave me.”\nEncouraged by her performance, Ms. Pescatore joined a U.S. Masters swim team last October. Masters programs provide coached pool workouts to adults of all swimming abilities.\nShe is currently training for the 2019 National Senior Games, which will take place June 14-25 in Albuquerque, N.M. In addition to freestyle, she plans to compete in the backstroke. \n“I’d like to be on the podium in three events,” she says. “At this age, I relish the competition. There’s something so rewarding about winning a race.”\nMs. Pescatore now attends Master group workouts at the West Gwinnett Park Aquatic Center, where recently she has been working on her starts. ‘A fast start off the blocks is critical in short distances.’ Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal The Workout Ms. Pescatore attends Masters group swim sessions from noon to 1 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays. She arrives early and warms up with 20 minutes of freestyle swimming and 10 minutes of backstroke and kickboard drills. \nMs. Pescatore says a lot of Masters programs focus on yardage, but hers focuses on technique. Coach Kai Akubo Smith videotapes pool workouts so they can deconstruct her stroke. \nDrills frequently incorporate kickboards and fins. They also do core work, which Ms. Pescatore says is crucial to maintaining good technique. They might go to the deep end of the pool and kick their feet and legs to keep their heads above water, without using their arms for assistance.\nCore work is a key part of training, and Ms. Pescatore often practices keeping her head above water using only vertical kicks. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal Lately, Ms. Pescatore has been working on her start. “A fast start off the blocks is critical in short distances,” she says. \nShe swims with a TYR snorkel. “It allows me focus on my arms and legs without worrying about turning my head to breathe,” she says.\nMs. Pescatore has practiced yoga for 15 years and attends vinyasa classes twice a week. “My yoga breathing helps keep me centered at meets,” she says. “I get up on the blocks, take deep breaths, and visualize my race.”\nShe swims with a snorkel, which frees her from having to turn her head to breathe. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal The Diet Ms. Pescatore has been a vegetarian for nearly 15 years, but she does eat fish and eggs. She starts the day with coffee and a breakfast of oatmeal or granola with almond milk, blueberries and walnuts. Lunch is a veggie burger or grilled cheese. \nShe packs snacks like oranges, hummus or corn chips to eat on the drive home from swim practice. “After an hour and a half of swimming, I’m ravenous,” she says. \nShe and her husband cook dinner at home. Grilled fish with roasted vegetables, pasta and vegetables, and Thai shrimp curry are staples. Caramel corn is her favorite evening snack.\nThe Gear & Cost Ms. Pescatore pays $480 annually for unlimited swimming and Masters group workouts at West Gwinnett Park Aquatic Center in Norcross, Ga. Her Speedo swimsuits cost about $75 each. A TYR swim snorkel costs $35, while TYR fins are $30. She swims in TYR Velocity goggles ($15) and wears nose clips for backstroke. Athleta is her go-to yoga apparel brand, and her classes at Johns Creek Yoga studio are $16 each.\nThe Playlist “I hear noise all day,” Ms. Pescatore says. “When my head is in the water, I don’t want to hear anything. I find the quiet very meditative.”\nMs. Pescatore is currently training for the 2019 National Senior Games, where she hopes to be on the podium in three events. ‘At this age, I relish the competition.’ Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T23:14:42.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
