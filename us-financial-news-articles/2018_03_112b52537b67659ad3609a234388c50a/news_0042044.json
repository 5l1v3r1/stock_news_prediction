Police officers prepare equipment as inspectors from the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) begin work at the scene of the nerve agent attack on former Russian agent Sergei Skripal, in Salisbury, Britain March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are in critical condition after they collapsed on a bench in Salisbury on March 4. Britain accuses Russia of attempted murder but Russia denies involvement and says Britain has no evidence. Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko was asked at a news conference whether Russia was treating the incident as a joke after the Russian Embassy tweeted that without evidence for what happened, Poirot, the creation of crime fiction writer Agatha Christie, was needed in Salisbury. He defended the tweet. “We don’t have any information,” Yakovenko told reporters. “The investigation is classified. We don’t know the motivation of the British government, and that’s why it says: this case is so complicated, we need, let’s say, some wisdom of a person like Poirot to investigate.” Reporting by Alistair Smout and Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Stephen Addison", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T15:45:42.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
