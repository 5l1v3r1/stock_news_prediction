That addition cost could equal the “loss of tens of thousands of jobs.”\nMiller Coors expressed its concerns about the President’s proposed tariff on Twitter, stating the aluminum used in beer cans “does not cause any national security issues.” Trump’s reasoning behind imposing the tariffs is due to a Commerce Department study that concluded that metal imports have impacted America’s ability to make its own weapons.\nMillerCoors statement: We are disappointed with President Trump’s announcement of a 10% tariff on aluminum. While we won’t know the details for a week, the Department of Defense recently reported that aluminum does not cause any national security issues.

American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of\nthis misguided tariff.

Cans are cheaper and easier to ship than bottles, and also prevent oxygen and light from getting to beer that may cause it to go bad. In recent years many craft beer producers have turned to using cans as their primary way of distributing beer, and larger companies such as Budweiser and Miller have used cans for years to distribute products.\nBud Light, in particular, has been positioned as the beer of working-class America, The Wall Street Journal notes. That “working class” demographic is a huge part of Trump’s base.", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/canned-beer-pays-price-for-trump-tariff-1520000163", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-revive-1962-law-to-explore-new-barriers-on-steel-imports-1492661339", "https://twitter.com/MillerCoors/status/969313202780688385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/MillerCoors/status/969312711371886594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-03-03T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T00:16:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
