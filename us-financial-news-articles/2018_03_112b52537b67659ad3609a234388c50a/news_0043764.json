If they are able to trade (privacy) for convenience, safety or efficiency â€“ in a lot of cases they are willing to do that,\" said Li.\nIn January a consumer group from Jiangsu in east China filed a lawsuit against Baidu claiming the firm was illegally collecting personal data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T16:11:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
