The logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at a branch office in Zurich, Switzerland January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Staff affected will be informed in the next few months, and while relocations will depend on where clients are, the bulk of the moves will be to Frankfurt, according to the source who has seen the memo. A spokesman for UBS confirmed the contents of the memo.
