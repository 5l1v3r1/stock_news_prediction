The surveys contained two sections, one for parents and one that could be completed by young patients themselves, by parents or jointly.\nNearly 60% of the patients completed the youth section of the survey themselves, and 28% responded jointly with their parents.\nParents and their children tended to agree on the quality of pain relief the child received and the quality of the overall experience, the researchers found. However, they tended to disagree on questions about the quality of communication with hospital staff, involvement in decision-making, feeling safe and having adequate privacy.\n“A bad experience with a doctor or dentist as a young child may be remembered for decades and may put people off seeking care when they need it,” Hargreaves said.\n“For young people with a long-term condition like diabetes or epilepsy, their long-term outcomes can be affected by attitudes and habits they picked up when they first learned to manage their condition as a teenager,” he added.\nThe study authors suggest including children over age 8 in patient surveys, as long as the wording is adapted and questionnaires are designed appropriately for pediatric patients. Hargreaves and colleagues are working on tools to share decision-making between children and parents and to develop what they call“child/young person-friendly” versions of patient experience surveys for different healthcare settings.\n“Being in the hospital can be an unpleasant and frightening experience for a child,” Hargreaves said. “Listening to them shows that the way they feel is important to us, and it allows us to help them through their hospital experience.”\nIn a 2013 research review, Dr. Anne-Emmanuelle Ambresin of Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland and colleagues outlined several ways to make surveys and healthcare more friendly for youth. They identified eight areas that are central to a young person’s positive experience of care, including accessibility, staff attitude, communication, medical competency, guideline-driven care, age appropriate environments, involvement in decision-making and health outcomes.\n“Staff attitudes, which included the notions of respect and friendliness, appeared universally applicable,” said Ambresin, who was not involved in the current study.\n“Other domains, such as an appropriate environment, including cleanliness, were more specific to particular contexts,” she added. “Measures of youth-friendly healthcare should address these.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2FIgZBx\nArch Dis Child 2018.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T01:04:29.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
