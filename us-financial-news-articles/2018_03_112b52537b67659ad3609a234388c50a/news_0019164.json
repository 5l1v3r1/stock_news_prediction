What I’ve said is that the EU’s model of equivalence, which is unilateral (and) withdrawable on no notice in some cases... would not work,” Hammond said in a speech in London’s Canary Wharf financial centre.\n“The principle of equivalence, if it’s based on mutual agreement, it’s robust and enduring ... and there are proper procedures ... could be the basis on which we could move forward.”\nReporting by Huw Jones, David Milliken and Andrew MacAskill; writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:33:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
