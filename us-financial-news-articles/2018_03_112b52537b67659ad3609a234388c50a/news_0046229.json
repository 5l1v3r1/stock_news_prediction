Investors tend to buy Treasurys during times of economic uncertainty because they offer steady interest payments and essentially no credit risk.\nThe U.S. Treasury Building in Washington.

That move, however, quickly reversed as stocks fell again, reflecting what analysts described as general unease in the market.\nInvestors are fairly confident in the economy and the direction of monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, but “the wild card is coming from the White House,” said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co.\n“The question is, on any day, you don’t know what’s going to happen.”\nInvestors turned their attention to trade and politics after the Fed on Wednesday increased its benchmark federal-funds rate by 0.25 percentage point and raised its median forecast to three rate increases in 2019 from two.\nTreasury yields have jumped this year partly because investors have grown more concerned that a sustained period of economic growth across developed countries will finally result in higher inflation and a move to tighter monetary policies around the globe. Inflation is a threat to government bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed payments.\nStill, recent data has suggested that inflation in the U.S. is still relatively muted, helping ease pressure on Treasurys after the 10-year yield nearly reached 3% in February.\nWrite to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:22:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
