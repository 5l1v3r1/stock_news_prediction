But she added: “At this moment there is no discussion of that. We cannot say anything at this point.”\nGermany on Wednesday said security officials were investigating an isolated attack on its government computer networks, but the incident had been brought under control.\nIt did not confirm media reports that the foreign and defense ministries were affected by the attack.\nReporting by Rene Wagner; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Michelle Martin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:40:08.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
