Only 13 of the bloc’s 28 members have set up sandboxes as some national watchdogs say it is not part of their remit.\nReporting by Huw Jones, editing by Louise Heavens and Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:07:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
