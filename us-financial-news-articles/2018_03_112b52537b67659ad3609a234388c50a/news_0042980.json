(Nasdaq:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, announced today that Dr. Roger Jeffs has joined Pluristem’s strategic advisory board. Dr. Jeffs, a highly accomplished biopharma executive, will advise Pluristem on clinical and commercial strategies for the Company’s cell therapy programs.\nDr. Jeffs joined United Therapeutics Corporation during its start-up phase in 1998 as director of research, development, and medical and led the company as its President and CEO from 2001 to 2014 and President & co-CEO from 2015 to 2016. During his successful 18-year tenure at United Therapeutics, Dr. Jeffs helped lead the company’s initial public offering, oversaw the clinical development and regulatory approval of six products, and managed the commercial effort that lead to a significant increase in revenues.

I look forward to working with Pluristem’s management team to move the clinical programs forward towards marketing.”\n“Dr. Jeffs brings tremendous expertise and vision to Pluristem, from business aspects, to clinical development, marketing approval and commercialization.
