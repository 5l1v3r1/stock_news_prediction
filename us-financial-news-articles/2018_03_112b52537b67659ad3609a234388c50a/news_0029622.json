Britain credits Saudi intelligence sharing with saving British lives and has licensed billions of pounds of weapons and ammunition sales to Saudi Arabia.\nThat has provided a controversial backdrop to the warm diplomatic welcome for Prince Mohammed, with hundreds turning out on Wednesday to protest the arms deals and Saudi Arabia’s role in the Yemen war.\nNevertheless, Friday’s meeting is expected to include talks on the sale of up to 48 Typhoon fighter jets made by British firm BAE Systems - a multi-billion pound deal which has been under discussion for years but has proven tough to seal.\nPrime Minister Theresa May defended the two countries defence ties on Wednesday, saying all arms sales were strictly regulated, but has also repeatedly raised concerns about humanitarian crisis in Yemen directly with Prince Mohammed.\nThe thorny topic was due to be discussed at a private dinner inside May’s country residence on Thursday night, but was tempered with gifts: May’s office said she presented Prince Mohammed with a family tree showing the descent of the Al Saud dynasty.\nDowning Street said the framed document was originally created by Queen Victoria’s consul general in Jeddah in 1880 (Reporting by William James in London and Stephen Kalin in Riyadh Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:05:59.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
