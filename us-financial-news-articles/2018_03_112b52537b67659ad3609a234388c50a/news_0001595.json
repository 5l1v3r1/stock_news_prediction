That was the biggest increase since September and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December.\nIn the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent after a similar gain in December because of base effects. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index advanced 0.3 percent in January - the largest gain since January 2017.\nThe so-called core PCE price index rose 0.2 percent in December. Unfavorable base effects also kept the annual increase in the core PCE price index at 1.5 percent in January. The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the core PCE price index rising 0.3 percent in January and advancing 1.5 percent year-on-year. The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.\nInflation is expected to breach its target this year as a tightening labor market boosts wage growth. Faster economic growth, spurred by a $1.5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending, is also seen stoking inflation.\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday offered an upbeat assessment of the economy, telling U.S. lawmakers “my personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December.” Powell also acknowledged that “fiscal policy is becoming more stimulative.”\nThose remarks prompted traders to raise their bets on four rate increases this year. The Fed has forecast three rate hikes in 2018, but economists expect that will be revised up when the central bank publishes its projections at the end of the March 20-21 policy meeting.\nHigher inflation cut into consumer spending growth in January. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, gained 0.2 percent. That was the smallest increase since August and followed a 0.4 percent advance in December.\nWhen adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.1 percent, declining for the first time since January 2017. The so-called real consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in December. The drop in real consumer spending in January suggests consumption will slow from the fourth-quarter’s robust 3.8 percent annualized pace.\nIt was also the latest indication that economic growth moderated at the start of the year after a 2.5 percent rate of expansion in the fourth quarter. Industrial production, home sales and core capital goods orders fell in January.\nBut spending remains underpinned by a strong labor market, which Fed officials consider to be near or a little beyond full employment. Personal income rose 0.4 percent in January after increasing by the same margin in December. Wages increased 0.5 percent in January after rising 0.4 percent the prior month.\nSavings increased to $464.4 billion in January from $363.2 billion in the prior month. The saving rate jumped to 3.2 percent from 2.5 percent in December. Savings in January were boosted by tax cuts, the Commerce Department said.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T16:23:36.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
