The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.2 percent.\nMarket expectations for a March rate hike are 94.4 percent as of Tuesday afternoon, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. While most market participants expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points, they will also look for clues about whether the central bank will stay on track to hike three times this year or if it expects to further tighten policy.\n\"The upcoming FOMC meeting is preceded by a market crash, elevated volatility, rising negative sentiment around trade, while consensus view of the Fed remains hawkish,\" said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of U.S. equity strategy at J.P.
