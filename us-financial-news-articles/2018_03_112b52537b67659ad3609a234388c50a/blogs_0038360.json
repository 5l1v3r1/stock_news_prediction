But Soini, speaking in an interview with Finnish broadcaster MTV, said North Korea’s nuclear programmes were not on the table at the talks that end on Wednesday. “This is a so-called 1.5 track meeting with academics and officials, with Finland only a facilitator ... but since we talk about 1.5 track, I think there will be no talk about nuclear weapons.” “It is good to have the discussion going on and take the use of this time frame that was opened between the South and North Korea before the (Winter) Olympics (last month),” Soini said.

The meeting has been planned well in advance of recent promising developments related to the Korean situation,” Finnish Foreign Ministry added in a statement, declining to give further details. North Korean and Swedish foreign ministers ended three days of talks on Saturday on security on the Korean peninsula in preparation for a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea is pursuing its nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
