The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, which is located in Switzerland, did not immediately respond to e-mailed queries about the Jamaican case on Friday evening. The Jamaican team, which finished 19th in the two-woman bobsleigh in Pyeongchang, was comprised of American-born driver Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian and former track sprinter Carrie Russell. Attempts to contact both women were unsuccessful. “As we’ve seen over the years, it’s best to be patient and see what comes out of these processes ... we ourselves are going through the process,” Stokes said. “I’m not at liberty to discuss the substance itself, but just to say that the (banned) list is long and there are many ways to end up with substances in your system, on purpose or inadvertently or simple by going about your daily life. So we are assessing what our particular situation is.” A source with knowledge of case indicated that the“A” sample from the test carried out on Jan. 13 in Switzerland showed traces of the banned steroid, Clenbuterol. The“B” sample has yet to be tested, the source added. The bobsleigh team received a lot of attention in Pyeongchang as they were the first female athletes from the Caribbean island nation to compete at a Winter Olympics. Their breakthrough appearance came 30 years after a Jamaican men’s team competed at the Calgary Olympics, inspiring the highly successful movie“Cool Runnings”.
