DuVernay, who’s been sharing Instagram photos of the film’s premieres, responded: “Nope.” Instead, she said, she had simply hired “great people of all kinds and colors.”\nHey @ava were Inclusion Riders how you ensured a diverse crew on #WrinkleInTime or what was the specific process you went through to make that happen? Loved seeing it on your insta story.\n— Shane Anderson (@ShaneM_Anderson) March 12, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nNope. Just hired great people of all kinds and colors. xo https://t.co/NVH61eQdEg\n— Ava DuVernay (@ava) March 12, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nA Wrinkle in Time, starring Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, and Storm Reid, helped make box-office history this weekend when it brought in $33 million, second only to Black Panther ‘s $41 million for the weekend. This marks the first time that two movies with black directors and budgets of $100 million or more have held the top two box-office spots.\nMs @ava ‘s brain is an Inclusion Rider 🙌🏾\n— Sareeta Domingo (@SareetaDomingo) March 12, 2018\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nIn addition to A Wrinkle in Time’s diversity , DuVernay told to The New Yorker ‘s Jelani Cobb in 2017 that every episode of her television show Queen Sugar is directed by a woman. She said it was “in the DNA” of the show and explained, “In my view it’s righting a wrong. Someone came up to me and said ‘you know, you may want to be careful with this because, you know, people could see it as discrimination,’ and I took a deep breath and said ‘I would welcome that conversation, I would welcome that lawsuit.’… there are some shows that are using this platform as a corrective measure to highlight and to incubate and to bring more women into the industry, an industry that has shut us out.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShaneM_Anderson/status/973141474396160000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WrinkleInTime?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/SareetaDomingo/status/973176462747586561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/12/entertainment/wrinkle-time-black-panther-trnd/index.html", "https://t.co/NVH61eQdEg", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/ava/status/973168950136762368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/ava-duvernay-and-a-reckoning-at-facebook", "https://twitter.com/ava?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-03-12T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T18:11:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
