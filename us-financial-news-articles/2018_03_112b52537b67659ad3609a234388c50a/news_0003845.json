No date was provided for the start of either service. RTA officials said they hoped to have a more solid plan for the program by the end of 2018 or early 2019.\nThe vehicles are powered by electricity and have a top speed of 80 kms (50 miles) per hour.\nDubai last year unveiled plans for a “flying taxi”.\nWriting by Sami Aboudi; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:49:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
