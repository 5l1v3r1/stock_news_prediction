Curtis Scaparrotti, who is also NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.\nThe general's comments came after multiple military and intelligence officials have said that they have yet to receive directives from President Donald Trump to combat the online onslaught from Russia.\nScaparrotti on Thursday also shed some light on how the Russian hackers were targeting the U.S.\n\"Typically, when you look at their [Russia's] disinformation, their social media, it is generally targeted at the undermining of Western values, confidence in that government, confidence in their governmental leaders, almost always subtly just hedging away at that,\" he said.\n\"Because of today's capabilities and information, where they can use multiple platforms and generate great volume, it can really undermine a nation,\" added Scaparrotti, who oversees an area of responsibility that includes Russia.\nWhen asked by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, whether the executive branch had communicated a strategy with him he said, \"with respect to our elections that's not really within my portfolio as the EUCOM commander, that is at CYBERCOM, OSD, and Joint Staff level.\"\n\"There doesn't seem to be anyone taking the lead on this and that is a cause of concern to many of us,\" Hirono said.\nScaparrotti is the latest military official to signal that the Trump administration has yet to give direction on how to respond to Russian cyber interference.\nJoshua Roberts | Reuters National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers One week prior to Scaparrotti's testimony, U.S. Cyber Command chief Navy Admiral Mike Rogers also said he was not directed by the president to counter Russian cyberoperators .\nRogers, who is also the director of the National Security Agency, added that the U.S. has \"not opted to engage\" with Moscow's continued interference.\nEarlier this month, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., asked FBI Director Christopher Wray if his agency was quarterbacking efforts to respond to Russian hacking on behalf of the president. Wray responded: \"Not as specifically directed by the president.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was also asked by several lawmakers what was being done to cease Moscow interference .\nGetty Images Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats answers questions during a hearing held by the Senate Armed Services Committee March 6, 2018 in Washington, DC. \"We've heard testimony from a number of intelligence officials who have said that there is currently interference going on from Russia into our upcoming election cycle for 2018 and you haven't had any direction from the White House or the administration to respond to that?\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., asked Coats during a Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\"No, I wouldn't put it in that context,\" Coats began. \"There obviously is concern about this ongoing effort of Russians to interfere with our elections. The White House is well aware of that as we all are, and agencies have been tasked to address this.\"\nCoats went on to say that \"much of what is being done or is being examined to be done would fall under a classified area,\" and therefore could only be discussed in a classified hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T00:25:11.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
