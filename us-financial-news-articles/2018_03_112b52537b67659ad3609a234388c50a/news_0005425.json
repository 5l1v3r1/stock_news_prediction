The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.4 percent by the close.\n“The monthly employment report delivered a number of surprises, many of them running contra to historic performances during the late stages of an economic expansion,” said BNY Mellon analysts.\nInterest-rate sensitive high dividend-paying stocks such as Unilever ( UNc.AS ), Nestle ( NESN.S ), and British American Tobacco ( BATS.L ) were among the top boosts to the STOXX 600.\nWhile the basic resources sector .SXPP was the best-performing, steelmakers were notable laggards: Voestalpine ( VOES.VI ), Outokumpu ( OUT1V.HE ) and Arcelormittal ( MT.AS ) fell 0.6 to 1.5 percent after the new U.S. tariffs.\nIndustrials stocks .SXNP, which had been the worst-hit by fears of an international trade war, were the biggest boost to the index as the worst-case scenario was averted by Trump accepting exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariff.\nAirbus ( AIR.PA ) gained 1.3 percent, while BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) rose 2.2 percent, helped by the finalization of talks between Britain and Saudi Arabia on a multi-billion pound order for 48 Typhoon aircraft made by the defense contractor.\nOil stocks .SXEP also rose as crude prices gained on signs of a detente between the U.S. and North Korea\nOil services stocks were the best-performing.

The stock had its worst day in four weeks after the passenger yield came in lower than expected.\nGermany's DAX .GDAXI was a laggard, down 0.1 percent after the country's industrial output fell unexpectedly for the second month in a row.\nReporting by Julien Ponthus; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T11:33:43.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
