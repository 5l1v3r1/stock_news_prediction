The are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce. \nKim is also scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump some time in May to discuss denuclearization, although a time and place have not been set for that summit. \nKim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a surprise visit to Beijing this week, his first trip outside the isolated North since he came to power in 2011. Even more surprising was Kim's pledge to denuclearize the Korean summit. That commitment was reported by Chinese state media, although North Korea's official media made no mention of it, or Kim's anticipated meeting with Trump. \nTrump and Kim had exchanged threats and insults in recent months. The U.S. leader made the equally surprising announcement earlier this month that he was prepared to meet Kim to discuss the crisis over Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the Unite States. \nThe North Korean leader's engagement with the international community has sparked speculation that he may try to meet other leaders. Japan's Asahi newspaper said on Thursday Japan had sounded out the North Korean government about a bilateral summit. \nChinese President Xi Jinping promised Beijing would uphold its friendship with North Korea after his meeting with Kim. \nTrump wrote on Twitter he had received a message from Xi on Tuesday night that his meeting with Kim \"went very well\" and that Kim looked forward to meeting the U.S. president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T09:17:15.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
