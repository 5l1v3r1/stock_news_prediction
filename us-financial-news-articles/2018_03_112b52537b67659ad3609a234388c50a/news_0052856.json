The 2019 Lincoln Aviator is presented at the New York Auto Show in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nCadillac, General Motors Co’s ( GM.N ) luxury division, unveiled the XT4, a sport crossover, at the New York auto show on Tuesday. \nJohan de Nysschen, who heads up the division, told Reuters on Wednesday that Cadillac is still in discussions with its Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp ( 600104.SS ) on rolling out the XT4 in that market, but he is optimistic that it will happen. \n“The (Chinese) volume potential played an important role in ensuring the financial feasibility for the investment in this (vehicle) program,” de Nysschen said. \nAfter the XT4, Cadillac plans a larger SUV with three rows of seats in 2019. China is the world’s largest auto market and accounts for more than half of Cadillac’s sales. And as in the United States, more consumers in China are opting for SUVs instead of sedans. [nL1N1RA10A] But Cadillac’s de Nysschen said overall, the number of sedans should continue to grow in China.
