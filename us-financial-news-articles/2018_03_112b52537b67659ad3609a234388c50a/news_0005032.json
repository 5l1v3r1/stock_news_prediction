Now BASF would hold the majority of the shares in the joint enterprise.\nReporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Terje Solsvik/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:44:11.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
