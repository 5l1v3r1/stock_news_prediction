Matthews, U.S. Air Force (Ret.), as Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005490/en/\n“General Matthews is an outstanding leader and will be a strategic asset to Verodin’s executive team,” said Verodin CEO and Co-founder Chris Key. “He brings proven leadership in developing cyberspace operations policy, delivering IT and national security system solutions, and shaping long-range strategies, and we will leverage his leadership as we move into new markets.”\nPrior to joining Verodin, Matthews served as Vice President and General Manager of Enterprise Security Solutions for DXC Technology, the world's leading independent end-to-end IT services and solutions company. In this role, Matthews delivered strategic, end-to-end solutions to help clients anticipate, overcome and reduce security threats.\nMajor General Matthews retired from the United States Air Force in 2014 after more than three decades of distinguished service, holding high-ranking positions such as the Chief Information Security Officer and Director of Cyberspace Operations, Chief Information Officer of the United States Transportation Command and Chief Information Officer of Air Mobility Command.\n“My goal in every position, from the battlefield to the boardroom, is to inspire creativity and dedication in pursuit of excellence,” Matthews said. “Verodin is bringing a new level of accountability to technology security, and that’s been sorely missing from this important discipline. I look forward to working with the team to develop and offer technologies that help enterprises and governments around the world better measure, manage and improve security.”\nVerodin’s mission is to remove assumptions and prove cybersecurity effectiveness with quantifiable, evidence-based data. Verodin demonstrates the effectiveness of an enterprise's cybersecurity investments, proactively identifies configuration issues in the defensive stack and exposes true gaps across people, process and technology.\nRequest a demo today.\nFollow Verodin:\nNewsroom: https://verodin.com/newsroom\nBlog: https://verodin.com/blog\nTwitter: @VerodinInc\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/verodin-inc-\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005490/en/\nCONTOS DUNNE COMMUNICATIONS\nPaula Dunne, +1 408-776-1400\npaula@contosdunne.com\n(m) +1 408-893-8750\nSource: Verodin", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2F&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=Security+Instrumentation&index=2&md5=2d8fe061464a05ba6a6c2883a3083c71", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FVerodinInc&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=%40VerodinInc&index=6&md5=d15e6d194e5096142374e88fa066d385", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2Fblog&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2Fblog&index=5&md5=a73ece3104fbfe48e5ba05e27bb4d87e", "https://verodin.com/newsroom", "https://verodin.com/blog", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2Fdemo-request-form%2F&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=demo&index=3&md5=62c3515de18acb8c0880a37fd258bc81", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2F&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=Verodin&index=1&md5=6b5987d9a436dd4430628a181bf2dba8", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2Fnewsroom&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fverodin.com%2Fnewsroom&index=4&md5=20f989031c46e54ca64311c7050d6804", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/verodin-inc-", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fverodin-inc-&esheet=51768570&newsitemid=20180306005490&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fverodin-inc-&index=7&md5=1f2edb7001f49885683479c7fe14f6f5", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005490/en/"], "published": "2018-03-06T15:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T18:20:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
