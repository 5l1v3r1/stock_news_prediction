Which is a great thing for us as a company,\" he said. \n\"The macroeconomic or the geopolitical landscape does not worry me at this point in time,\" he added. \"Our customers, the public sector or the government or the large companies, are not necessarily impacted directly by that.\" \nPresident Donald Trump previously said the United States would impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium . The decision is expected this week but the White House hinted there could be an exemption period for Mexico , Canada and a few other countries. \nThe move had prompted a global backlash and heightened fears of retaliatory measures from U.S. trading partners including Canada, the European Union and China . \nThe European Union on Wednesday threatened to impose duties on U.S. bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice in retaliation. China also warned that it would respond accordingly. \nElsewhere, reports said that Southeast Asia and Europe were looking to speed up efforts for a trade deal amid growing U.S. protectionism.", "external_links": ["http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/asean-eu-talk-up-trade-deal-amid-alarm-over-trump-tariffs"], "published": "2018-03-08T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T09:03:14.071+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
