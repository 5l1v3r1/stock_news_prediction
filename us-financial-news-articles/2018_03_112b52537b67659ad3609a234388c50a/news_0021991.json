Christopher Flood, a lawyer for Murray, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAs part of his plea deal, Murray agreed not to appeal any sentence of 6-1/2 years or less.\nMurray, 25, was arrested in May 2017 and charged with submitting a sham regulatory filing in which the nonexistent, Shanghai-based ABM Capital Ltd offered to buy Fitbit for $12.50 per share, roughly a 46 percent premium.\nThe filing caused Fitbits share price to rise 8 percent to $9.27 on Nov. 10, boosting the companys market value by $122 million, before the San Francisco-based maker of footstep counters and other wearable devices denied knowledge of any tender offer.\nAuthorities said Murray spent less than $1,000 on Fitbit call options, a bet the share price would rise, just before submitting the hoax offer. They said he made about $3,000 profit in one day by selling the options after the stock jumped.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against Murray. The hoax filing was submitted through the SECs electronic Edgar database.\nThe SEC said Murray concealed his identity by accessing Edgar through an account that appeared to be associated with a company in Napa, California, and having the filing signed by a Kevin Mead, ABM Capitals purported chief financial officer.
