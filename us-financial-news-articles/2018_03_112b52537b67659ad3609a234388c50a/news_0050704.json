The interface was designed to be used with fingers (instead of a stylus), and had an advanced web browser and other features that made Windows Mobile look stale.\nMicrosoft scrambled to catch up with a new platform. But in the meantime, Google 's Android — which was able to duplicate many of the features of the iPhone — appealed to a wide number of third-party handset makers because it was free for them to use and customize.\nAt the same time, Microsoft began its phone revamp on an older platform called Windows CE, which had originally been built for \"embedded\" systems (like bank ATMs) and hand-held organizers, then revamped to support Windows Mobile — without the advanced features that the iPhone and Android already had.\nBy the time Microsoft did all the work necessary to build a modern smartphone platform, Windows Phone, Android had already run away with most of the third-party market. Without a considerable market share, Windows Phone didn't have the same attraction to develop for as iPhone or Android, so popular apps either launched on Windows Phone much later or, in most cases, never at all.\nWindows Phone was eventually rebranded Windows 10 for Phones in 2015 before Microsoft announced in the fall of 2017 that development for the platform was finished.", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thank-you-21-years-onto-next-chapter-terry-myerson/"], "published": "2018-03-29T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T19:40:47.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
