The benchmark 10-year JGB yield fell half a basis point to 0.035 percent and the 40-year yield also declined half a basis point, to 0.890 percent. The BOJ on Friday offered to buy 260 billion yen ($2.45 billion) of 10- to 40-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-purchasing operation. The 10-year JGB yield was confined to a tight 0.035 to 0.045 percent range this week, as much of the support stemming from a rise in perceived global trade and geopolitical risks was offset by concerns towards a domestic political scandal engulfing Japan’s prime minister. Japan’s Nikkei share average slipped 0.25 percent on Friday as uncertainty over U.S. political issues sapped investor risk appetite.
