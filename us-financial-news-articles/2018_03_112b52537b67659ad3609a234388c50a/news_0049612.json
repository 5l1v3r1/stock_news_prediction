Foresight ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with $21.8 million in cash and short-term deposits, with GAAP net loss for the full year 2017 of $15.9 million and with non-GAAP net loss of $5.3 million.\n“The excitement for Foresight’s life-saving automotive vision solutions continues to grow,” commented Foresight Chief Executive Officer Haim Siboni. “Most recently, our innovative QuadSight TM vision system drew a tremendous amount of attention at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. We have also seen considerable progress in China, as Foresight concluded pilot programs with multiple leading Chinese car manufacturers during 2017. In the coming year, we will continue to leverage our industry-leading technology through pilot tests and commercial partnerships, leading us to long-term success.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,670,000, compared to $308,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2016.

This increase is attributed mainly to accelerated employee recruitment and is comprised primarily of payroll and related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses and subcontracted services expenses. GAAP net profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6,493,000, or $0.06 per ordinary share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $1,019,000, or $0.01 per ordinary share, in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is attributed mainly to the revaluation of derivative warrant liability, and revaluation of other investments (mainly the warrants we hold in Rail Vision Ltd.).\nNon-GAAP net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $977,000 or $(0.01) per ordinary share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $1,032,000, or $(0.01) per ordinary share, in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nR&D expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $4,089,000, compared to $904,000 in the full year ended December 31, 2016.

G&A expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $3,753,000, compared to $2,627,000 in the full year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributed primarily to payroll and related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses and expenses related to service providers. GAAP net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $15,942,000, or $(0.17) per ordinary share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $1,913,000 or $(0.03) per ordinary share, in the full year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is attributed mainly to the increase in R&D expenses, the increase in stock-based compensation expenses, and the increase in revaluation of derivative warrant liability.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $5,274,000 or $(0.06) per ordinary share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $3,355,000 or $(0.05) per ordinary share, in the full year ended December 31, 2016.\nFull year ended Three months ended December 31, December 31, (thousands of U.S. dollars,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 except per share data)\nGAAP Results Net (loss) profit $ (15,942) $ (1,913) $ 6,493 $ (1,019) Basic and diluted (loss) profit per share (0.17) (0.03) 0.06 (0.01) Non-GAAP Results Net loss $ (5,274) $ (3,355) $ (977) $ (1,032) Basic and diluted loss per share (0.06) (0.05) (0.01) (0.01) A reconciliation between GAAP operating results and non-GAAP operating results is provided in the following financial statements that are part of this release.

The increase compared to December 31, 2016 is attributed mainly to the proceeds received from private placements that occurred in the first half of 2017, totaling $11.6 million gross ($10.7 net) proceeds and to the warrants exercise proceeds, equal to $12.6 million, less the cash used during the period. GAAP shareholders’ equity totaled $24.8 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $4.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP shareholders' equity totaled $22.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $4.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, (thousands of U.S. dollars) 2017 2016 GAAP Results Shareholders' equity $ 24,817 $ 4,669 Non-GAAP Results Shareholders' equity $ 22,921 $ 4,800 A reconciliation between GAAP shareholders' equity results and non-GAAP shareholders' equity results is provided in the following financial statements that are part of this release.
