The Company also leases and sells cash registers and Point of Sale (POS) systems, including its recently developed proprietary multifunctional smart POS fiscal cash register system. Combining proprietary software and equipment, Comepay processes over 10 million customer payments per month and presently has more than 22,000 kiosks across Russia. The companies are currently focusing their planned business expansion on the smart POS fiscal cash register system called “Cassatka” in order to help businesses comply with newly released Russian taxation legislation, 54-FZ which requires 1.2 million businesses in fiscal 2018, and a further 1.4 million businesses in fiscal 2019 to install new, federally compliant on-line cash registers. The Cassatka, Comepay’s multifunctional smart POS online fiscal cash register can process payments and meet fiscal data storage requirements for participating businesses. It is a convenient and cost competitive solution for businesses to meet the new federal taxation requirements in Russia, and is currently being manufactured for distribution prior to June 2018. As the companies expand their business model, we expect to offer blockchain acquiring services and also to accept payments in multiple crypto currencies on the Cassatka. The Comepay group of companies presently earn revenue from a variety of channels including fee based commissions on payment processing for both cash and debit card payments, software licensing, kiosk placement fees and other rental fees for cash registers and associated equipment. With gross revenues of approximately US$22million ($1.234Bn Rubles) in fiscal 2017, the Comepay companies are looking to expand rapidly in fiscal 2018 and beyond as we introduce and market the Cassatka along with a suite of enhanced user features. www.comepaygroup.com , www.comepay.ru , www.kassatka.me , www.chekonline.ru , www.starrys.ru\nDisclaimer : Shareholders and investors are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance on information set forth within this website and these communications in making any investment decisions concerning our securities.
