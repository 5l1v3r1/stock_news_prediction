He was not only a Wall Streeter but also a Democrat, a moderate voice during a time of extremes. \nSo with his departure as Trump's key economic advisor comes more serious questions, with one rising above all the rest: Can the president push forward a populist agenda that also nurtures the market and the delicate climate of American business sentiment?\nCohn's saga will provide the sternest test yet for the market's faith.\nGetty Images President Donald Trump and Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn arrives for a meeting with House Republicans at the US Capitol on November 16, 2017. \"This is the real risk here: sudden changes can cause, well, sudden changes,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. \"He was seen as the voice of economic stability and a spokesperson for financial markets. His resignation leaves the president with a set of economic advisors largely seen as outside of the mainstream, or at least perceived as less aligned with Wall Street interests.\"\nMarkets reacted negatively the day after news broke that Cohn will be leaving. Losses were contained, though, and there seemed to be little fear that the sky was falling.\n\"This is not the end of the world,\" McMillan said. \"Markets are likely to take a step back, as they did with the initial announcement, and wait to see what happens.\"\nWhat happened Though Cohn did not speak publicly Wednesday, his departure is widely believed to be driven by his distaste for the tariffs Trump announced last week on imported steel and aluminum. \nCohn nearly left last summer after he was unhappy with Trump's response to the racial unrest in Charlottesville. He stayed on long enough to see his top priority — tax cuts — passed into law in December, but apparently was willing to go no further.\nWith the former Goldman Sachs chief operating officer leading the White House's globalist faction, his exit signals that the nationalist/protectionist bloc has gained a foothold inside the Oval Office. \nThe prospect is unnerving to those who have gotten used to an American economy that relies on cheap imports to keep the corporate bottom line churning.\n\"Protectionist policies will act like a wet blanket on global trade and markets continue to react negatively to these types of policies,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.\nNot all markets, though: Small-cap stocks, a group that would benefit by economic nationalism, rallied more than 0.5 percent at one point Wednesday.\nAs for the rest of the market, strategists remained fairly sanguine over the longer-term prospects, with sentiment pointing in the direction of further strength ahead as investors stay focused on the macro picture.\n\"We do not expect trade risks to derail the bull market, and economic fundamentals remain sound overall,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. \"Trade will likely continue to be a source of increased market volatility\" though he sees \"manageable losses\" as the likely effect.\nWhat's next Of course, much of how the market reacts depends on Trump and how he proceeds.\nShould he replace Cohn with a like-minded moderate, investors likely will barely notice. But if he decides to go hard-line protectionist with the pick, that could spell trouble at a time when the market already has had to withstand a volatility swell the likes of which it hasn't seen in years.\nIn short, Trump has to get this one right.\n\"Clearly it's important. At the same time, it's important for him to do it fairly quickly,\" Detrick said. \"His views were much different than Trump. For the hawks to have more power is clearly the worry.\"\nA trade war is a central tenet of the worst-case scenario many economists painted for Trump as president during the 2016 campaign and leading up to his term. \nWhile the direct economic impact of the steel and aluminum tariffs is negligible, the prospect of them inviting retribution from trading partners could be just the thing that would kill the goodwill, enthusiasm and trust the president has built with corporate leaders and investors.\nStill, Wall Street has gotten somewhat used to the constant drumbeat of strange headlines out of Washington, D.C.\n\"Our politics have gone back to what they looked like 100 years ago. Our politics used to be brutal and very, very nasty. So here we are,\" said Christopher Whalen, head of Whalen Global Advisors. \"The Street always gets comfortable after a day or two of tantrums. I'm not worried about that.\"\nWATCH: Former White House official Scaramucci talks Cohn and markets .\nshow chapters Anthony Scaramucci discusses how Cohn's resignation affects markets      3 Hours Ago | 04:52", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:49:38.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
