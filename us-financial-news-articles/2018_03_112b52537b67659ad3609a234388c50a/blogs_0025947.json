Let's not forget that he's already instituted tariffs on imported solar panels, washing machines and Canadian lumber.\nIn general, trade tariffs are not positive for economic growth, and a potential ensuing trade war ultimately produces no winners. Tariffs tend to raise prices for consumers, raise costs for businesses using the imported materials in manufacturing and marginally detract from economic growth.\nSome industries hit harder than others The tariffs so far should have a limited impact on the economy, but certain industries like beer brewers, homebuilders, oil and gas drillers and canned goods manufacturers will feel the heat more so than others.\nThe broader fear, of course, lies in the potential for a global trade war erupting as an outcome of these tariffs, causing our trading partners to place tariffs on our exports to them.\nDomestic industries like agriculture, bourbon, Harley Davidson motorcycles and tobacco products would be among those hit by such an event.\nAt the end of the day, nobody really emerges as the winner of a trade war, and we'll be closely monitoring the news flow on this as Wall Street and investors are certainly on edge over this.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
