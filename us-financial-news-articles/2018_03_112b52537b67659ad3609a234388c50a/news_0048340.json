But it skipped a reference to potentially increasing purchases, a signal that it remains on track to end the three-year-old stimulus scheme before the end of 2018.\nOn Tuesday, policymaker Ewald Nowotny said the ECB will probably decide this summer to slash its bond purchases, warning that the ECB must not fall “behind the curve”.\nA late selloff in U.S. technology shares on Tuesday weighed on global stock markets but currency markets remained broadly immune, with high-yielding currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars well supported.\nThe dollar recovered slightly on hopes that negotiations between the United States and China would produce a compromise and avoid a full-blown trade war.\nBut news that U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had discussed “joining forces to counter” China’s economic practices and alleged intellectual property theft raised fears that trade tensions could escalate.\nThe U.S. currency was 0.2 percent higher at 105.56 Japanese yen, well off a 16-month low of 104.560 yen set on Monday but down from an overnight high near 106.000.\n“The dollar lost some traction as equity markets sank following the latest media report on U.S. trade policy,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.\nU.S. data due later in the day include the final estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product and pending home sales.\nThe pound was broadly stable against most currencies, particularly the euro on media reports that a new proposal from the British government for the Irish border question is expected to be announced “imminently”.
