It was unclear whether companies based outside of Shanghai are also covered by the restrictions.\nThe limits were previously reported by China Securities Journal, citing unnamed sources.\nIssuance of NCDs, a popular interbank instrument, has remained strong despite regulatory efforts to rein it in. The value of outstanding NCDs currently stands at a record high, and issuance is set to break quarterly records.\nWindow guidance refers to informal instructions from regulators that are often communicated orally with no written notice.\nThe CSRC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith and Engen Tham; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:14:07.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
