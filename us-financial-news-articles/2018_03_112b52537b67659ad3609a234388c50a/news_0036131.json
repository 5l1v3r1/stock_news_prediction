With Siri’s help, users can ask whether their Model 3 is locked and where it might be located. Siri can also be told to honk the horn, lock the doors, and perform other basic functions. According to the report, a variety of functions are still not available, including the ability to adjust climate control settings and turn on valet mode. \nApple and Tesla have a contentious relationship , due in no small part to the iPhone maker’s ambitions in the self-driving car business.
