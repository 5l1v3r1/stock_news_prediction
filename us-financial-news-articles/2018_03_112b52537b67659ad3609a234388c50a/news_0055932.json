In particular, the research team also looked for a new diagnosis of osteoporosis or related bone fracture. \nThey found that 120 patients in the group that had thyroid surgery and 368 in the group without surgery developed osteoporosis or fractures. Overall, the risk was about 1.5 times higher for both the partial and total thyroidectomy patients. The risk was also higher in younger patients between ages 20 and 49 and women who had thyroid surgery. \n“We believe it is the degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression which is the main cause for increased osteoporosis,” Ganly said. “Reducing the degree of suppression, particularly in low-risk thyroid cancer patients that account for the bulk of all thyroid cancer patients, would seem the most obvious first remedy.” \nA limitation of the study is that it is a retrospective look at data that can’t control for variables such as steroid use, alcohol use, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, primary hyperparathyroidism and other factors that lead to decreased bone density and osteoporosis, said Dr. Maria Papaleontiou of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who wasn’t involved in the study. \nFuture studies should look more closely at thyroid-stimulating hormone (or TSH) suppression therapy, which is currently the standard of care for patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk thyroid cancer, she said. \n“TSH suppression therapy and overtreatment with thyroid hormone (both of which induce a state of hyperthyroidism) may have played a role in the development of adverse skeletal effects in these patients,” Papaleontiou said in an email. \nUniversity of Michigan researchers are conducting several studies in veterans to understand the possible links between thyroid overtreatment or suppression therapy and osteoporosis, she noted. They’re also surveying U.S. doctors to understand primary care physicians and specialists’ beliefs about thyroid hormone replacement therapy and bone density. \nAt the same time, she noted, current guidelines from national groups don’t recommend regular bone density screenings or osteoporosis treatments for patients who have undergone thyroid surgery. \n“Decreased bone density may be multifactorial, physicians should use their experience and discretion in screening for and treating osteoporosis in these patients,” Papaleontiou said. “We should advocate for providing evidence-based patient care but by first doing no harm.” \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2GmHtrD World Journal of Surgery, online March 14, 2018.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://bit.ly/2GmHtrD", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:30:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
