It's terrible that crash. Never liked that plane, structurally,\" he said during an interview with Washington Post .\nFour months later, in response to a series of cost overruns and other development issues for Lockheed Martin's F-35 jet, Trump asked Boeing to \"price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.\"\nTrump's request — announced via tweet— came a day after meeting separately with the CEOs from Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\nTRUMP TWEET\nBoeing's response — also announced via tweet— said it accepted the invitation to work with the Trump administration to \"affordably meet US military requirements.\"\nBOEING TWEET\nThe suggested Boeing F-18 Super Hornet is a generation behind the F-35, lacking the coveted capabilities such as stealth and sensor fusion. In short, Boeing's Super Hornet would have to be significantly redesigned, manufactured, and tested over multiple years in order to meet the same requirements akin to Lockheed's stealth fighter.\nCurrently, the Department of Defense is negotiating with Lockheed Martin on the next batch of F-35 jets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T01:07:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
