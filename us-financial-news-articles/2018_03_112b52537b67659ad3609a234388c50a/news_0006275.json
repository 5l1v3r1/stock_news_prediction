For all of 2017, digital and marketing services revenue represented 37.9 percent of total advertising and marketing services revenue, a 400 basis point increase when compared to the 33.9 percent reported for the full year 2016. These revenue growth strategies, coupled with diligent expense management that saw total expenses for 2017 decline by 8.8 percent over 2016, provided for a slight improvement in adjusted operating income when compared to 2016.”\nFull Year Results from Continuing Operations\nTotal revenue was $248.6 million for the full year of 2017, a decrease of $11.4 million, or 4.4 percent, when compared to the prior year period.\nRevenue from advertising and marketing services, including print and digital revenues, was $143.2 million for the full year of 2017, a decrease of $7.1 million, or 4.7 percent, when compared to the $150.3 million reported for the full year of 2016.

Belo Corporation - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Operating Loss to Adjusted Operating Income\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, In thousands (unaudited) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total net operating revenue $ 64,077 $ 66,095 $ 248,626 $ 259,984 Total operating costs and expense 64,527 90,230 258,679 283,730 Operating Loss $ (450 ) $ (24,135 ) $ (10,053 ) $ (23,746 ) Total operating costs and expense $ 64,527 $ 90,230 $ 258,679 $ 283,730 Less: Depreciation 2,575 2,988 10,415 10,713 Amortization 200 226 799 906 Severance expense 84 24 1,259 1,073 Pension plan settlement loss — — 5,911 — Assets impairments 3,116 22,682 3,344 22,682 Adjusted Operating Expense $ 58,552 $ 64,310 $ 236,951 $ 248,356 Total net operating revenue $ 64,077 $ 66,095 $ 248,626 $ 259,984 Adjusted operating expense 58,552 64,310 236,951 248,356 Adjusted Operating Income $ 5,525 $ 1,785 $ 11,675 $ 11,628 The Company calculates adjusted operating income by adjusting operating loss to exclude depreciation, amortization, severance expense, pension plan settlement loss and asset impairments (“adjusted operating income”). The Company believes that inclusion of certain noncash expenses and other items in the results makes for more difficult comparisons between years and with peer group companies.\nAdjusted operating income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses adjusted operating income and similar measures in internal analyses as supplemental measures of the Company’s financial performance, and for performance comparisons against its peer group of companies. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure for the purposes of evaluating consolidated Company performance. The Company therefore believes that the non-GAAP measure presented provides useful information to investors by allowing them to view the Company’s business through the eyes of management and the Board of Directors, facilitating comparison of results across historical periods and providing a focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of its business. Adjusted operating income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) from continuing operations, cash flows provided by (used for) operating activities or other comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nKaty Murray\n214-977-8869\nSource:A.H.
