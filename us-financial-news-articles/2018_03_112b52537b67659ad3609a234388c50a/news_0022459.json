FILE PHOTO - An electricity meter is seen in London, Britain August 1, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall * 668,000 customers switched during the month, the highest monthly switching figure recorded, despite February being the shortest month of the year. * The data comes as Britain’s energy firms are under pressure to reduce bills and as regulator Ofgem prepares to issue a price cap on the most widely used tariffs. *It also continues last year’s trend when a record 5.5 million customers switched in 2017 up from 4.8 million in 2016, Energy UK said. *The data does not show exactly which companies gained or lost customers but shows almost half the switches were between large suppliers, while almost a quarter of switches were from larger firms to smaller suppliers. *There are now over 60 energy suppliers in Britain. *Britain’s big six energy suppliers, controlling around 80 percent of the market are Centrica’s ( CNA.L ) British Gas, SSE ( SSE.L ), E.ON ( EONGn.DE ), EDF Energy ( EDF.PA ), Innogy’s ( IGY.DE ) Npower and Iberdrola’s ( IBE.MC ) Scottish Power.
