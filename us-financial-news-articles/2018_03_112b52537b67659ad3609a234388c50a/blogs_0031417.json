Analysts expect huge sinergies, of 12 billion reais. \nExplaining the reasons for Suzano choice on Friday, BNDES director Eliane Lustosa said Paper Excellence's bid was not firm. \"We saw it as an intention to present a proposal. Paper Excellence did not present financing for the bid or guarantees\", Lustosa said. \nLustosa added that BNDES considered Suzano proposal as firm. The bank will receive 8.5 billion reais in cash and an 11-percent stake in the new company, the largest divestment in the bank's history. \nThe deal is still subject to antitrust approval in Brazil, the United States, the European Union and China, Fibria said. An escape clause in the deal would allow Suzano to call it off if regulators force the sale of more than 1.1 million tonnes of capacity. \nPaper Excellence, controlled by the Wijaya family, which also owns Asia Pulp & Paper Company Ltd, offered to pay a $1.2 billion break-up fee if the deal failed to get funding, the source said, but it was not enough to sway the state bank. \n($1 = 3.28 reais) (Additional reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro, Paula Laier and Alberto Alerigi Jr. in Sao Paulo Editing by Brad Haynes, Daniel Flynn and Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T04:19:18.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
