The addition of polyurethane hot melt technologies, structural adhesives, and thermal management solutions significantly strengthens Chemence’s already robust portfolio of cyanoacrylates, machinery adhesives, silicones and light curable adhesives.”\nOver the next twelve months, Chemence intends to integrate this newly acquired electronics adhesive portfolio into its own Krylex® product line in order to provide a seamless transition experience for existing customers.
