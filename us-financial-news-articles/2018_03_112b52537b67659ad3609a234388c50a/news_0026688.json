The Notes will be guaranteed by all of CNX's wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee its revolving credit facility. CNX intends to use the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes to purchase any and all of the approximately $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 8.000% senior notes due 2023 pursuant to the tender offer that commenced concurrently with the offering of the Notes and to redeem any of its 8.000% senior notes due 2023 that remain outstanding after completion of the tender offer.\nThe Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the rules promulgated thereunder and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nCNX is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas companies in the United States and is focused on the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin.\nCautionary Statements:\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any notes nor shall there be any sale of notes in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state. The offering may be made only by means of an offering circular.\nVarious statements in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, may be considered forward-looking statements (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"anticipate,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release, if any, speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the factors discussed in the 2017 Form 10-K under \"Risk Factors,\" as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cnx-resources-corporation-announces-private-offering-of-500-million-of-senior-notes-300614525.html\nSOURCE CNX Resources Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cnx-resources-corporation-announces-private-offering-of-500-million-of-senior-notes-300614525.html"], "published": "2018-03-15T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T18:24:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
