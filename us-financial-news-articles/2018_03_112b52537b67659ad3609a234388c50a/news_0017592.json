Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, are on trial on charges of murdering Kim by smearing his face with VX.\nReporting by David Alexander; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T10:37:49.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
