Removal of an official requires a two-thirds vote.\nJosa Deinla, a spokeswoman and lawyer for Sereno, said the legal window for Calida to file his case questioning her suitability expired in 2013 a year after she started the job.\n“They just want to short-cut the process, betraying their anxieties that they will lose in the impeachment trial,” she said.\nIn October, Duterte dared Sereno to open her bank account to public scrutiny, accusing her of corruption and of being used by political opponents intent on driving him from power.\nSereno denies wrongdoing and has not responded publicly to Duterte’s verbal attacks.\nDuterte’s critics believe the impeachment move is motivated by the administration being uncomfortable with the fact she is due to hold the Supreme Court’s top post until 2030, when she reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70.\nMinority lawmaker Edcel Lagman said Sereno was on the receiving end of a“double barrel” assault to oust her, adding that she had committed no impeachable offence.\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:44:55.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
