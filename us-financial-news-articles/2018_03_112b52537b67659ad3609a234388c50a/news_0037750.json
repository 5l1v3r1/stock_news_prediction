The announcement comes as the 28 European Union countries work on rules that would compel Facebook, Twitter , Youtube and Google to be more proactive in filtering and weeding out hate speech on their platforms. “These days a newspaper director is criminally responsible if hateful comments are posted on its website but if you run a social network anything goes,” Philippe said in a speech on France’s policy on racism. “Nobody is going to convince me that the social networks live in space. What gets published and circulated in France is published and circulated in France and must answer to the laws of the French republic.” Philippe said France would tighten up its own rules pending progress at EU level, but did not elaborate on when or how.
