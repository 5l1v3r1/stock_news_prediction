They say our allies are foreign troops. For us they are not foreign troops, they are allies fighting for the same cause,” Issoufou said.\nJihadist groups have regrouped since the French intervention in 2013. They have expanded into central Mali, which they have used as a launchpad to hit Burkina Faso, Niger and Ivory Coast.\nWriting by Tim Cocks; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T22:01:44.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
