Officials say Bernstein is unlikely to fly back to Mexico City.\nA welcome banner for the seventh round of NAFTA talks involving the United States, Mexico and Canada is pictured at a hotel, in Mexico City, Mexico February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme The plan would be to arrange the inter-sessional talks as quickly as the three sides can agree on a date, one of the two sources said.\nOfficials have made little progress on the most contentious files since the talks started last August and the negotiations look set to drag on beyond the end date, which is tentatively scheduled for early April.\nUnder NAFTA, 62.5 percent of the net cost of a passenger car or light truck must originate in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs. Trump wants the threshold raised to 85 percent and is also seeking to ensure half the total content is U.S.-made.\nThe auto industry has opposed Trump’s demands on higher content, arguing it will disrupt supply chains and raise costs. Mexican officials say the issue must largely be resolved between the White House and U.S.-based industry bosses.\nNegotiators have struggled to advance on the auto proposal since it was submitted in October, but automakers are evaluating ideas put forward by Canada last month to include newer technology in the calculation of a vehicle’s value.\nThe current round of negotiations is set to end on Monday, when Mexican Economy Minster Ildefonso Guajardo, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland are scheduled to meet in the Mexican capital.\nSeparately, a private-sector official familiar with the talks said that negotiators from the three sides had now completed talks on good regulatory practices.\nAdditional reporting by Dave Graham and Lesley Wroughton in Mexico City; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:52:50.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
