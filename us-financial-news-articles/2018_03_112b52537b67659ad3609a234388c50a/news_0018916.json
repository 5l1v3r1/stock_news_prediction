Conventional grade gasoline in the Gulf Coast slipped by 0.75 cent a gallon to trade at 18.25 cents a gallon below benchmark futures on Wednesday after the line was shut.\nThe company said its main gasoline and distillate lines - lines 1 and 2 - were operating normally.\nThere is no estimate on the amount of fuel leaked and the cause is being investigated, a spokeswoman said in a statement.\n“There are no indications at this time that the product has migrated outside of our facility,” she said.\nReporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in New York, Swati Verma and Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T00:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:40:03.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
