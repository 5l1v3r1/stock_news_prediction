It said it had no authority to act in the matter except to dismiss the case.\n\"The plaintiffs invite us to opine on the appropriate balance of power between the Commonwealth's legislature and judiciary in redistricting matters, and then to pass judgment on the propriety of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's actions under the United States Constitution,\" the judges wrote. \"These are things that, on the present record, we cannot do.\"\nThe Democratic majority on the state Supreme Court had ruled in January that a map Republicans crafted in 2011 amounted to an unconstitutional gerrymander.\nAfter lawmakers in the GOP-controlled General Assembly and Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf did not produce a replacement, the court enacted its own map last month and gave candidates extra time for petition gathering.\nMonday's decision comes in a federal case brought a month ago by eight sitting Republican congressmen and two GOP state senators. They argued the state justices infringed on the Legislature's prerogative and did not give lawmakers enough time to come up with a replacement.\nIn a separate case, two senior Republicans in the state Legislature who were on the losing end of the state Supreme Court decision have a pending request before the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay, which would result in the use of the 2011 map for this year's congressional elections in Pennsylvania. They want the new map put on hold while they pursue an appeal to the nation's highest court.\nA ruling on that request could come at any time.\nA group of 18 Democratic voters sued in state court last year to challenge the 2011 map, a case the state Supreme Court put on a fast track before throwing out the former district lines.\nAll five Democrats on the state Supreme Court said the map violated the state constitution, but one of the Democrats joined both Republicans in objecting to the majority's determination to enact a new map for this year's races.\nMore than two dozen candidates had filed petition paperwork by mid-day Monday, according to state elections bureau data. The deadline to submit at least 1,000 voter signatures to get on the primary ballot is Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T21:00:36.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
