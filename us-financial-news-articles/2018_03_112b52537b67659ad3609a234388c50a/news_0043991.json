After the mice were addicted, the researchers injected a CBD gel into the ratâ€™s skin. \nOver time, the rats injected with CBD showed reduced signs of relapse into addiction, even when they were exposed to stress or the cues researched had used to get them to take the drugs in the first place. \nCBD is already being used on humans to help treat pain as well as psychiatric and neurological disorders. A study last year by the National Academy of Sciences also found CBD to help in treating nausea and other side effects from chemotherapy as well as muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis. \nCannabis is legal in 29 states for medical use, and 9 states for recreational use. However, it is illegal under federal law.
