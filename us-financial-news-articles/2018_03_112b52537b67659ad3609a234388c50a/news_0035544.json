The stock closed a dollar below their IPO price of $17 on Tuesday.\nDropbox's IPO comes on the heels of an upsized offering by cyber security firm Zscaler , and a strong debut would encourage other tech biggies looking to go public.\nMusic streaming service Spotify, valued at roughly $19 billion in the private markets, has also filed for a direct listing and will debut the NYSE on April 3.\nA direct listing lets investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.\nIn contrast, Dropbox has hired the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , among others, for its IPO.\nThe order book for the offering closes at midday on Wednesday and the pricing is expected on Thursday.\nSources told Reuters on Monday that the offering was oversubscribed.\nThe company has 500 million users and competes with Alphabet 's Google, Microsoft , and Amazon . Box is its main rival.\nThe stock will start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T15:39:41.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
