A Tesla Model S electric car is seen at its dealership in Seoul, South Korea July 6, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo \nTesla said there were no accidents or injuries related to the issue and the recall was undertaken in an abundance of caution. \nThe bolts, made by German supplier Bosch, can begin to corrode after contact in cold temperatures with road salt. Some Tesla owners had complained about the issue on online forums. \nSome 123,000 Model S vehicles globally contain the bolts, Tesla said.
