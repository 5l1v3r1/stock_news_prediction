That does not mean they will, but we must act responsibly,” CNR CEO Elisabeth Ayrault told Reuters on the sidelines of a briefing for energy reporters.\nTo make up for this, CNR plans to boost its renewables capacity five-fold.\n“Our plan is to have as much capacity away from the river as on the river, probably by 2035,” she said.\nCNR has 3,035 megawatt (MW) of hydropower capacity - making it France’s second-biggest hydropower producer after EDF - and has already built some 600 MW of mainly wind and some solar power since 2015.\nBy 2020, it wants to boost that to 1,000 MW and then accelerate renewables investment with a further 1,500 MW in 2020-25 to eventually reach 3,000 MW of renewables capacity.\nAyrault said the problem was not just slower flow rates but also increasing volatility. Last year’s drought was followed by three major floods in December-January. Floods also weigh on output, as CNR is forced to open dams to evacuate excess water.\n“What is worrying is the huge swings in river flow. We no longer have the regularity we had before,” she said.\nAyrault said the irregular flow also affects other industries, such as nuclear energy, agriculture and shipping.\nIn the past 18 months, France twice had to ask Switzerland to increase the outflow of Lake Geneva to ensure sufficient cooling water for the Bugey nuclear plant, she said.\nOwned 49.97 percent by gas utility Engie, 33.2 percent by state financial group Caisse des Depots and 16.83 percent by local authorities, CNR accounts for 25 percent of French hydropower output and has a monopoly on Rhone river hydropower under a concession that runs till 2023.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T03:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T21:55:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
