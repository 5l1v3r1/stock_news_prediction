The reserve also found time for a team-high six assists.\nAfter having gone scoreless in his first two games with the Clippers, Marjanovic surpassed his previous season high of 15 he had for the Pistons at Miami in January.\nAustin Rivers added 17 points, Tyrone Wallace 16, Harrell 15 and Milos Teodosic 11 for the Clippers, who completed a run of seven straight road games with five wins.\nHarris paced the Nuggets with 23 points.\nWill Barton went for 19 points, Jokic, Wilson Chandler and Jamal Murray had 18 apiece, and Mason Plumlee added 10 points to go with a team-high nine rebounds for Denver, which lost its second straight.\nThe Nuggets welcomed back Paul Millsap from a 44-game absence caused by a torn ligament in his left wrist. He had nine points and seven rebounds in 23 minutes off the bench.\nThe Nuggets led by as many as 11 points in the first half and then by 19 after a Harris layup with 4:24 remaining in the third quarter.\nIt was 86-68 with 2:53 to go before Marjanovic (five points) and Williams (four) combined for nine points in a 13-2 run to close the period and get the Clippers within 88-81.\nWilliams then hit a 3-pointer while Harrell and Marjanovic each contributed a three-point play to a 19-4 Clippers flurry that completed the 32-6 run and put Los Angeles up 100-92 with 8:02 to go.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:13:11.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
