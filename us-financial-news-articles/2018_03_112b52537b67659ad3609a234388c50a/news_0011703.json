REUTERS/Denis Balibouse During the visit, the IMF delegation will meet senior officials from the ministry and central bank, as well as business and union leaders and academics.\nLast year, the IMF criticized Israel’s government for a looser fiscal policy and advised the central bank to hold the line on interest rates until inflation surfaces.\nCraig Beaumont, the IMF’s mission chief for Israel, called it“regrettable” for the state to set a budget deficit target of 2.9 percent of gross domestic product instead of making further progress in reducing debt.\nThe IMF in 2018 projects Israel’s economy will grow 3.4 percent, in line with most other estimates.\nThe ministry again in 2019 set a budget deficit target of 2.9 percent of GDP, while the Bank of Israel last week held its benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent for the 32nd straight time. The rate is expected to remain unchanged until at least the fourth quarter of 2018 when a hike is forecast.\nReporting by Steven Scheer, Editing by Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T22:55:36.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
