The property was purchased at $23.5 million, and a cap rate of 9%.\nCranberry Square is centrally located in one of greater Pittsburgh’s most affluent and fastest growing suburbs. The property is home to top national retailers including Field & Stream, Best Buy and Barnes & Noble, and is shadow anchored by Walmart and Costco. Strategically positioned at the Township’s most prominent intersection, Route 19 and Route 228, Cranberry Square sees traffic counts in excess of 70,000 cars per day.\n\"Cranberry Square embodies the characteristics of a great real estate investment for our fund,\" says Scott G. Onufrey, President & Managing Partner at ALTO Real Estate Funds, \"with irreplaceable real estate generating strong cash flow, and potential to add value over time as we recapture those spaces currently paying below market rents. The asset is shadow anchored by Walmart and Costco, both maintaining extremely high sales volumes in one of the fastest growing and most affluent suburbs of Pittsburgh. This bodes well for the long-term prospects for the property.\"\nMarty Sweeney, Senior Vice President of Acquisitions for M & J Wilkow stated, “Cranberry Square provides us the opportunity to acquire great real estate in the region’s fastest growing and most affluent submarket at a price that would have been unlikely just 18 months ago. The shopping center is home to many of the area’s strongest performing and top name retailers, and will make an outstanding addition to M & J Wilkow’s Pittsburgh portfolio.”\nThe acquisition of Cranberry Square marks the fourth joint venture between ALTO and M & J Wilkow, and ALTO's third acquisition in the area.\nAbout ALTO Real Estate Funds\nALTO Real Estate Funds is a series of closed-end investment funds specializing in value-add commercial real estate across the US.
