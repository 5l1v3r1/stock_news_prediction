Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban talks during a forum of the chamber of industry in Budapest, Hungary, March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo In a video posted on his Facebook page, Orban said the government would provide a 10,000 forint ($39.85) food voucher to all pensioners and refund 12,000 forints from winter gas bills to families.
