(NASDAQ: FORK) (\"Fuling Global\" or the \"Company\"), a specialized producer and distributor of plastic serviceware, with precision manufacturing facilities in both the U.S. and China, today announced its financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenues\n$127.3\n$104.9\n21.3%\nGross profit\n$26.1\n$25.2\n3.2%\nGross margin\n20.5%\n24.1%\n-3.6 percentage points\nOperating income\n$7.6\n$8.5\n-10.8%\nOperating margin\n6.0%\n8.1%\n-2.2 percentage points\nNet income attributable to Fuling Global\n$6.3\n$7.9\n-21.0%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.40\n$0.50\n-21.1%\nRevenues increased by 21.3% to $127.25 million for the year of 2017 from $104.88 million for the prior year, as a result of the combined effect of increases in both sales volume and blended average selling prices (\"ASP\"). Total sales volume increased by 17.7% to 50,284 tons for the year of 2017 from 42,723 tons for the prior year. The increase in sales volume was across all product categories. Blended ASP also increased by 3.1% to $2.53 per kilogram for the year of 2017 from $2.45 per kilogram for the prior year. Gross profit increased by 3.2% to $26.05 million for the year of 2017 from $25.24 million for the prior year. Gross margin decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 20.5% for the year of 2017 from 24.1% for the prior year. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increase in the price of raw materials, particularly Polypropylene. Net income attributable to Fuling Global was $6.28 million, or $0.40 per basic and diluted share, for the year of 2017, compared to $7.94 million, or $0.50 per basic and diluted share for the prior year. The decrease in net income attributable to Fuling Global was mainly due to the increase in total operating income and the decrease in subsidy income that more than offset the increase in gross profit.\n\"2017 proved to be another strong year for Fuling Gobal with both revenues and shipment volume reaching record high. The growths were across all major geographical regions and all product categories,\" said Mr. Xinfu Hu, Chief Executive Officer of Fuling Global.\nMs. Guilan Jiang, Chairwoman of Fuling Global, further commented, \"With continuing order momentum and increased manufacturing capacity, we are increasingly confident in our ability to further extend our top-line growth streak in 2018 and beyond. As we continue to face uncertainty in market factors, particularly pricing environment for raw materials and our final products, we look for ways to further improve our productivity and profitability through process optimization and cost control in 2018.\"\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nFor the year of 2017, total revenues increased by $22.37 million, or 21.3%, to $127.25 million from $104.88 million for the prior year. The increase in total revenues was a combined result of increases in both sales volume and blended ASP.\nOverall sales volume increased by 7,561 tons, or 17.7%, to 50,284 tons for the year of 2017 from 42,723 tons for the prior year. The increase in sales volume was across all product categories. Sales volume of cutlery increased by 2,310 tons, or 8.5%, to 29,638 tons for the year of 2017 from 27,328 tons for the prior year. Sales volume of straws increased by 1,590 tons, or 35.8%, to 6,025 tons for the year of 2017 from 4,435 tons for the prior year. Sales volume of cups and plates increased by 2,516 tons, or 31.1%, to 10,602 tons for the year of 2017 from 8,086 tons for the prior year. Sales volume of other products increased by 1,145 tons, or 39.8%, to 4,020 tons for the year of 2017 from 2,875 tons for the prior year.\nBlended ASP increased by $0.08 per kilogram, or 3.1%, to $2.53 per kilogram for the year of 2017 from $2.45 per kilogram for the prior year. The increase in blended ASP was mainly related to cutlery and other products and partially offset by decrease in ASP for straws and cups and plates. ASP of cutlery increased by $0.12 per kilogram, or 6.1%, to $2.12 per kilogram for the year of 2017 from $2.00 per kilogram for the prior year. ASP of straws decreased by $0.24 per kilogram, or 6.9%, to $3.19 per kilogram for the year of 2017 from $3.43 per kilogram for the prior year. ASP of cups and plates decreased by $0.20 per kilogram, or 5.9%, to $3.24 per kilogram for the year of 2017 from $3.44 per kilogram for the prior year. ASP of other products increased by $0.19 per kilogram, or 7.4%, to $2.69 per kilogram for the year of 2017 from $2.51 per kilogram for the prior year.\nThe increase in revenues was across all product categories. Revenues from cutlery sales increased by $8.23 million, or 15.1%, to $62.85 million for the year of 2017 from $54.62 million for the prior year. Revenues from straws sales increased by $4.03 million, or 26.5%, to $19.25 million for the year of 2017 from $15.22 million for the prior year.

Revenues from other products sales increased by $3.62 million, or 50.2%, to $10.83 million for the year of 2017 from $7.21 million for the prior year. Cutlery, straws, cups and plates, and other products accounted for 49.4%, 15.1%, 27.0%, and 8.5% of total revenues for the year of 2017, compared to 52.1%, 14.5%, 26.5%, and 6.9% for the prior year, respectively.\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nY/Y Change\nRevenues\n($'000)\n% of\nTotal\nRevenues\n($'000)\n% of\nTotal\nAmount\n($'000)\n%\nCutlery\n$\n62,846\n49.4%\n$\n54,619\n52.1%\n$\n8,227\n15.1%\nStraws\n19,248\n15.1%\n15,219\n14.5%\n4,029\n26.5%\nCups and\nplates\n34,330\n27.0%\n27,835\n26.5%\n6,495\n23.3%\nOthers\n10,826\n8.5%\n7,209\n6.9%\n3,617\n50.2%\nTotal\n$\n127,250\n100.0%\n$\n104,882\n100.0%\n$\n22,368\n21.3%\nOn a geographical basis, sales in the U.S., Fuling Global's largest market, increased by $14.28 million, or 15.0%, to $109.17 million for the year of 2017 from $94.90 million for the prior year.

The increase was mainly due to increased sale volume as well as higher unit price of raw materials, particularly Polypropylene. Gross profit increased by $0.81 million, or 3.2%, to $26.05 million for the year of 2017 from $25.24 million for the prior year. Gross margin was 20.5% the year of 2017, compared to 24.1% for the prior year.\nOperating income\nSelling expenses increased by $0.76 million, or 11.1%, to $7.62 million for the year of 2017 from $6.86 million for the prior year. As a percentage of sales, selling expenses were 6.0% in 2017, compared to 6.5% in the prior year. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.37 million, or 4.9%, to $7.88 million for the year of 2017 from $7.51 million for the prior year. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 6.2% in 2017, compared to 7.2% in the prior year. Research and development expenses increased by $0.60 million, or 25.4%, to $2.95 million for the year of 2017 from $2.36 million for the prior year. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses accounted for 2.3% in 2017, compared to 2.2% in the prior year. We expect research and development expenses in 2018 to stay at current levels as we continue to conduct research and development activities, especially seeking to increase the use of environmentally-friendly materials, develop biodegradable materials and reduce reliance on fossil-based raw materials.\nAs a result, total operating expenses increased by $1.73 million, or 10.4%, to $18.45 million for the year of 2017 from $16.72 million for the prior year.\nOperating income decreased by $0.92 million, or 10.8%, to $7.60 million for the year of 2017 from $8.52 million for the prior year. Operating margin was 6.0% for the year of 2017, compared to 8.1% for the prior year. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to decrease in gross margin and partially offset by decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues.\nIncome before income taxes\nTotal net other expense, which includes interest income and expenses, subsidy income and other non-operating income and expenses, was $0.48 million for the year of 2017, compared to total net other income of $1.46 million for the prior year. The difference was mainly due to decreased subsidy income and other income as well as increased interest expense in 2017.\nIncome before income taxes decreased by $2.86 million, or 28.7%, to $7.11 million for the year of 2017 from $9.97 million for the prior year. The decrease was a result of increased operating expenses that more than offset increased gross profit in 2017.\nProvision for income taxes was $0.82 million for the year of 2017, compared to $2.03 million for the prior year.\nNet income\nNet income decreased by $1.65 million, or 20.8%, to $6.29 million for the year of 2017 from $7.94 million for the prior year. After deduction of non-controlling interest, net income attributable to Fuling Global decreased by $1.67 million, or 21.0%, to $6.28 million for the year of 2017 from $7.94 million for the prior year.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were $0.40 for the year of 2017, compared to $0.50 for the prior year. The decrease in earnings per share was mainly due to decrease in net income as a result of increased operating expenses and other net expenses that more than offset increased gross profit in 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and certificates of deposits of $4.12 million, $4.37 million, and $0.11 million, respectively, compared to $4.01 million, $2.33 million, and $1.54 million, respectively, at the end of 2016.
