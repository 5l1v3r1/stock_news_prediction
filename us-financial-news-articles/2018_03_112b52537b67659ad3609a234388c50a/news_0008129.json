The price to be paid by Interfor for any common share will be the market price at the time of acquisition.\nThe average daily trading volume of Interfor’s common shares over the six-month period ending February 28, 2018, as calculated per the TSX rules, was 258,822 common shares. Consequently, under TSX rules, Interfor will be allowed to purchase daily, through the facilities of the TSX, a maximum of 64,705 common shares representing 25% of such average daily trading volume, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. The Company did not make any purchases in the preceding 12-month period under the current NCIB.\nThe Company believes that, from time to time, the market price of its common shares may be attractive and their purchase would represent a desirable use of its capital to increase shareholder value.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release contains information and statements that are forward-looking in nature, including, but not limited to, statements about the Company’s intention to repurchase its shares.
