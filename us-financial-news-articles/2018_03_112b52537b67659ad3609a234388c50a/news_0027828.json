(“IBEX” or the “Company”) (TSX Venture:IBT) today reported its financial results for the six months ended January 31, 2018.\n“As anticipated, the Company recorded lower revenues in the quarter as one of our major customers reduced inventories which had been built up in Fiscal 2017 in advance of their launch of a major new product,” said Paul Baehr, IBEX President & CEO. “We expect that sales to this customer will return to a normal purchasing pattern sometime in the second half of the fiscal year. We are also pleased to report that our Montreal fermentation facility is operational and that the Montreal operation was certified for the production of diagnostic enzymes (ISO 13485).”\nNote: All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. The Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2017 and the accompanying notes and the related management’s discussion and analysis can be found on the Company’s website at www.ibex.ca or under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nSECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nRevenues for the quarter ended January 31, 2018 decreased by $649,467 to $892,774 compared to $1,542,241 in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenues traces mainly to a reduction in purchases by one customer who reduced inventories built up in Fiscal 2017 in advance of their launch of a major new product.\nAs a consequence of the reduction in revenues, and an increase in expenses, the Company recorded EBITDA of negative $332,832 vs. positive $502,402 in same period year ago.\nThe net loss for the period was $415,596 compared to net earnings of $422,686 for the same period a year ago. In addition to the reduction in revenues of $649,467, the Company had an increase in expenses of $188,815, partially due to a non-cash increase in share-based compensation expense ($77,319) related to the granting of stock options and to the negative impact in foreign exchange ($61,602).\nCapital expenditures during the period were $5,441, a reduction of $139,476 vs. the same period year ago.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $399,957 to $2,708,984 compared to $3,108,941 in the quarter ended October 31, 2017.\nIt should be noted that Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization (“EBITDA”) is not a performance measure defined by IFRS, but we, as well as investors and analysts, consider that this performance measure facilitates the evaluation of our ongoing operations and our ability to generate cash flows to fund our cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program. Note that our definition of this measure may differ from the ones used by other public corporations:\nEBITDA for the three months ended January 31,\n2018 January 31,\n2017 Net (loss) earnings ($415,596 ) $422,686 Depreciation of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets $78,498 $69,499 Interest – Net $4,266 $10,217 Recovery of income taxes - - (Loss) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ($332,832 ) $502,402 FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018\nRevenues for the six months ended January 31, 2018 of $2,075,787 are down as compared to $2,752,815 in the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenues traces to the factor mentioned above.\nAs a consequence of the reduction in revenues, and an increase in expenses, the Company recorded EBITDA of negative $136,561 vs. positive $783,797 in the same period year ago.\nThe Company recorded net loss of $285,737 compared to net earnings of $621,574 for the same period a year ago. This negative variation in earnings can be mainly traced to the decrease in sales.\nCapital expenditures during the period were $37,651, a reduction of $262,698 vs. the same period year ago.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $295,643 during the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2017. Net working capital decreased by $132,602 during the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended July 31, 2017.\nFinancial Summary for the six months ended January 31,\n2018 January 31,\n2017 Revenues $2,075,787 $2,752,815 (Loss) Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortization ($136,561 ) $783,797 Depreciation $139,406 $141,082 Net (loss) earnings ($285,737 ) $621,574 (Loss) earnings per share ($0.01 ) $0.02 EBITDA for the six months ended January 31,\n2018 January 31,\n2017 Net (loss) earnings ($285,738 ) $621,574 Depreciation of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets $139,406 $141,082 Interest – Net $9,771 $121,141 Recovery of income taxes - - (Loss) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ($136,561 ) $783,787\nBalance Sheet Summary as at January 31,\n2018 July 31,\n2017 Cash and cash equivalents $2,708,984 $3,004,627 Net working capital $3,216,453 $3,349,055 Outstanding shares at report date (common shares) 24,703,244 24,703,244 LOOKING FORWARD\nAs always, the future of the Company is difficult to predict as the Company’s customers have wide swings in their purchase patterns.\nAs previously reported, we expected to see lower sales in Fiscal 2018 vs. Fiscal 2017 as one of our major customers was building inventory in Fiscal 2017 in advance of a major new product introduction. However, we expect our sales to increase as this customer moves to a post-introduction sales pattern.\nWe also anticipate a weaker US dollar in Fiscal 2018, which is having, and will have, a negative impact on profitability.\nThe two factors above point to lower net earnings in Fiscal 2018. On the positive side, with the completion of our Montreal fermentation facility, the Fiscal 2018 cash needs of the Company due to capital expenditures is significantly reduced.\nThe Company continues to work on a number of projects with its key customers, some of which may result in additional revenues in Fiscal 2019 and beyond; however, as with all developmental projects, we cannot give any assurances that any of these projects will come to fruition and produce revenues.\nManagement believes that the Company has sufficient funds to meet its obligations and planned expenditures for the ensuing twelve months as they fall due. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting period.\nABOUT IBEX\nIBEX manufactures and markets proteins for biomedical use through its wholly owned subsidiaries IBEX Pharmaceuticals Inc.
