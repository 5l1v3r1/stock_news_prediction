Although inflation has gradually eased after hitting 12.98 percent in November - the highest since late 2003 - it remains far above the bank’s target of 5 percent.\nThe bank has previously used unorthodox moves to tighten policy, creating the perception among market players and other investors that it wants to avoid conventional rate hikes in the face of President Tayyip Erdogan’s often stated opposition to high borrowing costs.
