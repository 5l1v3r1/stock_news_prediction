The accusation from the US administration is that Chinese policy and cheap loans from state banks were behind the flurry of deals over the past three years. \nBut M&A activity is expected to pick up in coming months as China’s political situation firms up, although the focus could fall outside of the US. \n“The government’s new economic team is in place in Beijing and everything has settled down,” said Tang Zhenyi, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment bank CLSA. “Now the corporations can focus on going out, on going global. I think that means it will be a big year for Chinese companies doing overseas deals.” \nA series of sensitive political meetings kicking off in October of last year had disrupted deal flows in 2017, with companies such as HNA Group waiting for clarity on what types of outbound investment would be allowed. MUST READ Tuesday's ETF with Unusual Volume: IDEV \nU.S. crackdown threatens bullish mood \nThe crackdown was swift, just as much as it was unexpected. In short order earlier this month, the US government acted to, in effect, block the prospects of the largest technology acquisition of all time: the $142 billion takeover of chipmaker Qualcomm by Singapore-based Broadcom, writes Arash Massoudi. \nThe use of national security concerns by President Donald Trump to block a takeover that had yet to be agreed was unprecedented and spooked dealmakers around the world at a time when the US government is pursuing more protectionist policies. \nIt is uncertain whether a further freeze in global dealmaking will take a hold, but for now cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for more than $511.7 billion in overall activity in the first quarter of this year. That is up 76 percent from the same period a year ago and advisers see no sign that a slowdown is coming. \n“M&A dialogue remains robust despite concerns about the potential impact of changes in America’s trade and national security policies on deal activity,” said Stephen Arcano, head of M&A at Skadden. \nOne area where the US actions did have an effect however was in deals from China, with companies from the country registering just 4 percent of the activity so far in 2018. \nUS companies launched more than $101 billion worth of overseas deals, with the largest move coming from cable group Comcast as it tries to break up a takeover of UK pay-TV broadcaster Sky. \nOther significant cross-border transactions in the period include Italy’s Atlantia and Spain’s ACS teaming up to jointly take over Abertis, the Spanish highway concessions group. \nThe largest European deal into the US came in January when privately held consumer group JAB Holding agreed to pay $18.7 billion in cash to acquire soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple and combine it with its Keurig Green Mountain coffee business. \nStrong demand powers buyout funds MUST READ S&P, small cap stocks hit record; financials lead \nGlobal private equity deals have enjoyed their strongest start in five years, buoyed by the record amounts of cash flowing into the sector as institutional investors look for ways to boost their returns, writes Javier Espinoza. \nBuyout-backed transactions totaled $79.7 billion in the first quarter, a 30 percent rise from a year earlier. The figure represents 7 percent of overall global dealmaking activity, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nThe US saw the biggest increase in private equity transactions with a 52 percent rise in deals led by buyout funds, accounting for a total of $46.4 billion so far this year. In Europe dealmaking jumped 27 percent, totaling $19 billion and the most active year since 2007. Asian deal flow shrank slightly. \nThe two largest transactions for the first quarter were Blackstone’s $17 billion acquisition of the financial terminals and data unit of Thomson Reuters and Carlyle’s 10.1 billion euro acquisition of Akzo Nobel’s speciality chemicals unit. \nRob Pulford, head of financial sponsors for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Goldman Sachs, said he expects activity levels to surpass those of 2017. He said: “This year is as good as last year and I think 2018 will be even more active. We are seeing the biggest deals in a long time.” \nPulford expects a bulk of the deals to come from private equity groups acquiring listed companies following a doubling in the value of such deals last year. “The level of dialogue and conversation around public to private transactions has accelerated from last year. Boards of companies have decided that what’s on offer is compelling,” he said. \nBut as the pace of dealmaking speeds up, advisers to buyout funds have warned that there is a risk of overpaying for assets as multiples have already surpassed the record highs of before the financial crisis. \n–Additional reporting by FT’s Arash Massoudi and James Fontanella-Khan ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:17:04.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
