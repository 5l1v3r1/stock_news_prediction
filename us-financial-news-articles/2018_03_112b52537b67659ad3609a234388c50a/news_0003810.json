Bless said he also doesn't think that will happen. But if it does, it will be minimal, he said. \nDuring the meeting on Thursday, Trump argued that trade trends \"destroyed\" the American steel and aluminum industries. \nBut there was confusion leading up to the meeting as the administration struggled to agree on how to proceed. \nWhile one White House aide told CNBC it was a \"mess,\" Bless said it has been \"seamless\" and the meeting went off \"without a hitch.\" \n\"We've been impressed that they could bring it together that quickly.\" \nâ€” CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Eamon Javers contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:41:12.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
