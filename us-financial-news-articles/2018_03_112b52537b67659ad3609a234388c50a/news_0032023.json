The country’s no.2 supermarket chain could be worth around A$20 billion ($16 billion), analysts said, which would make it a top 30 company on the bourse. Wesfarmers shares jumped as much as 6 percent after the retailer announced the spin-off early on Friday. The move comes more than a decade after Wesfarmers bought Coles, discount chains Kmart and Target, and the Officeworks business supplies chain for A$21 billion ($16 billion) in what was then Australia’s biggest takeover. Wesfarmers proposes to retain up to 20 percent interest in Coles following the demerger, while investing more capital in businesses with stronger earnings growth prospects, the company said. “As a diversified conglomerate, there is an opportunity for us to deliver a superior return,” Managing Director Rob Scott told reporters. “And that doesn’t mean the returns from Coles won’t be good returns, they just will be more moderate levels of return. That’s really about why we’re proposing to undertake this demerger.” The Coles supermarkets and liquor business accounts for 61 percent of the group’s capital employed but generates only 34 percent of its earnings. Private equity firms, led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, had eyed Coles back in 2006 and 2007, and the spin-off could attract suitors again. “We would welcome any offers but it would need to be at a very attractive value for our shareholders for us to consider it,” Scott said on a conference call from Perth, where Wesfarmers is headquartered. FIERCE COMPETITION The move comes as supermarket sales face increasing pressure from fierce competition while at the same time sluggish wage growth stays consumer spending power. The retailer, which has been caught up in an aggressive price war with archrival Woolworths Ltd, last month reported a drop in first-half earnings partly due to lower contribution from Coles. “The outlook for grocery retailing in particular looks clouded,” said Michael McCarthy, Chief Market Strategist at brokerage CMC Markets. “There are definitely real and present structural threats to the industry and growth-rates in the business have been in decline for a long time. The only possible criticism of the move I’d make is that it comes a bit late,” he said. Wesfarmers saw strong growth potential for the nation’s no.2 supermarket chain when it took it over in 2007, at a time when it had been losing market share against Woolworths. But the turnaround took longer than expected as Coles needed to plough A$8 billion into overhauling its stores. Adding to the hurdles, competition against Coles and Woolworths grew over the past decade with private German group Aldi expanding rapidly in Australia and U.S. wholesaler Costco making inroads. “Last year was a very challenging year in the supermarket space given that our major competitor rebased their earnings and invested a billion dollars,” Scott said. Now was a good time to consider a spin-off compared to 12 to 18 months ago, he said. “The supermarket sector seems to have reached a degree of stability.” Wesfarmers said Steven Cain would succeed John Durkan as managing director of Coles. If the demerger is implemented, Wesfarmers shareholders will receive one share in Coles for every share in Wesfarmers, the company said. The separation, subject to board, regulatory and shareholder approvals, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2019.
