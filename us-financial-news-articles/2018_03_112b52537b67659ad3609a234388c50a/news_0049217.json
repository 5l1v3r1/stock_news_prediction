U.S. WTI crude is up about 7.5 percent since the start of the year.\nshow chapters Commodities tomorrow: Inventories, US production pressures crude 3:27 PM ET Wed, 28 March 2018 | 00:42 \"The equities market is rallying and that's lending support to oil,\" said Philip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. All three major U.S. stock indexes were positive on Thursday.\n\"The dollar is slightly in positive territory, but it's not screaming like yesterday,\" which is also supportive to crude prices, said Streible. The dollar against a basket of currencies was up about 0.04 percent, after gaining 0.8 percent Wednesday. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.\nStrong compliance on supply cuts from members of The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies like Russia have supported prices.

Commercial U.S. stocks rose by 1.6 million barrels in the last week to 429.95 million barrels, while output hit a record 10.43 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.\n\"Right now, oil looks fragile,\" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. \"The price action last week was pretty clear. The objective on that move was to take out the highs of 2018, but that's not been done and the price action of the last three days has not been very convincing.\"\nshow chapters Oil cost curve is deflating: J P Morgan 12 Hours Ago | 03:11 This week marked the launch of the Shanghai crude oil futures contract, which has lost about 10 percent since it first opened on Monday. It ended Thursday's session at 409.7 yuan ($65.18) a barrel.\nDespite high volatility and lingering skepticism about Shanghai's trading hours, along with doubts about the process for physical delivery of crude under contract, most analysts expect the contract to establish itself as a third global oil price benchmark next to Brent and WTI.\nGoldman Sachs said in a note to clients that there was \"finally, an exchange traded price for Chinese crude oil.\"\nShanghai's \"start of trading was relatively successful (as)...it is the first onshore Chinese commodity contract that allows direct trading by foreign investors and is denominated in RMB (yuan), indirectly promoting the use of the Chinese currency,\" Goldman said.\n— CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T06:13:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
