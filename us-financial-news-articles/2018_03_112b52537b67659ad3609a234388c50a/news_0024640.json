Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau delivers the budget in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie “Certainly anecdotally in North America there are some businesses that are being cautious about investments because there is an expectation that NAFTA could be slightly different tomorrow than it was yesterday,” Bill Morneau said in a speech in London. “I just assume that is a similar situation here. Hopefully (that’s) one to be overcome as more clarity comes out.” Morneau reiterated that he hopes Canada will have at least as good a trade arrangement with Britain after Brexit as now, taking the country’s current CETA deal with the EU as a model.
