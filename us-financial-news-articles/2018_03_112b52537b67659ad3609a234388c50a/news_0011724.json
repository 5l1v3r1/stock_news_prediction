REUTERS/Costas Baltas The protestors organized by the We are Macedonia movement gathered under the statue of Hellenic ruler Alexander the Great in Skopje’s main square. \n“We are here because questions about the name, the identity, the constitution (and) language are issues over which we must adopt a (strong) position,” Evica Stojanova-Kamberova, one of rally organizers told the crowd. \nThe small republic and its southern neighbor Greece have agreed to step up U.N.-brokered negotiations this year to solve a decades-old dispute that has hampered Skopje’s ambition to join NATO and the European Union. \nProtesters demanded that the government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev halt talks with Greece over the name dispute. They also want a resolution to the United Nations demanding the country’s recognition under its constitutional name Macedonia. \n\nProtesters take part in a rally against the use of the term \"Macedonia\" in any settlement to a dispute between Athens and Skopje over the former Yugoslav republic's name, in Athens, Greece, February 4, 2018.
