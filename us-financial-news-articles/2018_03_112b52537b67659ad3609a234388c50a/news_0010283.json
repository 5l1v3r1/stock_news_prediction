Marketing departments often conjure up new specialist roles so their companies can get their heads around the latest trends and technologies. Remember everyone rushing to appoint a “head of mobile” and “digital evangelists”? Here’s a new one: Bank of America has created an internal “brand safety officer” role . The new job was born out of a necessity to clean house. The bank’s senior vice president and enterprise media executive Lou Paskalis said at Mobile World Congress earlier this week: “I get a text from my chief financial officer every time there is news about a brand safety issue. I know why he is sending them to me... at some point he is going to say ‘gee, is marketing safe to invest in?’ and we don’t want that.”\nOh You Pretty Things WPP rounded off the agency holding company earnings season with its worst annual results since the financial crisis , which summed up a fairly shoddy 12 months across the sector. In the earnings release, Mr. Sorrell said, “2017 for us was not a pretty year.” He blamed cost-cutting by clients engaged in zero-based budgeting and technological changes as the main contributors to the company’s decline in full-year sales. WPP also warned that 2018 would be a slog, too, and set budgets on the assumption that both revenue and net sales will be flat. The antidote? “Horizontality”: WPP’s effort to simplify its vast structure of specialist shops and get its agencies working better together on client projects. We’ve already seen the consolidation of agencies such as the formation of Wavemaker in its media division and yesterday’s merger of Burson- Marsteller and Cohn & Wolfe in the PR vertical. The company is also “horizontalizing” (they said it, not me) its internal systems, announcing today, for example, its production management platform Hogarth will now be rolled out for the entire company to use.\n—Mediapawhoza?—\nRival agency groups have suggested 2018 may have a repeat of 2015’s “Mediapalooza,” when a large number of clients called media reviews. But Mr. Sorrell doesn’t see a Mediapalooza 2 on the horizon, saying that while there has been increased new business activity—major reviews going on at the moment include Mars, Shell and HSBC—it’s not particularly busier than any other time. WPP Finance Chief Paul Richardson even said that the $21 billion of media billings on the table three years ago wasn’t dramatically more than the $18 billion that usually changes hands in a normal year. What *is* significant, according to Mark Read, CEO of WPP’s Wunderman, is that a tremendous amount of the activity this time is driven by companies looking at data and how they organize their tech stack, including how they work with companies like Adobe and Salesforce.\nRaising the Roof We finally have a look under the hood of Spotify’s business after the company filed to go public on Wednesday , WSJ reports. Lots to absorb from an advertising perspective. Spotify had 92 million monthly users on its ad-supported service this year, up 19% on 2016. It had 159 million monthly users in total. (Interesting that a monthly active user is counted if they consume content for “greater than zero” milliseconds—that’s one very short song!) Ad-supported revenue grew 41% to €416 million ($507 million) in 2017, which the company said was due to an increase in the number of impressions sold, driven largely by the growth in its programmatic channel. Spotify also managed to boost its average rate per impression by 7%, buoyed by the growth of its premium video offering. Elsewhere in the filing, Spotify says 62% of its users are in the coveted 18- to 34-year-old demo, and that there’s a big opportunity to grow its user base by gaining share from the $28 billion global radio market.\nThis Is the Next Century, Where NBCUniversal’s Free (Of Ads?) Typical! A week after I suggested that the smattering of news about TV companies experimenting with reducing their ad minutage doesn’t look to be escalating into a widespread trend, another network group makes a big announcement about cutting down their commercials. NBCUniversal said Wednesday that it plans to cut ad time by 10% during its original prime-time programming across its networks, CMO Today reports. NBCU also wants to reduce the number of ads per break by 20%. The network hopes to offset the reductions by running a standalone 60-second ad break at the start or the end of a show. Interestingly, Pivotal Research Group Senior Analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a research note earlier this month that NBCU was far from the worst offender as far as ad load is concerned. NBCU had average ad loads of 11.1 minutes per hour in January, roughly in the middle of the 10 national U.S. TV network groups analyzed. Viacom had the highest, at 14.6 minutes per hour.\nA Time and a Placed A newsletter exclusive : You might remember Placed as the location analytics company Snap acquired for $135 million in cash last year. Now Placed, which continues to operate independently from Snap, also wants to be remembered as the go-to metric for offline location data, the company’s CEO David Shim tells me. From Thursday, any brand, agency or Placed competitor will get free access to Placed’s Insights dashboard (the company will also continue to operate a paid-for premium service) to get data about the types of people that visit particular stores and which other brands and categories they have an affinity with. Mr. Shim tells me that while Nielsen is seen as the standard for TV ratings and comScore for website visits, there hasn’t really been a common currency for visits in the physical world. Placed gets its location data from owned-and-operated apps. Users opt-in to share their whereabouts in the background, in exchange for rewards like airline miles or charitable donations. Mr. Shim tells me it’s this opt-in consent approach which puts the company in good stead when Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May.\nBest of the rest Pizza Hut has replaced Papa John’s as the official pizza of the NFL. [ WSJ ]\nNike defeated an appeal by a photographer who accused the company of infringing his copyright by using his iconic photo of basketball star Michael Jordan to create its “Jumpman” logo. [ Reuters ]\nViacom CEO Bob Bakish said the company is planning a new ad-funded over-the-top streaming service, expected to launch next year. [ Variety ]\nVice and Vogue have put their editorial collaboration on hold just four months after it was announced. Launch sponsors including Gap had reportedly pulled support and switched their spending to other Condé Nast brands. [ Digiday ]\nAmazon is selling its first pay-per-view package for live sports, having signed a deal with UFC to stream the organization’s upcoming slate of weekend fights.
