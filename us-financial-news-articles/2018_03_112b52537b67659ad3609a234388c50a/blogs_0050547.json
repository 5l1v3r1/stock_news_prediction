Although many units of Odebrecht were suspended from making deals with the state, OEC is still able to sign contracts with the government. \nThe contract, disclosed by the company and in the official government gazette, is to upgrade the capacity of the Santa Cruz thermal power plant in Rio de Janeiro to 507 megawatts from 350 megawatts.
