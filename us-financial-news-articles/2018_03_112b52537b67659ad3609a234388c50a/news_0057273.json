REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh/Files The town of Douma, controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebel group, is the last patch of eastern Ghouta still held by insurgents who have been routed in a ferocious offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian military that began in February.\nIts recovery would seal a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad, crushing the last big rebel stronghold near Damascus seven years into a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.\nThousands of people - fighters from other rebel factions, their families and other civilians - have been leaving for northwestern Syria from other parts of eastern Ghouta in convoys of buses that have been given safe passage to Idlib province.\nJaish al-Islam has so far refused such an evacuation, saying it amounts to forced demographic change by Assad and his allies.\nThe Russian news agency Interfax Quote: d the Russian military’s general staff as saying it had reached agreement with insurgents in Douma to leave, without saying where they would go.\n“Agreement was reached today with the leaders of illegal armed groups on the departure in the near future of the rebels and their family members from the town of Douma,” it cited Sergei Rudskoy, an official with the general staff, as saying.\nA boy stands at a damage site after an airstrike on the rebel-held besieged city of Douma, in the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta, Syria October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh/Files The Jaish al-Islam military spokesman quickly denied the report. “Our position is still clear and firm and it is rejecting forced displacement and demographic change in what remains of eastern Ghouta,” Jaish al-Islam military spokesman Hamza Birqdar said in a message posted on his Telegram feed.\nBut Mohammad Alloush, the group’s political official, said the talks over Douma were moving in the right direction and the “chances (of agreement) are getting stronger day after day”.\nAlloush, who is based outside Syria, made the comments in a report whose accuracy he confirmed to Reuters.\nDouma is surrounded by Syrian government forces. There are tens of thousands of civilians in the town.\nSyrian state TV said a deal had nearly been reached for Jaish al-Islam to leave Douma to the Idlib, citing preliminary information.\nDamaged buildings are seen in the besieged town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Syria February 25, 2018.

It said a total of 144,000 people have now been displaced from eastern Ghouta.\nWhile thousands have gone to rebel-held territory near the Turkish border, the bulk of the displaced have fled the fighting to shelters in government-held areas near eastern Ghouta.\nReporting by Maria Kiselyova in Moscow and Tom Perry in Beirut; writing by Tom Perry; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T14:12:03.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
