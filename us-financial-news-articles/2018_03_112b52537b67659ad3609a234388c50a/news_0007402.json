In 2019, it added, the economy is seen growing between 2.2 percent and 3.2 percent, also in line with its previous outlook.\nNew central bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon has adopted a hawkish stance to underline his commitment to keep prices under control.\nIn its latest quarterly report, the bank once again stressed its willingness to act to quash price rises.\n“Given the presence of risks that imply a high grade of uncertainty for inflation and its expectations, monetary policy (will be) opportune and firm,” it said.\nIn a client note, Goldman Sachs economist Alberto Ramos said he expected the central bank to hold rates steady at 7.50 percent in its April meeting, “barring new negative shocks to inflation” and if the exchange rate remains steady.\nThe bank noted that the balance of risks to inflation remains upwardly slanted in an environment of high uncertainty, and that future risks to inflation could come from significant price rises in some energy products.\nMexico’s central bank reiterated that it expects inflation to keep falling, getting close to its 3 percent target throughout 2018, reaching the target in the first quarter of 2019 and remaining around 3 percent for rest of next year.\nDiaz de Leon said there was no evidence of second order effects on inflation, but said Mexico faces an especially volatile scenario for the peso exchange rate.\nThe balance of risks to growth remains on a downward bias, the bank said. It noted that a delay in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or an unfavorable outcome to the talks, are risks to growth, along with volatility in financial markets around Mexico’s July election.\nNonetheless, the bank said that due to monetary policy actions, the government’s adherence to fiscal goals, and the resilience of the financial system, Mexico’s economy was now better placed to face possible adverse scenarios.
