Hartley missed last week’s defeat by France but has recovered from a calf strain. Jones has brought in Richard Wigglesworth at scrumhalf and moved Owen Farrell to flyhalf, with Ben Te’o and Jonathan Joseph in the centres. There is also a new-look back row with James Haskell starting at openside flanker, Sam Simmonds at number eight and Chris Robshaw moved back to blindside. Anthony Watson retains the fullback shirt, with Mike Brown again on the bench. Prop Kyle Sinckler is rewarded for his impressive cameo with a starting berth, with Cole dropped to the bench while George Kruis starts in the second row ahead of Joe Launchbury. Exeter’s Dom Armand, the stand-out back rower in the Premiership this season but ignored by Jones since his sole international appearance off the bench in Argentina last year, is named among the replacements. Following losses in Scotland and France, the defending champions are trying to avoid three successive Six Nations defeats for the first time since 2006. If they do lose on Saturday - handing Ireland their third grand slam in the process - they could finish outright fifth in the standings, their worst performance for 35 years.
