The discount works out to 54 percent.\nUnder the offer, customers on Medicaid can get Amazon Prime for $5.99 a month, or $7 less than the new regular monthly fee of $12.99 . In June, Amazon first introduced this discounted price for shoppers who receive government assistance in the form of an Electronic Benefits Transfer card.\nThe goal of these discounts, according to Amazon executive Aaron Perrine, is to give more people access to \"aspects of the digital economy — some conveniences and benefits — that I think a lot of us take for granted.\"\nAn Amazon Prime membership includes perks such as two-day shipping on more than 100 million products, unlimited photo storage and free online streaming of thousands of movies and TV shows. Amazon Prime customers typically spend more and buy more frequently on Amazon than non-members do.\nWith the moves, Amazon is increasingly battling Walmart and other low-priced retailers for the wallets of those with less disposable income. But it's not altruism; Amazon Prime has been widely adopted by middle-class and well-off Americans, so if the membership program is going to continue to grow in the U.S., the company has to figure out how to attract other demographics .\nMore from Recode:\nFacebook ad costs spiked higher after a big change to its News Feed algorithm\nSheryl Sandberg says Facebook is taking the tech backlash seriously — and it's doing something about it\nRival chipmakers Qualcomm and Broadcom are in a back-and-forth that can only be described as a soap opera\nAt the same time, Walmart has made moves to court bigger spenders with the acquisition of brands like Bonobos and a new service aimed at serving busy, well-off moms in New York City.\nMedicaid is the government program that helps provide health coverage for many low-income families and disabled individuals. Medicare, which isn't part of this discount program, guarantees health coverage for those 65 or older.\nThe discounted membership price works out to about $72 for 12 months. The cheapest Prime membership for those Amazon customers who do not receive government assistance is $99 for a full year.\nThose who want to qualify for the discount will be asked to apply and upload a photo of their Medicaid card. Eligible shoppers need to reapply once a year and are eligible for up to four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:42:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
