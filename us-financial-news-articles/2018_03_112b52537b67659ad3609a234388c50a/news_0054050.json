The arrests took place with help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, he said.\nThe planes used in the flights were rented in Colombia and in some Central American and Caribbean countries, the police added.\nReporting by Nelson Bocanegra; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:01:06.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
