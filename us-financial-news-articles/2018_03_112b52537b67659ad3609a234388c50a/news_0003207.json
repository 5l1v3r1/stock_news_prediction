Carolina outshot Philadelphia by a whopping margin of 28-14.\nPhiladelphia came out aggressive in the third and quickly cut the lead to 3-1 when Konecny registered his 16th goal on a gorgeous pass and assist by Sean Couturier at 1:20. Claude Giroux received the other assist.\nCarolina’s Noah Hanifin was whistled for holding Scott Laughton, giving the Flyers a late power play. The Flyers had some good chances but were unable to connect.\nShortly after the power play, Aho ripped a wrist shot past Mrazek for a commanding 4-1 advantage at 14:23 of the third. It was Aho’s 23rd goal of the season.\nCarolina outshot the Flyers 35-22.\nPhiladelphia had six shots in the first, seven in the second and eight in the third and never was able to put consistent pressure in the crease on Ward.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:24:10.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
