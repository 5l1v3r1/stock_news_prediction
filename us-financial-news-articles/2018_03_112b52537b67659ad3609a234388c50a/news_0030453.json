(NYSE:REV) today announced its results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nQuarter ended December 31, 2017 Highlights 1 :\nAs Reported net sales were $786.6 million, a decrease of 1.8% compared to the prior-year period. As Reported operating income of $21.0 million, compared to operating income of $25.4 million in the prior-year period. As Reported net loss was $76.9 million, compared to As Reported net loss of $36.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted (a) net loss was $45.2 million, compared to Adjusted net income of $22.5 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA (a) was $112.0 million, compared to $149.0 million in the prior-year period, representing a 24.8% decrease.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal Company Results\nIn calculating Adjusted results, adjustments were made for the Non-Operating Items described in footnote (a).\n(USD millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 As Reported Adjusted As Reported Adjusted As Reported Adjusted % Change % Change Net Sales $ 786.6 $ 786.6 $ 800.7 $ 800.7 (1.8 )% (1.8 )% Gross Profit 458.9 459.3 452.4 468.9 1.4 % (2.0 )% Gross Margin 58.3 % 58.4 % 56.5 % 58.6 % 180bps -20bps Operating income $ 21.0 $ 67.0 $ 25.4 $ 105.2 (17.3 )% (36.3 )% Adjusted EBITDA 112.0 149.0 (24.8 )% Net (loss) income (76.9 ) (45.2 ) (36.5 ) 22.5 (110.7 )% (300.9 )% Diluted (loss) earnings per common share $ (1.46 ) $ (0.86 ) $ (0.70 ) $ 0.43 (108.6 )% (300.0 )% 1 The results discussed below include the following measures: U.S. GAAP (“As Reported”); non-GAAP (“Adjusted”), which excludes certain Non-Operating Items (as defined in footnote (a)) from As Reported results; and Non-GAAP pro forma (“Pro Forma Adjusted”), which presents the Adjusted results on a pro forma basis as if Revlon and Elizabeth Arden were a combined company for all of the periods presented (“Pro Forma”). See footnote (a) for further discussion of the Company’s Adjusted and Pro Forma Adjusted measures. Reconciliations of As Reported results to Pro Forma, Adjusted and Pro Forma Adjusted results are provided as an attachment to this release. In addition, where indicated, the Company analyzes and presents its results excluding the impact of foreign currency translation (“XFX”).\nAs Reported net sales were $786.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 1.8% compared to the prior- year period, primarily driven by net sales declines in North America, partially offset by international growth within the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nAs Reported gross margin was 58.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 56.5% in the prior-year period, an increase of 180 basis points (\"bps\"). This increase was driven by the impacts of additional inventory costs in the prior-year period related to the increase in the fair value of inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden acquisition and the realization of approximately $10 million of insourcing integration synergies, which were partially offset by higher obsolescence as the Company executes on aligning its strategic investments, higher returns and less overhead absorption. On an Adjusted basis, gross margin was 58.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 58.6% in the prior-year period, a decline of 20bps due to the drivers in As Reported gross margin discussed above, excluding the impact of the additional inventory costs in the prior period related to the fair value of inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden acquisition.\nAs Reported operating income was $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to operating income of $25.4 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher SG&A and acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by the results of the drivers of the increase discussed in As Reported gross margin above and lower restructuring charges. As Reported operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a $10.8 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge within the Company’s Global Color Brands reporting unit. On an Adjusted basis, operating income was $67.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to Adjusted operating income of $105.2 million in the prior-year period, as a result of the drivers of the decline in Adjusted gross margin discussed above and higher SG&A costs, offset by the realization of a total of $28 million of pro forma synergies and cost reductions.\nAs Reported net loss was $76.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $36.5 million in the prior-year period. This decline was primarily the result of the drivers discussed in As Reported operating income above and a higher provision for income taxes, which includes non-cash expense of $47.9 million associated with the reduction in the Company's deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the U.S. These drivers were partially offset by the favorable impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted net loss, which excludes certain Non-Operating Items described in footnote (a), was $45.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to Adjusted net income of $22.5 million in the prior-year period, a $67.7 million decrease, primarily driven by net sales declines, higher SG&A costs and a higher provision for income taxes, partially offset by the effects of foreign currency fluctuations as compared to the prior-year period.\nElizabeth Arden Integration Program\nThe Company continued to accelerate the realization of synergies and cost reductions on the restructuring and integration of Elizabeth Arden, delivering $69 million of synergies and cost reductions for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to an expected delivery of $55 million to $60 million for the year. Of the $69 million of synergies and cost reductions for the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $23 million were realized within costs of sales and $46 million were realized within SG&A costs.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company incurred approximately $22 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with implementing actions under the Elizabeth Arden Integration Program, as the Company continues to execute on the process to consolidate and streamline the combined organization. Through December 31, 2017, the Company has realized approximately $72 million in restructuring and related charges.\nSegment Results\n(USD millions) Three Months Ended December 31, Net Sales As Reported As Reported 2017 2016 % Change XFX\n% Change Consumer $ 355.7 $ 367.5 (3.2 )% (4.0 )% Elizabeth Arden 313.2 306.2 2.3 % 1.6 % Professional 111.8 119.3 (6.3 )% (10.4 )% Other 5.9 7.7 (23.4 )% (28.6 )% Total $ 786.6 $ 800.7 (1.8 )% (3.0 )% Three Months Ended December 31, Segment Profit (b) As Reported As Reported 2017 2016 % Change XFX\n% Change Consumer $ 105.1 $ 128.8 (18.4 )% (18.2 )% Elizabeth Arden 48.7 35.7 36.4 % 35.0 % Professional 10.4 26.0 (60.0 )% (62.3 )% Other (1.2 ) (1.8 ) 33.3 % 44.4 % Total $ 163.0 $ 188.7 (13.6 )% (13.9 )% Consumer Segment\nConsumer segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $355.7 million, a decrease of 3.2%, or 4.0% XFX, compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by net sales declines in Almay color cosmetics as a result of higher returns, partially offset by growth in net sales of Revlon color cosmetics.\nConsumer segment profit decreased by 18.4%, or 18.2% XFX, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of the decline in net sales and higher sales returns, as well as higher brand support expenses.\nElizabeth Arden Segment\nElizabeth Arden net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $313.2 million, an increase of 2.3%, or 1.6% XFX, compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher net sales of Elizabeth Arden branded skin care and fragrances internationally, offset by lower net sales of designer and celebrity fragrances, primarily within the U.S. mass retail channel.\nElizabeth Arden segment profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $48.7 million compared to $35.7 million in the prior-year period. The increase of 36.4% was primarily driven by higher net sales in addition to lower cost of sales and SG&A expenses due to the realization of synergies and cost reductions in 2017, partially offset by higher brand support expenses.\nProfessional Segment\nProfessional segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $111.8 million decreased by 6.3%, or 10.4% XFX, compared to the prior-year period, driven by continued lower net sales of American Crew men’s grooming products, as efforts to balance trade inventory stabilize, which were partially offset by higher net sales of Creme of Nature multi-cultural hair products.\nProfessional segment profit decreased by 60.0%, or 62.3% XFX, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior-year period, primarily resulting from lower gross profit driven by the declines in net sales and higher obsolescence, as well as higher brand support expenses.\nGeographic Net Sales\nOverall, net sales decreased on an As Reported basis by 1.8%, driven by overall lower net sales in North America, partially offset by international growth in the Elizabeth Arden and Professional segments.\n(USD millions) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nAs Reported 2016\nAs Reported As Reported\n% Change As Reported XFX\n% Change Net Sales: Consumer North America $ 216.0 $ 225.7 (4.3 )% (4.6 )% International 139.7 141.8 (1.5 )% (3.0 )% Professional North America $ 44.1 $ 56.9 (22.5 )% (23.4 )% International 67.7 62.4 8.5 % 1.4 % Elizabeth Arden North America $ 169.6 $ 187.2 (9.4 )% (9.7 )% International 143.6 119.0 20.7 % 19.5 % Other North America $ — $ — N.M.

Free cash flow used in 2017 was $247.6 million, compared to $60.8 million provided in 2016. These decreases are primarily driven by higher inventory; higher payments for interest, restructuring, acquisition and integration costs related to the EA Integration Program and permanent displays; as well as higher capital expenditures. Partially offsetting this were favorable changes in accounts payable and lower payments for income taxes and incentive compensation.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had drawn $157 million on its Revolving Credit Facility and had $280.1 million of liquidity, consisting of $87.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $193 million in available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has continued to repatriate cash to the U.S. using tax-effective methods as part of continuing to effectively manage its working capital needs.\nFull Year 2017 Results\n(USD millions, except per share data) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 As Reported Adjusted As\nReported\nAdjusted As\nReported\nAdjusted Pro Forma\nAdjusted % Change % Change Pro Forma %\nChange\nNet Sales $ 2,693.7 $ 2,693.7 $ 2,334.0 $ 2,334.0 $ 2,858.9 15.4 % 15.4 % (5.8 )% Gross Profit 1,542.4 1,560.8 1,416.9 1,437.9 1,709.7 8.9 % 8.5 % (8.7 )% Gross Margin 57.3 % 57.9 % 60.7 % 61.6 % 59.8 % -340bps -370bps -190bps Operating (loss) income $ (22.3 ) $ 96.2 $ 155.3 $ 285.7 $ 239.5 (114.4 )% (66.3 )% (59.8 )% Adjusted EBITDA 258.8 415.3 405.3 (37.7 )% (36.1 )% Net (loss) income (183.2 ) (101.4 ) (21.9 ) 81.3 (736.5 )% (224.7 )% Diluted (loss) earnings per common share $ (3.48 ) $ (1.93 ) $ (0.42 ) $ 1.55 (728.6 )% (224.5 )% As Reported net sales were $2,693.7 million in 2017, an increase of 15.4% compared to 2016, primarily driven by the inclusion of Elizabeth Arden segment net sales for the full year ended December 31, 2017. On a Pro Forma basis, net sales decreased by 5.8%, or 6.1% XFX, primarily driven by declines in the U.S. mass retail channel.\nAs Reported gross margin was 57.3% in 2017, compared to 60.7% in 2016, a decrease of 340bps. This decrease was primarily driven by the addition of the lower gross margin Elizabeth Arden business acquired in September 2016. On a Pro Forma Adjusted basis, gross margin was 57.9% in 2017, compared to 59.8% in the prior-year period, a decline of 190bps due to higher sales incentives and returns, as well as higher obsolescence, partially offset by the realization of approximately $23 million of pro forma synergies within the Elizabeth Arden segment.\nAs Reported operating loss was $22.3 million in 2017, compared to operating income of $155.3 million in 2016, driven by higher SG&A costs, in addition to higher acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by higher gross profit due to the inclusion of net sales in the Elizabeth Arden segment for the year ended December 31, 2017. On a Pro Forma Adjusted basis, operating income was $96.2 million, compared to Pro Forma Adjusted operating income of $239.5 million in 2016, a result of the drivers of the decline in Pro Forma Adjusted gross margin discussed above and higher SG&A costs, offset by the realization of approximately $69 million of pro forma synergies and cost reductions during 2017.\nAs Reported net loss was $183.2 million in 2017, compared to a net loss of $21.9 million in 2016. This decline was primarily the result of the drivers discussed in As Reported operating loss above and higher interest expense, partially offset by the favorable impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted net loss, which excludes certain Non-Operating Items described in footnote (a), was $101.4 million in 2017, compared to Adjusted net income of $81.3 million in 2016, a $182.7 million decrease, driven by higher SG&A costs and higher interest expense, partially offset by higher gross profit due to the inclusion of the Elizabeth Arden segment for the full year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Results Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call with members of the investment community today, March 15, 2018, at 5:30 P.M. NYC time to discuss 2017 results. Access to the call is available to the public at www.revloninc.com .\nFootnotes to Press Release\n(a) Non-GAAP Financial Measures : Pro Forma Net Sales; EBITDA; Adjusted and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted and Pro Forma Adjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations, before income taxes; Adjusted net (loss) income; Adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per common share; Pro Forma Adjusted operating income; Pro Form Adjusted gross margin; and free cash flow (together, the “Non-GAAP Measures”) are non-GAAP financial measures that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables. Pro Forma financial information assumes the Elizabeth Arden acquisition was completed on January 1, 2016 and its financial results were included for all periods presented.\nThe Company defines EBITDA as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses (the foregoing being the “EBITDA Exclusions”). The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the impact of non-cash stock compensation expense, the EBITDA Exclusions and certain other non-operating items that are not directly attributable to the Company's underlying operating performance (the “Non-Operating Items”). The following table identifies the Non-Operating Items excluded in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for all periods:\n(USD millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Income / (Loss) Adjustments to EBITDA Non-Operating Items: Non-cash stock compensation expense $ 0.9 $ 1.6 Restructuring and related charges 22.2 34.5 Acquisition and integration costs 12.7 3.7 Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program 0.3 0.9 Impairment charge 10.8 23.4 Inventory purchase accounting adjustments, cost of sales — 16.4 Deferred consideration for CBB Acquisition — 0.9 (USD millions) YTD 2017 YTD 2016 YTD 2016\nPro Forma\nAdjusted Income / (Loss) Adjustments to EBITDA Non-Operating Items: Non-cash stock compensation expense $ 6.8 $ 6.4 $ 10.4 Restructuring and related charges 34.5 36.8 45.1 Acquisition and integration costs 52.9 43.2 2.8 Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program 1.1 2.6 2.6 Impairment charge 10.8 23.4 23.4 Inventory purchase accounting adjustments, cost of sales 17.2 20.9 20.9 Deferred consideration for CBB Acquisition 2.0 3.5 3.5 Adjusted net (loss) income and adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per common share exclude the after-tax impact of the Non-Operating Items from As Reported Net Income (loss).\nThe Company excludes the EBITDA Exclusions and Non-Operating Items, as applicable, in calculating the Non-GAAP Measures because the Company's management believes that some of these items may not occur in certain periods, the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period and/or these items do not facilitate an understanding of the Company's underlying operating performance.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow excludes proceeds on sale of discontinued operations. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements, which for the Company are significant.\nThe Company's management uses the Non-GAAP Measures as operating performance measures, and in the case of free cash flow, as a liquidity measure (in conjunction with GAAP financial measures), as an integral part of its reporting and planning processes and to, among other things: (i) monitor and evaluate the performance of the Company's business operations, financial performance and overall liquidity; (ii) facilitate management's internal comparisons of the Company's historical operating performance of its business operations; (iii) facilitate management's external comparisons of the results of its overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels; (iv) review and assess the operating performance of the Company's management team and, together with other operational objectives, as a measure in evaluating employee compensation, including bonuses and other incentive compensation; (v) analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments; and (vi) plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments.\nManagement believes that the Non-GAAP Measures are useful to investors to provide them with disclosures of the Company's operating results on the same basis as that used by management. Management believes that the Non-GAAP Measures provide useful information to investors about the performance of the Company's overall business because such measures eliminate the effects of certain charges that are not directly attributable to the Company's underlying operating performance. Additionally, management believes that providing the Non-GAAP Measures enhances the comparability for investors in assessing the Company’s financial reporting. Management believes that free cash flow is useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service and other strategic measures, after making necessary capital investments in property and equipment to support the Company's ongoing business operations, and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that the presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, are useful financial analytical measures that are used by management, as described above, and therefore can assist investors in assessing the Company's financial condition, operating performance and underlying strength. The Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their respective most directly comparable As Reported financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income/loss, operating income, diluted earnings per share or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Other companies may define such non-GAAP measures differently. Also, while EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as used in this release, are defined differently than Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's credit agreements and indentures, certain financial covenants in its borrowing arrangements are tied to similar financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and related footnotes filed with the SEC.\n(b) Segment profit is defined as income from continuing operations for each of the Company's Consumer, Elizabeth Arden, Professional, and Other segments, excluding the EBITDA Exclusions. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the segments' underlying operating performance, including the impact of the Non-Operating Items noted above in footnote (a). Unallocated corporate expenses primarily relate to general and administrative expenses related to the corporate administrative organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses as these items are centrally directed and controlled. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales.
