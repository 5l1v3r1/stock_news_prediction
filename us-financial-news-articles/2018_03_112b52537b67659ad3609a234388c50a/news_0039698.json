Members of Congress from both parties have questioned a drawdown of personnel there by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe Army Corps stepped in after Hurricane Maria struck in September . It hired two contractors, Fluor Corp. and PowerSecure Inc., to spearhead reconstruction of damaged transmission and distribution lines. The companies are now demobilizing workers as those federal contracts reach their limits .\nFluor and PowerSecure had 1,141 contract workers in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, down from more than 4,000 during much of February, according to tweets from the official Army Corps Twitter account.\nRelated\nPuerto Rico Contract Spending Accelerates With Army Corps Exit Fluor Winds Down Work on Puerto Rico Grid Federal Judge Approves $300 Million Loan for Prepa Yet electricity woes continue to plague Puerto Rico, where nearly 100,000 customers, on an island of more than three million, still lack service. Nearly all power generation is back online, but the grid system is prone to sudden outages. Gaps in the above-ground transmission system mean electricity isn’t reaching some rugged, mountainous regions.\nThe remaining repair work is poised to fall largely to the island’s bankrupt public power monopoly, known as Prepa , after Fluor stopped working Monday under its $749 million contract . PowerSecure’s $200 million contract runs out April 7, a company spokesman said.\nAn Army Corps spokesman said it “would do all possible work with the funds available” before the contractors leave. But documents compiled by Prepa and people familiar with the matter suggest a series of problems stemming from supply bottlenecks have hindered the agency’s power restoration efforts.\nConstruction materials like concrete poles, transformers and conductors were in short supply, and the Army Corps struggled to purchase and transport materials quickly enough, people involved in the work said. Linemen scrounged for replacement parts but were sometimes unable to complete assigned tasks, swelling labor costs, the people said.\nThe Army Corps acknowledged the supply shortages and said natural disasters last year in Texas, Florida and California strained supplies of construction materials across the U.S. A Prepa spokesman declined to comment, referring questions to the Army Corps.\nA man with a sign reading “Catano Without Electricity,” during a protest earlier this year demanding that authorities fix Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.

A House committee supervising Puerto Rico is now probing if materials were improperly stockpiled during the emergency.\nAn Army Corps spokesman said Fluor was authorized to purchase needed supplies while the Army Corps was responsible for filling supply shortfalls “as well as expediting the delivery and distribution of those supplies.” But a Fluor spokesman said the Army Corps was charged with supplying materials.\nFluor said its work in Puerto Rico turned the lights back on for more than a quarter-million customers and injected $185 million into the island economy through hiring of local workers, suppliers and subcontractors.\nElectrical workers repair distribution lines damaged by Hurricane Maria, in San Juan, in October 2017.

Prepa reported last week that 32% of the 755 towers and poles that were downed in the hurricane still aren’t repaired. Of 1,238 damaged conductors and insulators, 28% weren’t finished.\n“The average citizen on the street in those communities cannot tolerate even the perception that at this point we will begin to wind down the urgent relief mission and that the process of finishing the job will slow down,” Rep. Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s Republican delegate to Congress, wrote in a letter to Army Corps officials last week.\nMichael Byrne, the federal coordinating officer for the hurricane response, testified Thursday that the remaining work would be the most difficult.\n“It’s like working on a car engine,” he said. “You could bring in lots more mechanics but you can get only so many hands into the vehicle at one time.”\nThe Army Corps said Wednesday it was “on track with its contribution to the goal” of restoring power to 95% of Prepa customers by the end of the month. The final 5% could take until late May, it said.\nWrite to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-4418?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4418?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4424?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4424?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4418?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4418?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4424?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4418?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4424?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4424?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4424?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4418?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-03-23T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T01:56:41.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
