(NYSE: FF) (“FutureFuel”), a manufacturer of custom and performance chemicals and biofuels, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights (all comparisons are with the fourth quarter of 2016)\nRevenues were $75.3 million, up 8.5% from $69.4 million Adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 million, down 51.9% from $18.9 million Net income decreased to $15.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, from $18.7 million, or $0.43 per diluted share.\n2017 Financial Highlights (all comparisons are with the year ended December 31, 2016)\nRevenues were $275.0 million, up 8.6% from $253.2 million Adjusted EBITDA was $26.4 million, down 52.3% from $55.3 million Net income decreased to $23.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, from $56.3 million, or $1.29 per diluted share.\n“We achieved strong year-on-year revenue growth and I am particularly pleased to see that occur in each of our chemicals and biofuels segments. We are now well positioned to capture a greater share of value in both the energy and agro-chemical markets where we saw continued recovery through 2017.\nIn our biofuels segment, we operated prudently amidst the volatility caused by the absence of the blenders' tax credit. We welcome its belated reinstatement for 2017 and would urge Congress to address a long-term extension to this program for 2018 and beyond that will incentivize further investment in our industry. The counterveiling and anti-dumping duties levied on biodiesel imports from Argentina and Indonesia in mid-2017 was also a very positive move that substantially levels the playing field for US domestic manufacturers.\" said Tom McKinlay, Chief Operating Officer for FutureFuel Corp.\nSubsequent Event\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 was passed by Congress and signed into law on February 9, 2018, retroactively reinstating the blenders tax credit for 2017. As this act was passed into law in 2018, FutureFuel will recognize the pretax benefit of $28.9 million in the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 Regular Cash Dividends\nFutureFuel declared normal quarterly dividends of $0.06 per share for 2018.\nThree months ended December 31: Dollar % 2017 2016 Change Change Revenues $ 75,261 $ 69,373 $ 5,888 8.5 % Income from operations $ 3,838 $ 14,777 $ (10,939 ) (73.6 %) Net income $ 15,947 $ 18,680 $ (2,733 ) (14.4 %) Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ (0.07 ) (16.3 %) Diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.43 $ (0.07 ) (16.3 %) Capital expenditures and intangibles (net of customer reimbursements and regulatory grants) $ 993 $ 2,088 $ (1,095 ) (52.4 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,152 $ 18,933 $ (9,781 ) (51.9 %) Twelve months ended December 31: Dollar % 2017 2016 Change Change Revenues $ 275,026 $ 253,193 $ 21,833 8.6 % Income from operations $ 9,887 $ 36,523 $ (26,636 ) (72.9 %) Net income $ 23,511 $ 56,341 $ (32,830 ) (58.3 %) Earnings per common share: Basic $ 0.54 $ 1.29 $ (0.75 ) (58.3 %) Diluted $ 0.54 $ 1.29 $ (0.75 ) (58.3 %) Capital expenditures and intangibles (net of customer reimbursements and regulatory grants) $ 3,406 $ 4,223 $ (817 ) (19.0 %) Adjusted EBITDA $ 26,353 $ 55,261 $ (28,908 ) (52.3 %) Financial and operating metrics, which include non-GAAP financial measures, include dollars in thousands, except per share amounts:\nFutureFuel Corp.\nCertain Financial and Operating Metrics\n(Unaudited)\n2017 Financial and Business Summary\nSales revenue increased 8.6% or $21,833 in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase primarily resulted from higher selling prices in the biofuel and chemical segments and increased chemical sales volumes primarily from the improved conditions in the agrochemical and energy markets. The biofuels segment suffered from lower sales volumes largely from the expiration of the federal blenders’ tax credit (“BTC”).\nChemical sales revenue increased 4.4% or $4,479 in 2017 compared with 2016. Sales revenue for our custom chemicals product line (chemicals produced for specific customers) totaled $87,905, an increase of $5,238 from 2016. This increase was primarily attributed to increased sales prices and volumes in the agrochemical and energy markets, new customer product sales, and increased amortization of deferred revenue which were partially offset by reduced in sales volumes and price of our laundry detergent additive. Our contract for sales of the laundry detergent additive expires December 31, 2018 (unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement, as amended). We continue to pursue other customers for this product. Performance chemicals revenue (comprised of multi-customer products which are sold based on specification) was $17,481 in 2017, a decrease of $759 from 2016. This decrease was primarily from reduced sales volumes of our polymer modifier products and specialty additives.\nBiofuels sales revenue increased 11.4% or $17,354 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily from increased sales prices of biodiesel, biodiesel blends, and RINs. The sale of separated, internally generated RINs, comprised a larger component of revenue in 2017 as compared to 2016. Partially offsetting this increase was reduced sales volumes of biodiesel and biodiesel blends and less common carrier pipeline sales. Pipeline sales totaled $2,175 compared to $9,018 in 2016. Sales volumes of biodiesel, biodiesel blends, and diesel were down given the unfavorable market (without the BTC credit as compared to 2016 which had the credit in effect all year).\nFutureFuel reported net income of $23,511, or $0.54 per diluted share, for 2017, compared with net income of $56,341, or $1.29 per diluted share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 totaled $26,353, down from $55,261 in 2016. A one-time tax benefit of $12,066 was recognized in 2017 resulting from the enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This benefit was due to an anticipated lower tax rate for future reversals of deferred tax liabilities.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures and intangibles were $3,581 in 2017, compared with $4,495 in 2016. FutureFuel was reimbursed for a portion of these expenditures by certain customers as summarized in the following table.\n(Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 Cash paid for capital expenditures and intangibles $ 3,581 $ 4,495 Cash received as reimbursement of capital expenditures $ (175 ) $ (272 ) Cash paid, net of reimbursement, for capital expenditures $ 3,406 $ 4,223 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $235,326 as of December 31, 2017, compared with $305,418 as of December 31, 2016. The majority of the decrease in cash in the first nine months of 2017 was attributed to a special cash dividend of $100,188 that was paid on January 13, 2017.\nAbout FutureFuel\nFutureFuel is a leading manufacturer of diversified chemical products, specialty chemical products, and biofuel products.

Forward-looking statements deal with FutureFuel’s current plans, intentions, beliefs, and expectations, and statements of future economic performance. Statements containing such terms as “believe,” “do not believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” and other phrases of similar meaning are considered to contain uncertainty and are . In addition, from time to time FutureFuel or its representatives have made or will make orally or in writing. Furthermore, such may be included in various filings that the company makes with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in press releases, or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of FutureFuel’s authorized executive officers.\nThese are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ reflected in these . Factors that might cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in FutureFuel’s Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in its future filings made with the SEC. An investor should not place undue reliance on any contained in this document, which reflect FutureFuel management’s opinions only as of their respective dates. Except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to . The risks and uncertainties described in this document and in current and future filings with the SEC are not the only ones faced by FutureFuel. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the company to predict which will arise. There may be additional risks not presently known to the company or that the company currently believes are immaterial to its business. In addition, FutureFuel cannot assess the impact of each factor on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ contained in any . If any such risks occur, FutureFuel’s business, operating results, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected in an adverse manner. An investor should consult any additional disclosures FutureFuel has made or will make in its reports to the SEC on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and any amendments thereto. All subsequent written and oral attributable to FutureFuel or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this document.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, FutureFuel used adjusted EBITDA as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for operating income, net income, or cash flow from operating activities (each as determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. FutureFuel defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses, excluding, when applicable, non-cash share-based compensation expense, public offering expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs, purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of property and equipment, gains or losses on derivative instruments, other non-operating income or expense. Information relating to adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same data that management employs in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of FutureFuel’s business. FutureFuel’s calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies; therefore, the results of its calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA allows FutureFuel’s chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of FutureFuel’s business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of its operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, to fund capital expenditures, and to pay dividends. In particular, FutureFuel management believes that adjusted EBITDA permits a comparative assessment of FutureFuel’s operating performance and liquidity, relative to a performance and liquidity based on GAAP results, while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization, which may vary among its operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance, and of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense that varies widely among similar companies, and gains and losses on derivative instruments, whose immediate recognition can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel.\nA table included in this earnings release reconciles adjusted EBITDA with net income, the most directly comparable GAAP performance financial measure, and a table reconciles adjusted EBITDA with cash flows from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP liquidity financial measure.\nFutureFuel Corp.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Dollars in thousands)\n(Audited) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 114,627 $ 199,272 Accounts receivable, inclusive of the blenders' tax credit of $0 and $5,495 and net of allowances for bad debt of $0 and $0, at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively 22,138 24,744 Inventory 43,754 52,093 Marketable securities 120,699 106,146 Other current assets 9,140 23,027 Total current assets 310,358 405,282 Property, plant and equipment, net 109,735 118,152 Other assets 5,470 5,609 Total noncurrent assets 115,205 123,761 Total Assets $ 425,563 $ 529,043 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Accounts payable $ 19,579 $ 24,053 Dividends payable 10,498 $ 110,688 Other current liabilities 5,204 9,308 Total current liabilities 35,281 144,049 Deferred revenue – long-term 16,522 16,792 Other noncurrent liabilities 22,164 35,389 Total noncurrent liabilities 38,686 52,181 Total liabilities 73,967 196,230 Commitments and contingencies: Preferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 5,000,000 shares authorized, none issued and outstanding -
