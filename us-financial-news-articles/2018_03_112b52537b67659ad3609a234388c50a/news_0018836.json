It said it would work to reduce its cobalt stockpile soon.\n“The forthcoming shift in favour of more nickel-intensive technologies in battery cathode material alongside the growing share of electric vehicles ... should drive up strongly the demand for Class 1 nickel products towards 2025,” it said.\nIt made the comments in its financial statement for 2017, in which the firm reported 2 percent growth in its core earnings in 2017 thanks to higher prices for its metals.\nIts shares dipped 0.3 percent in line with the broader MICEX index, as investors remained focussed on conflict between Nornickel’s biggest shareholders, Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin and aluminium producer Rusal.\nThe dispute partly revolves around whether the firm should deliver a big dividend or focus on robust capital spending.\nThe company said on Tuesday its board would issue a recommendation for its final dividend for 2017 in April or May\nThe firm’s 2018 capital expenditure is set at $2 billion and it continues to consider several projects in Russia.\nNornickel is also the world’s top producer of palladium, which is chiefly used in emission-curbing auto catalysts. The metal was Nornickel’s largest revenue generator in 2017 as prices soared on fears of shortages.\nThe company said it did not see any immediate threat to palladium from electric vehicles, forecasting the market deficit to widen to 1.2 million troy ounces this year.\nNornickel said its 2017 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $4.0 billion were held back by several factors, including the accumulation of palladium stock to deliver under 2018 contracts.\nNornickel accumulated the stockpile of more than 500,000 ounces of palladium at the end of 2017, it said, adding that it planned to sell the bulk of that by the end of June to meet the rising demand from its customers.
