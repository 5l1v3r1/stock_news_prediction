She wouldn’t identify attendees except to say that the South Korean delegation would include civilian academics, alongside former government officials. \nSouth Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap news agency reported that Washington’s former ambassador to Seoul, Kathleen Stephens, would attend. Neither Stephens nor the U.S. Embassy in Seoul could be reached immediately for comment. The American officials said that Stephens, who served as the U.S. ambassador in Seoul from 2008 to 2011, wasn’t carrying a message on behalf of the Trump administration or serving as an interlocutor for the State Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T16:21:06.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
