(NASDAQ:FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders, today reported business highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“Initial clinical observations from the investigation of our first-in-class product candidates have established Fate Therapeutics as a leading innovator in the development of next-generation cellular immunotherapies. We look forward to sharing additional clinical data from three ongoing studies of FATE-NK100 and the PROTECT Phase 1 study of ProTmune at upcoming scientific conferences throughout 2018,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “In addition, we are now poised to advance FT500, our first iPSC-derived NK cell cancer immunotherapy, to a landmark IND filing in the first half of 2018. We believe our proprietary iPSC product platform, which we are applying to consistently produce large quantities of uniform, well-characterized NK cells and T cells from clonal master iPSC lines, can transform cell therapy from a single-dose, patient-restricted process to a multi-dose, off-the-shelf product paradigm. Upon clearance of this first IND from our iPSC product platform, we are well positioned to rapidly advance multiple off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapies, including our engineered NK cell and universal CAR T-cell products, into clinical development.”\nClinical Programs – Highlights & Updates\nAnti-Leukemia Activity of FATE-NK100 Observed in VOYAGE Study. In November 2017, initial clinical data of FATE-NK100, a first-in-class adaptive memory natural killer (NK) cell product, from the ongoing VOYAGE study for the treatment of refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting. At two weeks following a single intravenous infusion of FATE-NK100, the subject in the first dose cohort showed nearly a 50% reduction in leukemic blasts and the subject in the second dose cohort achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state based on bone marrow biopsy.No dose limiting toxicities were reported. Advanced FATE-NK100 through First Two Dose Cohorts of APOLLO Study. In December 2017, the APOLLO study of FATE-NK100 was initiated for the treatment of women with ovarian cancer that is resistant to, or recurrent on, platinum-based treatment. FATE-NK100 has advanced through the first two dose cohorts with no reports of dose limiting toxicities. The Company expects to release initial clinical data from the ongoing APOLLO study at the 3 rd Innate Killer Summit (March 27-29, San Diego). Reported Day 100 Clinical Data from Phase 1 Stage of PROTECT Study of ProTmune™ . In December 2017, initial clinical data of ProTmune, a next-generation hematopoietic cell graft, were presented at the 59 th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. During the first 100 days following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), all seven subjects receiving ProTmune in the Phase 1 stage of the PROTECT study for the treatment of hematologic malignancies remained alive and relapse-free. Three subjects experienced acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) during the first 100 days following HCT, all of whom responded to standard-of-care steroid treatment. There were no ProTmune-related serious adverse events reported by investigators.\nPreclinical Programs – Highlights & Updates\nInitiated IND-enabling Manufacture of FT500 iPSC-derived NK Cell Cancer Immunotherapy. Clinical-scale production of FT500, a first-of-kind, off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line, commenced at Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics, a state-of-the-art, FDA-registered Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) facility. The Company is currently preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for FT500 for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2018. The Company plans to clinically investigate multiple dosing cycles of FT500 in combination with FDA-approved checkpoint inhibitor therapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Presented Preclinical Data for FT819 iPSC-derived CAR19 T-Cell Cancer Immunotherapy . In December 2017, scientists from the laboratories of Michel Sadelain, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Center for Cell Engineering, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Fate Therapeutics presented at ASH the generation of iPSC-derived, anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-targeted, TCR-null CD8αβ + T cells. The universal T cells were derived from a single iPSC engineered to completely eliminate T-cell receptor (TCR) expression and to insert a CAR targeting CD19 into the T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus. The groundbreaking development enables the renewable production of large quantities of CAR T cells, from a clonal master iPSC line, that are uniformly engineered and are not patient-restricted. In preclinical studies, the collaborators demonstrated that the universal CAR T cells displayed target-specificity and potent anti-tumor activity. Fate Therapeutics is currently advancing FT819, an off-the-shelf CAR19 T-cell product candidate derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered with complete TCR elimination and TRAC-regulated CAR expression. Launched Collaboration with UCSD for Development of iPSC-derived CAR NK Cell Cancer Immunotherapies. The multi-year research collaboration with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is being led by Dan S. Kaufman, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine in the Division of Regenerative Medicine and Director of Cell Therapy. Dr. Kaufman and Fate Therapeutics have developed a novel CAR construct specifically designed to enhance NK cell activation and persistence that is comprised of a NKG2D transmembrane domain, a 2B4 co-stimulatory domain and a CD3ζ signaling domain. Preclinical data presented at ASH demonstrated that a single dose of these iPSC-derived CAR NK cells markedly inhibited tumor growth and significantly enhanced survival as compared to iPSC-derived CAR NK cells containing a construct commonly used in T cells.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nCash & Short-term Investment Position: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 were $100.9 million compared to $92.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $43.2 million in net cash proceeds received by the Company from its December 2017 public offering of common stock and $7.5 million in net cash proceeds received by the Company in July 2017 in connection with the amendment of its loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. These proceeds were offset by the Company’s use of cash to fund operating activities and to service principal and interest obligations under its loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. Total Revenue: Revenue was $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as for the comparable period in 2016. All revenue was derived from the Company’s research collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics. Total Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses were $13.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $8.7 million for the comparable period in 2016.

Higher frequencies of CD57+ NK cells in the peripheral blood or tumor microenvironment in cancer patients have been linked to better clinical outcomes. In August 2017, non-clinical data describing the unique properties and anti-tumor activity of FATE-NK100 were published by Cancer Research (doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0799), a peer-reviewed journal of the American Association of Cancer Research. Three clinical trials of FATE-NK100 are currently being conducted: VOYAGE for the treatment of refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia; APOLLO for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer; and DIMENSION for the treatment of advanced solid tumors, including in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy.\nAbout ProTmune™\nProTmune™ is an investigational next-generation hematopoietic cell graft for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). ProTmune is manufactured by pharmacologically modulating a donor-sourced, mobilized peripheral blood graft ex vivo with two small molecules (FT1050 and FT4145) to decrease the incidence and severity of acute GvHD while maintaining the anti-leukemia activity of the graft. ProTmune has been granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation by the European Commission. ProTmune is currently being investigated in a randomized, controlled and double-blinded Phase 2 clinical trial in adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing matched unrelated donor HCT.\nAbout Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC Product Platform\nThe Company’s proprietary induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) product platform enables large-scale generation of off-the-shelf, engineered, homogeneous cell products that can be administered in repeat doses to mediate more effective pharmacologic activity, including in combination with cycles of other cancer treatments. Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event, and selecting a single iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for consistently and repeatedly manufacturing homogeneous cell products in quantities that support the treatment of many thousands of patients in an off-the-shelf manner. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 90 issued patents and 100 pending patent applications.\nAbout Fate Therapeutics, Inc.\nFate Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders.
