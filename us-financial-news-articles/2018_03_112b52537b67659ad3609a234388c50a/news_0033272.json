BlackBerry decided in 2016 to stop making its own smartphones.\nShareholders had accused BlackBerry of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013.\nThe amended complaint was based in part on information from the 2015 prosecution of James Dunham, a former chief operating officer at the retailer Wireless Zone.\nThat case revealed how an April 2013 report by Detwiler Fenton showing a high return rate for the BlackBerry 10 was based on data sold by Dunham from some 400 Wireless Zone stores.\nDunham pleaded guilty to selling confidential wireless industry information and was sentenced to five months in prison.\nMcMahon said the plaintiffs have made a \"plausible showing\" that BlackBerry's public response to the Detwiler report, including that customers were \"satisfied\" and return rates were \"at or below our forecasts and right in line with the industry,\" contradicted data it allegedly had from Wireless Zone.\nShe said she would address later the merits of BlackBerry's arguments that its statements were not misleading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T15:53:50.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
