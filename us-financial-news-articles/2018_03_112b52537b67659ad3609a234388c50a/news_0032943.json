As a result, regulators have decided to force banks to take fewer lending risks.\nNational Australia Bank CEO Andrew Thorburn said this had been the right approach. \"What we have seen is the banks and the regulators slow down housing creditor, it's down to about 5 or 6 percent now,\" he said.\n\"That's probably sustainable and I think that's good thing because what it means is we have been able to ease into this,\" Thorburn added, noting a small drop in house prices recently.\nData from CoreLogic, a financial services company, showed Monday that prices in Australia have dropped 1.7 percent this year, after a modest reversal late last year.\nFurthermore, data released this week by Moody's Analytics showed that house prices will continue to fall, with Sydney set to see a correction in prices in the next year, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.\nMeantime, the government should also boost infrastructure and broadband expansion to ensure that house prices continue on their downward trend, Thorburn said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T16:43:05.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
