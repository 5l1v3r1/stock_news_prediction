For ‘extra urgent’ notice like this, you have to act immediately,” said Wu Jian, a Beijing-based analyst.\n“Those who don’t comply in time will immediately be closed down,” Wu said.\nA TV reporter’s theatrical eyeroll during a long-winded question at a Beijing news conference stole the show during China’s annual parliament session last week, exploding on Chinese social media before censors intervened.\nA video of the eyeroll became the source material for many parodies and satirical performances.\nDespite strict censorship, China has a fairly lively online community of bloggers, who frequently respond to breaking events with humorous - and sometimes risqué - sketches and short videos, although they often face their posts being taken down.\nJustXiait, a team of Chinese parody bloggers famous for satirical dubbed-over videos from movies, said in an official microblog post that the group would voluntarily delete all videos “to conduct self-inspection, cleanup and improvement”.\nThe decision is “to make the program more in line with relevant laws and regulations, and to provide audience more interesting and wholesome programs”, it said.\nReporting by Pei Li and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T06:56:21.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
