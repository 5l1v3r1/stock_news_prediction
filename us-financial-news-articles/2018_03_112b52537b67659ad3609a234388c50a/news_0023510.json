Lawyers for both sides said the award was the largest excessive force settlement in the state’s history.\nThe agreement concluded a civil rights lawsuit filed in January 2016 by an administrator for Harris’ estate that accused Bates of unreasonable and excessive use of deadly force and held current and former Tulsa County sheriff’s officials responsible.\n“This settlement ends a long and tumultuous road for the Harris family,” said a statement emailed on Saturday by Daniel Smolen, an attorney for the Harris estate administrator.\nThe incident prompted the suspension of the reserve deputy program, a grand jury investigation of the sheriff’s department, and the resignation of the sheriff at the time, Stanley Glanz.\nScott Wood, the lawyer representing current and former sheriff’s officials in the case, said the new sheriff, Vic Regalado, had been anxious to put this matter behind him.\n“And not just him, the department as well,” Wood said by telephone on Saturday.\nBates, who is in his 70s, had been on patrol with other deputies during a sting operation targeting illegal guns when he shot Harris, 44, who was on the ground.\nIn video played during Bates’ trial, a deputy is shown subduing Harris and Bates is heard saying “Taser, Taser.” There is a gunshot, then Bates is heard saying “Oh, I shot him. I’m sorry.” Harris died later at a Tulsa hospital.\nWood said the county’s reserve deputy program has been restored with more stringent controls and procedures, including that reservists now ride with full-time deputies.\nReporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Editing by Daniel Wallis and XX\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T22:45:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
