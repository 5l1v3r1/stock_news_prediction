(“MetLife” or the “Company”) (NYSE:MET) and certain of its officers.

Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) MetLife’s practices and procedures used to estimate its reserves set aside for annuity and pension payments were inadequate; (2) MetLife had inadequate internal controls over financial reporting; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ statements about MetLife’s business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.\nOn December 15, 2017, during aftermarket hours, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), announcing that the Company had been unable to locate some of the Company’s annuitant population and planned to provide an update upon the filing of MetLife’s Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “MetLife Discloses Failure to Pay Thousands of Workers’ Pensions” which discussed the extent and duration of MetLife’s failure to pay pension benefits.\nOn this news, shares of MetLife fell $0.62 per share, or over 1.2%, over the following two trading days to close at $50.79 per share on December 19, 2017, damaging investors.\nOn January 29, 2018, MetLife issued a press release entitled “MetLife Preannounces Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings, Reschedules Earnings Release and Conference Call”, which announced that MetLife would reschedule its earnings releases and conference calls for the fourth quarter of and full year 2017, that the Company had identified material weaknesses in its internal controls, that the Company would have to revise certain of its prior financial statements, and that the SEC and New York Department of Financial Services had made inquiries to MetLife with respect to the foregoing issues.\nOn this news, shares of MetLife fell $6.28 per share or over 11.6% over the next two trading days to close at $47.67 per share on January 31, 2018, damaging investors.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
