The Foods & Refreshment division will be based in Rotterdam.\nUnilever said its 7,300 staff in the United Kingdom will be unaffected and it will continue to be listed in London, Amsterdam and New York.\nUnilever said last year that collapsing into a single entity would benefit the company and shareholders, partly by facilitating big-ticket M&A deals, but it delayed a decision on location amid heightened political sensitivity caused by Brexit.\nUnilever had met with the governments of both countries in the run-up to its decision and the move will be seen as a blow to May's government one year before Britain leaves the European Union.\n\"The board believes the move to three divisions and the simplification of our corporate structure will create a simpler, more agile and more focused company with increased strategic flexibility for value-creating portfolio change,\" said Marijn Dekkers, Chairman of Unilever.\nThe British government said Unilever's decision was not linked to Brexit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T10:27:26.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
