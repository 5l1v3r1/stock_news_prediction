We in the European Union have therefore adopted an unequivocal position and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the United Kingdom,” Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement.\nGiving the diplomats seven days to leave, Maas said the Russian government had not answered any of the unresolved questions around the attack and had shown no willingness to play a constructive role in clarifying the circumstances around it.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber and Riham Alkousaa, editing by Thomas Escritt and Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:48:53.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
