Another witness said he saw a long stream of light followed by additional explosions.\nIn al-Malqa neighborhood, emergency personnel gathered near a crater in the ground and inspected shattered glass in nearby homes.\nThe United States, which provides support to the coalition, said in a State Department statement it condemned the missile attacks and backed the right of Saudi Arabia to defend itself against such threats.\nThe attack marked the third time in five months that missiles have flown over Riyadh, as the Houthis step up efforts to demonstrate they can reach the Saudi capital, and threatened to escalate a regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nPeople check the damage after debris from ballistic missiles fired by Yemen's Houthi militia fell onto a house in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser The Houthi-run SABA news agency reported the group’s missile force had targeted King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with a Burkan H2 missile.\nThe group also fired other types of missiles at airports in Jizan, Najran and Abha, another southern Saudi city, according to the SABA report.\nSlideshow (4 Images) The Saudi-led coalition of Gulf Arab states launched military operations against the Houthis in Yemen in March 2015, after the Iran-aligned Shi’ite militia seized the Yemeni capital Sanaa and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi to flee.\nRiyadh saw the ouster as a regional power grab by arch-foe Iran, although the Houthis deny any help from Tehran, and has described Iran’s alleged supply of rockets to the Houthis as “direct military aggression.”\nThe United States has also displayed what it said were Iranian-made weapons supplied to the Houthis, calling them conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.\nThe conflict in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 2 million, unleashing a humanitarian crisis in the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country. Nearly 1 million people have been infected with cholera.\nCoalition forces have made modest territorial gains over the course of the war but appear far from seizing back the capital.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch, Marwa Rashad, Mostafa Hashem and Stephen Kalin; Additional reporting by Makini Brice in Washington; Writing by Katie Paul; Editing by Grant McCool and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T00:15:13.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
