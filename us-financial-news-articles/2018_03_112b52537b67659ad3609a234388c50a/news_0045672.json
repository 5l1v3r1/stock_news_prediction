The index ended the year up nearly 20 percent, its best annual performance since 2012.\nBut after a violent selloff - prompted by fears of U.S. inflation - wiped over $4 trillion in global stock market capitalization earlier this year, the president’s Twitter feed has gone quiet on the subject: the second-longest spell without a tweet about the market since his election.\nTrump’s last tweet on the market came shortly after the shakeout, warning investors they were making a “big mistake” for selling stocks despite “good news” about the economy. The S&P 500 and global stocks have struggled to recover since the rout in early February.\nThat development, investors say, is due to fears of a global trade war erupting on the back of tariffs and talk of further protectionist measures from the U.S. administration. Trump himself has tweeted, saying trade wars are “good”, and “easy to win.”\n“For a person who’s been obsessed with stock market gains since his election victory 16 months ago, Trump doesn’t appear too concerned about the impact his tariffs are having at the moment,” wrote Craig Erlam, market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.\nThe added factor of the successive departures of Trump’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is causing investors to consider whether there has been a definitive turn in the U.S. administration’s priorities. Cohn and Tillerson were widely viewed as moderates on issues of trade and foreign policy.\nReporting by Ritvik Carvalho; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:47:32.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
