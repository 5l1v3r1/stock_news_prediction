Further, while monthly Model 3 deliveries are showing sequential improvement, we estimate that they will fall well short of consensus expectations,\" Tamberrino wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"We continue to expect a slow ramp for the Model 3, and maintain our Sell rating as we expect shares to de-rate as targets are potentially pushed further out.\"\nTesla shares declined 2.4 percent Monday.\nTamberrino reaffirmed his first-quarter Model 3 delivery estimate of 7,000 versus the Wall Street average of 13,800 after his analysis of vehicle registration data.\n\"We maintain that the Model 3 ramp will be below company expectations (albeit improved from Model S/X ramps), and note that incremental production issues may continue to appear as the company looks to ramp mass manufacturing along the chassis, body, and final assembly lines,\" he wrote.\nThe analyst reiterated his $205 six-month price target for Telsa shares, representing 36 percent downside to Friday's close.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T17:23:59.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
