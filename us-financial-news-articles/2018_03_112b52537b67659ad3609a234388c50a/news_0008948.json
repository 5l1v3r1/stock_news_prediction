(\"Stina\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: SQA ) (OTCQB: STNUF) (Frankfurt: 01X) is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Brian Ricker as President and CEO of Jet Power and Controls Ltd. (\"Jet Power\").\nBrian's focus will be to integrate Jet Power's technology with the Gildemeister vanadium redox flow battery (\"VRB\") and expand operations throughout North America. Jet Power will not only continue to serve and expand its existing client base with its electrical products, but also now provide products and services for storage batteries. \"Battery storage of electricity is fast becoming one of the most important aspects of grid, micro grid, diesel replacement and green energy storage from wind and solar\", stated Brian Stecyk, President and CEO of Stina.\nMr. Ricker brings over 30 years of business experience in the electrical industry, including 15 years in senior management roles. He recently left Eaton Corporation (a multi-national power management company) where he was responsible for managing domestic and international projects in the engineered equipment space.\n\"Jet Power offered me the opportunity and challenge of building a company with similar products to Eaton, but with greater upside, given the fast growing energy storage industry. I was also attracted by Stina's vision and its goal of becoming a fully integrated producer of vanadium, vanadium electrolyte and VRBs. The equipment manufactured by Jet Power will complement the design, production and installation of Gildemeister VRBs. This growing industry is especially exciting given the increase in renewable energy worldwide and I am keen to have the opportunity to contribute to Jet Power's success,\" Brian Ricker stated.\n\"The existing team at Jet Power is looking forward to working with our new President and CEO,\" stated Jet co-founders David and Devon Sandford. \"We feel very fortunate to have attracted someone of Brian's reputation and caliber as the new leader of Jet Power. He brings critical experience and a track record in power management that we believe will take Stina into its next phase of high growth.\"\nOn February 28, 2018 Stina announced that it had acquired Jet Power, a leading-edge provider of custom and off-the-shelf electrical equipment and systems. It has been providing innovative and high quality products for over ten years to heavy power users, pipeline companies, refineries, manufacturers, municipalities and infrastructure providers. It offers a \"one stop shop\" to its customers in terms of complete turnkey engineering & electrical solutions and equipment. Its key products include electrical switchgear, motor control switchers, and solar power inverters.
