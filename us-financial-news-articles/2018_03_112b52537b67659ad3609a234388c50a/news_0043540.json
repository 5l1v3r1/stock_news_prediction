(NASDAQ:RELV), a maker of nutritional supplements that promote optimal health, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nFourth-Quarter Results\nReliv reported net sales of $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with net sales of $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. net sales decreased by 8.5 percent for the quarter compared with the same quarter in 2016. Net sales outside of the United States increased by 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter.\nReliv reported a net loss of $382,000, or loss of $0.21 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a net income of $272,000, or earnings of $0.15 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $141,000 compared to $275,000 in the same period in 2016. The impact to operations from the decrease in fourth quarter 2017 net sales was partially offset by a reduction in selling, general and administrative (“SGA”) expenses. SGA expenses decreased to $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income tax expense was $517,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily the result of non-cash adjustments to our deferred tax assets, including a $509,000 valuation allowance recorded against the value of net operating loss carryforwards in our European subsidiary.\nFull-Year Results\nReliv reported net sales of $41.8 million for 2017 compared with net sales of $45.5 million in 2016. U.S. net sales decreased to $32.5 million from $35.6 million, a decline of 8.8 percent.\nNet sales in Reliv’s foreign markets for 2017 decreased 6.1 percent compared with net sales for 2016, with 3.4 percent of the decline due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation as the result of a stronger U.S. dollar in certain markets. The decline in net sales in Europe represented a significant portion of the decrease in foreign sales. Net sales in Europe declined by 16.6 percent in 2017 compared to the prior year, with 4.3 percent of the decline due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. Sales in Asia increased by 39.7 percent in 2017 compared to the prior year.\nThe net loss for 2017 was $697,000 (loss per diluted share of $0.38) compared to a net loss of $625,000 (loss per diluted share of $0.34) in 2016. The loss from operations for 2017 was $183,000 compared to a loss from operations of $812,000 in 2016. SGA expenses were $17.9 million versus $20.2 million in 2016, as the continuing effect of a cost reduction program implemented in mid-2016 helped offset the impact of the sales decline. Income tax expense for 2017 was $545,000 compared to $9,000 in 2016, primarily the result of the deferred tax adjustments discussed in the fourth-quarter results.\n“While our results from operations improved in 2017 when compared to 2016, we remain focused on growing sales through new product and business development by providing additional tools and support with programs to attract new distributors and customers,” said Ryan A. Montgomery, President.\n“In mid-April, we are introducing an additional whey-based version of our flagship NOW product. This new version is in response to consumer trends and offers an alternative to those that prefer a whey protein based product,” commented Montgomery.\nOther distributor/customer recruitment programs include continued free ground shipping for new distributors reaching the Quick Start and Master Affiliate business levels, an additional 10 percent discount on autoship orders placed by Preferred Customers, and a free product credit to distributors for enrolling three new Preferred Customers with a minimum order amount.\nAdditionally, a new mobile app is in development for launch in April that will allow distributors to perform most of their key sales and recruiting functions via a smartphone or tablet, including enrollment of new distributors and customers, placing orders and tracking downline organizational activity.\n“Lastly, our Fit3 TM program continues to grow in popularity throughout the Reliv distributor base. It’s not just about the Fit3 products, it’s also a fitness and lifestyle transformation,” stated Montgomery.\nReliv had cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $3.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $157,000 in 2017 compared to $1.5 million of cash generated from operations in the prior-year period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Reliv had 33,620 Distributors and Preferred Customers – a decrease of 12.6 percent from December 31, 2016 – of which 3,910 are Master Affiliate level and above. The number of Master Affiliates decreased by 26.5 percent compared to the year-ago total. Master Affiliate is the level at which Distributors are eligible to earn generation royalties. With the formal introduction of the Preferred Customer program in the United States and Canada in February 2016, Reliv now includes Preferred Customers as part of Active Distributor statistics.\nAbout Reliv International, Inc.\nReliv International, based in Chesterfield, MO, produces nutritional supplements that promote optimal nutrition.
