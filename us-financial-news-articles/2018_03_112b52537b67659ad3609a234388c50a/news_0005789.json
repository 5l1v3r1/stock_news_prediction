IPF, which provides small personal loans to borrowers in Europe and Mexico, said pretax profit rose to 105.6 million pounds ($145.27 million) in 2017, from 96 million pounds a year earlier. The consumer credit lender said it expected its digital arm to continue to grow strongly and improve performance as sales increase and impairments reduce. However, it backed away from its target of the unit delivering its maiden profit in 2018 citing the impact of new accounting regulations. “Under the new standard IFRS 9, the timing of impairment and therefore profit recognition, particularly in our new markets which are growing strongly, will be negatively impacted,” IPF said in a statement. The company said more stringent creditworthiness assessments introduced in Romania last year were likely to reduce the volume of loans it was allowed to provide to customers in that country. IPF said it continued to engage with the Polish government over the country’s proposal to reduce the existing non-interest pricing cap to encourage a “more positive” outcome for consumers and credit providers such as itself.
