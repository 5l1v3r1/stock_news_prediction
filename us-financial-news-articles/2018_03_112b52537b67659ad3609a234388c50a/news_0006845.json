(NYSE: GEF, GEF.B), a world leader in industrial packaging products and services, today announced first quarter 2018 results.\nFirst Quarter Highlights include (all results compared to the first quarter of 2017 unless otherwise noted):\nNet sales increased by $84.8 million to $905.7 million. Gross profit increased by $8.4 million to $171.7 million. Operating profit decreased by $0.1 million to $65.5 million and operating profit before special items 1 increased by $1.4 million to $68.1 million. Income tax expense decreased from $11.8 million to a benefit of $15.6 million. The results for the three months ended January 31, 2018 included a provisional net tax benefit of $29.1 million related to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Reform Act\"). Please see the Tax Summary section of this release for further discussion of tax changes. Net income of $56.5 million or $0.96 per diluted Class A share compared to net income of $5.4 million or $0.10 per diluted Class A share. Net income, excluding the impact of special items, of $28.8 million or $0.49 per diluted Class A share compared to net income, excluding the impact of special items, of $26.4 million or $0.45 per diluted Class A share. Cash used in operating activities increased by $9.6 million to $53.7 million. Free cash flow 2 decreased by $16.3 million to a use of $81.7 million.\n“Greif delivered improved year over year results during the fiscal first quarter, but our performance fell below our expectations,” said Greif’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Pete Watson. “Sales, operating profit before special items and earnings each increased versus the prior year quarter, but were negatively impacted by weaker than anticipated Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services volumes in December caused by a temporary winter slowdown. In addition, raw material costs continued to accelerate, outpacing price adjustment mechanisms in that segment, and we experienced increased transportation costs across our global network. Despite these challenges, we achieved a positive January performance and Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services volumes have rebounded. We remain extremely confident in achieving our Fiscal 2018 guidance.”\n(1) A summary of all special items that are excluded from operating profit before special items, from net income before special items, and from earnings per diluted Class A share before special items is set forth in the Selected Financial Highlights table following the Company Outlook in this release. (2) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of properties, plants and equipment. Note: A reconciliation of the differences between all non-GAAP financial measures used in this release with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the financial schedules that are a part of this release. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with our financial results. They should not be considered an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of this financial information should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures.\nCustomer Service\nDuring the quarter, each of our three business segments with manufacturing operations - Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services (RIPS), Paper Packaging & Services (PPS) and Flexible Products & Services (FPS) - reported year over year CSI 3 improvements, with the largest in FPS, which generated a 27% improvement versus the prior year quarter. Our expectation is the each business segment delivers CSI at a 95 score or better.\nWe also finalized our fifth NPS 4 survey during the quarter and received a consolidated Greif score of 47, which is flat compared to the previous surveys results. Our aspiration is to achieve a score of 55 over time. We continue to leverage the increased customer interactions that accompany each survey as they lead to additional actions with our customers and ultimately better strategic insight into their businesses.\nSegment Results (all results compared to the first quarter of 2017 unless otherwise noted)\nNet sales are impacted mainly by the volume of primary products 5 sold, selling prices, product mix and the impact of changes in foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar. The table below shows the percentage impact of each of these items on net sales for our primary products, for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 for the business segments with manufacturing operations:\nRigid Industrial Packaging & Paper Packaging & Flexible Products Net Sales Impact - Primary Products\nServices Services & Services % % % Currency Translation 4.7 % — 9.1 % Volume (1.4 )% 1.2 % 2.3 % Selling Prices and Product Mix 7.5 % 10.1 % 3.0 % Total Impact of Primary Products 10.8 % 11.3 % 14.4 % Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services\nNet sales increased by $53.9 million to $615.4 million. Net sales excluding foreign currency translation increased by $29.1 million due primarily to a 7.5 percent increase in selling prices on our primary products as a result of strategic pricing decisions and increases in index prices.\nGross profit decreased by $2.0 million to $110.4 million. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the continuation of rapidly rising raw material costs, the timing of contractual pass through arrangements, a temporary winter slowdown and an increase in transportation costs of $2.5 million.\nOperating profit decreased by $11.6 million to $31.2 million. Operating profit before special items decreased by $8.7 million to $34.7 million, due primarily to the same factors that impacted gross profit and an increase in this segment's selling, general & administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses.\nPaper Packaging & Services\nNet sales increased by $20.9 million to $203.8 million. The increase was due primarily to an increase in selling prices due to increases in published containerboard pricing and increased sales of specialty products.\nGross profit increased by $8.0 million to $43.3 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher containerboard prices and lower old corrugated container input costs, partially offset by an increase in transportation costs of $2.3 million.\nOperating profit increased by $7.9 million to $27.9 million. Operating profit before special items increased by $8.0 million to $27.9 million due to the same factors that impacted gross profit.\nFlexible Products & Services\nNet sales increased by $10.3 million to $80.0 million. Net sales excluding foreign currency translation increased by $4.4 million due to strategic pricing decisions, product mix and higher volumes.\nGross profit increased by $2.1 million to $15.2 million due primarily due to the same factors that impacted net sales.\nOperating profit increased by $2.6 million to $3.2 million. Operating profit before special items increased by $1.9 million to $3.5 million. The improvement in operating profit before special items was due primarily to the same factors that impacted gross profit in addition to effective SG&A expense control.\nLand Management\nNet sales decreased by $0.3 million to $6.5 million primarily due to unusually severe winter weather in parts of the southeastern United States.\nOperating profit increased by $1.0 million to $3.2 million. Operating profit before special items increased by $0.2 million to $2.0 million.\nDividend Summary\nOn February 27, 2018, the Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.42 per share of Class A Common Stock and $0.63 per share of Class B Common Stock. Dividends are payable on April 1, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nTax Summary\nDuring the quarter, we recorded a provisional tax net benefit of $29.1 million related to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The provisional tax net benefit, which is being treated as a special item, is the net benefit resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances for the new corporate rate, offset by the tax liability incurred for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax. This provisional tax net benefit is subject to change. We will not have any cash tax payment during the fiscal year regarding the repatriation transition tax.\nCompany Outlook\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Original Fiscal\n2018 Outlook\nUpdated Fiscal\n2018 Outlook\nComments SG&A expense $395 - $415\nNo change N/A Interest expense $50 - $55 No change N/A Other expense, net $10 $15 - $20 Change in pension expected return on assets assumption Tax rate excluding the impact of special items 30 - 34% 28 - 32%\nUpdated for Tax Reform Act Class A Earnings Per Share Before Special Items $3.25 - $3.55 No change N/A Capital expenditures $100 - $120 No change N/A Free Cash Flow $200 - $220 No change N/A Note: 2018 Class A Earnings per Share guidance is not provided in this release due to the potential for one or more of the following, the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast: gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, timberland or properties, plants and equipment, net, non-cash asset impairment charges due to unanticipated changes in the business, restructuring-related activities, non-cash pension settlement charges or acquisition costs, and the income tax effects of these items and other income tax-related events. No reconciliation of the fiscal year 2018 Class A earnings per share guidance, a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes gains and losses on the disposal of businesses, timberland and properties, plants and equipment, non-cash pension settlement charges, acquisition costs, restructuring and impairment charges and provisional tax net benefit resulting from the Tax Reform Act is included in this release because, due to the high variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of some of the excluded information, together with some of the excluded information not being ascertainable or accessible, we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts. A reconciliation of 2018 free cash flow guidance to forecasted net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is included in this release.\n(3) Customer satisfaction index (CSI) tracks a variety of internal metrics designed to enhance the customer experience in dealing with Greif.
