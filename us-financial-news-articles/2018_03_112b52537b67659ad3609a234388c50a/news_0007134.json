Shanghai shares closed 0.4 percent higher.\nFed chief Powell will deliver the second leg of his semi-annual testimony on Thursday, an opportunity to clarify comments made on Tuesday that rekindled speculation over U.S. monetary tightening this year happening faster than expected.\nPowell on Tuesday vowed to prevent the economy from overheating while sticking with a plan to gradually raise interest rates.\nFor equity markets, the fear is that a pick-up in the pace of rate rises could crimp corporate activity and cool economic growth.\nPhilip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London said Powell’s testimony was unlikely to change from the one he delivered on Tuesday, putting the focus on the question and answer session.\nA man walks past an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai “He (Powell) appears to have got an easy ride from lawmakers in the sense that the technical questioning on Tuesday wasn’t too heavy,” Shaw said. “He may not have such an easy time today with the Senate Banking Committee.”\nDOLLAR COMEBACK The dollar meanwhile has taken heart from the Fed chair’s comments. The dollar index rose to 90.776, a six-week high.\nIt has clawed back from the three-year trough of 88.253 set in mid-February, as fears of a ballooning U.S. budget deficit and worries of a possible weak-dollar policy from Washington took a toll.\nThe gap between short-dated borrowing costs in the United States and Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks for the two regions diverge.\nThe U.S./Germany two-year bond yield spread widened to 281 basis points.\nIn contrast to rising rate-hike speculation in the United States, data on Wednesday showing euro zone inflation slowed to a 14-month low in February highlighted that a rate rise from the European Central Bank remains some way off.\n“In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where the inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz.\nThat divergence in rate outlooks also weighed on the euro, which hovered at a six-week low at around $1.2182.\nThe dollar was little changed at 106.73 yen, having slipped from the week’s peak of 107.680 as broader risk aversion favoured its Japanese peer.\nThe Australian dollar was down 0.6 percent at $0.7717 after brushing $0.7710, its lowest since late December.\nU.S. crude oil futures were a touch firmer at $61.73 per barrel after sliding more than 2 percent overnight. Brent crude added 0.25 percent to $64.89 per barrel.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo and Abhinav Ramnarayan in London; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:02:45.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
