However, core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 0.4 percent to 2.64 billion euros due to costs related to political uncertainty in Spain and due to the cost of terminating two services contracts.\nSuez’s Spain business has been impacted by uncertainty surrounding the political future of the Catalonia region.\nGroup earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 0.2 percent to 1.28 billion euros, in line with the company’s guidance following a profit warning in January.\nYet net profits fell 28 percent to 302 million euros, due to the impact of costs related to its earlier GE Water acquisition and a voluntary redundancy plan in France.\nSuez also confirmed a dividend of at least 0.65 euro on 2018 earnings and its current 2018 targets.\nThis year, Suez is targeting revenue growth of about nine percent and EBIT growth of about 10 percent, both at constant exchange rates, and free cash flow of about 1 billion euros.\n$1 = 0.8203 euros Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:43:22.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
