The tyre of Renault's Reon concept car is seen at its launch at the India Auto Show 2018 in Greater Noida, India, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal France announced last year plans to sell some 10 billion euros worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron. State stakes in big groups have long had popular backing, and the OpinionWay poll showed two thirds of voters still back it in principle.

Renault, at the heart of a power struggle over its ownership, topped the list, with 56 percent in favour of the state selling at least some of its 15 percent stake. The survey showed, however, that a majority oppose the selling of state assets in mail operator La Poste and electricity provider EDF ( EDF.PA ). Responses were split about state-owned railway operator SNCF, with 50 percent opposing any asset sale and 47 percent backing it.
