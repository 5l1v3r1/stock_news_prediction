Broad has figures of 3-18. \nEngland had resumed play on a credible 290 for eight after Bairstow had rallied the tail to support him on the first day. \nDebutant Jack Leach took the majority of the early strike on Saturday before Bairstow tucked a Boult delivery off his hip for a single to reach his personal milestone, prompting a standing ovation from the small crowd. \nSouthee, who finished with six for 62, added to his seventh five-wicket haul when he had Leach caught behind for 16 in the next over before Bairstow was caught at third man by Taylor off Boult nine balls later for 101. \nEngland need a win to stop New Zealand clinching their first series against them since 1999. The hosts won the first test at Eden Park in Auckland by an innings and 49 runs.
