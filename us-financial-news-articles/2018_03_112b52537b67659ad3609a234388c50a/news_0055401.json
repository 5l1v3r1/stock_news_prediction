Dominion will build and operate the pipe \n* To feed gas into Atlantic Coast and other pipelines, Dominion also wants to build the 38-mile Supply Header project in West Virginia and Pennsylvania at a cost of about $500 million Reporting by Scott DiSavino Editing by Susan Thomas", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T17:44:52.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
