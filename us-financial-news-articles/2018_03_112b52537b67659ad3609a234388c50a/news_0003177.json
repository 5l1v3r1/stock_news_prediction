And we expect a larger number of electric vehicles in the near future to be driving on our streets.\"\nAs more people start to drive electric vehicles over longer distances, the need for a large-scale charging network will become increasingly pressing.\nChanges are taking place. In January, for example, BP Ventures invested $5 million in FreeWire Technologies, a U.S. company that specializes in mobile electric vehicle rapid charging systems. BP said it planned to use the units at a selection of BP retail sites in the U.K. and Europe this year.\nIn Germany, where there is a big drive to boost the number of electric vehicles on roads, efforts are also underway to increase the number of charging points. \n\n\"We are planning to install 350 charging stations, especially at public places,\" Bernhard Riehle, project manager at Pfalzwerke Netz, told Sustainable Energy.\nWhile the ambitions are grand, there are a number of obstacles when it comes to rolling out new infrastructure. \"There… (are) a lot of technical challenges when setting up the infrastructure regarding the grid connection,\" Pfalzwerke Netz's Sebastian Koch said. Costs were another concern, he added.\nThere are several options when it comes to the model of charging used, including alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). \"Looking at AC charging… you need to have an on-board converter in your vehicle which then converts the alternating current into direct current to feed the battery,\" ABB's Hering said.\n\"This is of course a little bit slower but also cheaper,\" he added. \"Looking at DC charging, you can recharge at higher powers and thus need to spend less time to recharge your car because the conversion to DC takes place outside of the vehicle.\"\nMany users of electric vehicles will \"charge up\" using home-based stations, but this can be time consuming. \"People at home are able to charge their vehicles in three, up to four hours, maybe… longer,\" Pfalzwerke Netz's Riehle said. At a \"fast-charging\" station, however, cars could be charged in 30 to 45 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T12:18:24.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
