The company's CorPath® System is the first FDA-cleared medical device to bring robotic precision to percutaneous coronary and percutaneous vascular procedures. During the procedure, the interventional cardiologist sits at a radiation-shielded workstation to advance guide catheters, stents, and guidewires with millimeter-by-millimeter precision. The workstation allows the physician greater control and the freedom from wearing heavy lead protective equipment that causes musculoskeletal injuries. CorPath GRX is the second generation robotic-assisted PCI technology offering enhancements to the platform by adding important key upgrades that increase precision, improve workflow, and extend the capabilities and range of procedures that can be performed robotically. With the CorPath System, Corindus Vascular Robotics brings robotic precision to interventional procedures to help optimize clinical outcomes and minimize the costs associated with complications of improper stent placement during manual procedures. Corindus stands behind its product with its unique $1,000 hospital credit \"One Stent Program.\" For additional information, visit www.corindus.com , and follow @CorindusInc.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006246/en/\nCorindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nLynn Pieper Lewis, 415-937-5402\nir@corindus.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nKate Stanton, 508-653-3335 ext. 200\nKate.stanton@corindus.com\nSource: Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.corindus.com%2F&esheet=51772689&newsitemid=20180313006246&lan=en-US&anchor=www.corindus.com&index=1&md5=ae65e43150207b1bb989cdf7097a1cbf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corindus.com&esheet=51772689&newsitemid=20180313006246&lan=en-US&anchor=www.corindus.com&index=3&md5=be868b29f98dc877581af7eab7a837a6", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.corindus.com&esheet=51772689&newsitemid=20180313006246&lan=en-US&anchor=Corindus+Vascular+Robotics%2C+Inc.&index=2&md5=8c6da0b355f0b3ec78ca3d3c5d241859", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006246/en/"], "published": "2018-03-13T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T23:51:20.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
