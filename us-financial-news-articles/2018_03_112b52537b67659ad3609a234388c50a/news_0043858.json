He said Parmalat wanted to focus on higher-margin products including yogurt, cheese and special milks to foster growth and reverse a fall in core earnings.\nParmalat last week reported annual results, including a 3.2 percent rise in sales to 6.7 billion euros ($8.3 billion) and a 1.1 percent fall in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to 453.6 million euros.\nReporting by Francesca Landini.
