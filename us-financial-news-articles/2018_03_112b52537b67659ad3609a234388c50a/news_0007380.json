Oil Search will provide a revised production forecast and the likely impact on its 2018 earnings and capital outlook once it has more clarity on the progress of repair works, the company said in a statement on Monday. The magnitude 7.5 quake struck a week ago, triggering landslides, flattening buildings, killing at least 31 people and prompting ExxonMobil and Oil Search to suspend LNG exports. The Agogo Production Facility and the Moran field were the most impacted by the earthquake, and major repairs will be required before production can restart, the company added. The timeframe to restart production through Agogo is still being reviewed.
