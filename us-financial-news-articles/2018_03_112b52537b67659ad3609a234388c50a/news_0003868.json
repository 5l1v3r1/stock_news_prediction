We focus on the return and risk needs of insurance companies, corporate and public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and foundations, consultants, wealth managers, and high-net-worth investors. Our 300+ investment professionals perform rigorous research to understand market trends and identify undervalued opportunities in areas that are often complex and underfollowed. This approach to investment management has enabled us to deliver innovative strategies providing diversification opportunities and attractive long-term results.\nDiversification neither assures a profit nor eliminates the risk of experiencing investment losses.\nCurrencyShares are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. The value of the shares of each CurrencyShares Trust relates directly to the value of the foreign currency held by the particular Trust. This creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of the applicable foreign currency. Accordingly, a decline in the price of that currency will have an adverse effect on the value of the shares of the particular CurrencyShares Trust. Factors that may have the effect of causing a decline in the price of a foreign currency include national debt levels and trade deficits, domestic and foreign interest rates, investment and trading activities of institutions and global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of these products carefully before investing. The prospectus pertaining to each product contains this and other information about the product. Please read the applicable prospectus, including the Risk Factors section, carefully before you invest. Shares can be bought and sold through a broker and the purchasers or sellers may have to pay brokerage commissions in connection with the transaction. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that shares may be worth more or less than original cost. Shares may only be redeemed directly from the Trust by Authorized Participants via baskets (as defined in the prospectus). There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the shares will develop or be maintained. The CurrencyShares Trusts are not investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result the Trust(s) are not subject to the regulatory requirements of investment companies.\nThe CurrencyShares® Australian Dollar Trust , CurrencyShares® British Pound Sterling Trust , CurrencyShares® Canadian Dollar Trust , CurrencyShares® Chinese Renminbi Trust , CurrencyShares® Euro Trust , CurrencyShares® Japanese Yen Trust , CurrencyShares® Singapore Dollar Trust , CurrencyShares® Swiss Franc Trust and CurrencyShares® Swedish Krona Trust (each a “Trust” and collectively, the “Trusts”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offerings to which this communication relates. Before you invest in the shares of a Trust, you should read the prospectus in the registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and its offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov .
