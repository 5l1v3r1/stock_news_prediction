The record date is March 9.\nEvraz proposed a surprise dividend in August last year, its first since 2014, when it stopped payments in a drive to reduce debt.\nThe company’s Chief Financial Officer Nikolay Ivanov told Reuters in an interview in January that dividend payments were likely this year, and said instituting a new policy of regular payouts would be a wise move.\nAccording to its policy, Evraz said on Thursday, no dividend will be paid out if its net debt to EBITDA ratio is above 3.0. The ratio was at 1.5 at the end of 2017.
