Officials privately still held out hope that Trump would change his mind.\nToyota Motor Corp warned that while the“decision to impose substantial steel and aluminum tariffs will adversely impact automakers, the automotive supplier community and consumers as this would substantially raise costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in America.”\nJohn Bozzella, who represent Global Automakers, a trade group representing foreign automakers, said“investments earmarked for new products and plants will instead be funneled to pay for rising steel and aluminum prices used in existing products and facilities. There are better ways to address concerns about the American steel and aluminum industries. It’s time to go back to the drawing board.”\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross downplayed the impact on autos, telling CNBC Friday that there’s about a ton of steel in an average car — and that commodity currently costs $700.“So 25 percent on that would be one half of 1 percent price increase on the typical $35,000 car. So it’s no big deal,” he said.
