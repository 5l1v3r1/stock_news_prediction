They targeted bank employees with emails infecting their computers and then using them as a base to gain control of bank network and servers.\n“With that level of access, the nefarious individuals authorize fraudulent bank transfers, raise the balances of mule accounts or command affected ATMs to spit out the money for them,” Europol said.\nEuropol, said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Romanian, Belarussian and Taiwanese authorities, and private cyber security companies were assisting in the case.\nORGANIZATION USED ‘MULES’ TO EXTRACT MONEY The Interior Ministry said that during the raid in Alicante police seized jewels worth 500,000 euros and two luxury cars. It also blocked bank accounts and two homes valued at about 1 million euros.\nThe organization needed the support of other criminal groups to coordinate the work of the ‘mules’ they used to extract money from cash points that they attacked, it said. Until 2015 they used the Russian mafia for this, and after 2016 the Moldovan mafia.\nTheir earnings were converted into bitcoins at exchange houses in Russia and Ukraine. These were later transferred to their accounts and they accumulated about 15,000 bitcoin, Interior Ministry said.\nDenis K used financial platforms in Gibraltar and the United Kingdom to load prepaid cards with bitcoin and spend them in Spain on cars, homes, and other goods.\nHe also set up an “enormous network” to mine bitcoins which he used as a means of laundering money.\n($1 = 0.8037 euros)\nReporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam, Angus Berwick and Jesús Aguado in Madrid and Jack Stubbs in Moscow; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T15:23:49.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
