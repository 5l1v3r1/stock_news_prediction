From 2019 the likelihood of the market being in deficit is expected to increase,\" Antofagasta said.\n\"With the backdrop of stronger copper prices, employee expectations may be raised which could result in some supply disruptions in the region.\"\nAntofagasta shares were up 1.8 percent to 904 pence at 0805 GMT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T11:15:42.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
