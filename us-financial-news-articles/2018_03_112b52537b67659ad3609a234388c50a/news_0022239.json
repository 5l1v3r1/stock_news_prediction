Gold-covered doughnut CNBC | Secret Lives of the Super Rich The world's most expensive doughnut, the Golden Cristal Ube. Chef Bjorn Delacruz creates a handcrafted doughnut with premium ingredients like $200-per-bottle Cristal champagne and ube, a purple yam from the Philippines.\nIt's also covered in 24-karat gold dust and gold leaf.\n\"Their doughnuts are covered in gold, but the inside is actually the most incredible thing in the entire world,\" Cheban says. \"One of my favorite things that I've had with gold.\"\nCheban bought a box of the doughnuts — which sell for $100 a piece — for his mother's birthday last July. A dozen will set you back a whopping $1,200.\nThe sweet treats can be found via the Manila Social Club in either Brooklyn , New York or Miami , Florida, depending where the chef is at the time.\nIn January, the eatery's Brooklyn location announced it would close for six months as Delacruz decided to take a trip, \"setting up donut shops and hosting exclusive dining experiences around the country,\" according to Manila Social Club's Facebook page .\n2. Gold-topped baked potato Courtesy of Komodo If you prefer savory indulgences, Cheban recommends this decadent baked potato from Komodo in Miami, Florida.\nFor $24, you get a sweet potato with wasabi butter, tobiko, shaved truffles and gold leaf sprinkled on top. The dish is called the Super Sweet Potato .\n\"I don't even eat baked potatoes,\" Cheban says, but he's willing to make an exception in this case. \"This has so much stuff on it. It's incredible.\"\nOf course, the restaurant named a dessert after Cheban — the Foodgod Baked Alaska Surprise — so he may be a little biased.\nDon't miss: How Kylie Jenner turned her $29 lipstick business into a $420 million empire in 18 months\nLike this story?
