Atilla has already been in jail for about 12 months.\nAtilla, 47, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 11 by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman. Prosecutors are expected to make their case for what Atilla’s sentence should be in a court filing next Monday.\nAtilla’s lawyers said in Monday’s filing that Atilla was the only foreign banker ever prosecuted under the U.S. sanctions law, and that a heavy sentence would be unfair when other bankers were not punished at all.\nThey argued that Atilla’s conduct was “less culpable than that of someone who owes allegiance to the United States,” and that “thwarting the foreign policy objectives of the United States is not self-evidently wrong” for someone without ties to the country.\nThey said that Atilla had already suffered a severe penalty because his conviction had “shattered” his career.\nAtilla was arrested in New York in March 2017. He was found guilty of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions law on Jan. 3 after a four-week trial.\nProsecutors charged that beginning around 2012, Atilla took part in a scheme to let Iran spend its oil and gas revenues abroad using fraudulent gold and food transactions through Halkbank.\nAt the center of the scheme, prosecutors said, was Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who had been arrested in Florida a year earlier. Zarrab pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for prosecutors.\nAtilla, testifying in his own defense, denied that he took part in any scheme.\nZarrab testified that he bribed Turkish officials, and that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan personally signed off on parts of the scheme while he was the country’s prime minister.\nThe case has strained relations between the United States and Turkey, which are NATO allies.\nDuring the trial, Erdogan called the case a “plot against Turkey” based on evidence fabricated by followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he has also blamed for a failed 2016 coup attempt.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:42:29.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
