The new manufacturing facility will expand RJR's capacity for its widely accepted high-performance plastic Air Cavity packaging for RF and microwave applications.\n\"RJR is making capital investments on a 30,000-square foot building to house our corporate headquarters as well as expand our manufacturing operations to support our growth. We decided to move our headquarters from California to Arizona after working closely with the Phoenix Economic Development Council due to its friendly government, pro-business stance and available technical talent due to a strong semiconductor base. We will maintain our Oakland facility to run our custom specialty product lines as well as a second source for our high volume standard products. We moved into the building in April of 2017 and have just received our first customer qualification and are starting our volume ramp,\" said President and CEO Wil Salhuana. \"Today our Air Cavity Plastic (ACP) and RQFN packages offer a compelling value proposition in terms of high performance, low cost and faster time-to-market, and the packages have been widely accepted as the package of choice for the RF Cellular Base Station Market.\"\nIndicative of the company's success, RJR Technologies has already shipped millions of units of its new second-generation ACP2 packages to leading manufacturers in the RF market. Over the next few years, the company's industry-standard ACP packages promise to deliver similar benefits to applications in the Gallium Nitride (GaN) market, and RF Energy applications, such as lighting, automotive ignition systems, and consumer microwave appliances as well as new products that address other market applications.\nAbout RJR Technologies\nRJR Technologies, Inc. is a developer and high-volume manufacturer of Air Cavity LCP semiconductor packages and a leading formulator of B-staged epoxies.
