The search vessel, the Seabed Constructor, began its search on Jan. 23.\nThe 90-day agreement, however, did not include days for the search vessel to travel to a port for refueling, Civil Aviation Authority chairman Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said.\n“The vessel has a working cycle of 26 days before it needs to refuel and resupply,” Azharuddin said at a memorial event marking the fourth year of the plane’s disappearance.\nPlans to recover the Boeing 777’s wreckage or its flight recorders, in the event the aircraft is found, will be finalised in two weeks, and will involve several Malaysian and Australian agencies, he said.\nFILE PHOTO: The shadow of a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) P3 Orion maritime search aircraft can be seen on low-level clouds as it flies over the southern Indian Ocean looking for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 March 31, 2014. REUTERS/Rob Griffith/Pool/File Photo Malaysia will take custody of any parts recovered from the seabed, he said.\nThe Seabed Constructor has completed the first part of its search, covering 8,200 sq km, and has now moved into a new area, Ocean Infinity said in its weekly update on Tuesday.\nIt has not yet made any significant findings, the firm said.\nSaturday’s memorial event featured talks and musical performances, as families paid tributes to the passengers and crew aboard the aircraft.\n“We want to remind everyone that MH370 is not history, it’s the future,” said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane.\n“It’s very important in the interests of aviation safety that we find MH370, so that we can prevent something like this from happening again,” she said.\nInvestigators are divided on whether the aircraft suffered a mechanical failure or whether it was deliberately diverted over the southern Indian Ocean.\nDebris has been collected from Indian Ocean islands and Africa’s east coast and at least three pieces have been confirmed as coming from the missing plane.\nReporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T14:55:27.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
