Customers prefer government-backed money transfer service, PromptPay, startup Omise and digital wallets such as TrueMoney, offered by telecommunication firm True Corporation Pcl.\nWaiving off online transaction fees could hurt the market value of these banks and their profit could decline up to 5 percent, analysts warned.\nThe Thai banking sector index slipped 0.67 percent, while the broader market declined up to 0.53 percent on Thursday.\nThe decision to waive off digital transaction fees will support the government’s plan to make Thailand a ‘cashless society’, Bangkok Bank Executive Vice-President Prassanee Ouiyamaphan said, adding that the lender would waive off these fees from April 1.\n“We aim to respond to our customers’ needs,” Siam Commercial Bank’s First Senior Vice-President, digital banking division, Tana Pothikamjorn, said in a statement.\nIn 2017, 15.9 percent of SCB’s 30.3 billion baht ($970.22 million) of net fee income included bank transfer and remittances.\n$1 = 31.2300 baht Reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:58:31.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
