Passive euthanasia will be applicable to only a terminally ill person with no hope for recovery, the court said.\nIn 2015, the death of a 66-year-old nurse Aruna Shanbaug, who was sexually assaulted and left in a vegetative state for more than 40 years, had sparked a national debate over the legalisation of euthanasia.
