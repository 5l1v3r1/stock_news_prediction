As stocks went down, bitcoin went down,\" Colas said. \"Bitcoin faded just like a stock. However, as stocks began to rebound that correlation fell apart.\" \nColas, who owns a quarter of one bitcoin (worth about $2,700), contends investors may be better served by using a highly accessible strategy that relies only on an internet connection. \n\"The precursor for opening a wallet for many people is just googling the term 'bitcoin,' 'how to buy a bitcoin wallet,' 'how to buy a bitcoin' and so forth. So, as bitcoin searches go up, it's a precursor to bitcoin prices appreciating as well,\" he said. \nThe correlation was particularly significant between Thanksgiving and Dec. 17, when bitcoin was surging to its $19,843 record. Since then, the emerging asset has plunged 45 percent and is now bouncing along the $10,000 level. Bitcoin's next catalyst \nFor bitcoin to stage another breakout, Colas says it would take a major announcement from a retailer such as Amazon about using it for payment. Right now, price volatility and underdeveloped technology is a roadblock. \nEven though he doesn't see a near-term surge, he is far from bearish. His 2018 average price for bitcoin is $14,000 â€” noting that there is a fair amount of crossover between people who own bitcoin and stocks. \n\"It's such a polar discussion with people. We have clients who love it [bitcoin], and clients who hate it. And, there's really nobody in the middle,\" Colas said. \"Every day it doesn't go to zero is another day it lives. And, every day above ground is a good one. That applies for people and bitcoin.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T14:32:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
