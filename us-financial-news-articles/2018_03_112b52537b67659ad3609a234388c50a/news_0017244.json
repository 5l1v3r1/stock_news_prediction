REUTERS/Leah Millis It is the latest in a series of free-wheeling sessions Trump has held to talk about how to stop mass shootings at schools, but the White House has not yet made clear the full range of actions Trump supports to address gun violence.\nThursday’s session, set for 2 p.m. ET (1900 GMT), will include executives from Take-Two Interactive Software Inc ( TTWO.O ), which owns “Grand Theft Auto,” and ZeniMax Media Inc, owner of “Doom.” Trump’s younger brother Robert Trump is on the board of ZeniMax, first reported by Bloomberg.\nTrump, a Republican, has talked about the need to examine how violence in media affects children, after a 19-year-old gunman was accused of killing 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida and injuring more than a dozen others.\nTrump has made the issue personal, taking the unusual step of mentioning his concern for his 11-year-old son, Barron. “I look at some of the things he’s watching, and I say, how is that possible?” he said last week.\nDan Hewitt, a spokesman for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobby group whose CEO will attend the White House meeting, said studies have established no connection between video games and violent conduct.\nStudents from South Plantation High School carrying placards and shouting slogans walk on the street during a protest in support of the gun control, following a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Plantation, Florida, February 21, 2018.
