Benchmark 10-year note yields rose to 2.879 percent, the highest since March 13.\nA flood of Treasury supply, which has been concentrated in short-dated bills, to pay for the governments increasing deficit and bigger budget spending plans has also weighed on the market.\nBigger picture, I think people have been holding back from investing in the market, especially the front end, with very large supply coming through bills, Mulholland said.\nNo major data releases were scheduled for Tuesday.
