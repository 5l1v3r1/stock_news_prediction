It was fined T$300,000 ($10,253) by authorities in Kaohsiung after the incident.\nCPC’s diesel output was hit in January after an explosion at a refinery in the northwestern city of Taoyuan.\nBih said it will still “take some time” for the company to fully resume the production at the plant.\nReporting by Yimou Lee and Jeanny Kao; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell and Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T13:04:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
