REUTERS/Carlos Jasso Pemex said it expected the contract, in the Olmos field in the northern border state of Coahuila, to yield investment of $617 million, aiming to reach daily production of around 117 million cubic feet of gas by 2021.\nLewis Energy is a privately owned oil and gas operator based in south Texas. It has already drilled on behalf of Pemex in the Olmos field.\nEarlier this month, Mexico announced a September auction for development rights to shale blocks, the first time the country has offered private oil companies the chance to develop the resource, which has been booming in the United States for years.\nThe National Hydrocarbons Commission, Mexicoâ€™s oil regulator, launched a call for bids for its first shale tender, including nine contractual areas to be awarded on Sept. 5.\nThe blocks are in the Burgos Basin in the northwestern border state of Tamaulipas, where Pemex has drilled some 20 exploratory wells.\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:31:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
