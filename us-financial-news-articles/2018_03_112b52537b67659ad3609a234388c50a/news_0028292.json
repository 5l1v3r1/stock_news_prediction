REUTERS/Brian Snyder Airlines for America (A4A) said it expects carriers to fly 150.7 million passengers, 2.47 million per day, between March 1 and April 30, in a 4 percent increase from the year-ago period. Despite a number of seasonal challenges, including a rash of late-winter storms, U.S. airlines are generally off to a successful start of 2018, with some carriers having raised their first-quarter outlooks in the last week based on better-than-expected performance. “An expanding economy, employment gains and surging household net worth are also contributing to the growth in demand for air travel,” A4A Chief Economist John Heimlich said in a statement. The seasonal period includes several potential travel peaks, including U.S. college spring breaks, Easter and Passover.
