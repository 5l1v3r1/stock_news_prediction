The court has also published the judge’s opinion on its website.\n“The court ... recognised the arbitral award, meaning that a U.S. court judgment will be issued for the full amount of the award,” Stati’s press office said.\nStati, his son Gabriel and two family-controlled companies have been involved in legal battles with the Kazakh government of President Nursultan Nazarbayev for several years.\nThey invested in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industry and have alleged that they were subjected to harassment from the state aimed at forcing them to sell their investments cheaply. They and two of their companies won an arbitration award of around $500 million in Sweden against the government.\nKazakhstan denies the allegations, says the arbitration was won through fraud, and has countersued in several countries.\nKazakhstan’s central bank, which manages a sovereign fund invested in U.S. securities, did not reply to a request for comment on the court ruling on Monday.
