Production: Significant oil production growth of 39% in Colombia increased average consolidated oil and gas production to 30,654 boepd in 4Q2017 from 23,593 boepd in 4Q2016. The increase was mainly attributed to new oil production from the Tigana/Jacana oil fields in Llanos 34 block in Colombia. On a consolidated basis, gas production increased by 11% compared to 4Q2016, primarily attributed to increased industrial demand in Brazil.\nFor further detail, please refer to 4Q2017 Operational Update published on January 10, 2018.\nReference and Realized Oil Prices: Brent crude oil price averaged $61.5 per bbl during 4Q2017, and the consolidated realized oil sales price averaged $43.0 per bbl in 4Q2017, representing a 24% increase from $34.6 per bbl in 3Q2017 and a 38% increase from $31.2 per bbl in 4Q2016. Differences between reference and realized prices are a result of commercial and transportation discounts as well as the Vasconia price differential in Colombia, which averaged $4.0 per bbl in 4Q2017 from $2.8 per bbl in 3Q2017 and $5.7 per bbl in 4Q2016. Commercial and transportation discounts in Colombia were reduced to $14.9 per bbl in 4Q2017 from $15.2 per bbl in 3Q2017 and $15.0 per bbl in 4Q2016.\nCompany efforts are currently underway to continue improving realized oil prices, including negotiation of existing conditions with off-takers plus construction of a flowline and related facilities in Llanos 34 block, expected to continue improving current commercial and transportation discounts.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of reference and net realized oil prices in Colombia and Chile in 4Q2017:\n4Q2017 - Realized Oil Prices ($ per bbl)\nColombia Chile Brent oil price 61.5 61.5 Vasconia differential (4.0) - Commercial and transportation discounts (14.9) (8.4) Realized oil price 42.6 53.1 Weight on Oil Sales Mix 96% 4% Revenue: Higher oil and gas production and pricing drove total consolidated revenues up by 76% to $106.3 million in 4Q2017, compared to $60.3 million in 4Q2016.\nSales of crude oil: Consolidated oil revenues increased by 87% to $92.2 million in 4Q2017, driven by a 35% increase in oil sales volumes and a 38% increase in realized oil prices. Oil revenues represented 87% of total revenues compared to 82% in 4Q2016.\nColombia: In 4Q2017, oil revenues increased by 98% to $87.5 million mainly due to increased sales volumes and higher realized prices. Oil sales volumes increased by 40% to 23,283 bopd. Realized oil prices also increased by 40% to $42.6 per bbl, in line with higher Brent prices and a lower Vasconia discount. Colombia earn-out payments (deducted from Colombia oil revenues) increased to $3.7 million in 4Q2017, compared to $2.3 million in 4Q2016, in line with increased production and higher oil revenues. Chile: In 4Q2017, oil revenues decreased by 11% to $4.4 million due to lower sales volumes partially offset by higher realized prices. Oil sales volumes decreased by 31% to 902 bopd and realized oil prices increased by 28% to $53.1 per barrel, in line with higher Brent prices.\nSales of gas: Consolidated gas revenues increased by 28% to $14.1 million in 4Q2017 compared to $11.0 million in 4Q2016 due to 15% higher realized gas prices and 11% higher gas sales volumes.\nChile: In 4Q2017, gas revenues increased by 6% to $4.4 million mainly due to higher gas prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes. Gas prices increased by 24% to $4.5 per mcf ($27.1 per boe) in 4Q2017, due to increased methanol prices. Gas sales volumes decreased by 15% to 10,630 mcfpd (1,772 boepd). Brazil: In 4Q2017, gas revenues increased by 42% to $9.4 million, due to both higher realized prices and sales volumes. Gas prices, net of taxes, increased by 8% to $5.7 per mcf ($34.0 per boe) due to the annual gas price inflation adjustment of approximately 7%, effective January 2017. Gas sales volumes increased by 31% to 18,000 mcfpd (3,000 boepd), primarily due to higher gas consumption by Brazilian industrial users.\nCommodity risk management contracts: Consolidated commodity risk management contracts registered a realized loss of $5.8 million in 4Q2017, totaling realized losses of $2.1 million in full year 2017 ($3.8 million cash gains were recorded and cashed-in during the first nine months of 2017). Unrealized cash losses amounted to $12.6 million in 4Q2017 compared to $3.1 million loss in 4Q2016 resulting from the significant increase in forward Brent oil price curve. The company uses risk management contracts to minimize the impact of oil price fluctuations on the Company´s self-funded work program.\nProduction and operating costs [1] : Consolidated operating costs per barrel decreased by 9% to $7.3 per boe in 4Q2017 from $8.1 per boe in 4Q2016. Following the 30% increase in oil and gas sales volumes, total operating costs increased by $3.0 million to $19.6 million. Consolidated royalties increased by $6.8 million to $10.7 million in 4Q2017, mainly as the Jacana oil field in the Llanos 34 block accumulated more than five million barrels of production that triggered Colombia’s “high price” royalty scheme beginning in 2Q2017, and to a lesser extent due to increased volumes and higher realized prices.\nBelow is a breakdown of production and operating costs by country:\nColombia: Operating costs per boe remained flat at $6.1 per boe in both 4Q2017 and 4Q2016, due to: Significant increase in volumes sold, 40% compared to a year earlier, that increased overall operating costs by 40% to $13.1 million in 4Q2017 from $9.3 million in 4Q2016, Incremental costs related to the reopening of mature oil fields temporarily closed in 4Q2016 which have higher operating costs per barrel compared to Llanos 34 block. Chile: Operating costs decreased by 6% to $5.2 million in 4Q2017 from $5.6 million in 4Q2016 mainly due to lower volumes sold (-21%). As a result of the lower volumes, operating costs per boe increased by 18% to $21.3. Brazil: Operating costs decreased by 45% to $1.0 million in 4Q2017 from $1.7 million in 4Q2016, mainly due to a one-time recovery of maintenance costs in Manati that were incurred in previous quarters. Operating costs per boe decreased to $3.4 per boe from $8.0 in 4Q2016.\nSelling expenses: Consolidated selling expenses decreased to $0.3 million in 4Q2017 compared to $0.6 million in 4Q2016.\nAdministrative, Geological and Geophysical expenses: Consolidated G&A and G&G expenses increased by 15% to $14.5 million in 4Q2017 compared to $12.6 million in 4Q2016 mainly due to higher staff costs resulting from an increased scale of operations. Consolidated G&A and G&G costs per boe decreased by 13% to $5.5 per boe in 4Q2017 (vs. $6.1 per boe in 4Q2016).\nAdjusted EBITDA: Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $55.2 million was more than two times higher than the $27.0 million in 4Q2016. That is the equivalent of $20.6 per barrel and was driven by the combination of increased production and higher realized oil and gas prices.\nColombia: Adjusted EBITDA of $51.6 million in 4Q2017 (+95% vs. 4Q2016) Chile: Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 million in 4Q2017 (+75% vs. 4Q2016) Brazil: Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million in 4Q2017 (+116% vs. 4Q2016) Corporate, Argentina and Peru: Adjusted EBITDA of negative $4.7 million in 4Q2017\nThe table below shows production, volumes sold and breakdown of the most significant components of adjusted EBITDA for 4Q2017 and 4Q2016, on a per country and per barrel basis:\nAdjusted EBITDA/boe Colombia Chile Brazil Total 4Q17 4Q16 4Q17 4Q16 4Q17 4Q16 4Q17 c\n4Q16 Production (boepd) 24,378 17,535 2,932 3,523 3,328 2,535 30,654 23,593 Stock variation /RIK a (1,004) (878) (258) (151) (285) (206) (1,593) (1,235) Sales volume (boepd) 23,374 16,657 2,674 3,372 3,043 2,329 29,091 22,358 % Oil 99.6% 100% 34% 39% 1% 1% 83% 80% ($ per boe) Realized oil price 42.6 30.4 53.1 41.4 68.0 54.7 43.0 32.3 Realized gas price b 30.8 - 27.1 21.9 34.0 31.4 31.4 27.3 Earn-out (1.8) (1.4) - - - - (1.4) (1.1) Combined Price 40.8 29.0 35.9 29.4 34.5 31.7 39.7 29.3 Realized Commodity Risk Management Contracts (2.7) - - - - - (2.2) - Operating costs (6.1) (6.1) (21.3) (18.0) (3.4) (8.0) (7.3) (8.1) Royalties in cash (4.4) (1.9) (1.4) (1.2) (3.3) (2.6) (4.0) (1.9) Selling & other expenses 0.0 0.2 (0.7) (1.0) - - (0.1) (0.3) Operating Netback/boe 27.6 21.1 12.4 9.2 27.8 21.0 26.1 19.2 G&A, G&G (5.5) (6.1) Adjusted EBITDA/boe 20.6 13.1 a) RIK (Royalties in Kind).

No royalties were paid in kind in Chile and Brazil\nb) Conversion rate of mcf/boe=1/6 c)\nTotal amount includes 16 bopd of oil production from CN-V block in Argentina\nDepreciation: Consolidated depreciation increased by 17% to $19.8 million in 4Q2017, compared to $16.9 million in 4Q2016, due to higher volumes sold. On a per barrel basis, however, depreciation costs were lower given drilling successes and increased reserves. Depreciation costs per boe decreased by 10% to $7.4 per boe.\nWrite-off of unsuccessful exploration efforts: Consolidated write-off of unsuccessful exploration efforts was $1.1 million in 4Q2017, compared to $17.7 million in 4Q2016. Amounts recorded in 4Q2017 mainly correspond to unsuccessful exploration efforts in non-operated Sierra del Nevado and Puelen blocks in Argentina.\nImpairment of Non-Financial Assets: Consolidated non-cash impairment of non-financial assets was zero in 4Q2017 compared to a $5.7 million gain in 4Q2016 ($5.7 million non-cash recovery in Colombia).\nOther expenses: Other operating expenses were $2.7 million in 4Q2017, compared to $0.9 million in 4Q2016.\nCONSOLIDATED NON-OPERATING RESULTS AND PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD\nNet financial expenses: Net financial costs decreased by 7% to $8.2 million in 4Q2017, compared to $8.9 million in 4Q2016, mainly resulting from lower bank charges and other financial results.\nForeign exchange: Net foreign exchange charges were a $3.6 million loss in 4Q2017 and $1.4 million loss in 4Q2016, mainly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian Real over the US Dollar-denominated net debt incurred at the local subsidiary level, where the Real is the functional currency.\nIncome tax: Income taxes amounted to a $10.7 million in 4Q2017, as compared to a $9.7 million in 4Q2016, in line with higher taxable profits in 4Q2017.\nNet income: Net losses amounted to $3.4 million in 4Q2017 compared to $26.0 million in 4Q2016. The net loss in 4Q2017 resulted from unrealized hedge charges.\nBALANCE SHEET\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $134.8 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $73.6 million a year earlier. The difference reflects cash generated from operating activities of $142.2 million and cash from financing activities of $24.0 million, partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $105.6 million.\nCash generated from operating activities of $142.2 million is net of a $15.6 million advance payment paid in December 2017 to Pluspetrol, as a security deposit related to the recently announced acquisition of Aguada Baguales, El Porvenir and Puesto Touquet blocks in Neuquen basin in Argentina, which is expected to close in March 2018.\nCash from financing activities of $24.0 million includes net proceeds from the issuance of 2024 Notes of $418.3 million, offset by: (i) principal paid of $355.0 million related to the payment of 2020 Notes and the prepayment of the Itau loan, (ii) cancellation costs of $12.3, and (iii) interest payments of $27.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities of $105.6 million (76% allocated to Colombia) includes capital expenditures related to development, appraisal and exploration activities carried out in 2017 that allowed GeoPark to increase its reserves with low finding and development costs of $3.6/boe for 1P and $4.0/boe for 2P reserves (or $2.4/boe and $2.8/boe for 1P and 2P, respectively in Colombia).\nFinancial debt: Total financial debt (net of issuance costs) amounted to $426.2 million, including the $425 million 2024 Notes issued in September 2017. Short-term debt amounted to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nFINANCIAL RATIOS a\n($ million) At period-end Financial Debt\nCash and Cash Equivalents Net Debt Net Debt/ LTM Adj.

Percentage figures included in this press release have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures, but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, certain percentage amounts in this press release may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in the financial statements. In addition, certain other amounts that appear in this press release may not sum due to rounding.\nThis press release contains certain oil and gas metrics, including information per share, operating netback, reserve life index, and others, which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the Company's performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the Company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains statements that constitute . Many of the contained in this press release can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as ‘‘anticipate,’’ ‘‘believe,’’ ‘‘could,’’ ‘‘expect,’’ ‘‘should,’’ ‘‘plan,’’ ‘‘intend,’’ ‘‘will,’’ ‘‘estimate’’ and ‘‘potential,’’ among others.\nForward-looking statements that appear in a number of places in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations, regarding various matters, including expected 2018 production growth and performance, operating netback per boe and capital expenditures plan. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions, and on information currently available to the management. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may those expressed or implied in the due to various factors.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update them in light of new information or future developments or to release publicly any revisions to these statements in order to reflect later events or circumstances, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. For a discussion of the risks facing the Company which could affect whether these are realized, see filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOil and gas production figures included in this release are stated before the effect of royalties paid in kind, consumption and losses. Annual production per day is obtained by dividing total production for 365 days.\nInformation about oil and gas reserves : The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proven, probable and possible reserves that meet the SEC's definitions for such terms. GeoPark uses certain terms in this press release, such as \"PRMS Reserves\" that the SEC's guidelines do not permit GeoPark from including in filings with the SEC. As a result, the information in the Company’s SEC filings with respect to reserves will differ significantly from the information in this press release.\nNPV10 for PRMS 1P, 2P and 3P reserves is not a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for SEC proved reserves.\nThe reserve estimates provided in this release are estimates only, and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves may eventually prove to be greater than, or less than, the estimates provided herein. Statements relating to reserves are by their nature .\nAdjusted EBITDA: The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as profit for the period before net finance costs, income tax, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash items such as impairments and write-offs of unsuccessful exploration and evaluation assets, accrual of stock options stock awards, unrealized results on commodity risk management contracts and other non-recurring events. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of profit or cash flows as determined by IFRS. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. The Company excludes the items listed above from profit for the period in arriving at adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, profit for the period or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure and significant and/or recurring write-offs, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of adjusted EBITDA. The Company’s computation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the IFRS financial measure of profit for the year or corresponding period, see the accompanying financial tables.\nOperating netback per boe should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, profit for the period or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Operating Netback per boe are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure and significant and/or recurring write-offs, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Operating Netback per boe. The Company’s computation of Operating Netback per boe may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For a reconciliation of Operating Netback per boe to the IFRS financial measure of profit for the year or corresponding period, see the accompanying financial tables.\n[1] Production and Operating Costs = Operating Costs plus Royalties\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180307006454/en/\nGeoPark Limited\nINVESTORS:\nSantiago, Chile\nStacy Steimel – Shareholder Value Director\nssteimel@geo-park.com\nor\nMEDIA:\nNew York, USA\nJared Levy – Sard Verbinnen & Co\nT: +1 (212) 687-8080\njlevy@sardverb.com\nor\nKelsey Markovich – Sard Verbinnen & Co\nT: +1 (212) 687-8080\nkmarkovich@sardverb.com\nSource: GeoPark Limited", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geo-park.com&esheet=51769172&newsitemid=20180307006454&lan=en-US&anchor=www.geo-park.com&index=2&md5=1d13994a202b059fcc9f85365041462e", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180307006454/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geo-park.com&esheet=51769172&newsitemid=20180307006454&lan=en-US&anchor=www.geo-park.com&index=3&md5=5f6e7f7febf4fbf1507b84ebc768342f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.geo-park.com&esheet=51769172&newsitemid=20180307006454&lan=en-US&anchor=www.geo-park.com&index=1&md5=3583f1ed086ff31e0e932d762abc63b4"], "published": "2018-03-08T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T05:39:30.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
