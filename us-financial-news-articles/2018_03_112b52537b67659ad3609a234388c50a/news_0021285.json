Mooreâ€™s new title was not immediately clear. TrailStone, which is backed by private equity firm Riverstone, did not respond to a request for comment and Moore could not be reached for comment. NRG Energy, which currently owns Boston Energy Trading, declined to comment. Earlier this month, Diamond Generating Corp, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp, agreed to purchase Boston Energy Trading. That deal is due to close in the second half of 2018.
