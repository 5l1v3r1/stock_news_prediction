It took off in the 40s and became a part of pop culture in the 60s and 70s, when it was virtually impossible to drive through a neighborhood without seeing it parked in at least one driveway. \nThe Beetle has been squashed before, of course. VW ended production in 2003, but brought the car back in 2011. And, it’s possible the Beetle will rise again somewhere down the road, but Volkswagen officials hint that won’t be anytime soon. \n“Two or three generations is enough now,” said Frank Welsch, head of technical development at Volkswagen . “[The Beetle was] made with history in mind but you can’t do it five times and have a new new new Beetle.” \nWelsch did not provide a timeline for when the company will roll the final bug off of the assembly line.
