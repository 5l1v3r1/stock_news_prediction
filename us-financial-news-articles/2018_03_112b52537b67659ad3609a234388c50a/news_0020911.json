The index has slumped more than a third since hitting a multi-year high on Oct. 26 last year after the recapitalisation announcement.\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield has risen as much as 48 basis points so far in Jan-March, leaving bond prices on track for their third straight quarter of losses.\nCredit Suisse estimates that India’s state banks hold on an average about 10 percent more sovereign bonds than required by regulations, putting bank bond holdings at the highest level in 12 years.\nThe firm said the spike in bond holdings has been driven by weak loan growth and a surge in liquidity after a surprise bank note ban in late 2016 prompted banks to pile up on bonds.\nThe Reserve Bank of India may need to act to help contain the mark-to-market blow for the banks, the brokerage said, suggesting it could either raise the held-to-maturity threshold or buy back treasuries.\n$1 = 64.9550 Indian rupees Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:22:16.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
