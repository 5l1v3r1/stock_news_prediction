Last week he said he would file legal challenges to block future work, lashing out at the project as “corrupt.”\nHowever, he since softened his stance, calling for a thorough review of the project.\nGACM’s Patino dismissed suggestions that the airport was tainted by corruption and said that it was being built in accordance with high transparency standards.\n“It’s a glass box through which any citizen can see what’s happening in real time,” he said.
