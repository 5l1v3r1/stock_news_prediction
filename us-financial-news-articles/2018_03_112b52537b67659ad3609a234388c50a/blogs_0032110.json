According to people familiar with the matter, Mr. Jacobs was unhappy about the move. \nAt an annual meeting that was scheduled to occur earlier this month, Qualcomm shareholders were to vote on whether to oust current board members in favor of directors nominated by Broadcom. The meeting was delayed at the behest of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. before the deal was blocked by Mr. Trump. \nIt is now scheduled to take place next Friday and Qualcomm directors are expected to be re-elected unopposed as the Broadcom ballots won’t be tallied. \nHad the vote gone ahead as originally planned, a number of Qualcomm directors were expected to lose their seats, including possibly Mr. Jacobs, people familiar with the matter said. \nMr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm’s co-founder, owns just 0.13% of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego and has a market value of about $90 billion. To pull off a takeover of the company, which would cost upward of $100 billion, he would need to secure an inordinate amount of financing, and it isn’t clear where he would get it. \nMr. Jacobs took over as chief executive from his father, Irwin, in 2005, before passing the baton to current CEO \nSteve Mollenkopf \nin 2014. —Ted Greenwald contributed to this article. \nWrite to Dana Cimilluca at [email protected] , David Benoit at [email protected] and Dana Mattioli at [email protected] Appeared in the March 17, 2018, print edition as ‘Qualcomm Director Is Out.’ ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T03:08:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
