The Mustangs endured debilitating spans without a field goal down the stretch of the first half and into the second half, with the Cougars methodically expanding their lead courtesy of their defense.\nSMU’s Jimmy Whitt, averaging 11.3 points over the previous seven games with leading scorer Shake Milton sidelined due to a right hand injury, shot 1-for-8 and posted only five points.\nThe Cougars were first to break loose from a prolonged drought that engulfed both teams, with Gray drilling a jumper just inside the arc to snap a 2-2 tie at the 13:14 mark. Houston followed by either converting a 3-pointer or three-point play for its subsequent six baskets, surging to a 22-11 lead when Chris Harris Jr. completed the latter with 8:30 remaining in the first half.\nTwo things kept SMU afloat prior to the intermission: McMurray, who tallied 13 first-half points, and the Cougars’ inability to defend without fouling. Houston was whistled for 13 fouls before the break, with the Mustangs scoring one third of their 24 points at the free-throw line. The Cougars took a 12-point lead into the locker room, a deficit that could have been greater considering the Mustangs’ woeful 29.2 percent shooting, including 2-for-10 from behind the arc.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:07:35.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
