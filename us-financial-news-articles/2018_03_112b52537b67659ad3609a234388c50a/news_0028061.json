Our guiding premise: The minority in any community doesn’t have access to, is indeed often excluded from, the academic and professional opportunities and advantages critical for success that are available (most often implicitly) for the majority in the community. These implicit advantages include role models, mentors, community, connections, networking, experiential learning, leadership opportunities. Thus, it makes sense to level the professional playing field by making these advantages explicit and available for everyone. It’s not rocket science, just common sense.\nCMU’s Women@SCS program to level the professional playing field effectively countered the macroculture, resulting in women entering the computer-science major at CMU in increasing numbers, now inching up to almost 50%—and with retention of women now at a slightly higher level than men. We find that in a more balanced environment (in terms of both numbers and professional opportunities afforded) there is virtually no gender divide.\nProf. Lenore Blum\nCarnegie Mellon University\nPittsburgh", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T17:53:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
