(AmurEF) is proud to announce the completion of its fifth term securitization. A total of $197,549,000 in DBRS rated securities, spread across seven classes and secured by equipment lease and loans originated or contributed by AmurEF, were issued, including $164,800,000 rated investment grade. KeyBanc Capital Markets served as structuring agent, bookrunner, and lead manager; The Williams Group served as co-manager.\n“This securitization was a great outcome for AmurEF: it shows that the market believes in us and our platform and sets us up well to continue on our very exciting growth path. We’re grateful to the whole KeyBanc Capital Markets team for this outcome – a rapid uptick in interest rates during the marketing phase was a challenge, but they delivered a great result,” said Kalyan Makam, AmurEF Board Member and EVP of Capital Markets for Amur Finance Company, Inc.\n“The response of investors to our disciplined underwriting standards, solid portfolio performance and steady growth was tremendous as the bond offering was oversubscribed,” stated AmurEF’s Co-President and Chief Risk Officer, Andrea Zana. “It is clear that investors see and appreciate the value of what AmurEF is building.”\nAmurEF has issued over $796,000,000 in secured notes across five securitizations.
