(TSX:STEP) (the “Company” or “STEP”) today announces financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The following press release should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2017. All of the above documents are available on STEP’s website at www.stepenergyservices.com or on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nSTEP’s operations in the fourth quarter and year end 2017 resulted in positive net earnings for both periods . The Company’s $100 million initial public offering completed in the first half of 2017 provided financial flexibility to execute on our capital program and significantly grow the business.\nGenerated fourth quarter and full year 2017 consolidated revenue of $154.3 million and $553.2 million, respectively, compared to $64.2 million and $169.2 million in the same periods of 2016.\nCoiled tubing revenue per operating day in Q4 and full year 2017 increased 18% to average $45,290 and 15% to average $44,053, respectively, relative to the same periods in 2016.\nRevenue per operating day for fracturing services for Q4 and full year 2017 increased by 56% across both periods to average $259,866 and $246,527, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016.\nFracturing and coiled tubing operating days for Q4 2017 increased 86% and 57%, respectively, over the same period in 2016, and increased 226% and 67% for the full year 2017 compared to 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for Q4 2017 totaled $36.0 million (or 23%) and was a record $123.6 million (or 22%) for full year 2017, representing increases of $30.7 million and $117.4 million, respectively, over the same periods in 2016.\nNet income for Q4 2017 was $17.5 million and was $57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a loss of $2.6 million and a loss of $20.0 million, respectively, in the same periods of 2016.\nAs at December 31, 2017, STEP operated seven fracturing spreads representing 209,000 horsepower (“HP”) and a fleet of 19 coiled tubing spreads, including six in the U.S. In the first quarter of 2018, STEP deployed two additional coiled tubing spreads in the U.S., along with its eighth fracturing spread in Canada. The Company currently operates eight fracturing spreads representing 225,000 HP and a fleet of 21 coiled tubing spreads.\nSTEP exited 2017 with working capital of $121.0 million (including cash and cash equivalents of $36.9 million) and no drawings on our $100.0 million credit facility.\nHIGHLIGHTS SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END 2017\nOn February 22, 2018, STEP announced the acquisition of Tucker Energy Services Holdings, Inc. (“Tucker”), a U.S. based, privately-held provider of fracturing and completion solutions operating primarily in the SCOOP/STACK and Woodford plays in Oklahoma, for total cash consideration of US$275 million before closing adjustments (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition increases STEP’s geographic diversification, as approximately 40% of our fracturing horsepower and coiled tubing spreads will be in the U.S. post-closing. STEP expects to fund the Acquisition with approximately $30 million of available cash, proceeds from a previously announced $56 million equity offering of subscription receipts (the “Offering”) and the remainder from our new credit facilities. Closing of the Acquisition is expected on or about April 2, 2018.\n(1) See Non-IFRS Measures. “Adjusted EBITDA” is a financial measure not presented in accordance with IFRS and is equal to net income before finance costs, depreciation and amortization, loss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment, current and deferred income tax, share‐based compensation, impairment, transaction costs and foreign exchange (gain) loss .\nCONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS\nThe Company’s consolidated fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial and operating highlights are presented below.\nFINANCIAL Three months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n($000s except percentages, shares and per share amounts) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Consolidated revenue $ 154,253 $ 64,162 $ 553,220 $ 169,153 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders $ 17,548 $ (2,615 ) $ 57,718 $ (19,956 ) Per share-basic $ 0.29 $ (0.05 ) $ 1.02 $ (0.47 ) Per share-diluted $ 0.28 $ (0.05 ) $ 1.00 $ (0.47 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 35,962 $ 5,255 $ 123,584 $ 6,222 Adjusted EBITDA % (1) 23 % 8 % 22 % 4 % OPERATIONAL Three months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n($000’s except per day, days, units, and HP) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Total fracturing operating days (2) 378 203 1,483 455 Fracturing revenue per operating day $ 259,866 $ 166,353 $ 246,527 $ 157,985 Fracturing capacity (HP): Average active HP 187,500 100,000 160,688 75,000 Exit active HP 209,000 100,000 209,000 100,000 Total HP (3) 297,500 297,500 297,500 297,500 Total coiled tubing operating days (2) 1,237 789 4,259 2,546 Coiled tubing revenue per operating day $ 45,290 $ 38,520 $ 44,053 $ 38,205 Coiled tubing capacity: Average active coiled tubing units 19 13 16 12 Exit active coiled tubing units 19 14 19 14 Total coiled tubing units 19 16 19 16 Capital expenditures $ 32,020 $ 11,622 $ 110,955 $ 100,124 (1) See Non-IFRS Measures.\n(2) An operating day is defined as any coiled tubing and fracturing work that is performed in a 24 hour period, exclusive of support equipment.\n(3) Represents total owned HP, of which 225,000 HP is currently deployed and the remainder of which requires certain maintenance and refurbishment.\nBALANCE SHEET As at December 31, As at December 31, ($000s except shares and per share amounts) 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents $ 36,859 $ 2,151 Working capital $ 121,032 $ 29,872 Total assets $ 533,845 $ 335,140 Total long-term financial liabilities $ 8,049 $ 33,994 Shares outstanding Basic 60,309,738 47,719,703 Weighted average shares – basic 56,528,016 42,400,845 Weighted average shares – diluted 57,752,867 42,400,845 U.S. STRATEGIC ACQUISITION OF TUCKER\nConsistent with STEP’s strategic growth plans, on February 22, 2018, the Company announced an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Tucker for total cash consideration of U.S.$275 million, before closing adjustments. Tucker is a privately-owned and geographically-focused provider of fracturing and completion solutions. The Acquisition provides STEP an efficient and strategic entry into the U.S. fracturing market in key high-growth basins, with access to existing long-tenured clients holding large acreage positions and expansive drilling inventories in the SCOOP/STACK and Woodford plays in Oklahoma. This geographic expansion reduces STEP’s commodity price concentration risk and provides the Company with flexibility to allocate capital between our U.S. and Western Canadian operations, with the potential to improve asset utilization and realize stronger margins.\nThrough the Acquisition, STEP will add four fracturing spreads representing 192,500 HP (three spreads comprised of 142,500 HP are currently operating, and a fourth fracturing spread of 50,000 HP is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2018), two coiled tubing spreads and 15 wireline units. STEP’s scale and operational efficiency are enhanced through the Acquisition, with a total fracturing capacity of 490,000 HP (an increase of 65%), a total of 23 coiled tubing spreads and 15 wireline units. STEP intends to integrate the assets, client and supplier relationships, operational experience and expertise from the senior Tucker leadership team into our existing business and operations.\nFunding for the Acquisition is expected to come from cash on hand, proceeds from a $56 million equity offering of subscription receipts, and borrowings under STEP’s new credit facilities (the “New Credit Facilities”). The New Credit Facilities consist of a $330 million revolving syndicated credit facility, a $10 million operating facility and a U.S.$7.5 million operating facility.\nUnder the Offering, which closed on March 15, 2018, STEP issued 6,055,000 subscription receipts at a price of $9.30 per subscription receipt (the “Offering Price”), which included 675,000 subscription receipts issued pursuant to the partially exercised over-allotment option granted to the syndicate of underwriters, for gross proceeds of approximately $56 million. The over-allotment option is exercisable in whole or in part, at any time for a period of 30 days following the closing of the Offering, to purchase up to an aggregate of 807,000 subscription receipts at the Offering Price.\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\nSTEP’s quarterly and annual results reflect strong demand for our services and the resultant high equipment utilization. The significant increase in operating and financial performance in 2017 relative to 2016 is the result of strong utilization of an expanding active equipment base, improved pricing conditions in both Canada and the U.S., increasing fracturing intensity, proactive cost management and increasing economies of scale.\nCanadian Segment\nAs at December 31, 2017, our Canadian operations were comprised of 297,500 fracturing HP, of which a fleet of seven fracturing spreads representing 209,000 HP was staffed with 24-hour operations, and 13 purpose-built coiled tubing spreads. STEP’s Canadian segment took delivery of its seventh fracturing spread in December and eighth fracturing spread in late February, bringing active operating capacity to 225,000 HP.\nCompletions activity in Canada improved dramatically in 2017 over 2016, allowing STEP to activate 109,000 HP and three deep capacity coiled tubing spreads during the year. This additional capacity, combined with improved utilization and pricing, increased revenue by 146% and 237% for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, over the comparable periods in 2016. The addition of STEP’s Medicine Hat operating base during 2017 allowed for positioning in the Viking play and closer proximity to other light oil plays, where industry activity is increasing.\nThe Canadian segment generated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 of $28.5 million (or 21%) and $107.7 million (or 22%).\nU.S. Segment\nAt December 31, 2017, our U.S. operations included six active coiled tubing spreads. The Company took delivery of its seventh and eighth coiled tubing spreads in the first quarter of 2018.\nStrong demand for all units across all operating districts coupled with an expanded client base contributed to a 108% and 164% percent increase in revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, over the comparable periods in 2016. Adding the Midland, Texas and Arcadia, Louisiana operating bases in 2017 positioned STEP’s U.S. operations to benefit from increased geographical diversification. Depreciation in the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar partially offset the revenue per day improvements during the second half of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the U.S. for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.5 million (or 37%) and $15.9 million (or 27%), respectively, an increase of 189% and 429% over the comparable periods in 2016. The rebound in U.S. activity combined with the growing demand to service longer reach, high pressure wells supports the Company’s plans to grow its U.S. coiled tubing platform.\nOUTLOOK\nIn Canada, STEP has experienced strong demand for its asset base during the first quarter of 2018, with visibility to above normal activity levels in the second quarter. At the beginning of the year, extreme weather conditions and clients’ third party related delays resulted in operational downtime. Due to these operational delays, we anticipate that our revenue mix in the first quarter will have a higher component of standby related charges, which could in turn impact margin performance. Furthermore, sand delivery interruptions resulted in minor scheduling delays and modest cost inflation. As a result of the recent weakness in Canadian natural gas prices, 2018 completions activity is expected to shift to oil and liquids-rich gas formations, reinforcing our strategy to construct fit-for-purpose equipment to target oil plays.\nIn the U.S., the market for completions activity remains robust and client inquiries continue to be supportive of deploying new equipment. We anticipate that our coiled tubing and newly acquired fracturing assets will experience strong demand through 2018. In addition to increasing U.S. activity, management believes fracturing supply may be constrained by the attrition of older equipment and the potential for supply chain limitations resulting in longer lead time for construction and delivery of new capacity.\nModest cost inflation is expected to persist due to continuing market demand for supply chain inputs. STEP will continue to focus on operational efficiencies to drive its financial performance in 2018. Management will continue to employ a real-time approach to assessing the market’s ability to absorb new capacity and adjust accordingly.\nPrior to the Acquisition, the Board approved a 2018 capital program of $109 million, comprised of expansion capital of $73 million, maintenance capital of $29 million, and infrastructure and related investment of $7 million. Expansion capital includes the purchase of auxiliary equipment to support our Montney, Duvernay, and Viking activities, construction of fit-for-purpose equipment to target oil plays, and refurbishment and rebranding of idle fracturing assets. After the Acquisition and upon completion of the 2018 capital program we anticipate operating 15 fracturing spreads representing approximately 497,500 HP (305,000 HP in Canada and 192,500 in the U.S.), 16 coiled tubing spreads in Canada, 13 coiled tubing spreads in the U.S. and 15 wireline units in the U.S. STEP’s decision to deploy additional equipment will be influenced by market conditions, access to key components, shop capacity and the availability of qualified personnel to staff equipment.\nSTEP believes its commitment to modern fit-for-purpose equipment and our high performance culture differentiates the Company in the market place. STEP is continually developing and deploying technology to advance its business. Such advancements include: fiber optics; e-line and Coil Link™ real time downhole data; STEP-PLEX™ diverting agents used in recompletion activities and inter stage diversion on new wells; and SandCan, a containerized proppant delivery system.\nNON‐IFRS MEASURES\nPlease see the discussion in the Non‐IFRS Measures section of the MD&A for the reconciliation of non‐IFRS items to IFRS measures.\nFORWARD‐LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains certain forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Our combination of modern, fit-for-purpose fracturing and coiled tubing equipment has differentiated STEP in plays where wells are deeper, have longer laterals, and higher pressure.\nInitially operating only in Canada as a specialized, deep capacity coiled tubing company, in 2015 we expanded into the U.S. and also began offering fracturing services to our Canadian clients. Currently, STEP is a fully integrated, deep capacity coiled tubing and fracturing solutions provider focused primarily in the Montney and Duvernay in Canada, and is a coiled tubing services provider in the Permian and Eagle Ford in Texas and the Haynesville in Louisiana. Our U.S. business is a key differentiator for STEP, as the rate of expansion and profitability from that segment is expected to contribute meaningfully to the Company’s growth. Our continuing track record of safety, efficiency and execution drives repeat business from our blue-chip exploration and production clients.\nFor more information please contact:\nRegan Davis\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer Telephone: 403-457-1772\nEmail: investor_relations@step-es.com\nWeb: www.stepenergyservices.com\nSource: STEP Energy Services Ltd.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YP74u90zt75AoDxS_YxdCF3cGKeyYKu8Abyz9cPrl-4ok1ajGr6A_oTJD-whDFu3NtQ4ccZQY1f7y7RgfdBy7EHrTvlz7x_MqyLjcdwUe9zo7eMZccNFG0a5al_qdmry", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JyuoVCejf8s9Pm3s1fXKGQ8UHGjsgYSM9Ea4CQoytuV-llybwFi6wm6jtSISKW8mCcdCqQO4L5lpk8-VR7ZpXA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7d7a82ab-8c4c-485f-a08e-be1169746473"], "published": "2018-03-20T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T14:26:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
