Shippabo works with small- and medium-size shippers, including flooring wholesaler Flooret and subscription-box service Loot Crate.\nKeeping the money moving as quickly as shipments do is crucial at a time when freight capacity is tight, said Harold Friedman, a senior vice president at Data2Logistics, which processes freight payments for retailers and manufacturers. Truckload carriers “are in the driver’s seat,” Mr. Friedman said.\n“They have more loads than they have trucks or drivers for,” Mr. Friedman said. “As a result they’re becoming choosy as to who they want to engage as a customer, so it’s become increasingly important that bills be processed and paid in a timely basis.”\nWrite to Erica E.
