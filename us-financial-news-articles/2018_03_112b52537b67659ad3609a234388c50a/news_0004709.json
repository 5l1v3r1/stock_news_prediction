This is now our thirteenth consecutive quarter with record year over year adjusted earnings and we expect that progress to continue. I am especially pleased that the targets for operating margin and leverage ratio that we set three years ago, which were fairly aggressive targets, were both met on time and with some room to spare. We made commitments on these objectives and we met them, just as we make commitments to our customers and our people, and we strive to meet them too. We are very proud of our team at Martinrea and acknowledge their fine efforts in bringing success to our company. Our focus on operational excellence, cost reduction, good launches and improving our product offerings to customers is clearly taking hold, and our Martinrea 2.0 strategy is achieving results. We are also pleased to report improved safety performance, even though we already were better than the industry average. Safety is not just a must for the care of our people, but it is a sign of efficiency and discipline in our operations. Our quality continues to win awards from customers, and we received many quality awards from key customers in 2017. I am pleased to announce $40 million of new business in the quarter, since our last call, with Nissan on its next generation Rogue crossover vehicle platform starting in 2020. We continue to be very excited about our future, and about the coming year.”\nFred Di Tosto, Martinrea’s Chief Financial Officer, stated: “Sales for the fourth quarter, excluding tooling sales of $68.8 million, were $809.8 million, within our previously announced sales guidance. In the quarter, our adjusted net earnings per share, on a basic and diluted basis, was $0.50 per share, in excess of the high end of our quarterly guidance and a record fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA margins increased significantly year-over-year. Operating income margin for the year hit 6.4%, well in excess of the 6% target set at the end of 2014. We are also very pleased to have met our leverage ratio target by the end of 2017—it is clear that we have a very strong balance sheet for this industry, and the ability to generate cash. In 2017, a year where we invested heavily in our operations, net debt decreased by approximately $80 million. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet over time, and will pay down debt as appropriate, although we do not have specific targets.”\nRob Wildeboer, Executive Chairman, stated: “In 2017, we continued to drive our One Martinrea culture throughout the organization, as we focused on our vision, delivered on our mission and applied our Ten Guiding Principles in everything that we did. We continued to instill our lean thinking way into all of our operations and our entrepreneurial can do attitude was evident in our locations and our functions. We are thrilled with the improving financial performance, but that improved financial performance goes hand in hand with the development of our corporate culture, where we commit to work together to serve this company and all our stakeholders, making lives better, with dignity and respect. 2018 will be another year of promise and opportunity for our company and our business, and we see continued advancement in key earnings and margin metrics. The year is off to a good start, and we expect first quarter sales, excluding tooling sales, of $840 million to $880 million, and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $0.59 to $0.63 per share. We are very confident of the future, and that is one reason for the increase in the dividend for our shareholders. At the same time, we see many opportunities to invest in our business, and we intend to employ our improving financial position to continue to strengthen our operations and to take advantage of the right opportunities.”\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of operations may include certain unusual and other items which have been separately disclosed, where appropriate, in order to provide a clear assessment of the underlying Company results.

However, the Company considers certain non-IFRS financial measures as useful additional information in measuring the financial performance and condition of the Company. These measures, which the Company believes are widely used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the Company’s performance, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies, nor should they be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.

The decrease in sales was driven by a decrease in the North America operating segment, partially offset by year-over-year increases in sales in Europe and the Rest of the World.\nSales for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the Company’s North America operating segment decreased by $130.6 million or 16.2% to $674.9 million from $805.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was due to a $48.8 million decrease in tooling sales, which are typically dependent on the timing of tooling construction and final acceptance by the customer; the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of U.S. denominated production sales, which had a negative impact on overall sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 of approximately $31.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016; and lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain light-vehicle platforms including the Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, and other platforms late in their life cycle, and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016 such as the previous version of the GM Equinox/Terrain. These negative factors were partially offset by higher year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain light-vehicle platforms such as the Ford Escape and FCA’s Pentastar engine block program; and the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016 including the GM Bolt and next generation GM Equinox/Terrain, fourth quarter production volumes of which were impacted by an employee strike at GM’s assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario.\nSales for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the Company’s Europe operating segment increased by $13.0 million or 8.6% to $164.0 million from $151.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase can be attributed to a $6.4 million increase in tooling sales, a $2.5 million positive foreign exchange impact from the translation of Euro denominated production sales as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and higher overall production volumes in the Company’s Martinrea Honsel German operations including the ramp up of new structural components work and the new V8 AMG engine block for Daimler.\nSales for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the Company’s Rest of the World operating segment increased by $3.7 million or 9.8% to $41.9 million from $38.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to a $4.0 million increase in tooling sales and higher year-over year production sales in the Company’s operating facility in Brazil; partially offset by a $1.1 million negative foreign exchange impact from the translation of foreign denominated production sales as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on the Ford Mondeo/Taurus platforms in China.\nOverall tooling sales decreased by $38.4 million to $68.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $107.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 to year ended December 31, 2016 comparison Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change North America $ 2,913,786 $ 3,222,660 (308,874 ) (9.6 %) Europe 657,029 636,082 20,947 3.3 % Rest of the World 132,067 122,989 9,078 7.4 % Eliminations (12,383 ) (13,324 ) 941 (7.1 %) Total Sales $ 3,690,499 $ 3,968,407 (277,908 ) (7.0 %) The Company’s consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $277.9 million or 7.0% to $3,690.5 million as compared to $3,968.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The total decrease in sales was driven by a decrease in the Company’s North America operating segment, partially offset by year-over-year increases in sales in Europe and the Rest of the World.\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the Company’s North America operating segment decreased by $308.9 million or 9.6% to $2,913.8 million from $3,222.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due to the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of U.S. denominated production sales, which had a negative impact on overall sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $47.7 million as compared to the comparative period of 2016; a $44.9 million decrease in tooling sales; and lower year-over-year OEM production volumes on certain light-vehicle platforms including the Chrysler 200, customer production of which ended at the end of 2016, Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Malibu, and other platforms late in their product life cycle, and programs that ended production during or subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016 such as the previous version of the GM Equinox/Terrain. These negative factors were partially offset by a year-over-year increase in production volumes on FCA’s Pentastar engine block program which was down during the first quarter of 2016 for re-tooling; higher year-over-year volumes on certain light vehicle platforms such as the Ford Escape, GM Pick-up truck/SUV platform and other GM programs previously impacted by unplanned OEM shutdowns during the second quarter of 2016 because of an earthquake in Japan which disrupted the supply chain; and the launch of new programs during or subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016 including the GM Bolt and next generation GM Equinox/Terrain, 2017 production volumes of which were impacted by an employee strike at GM’s assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario that lasted four weeks.\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the Company’s Europe operating segment increased by $20.9 million or 3.3% to $657.0 million from $636.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase can be attributed to higher production volumes in the Company’s Martinrea Honsel German operations including the ramp up of new structural components work and the new V8 AMG engine block for Daimler, and an $8.0 million increase in tooling sales; partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of Euro denominated production sales, which had a negative impact on overall sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $6.3 million as compared to the comparative period of 2016.\nSales for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the Company’s Rest of the World operating segment increased by $9.1 million or 7.4% to $132.1 million from $123.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to a year-over-year increase in production sales in the Company’s operating facility in Brazil and higher year-over-year production sales in China related to GM’s CT6 vehicle platform; partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in tooling sales and a $0.6 million negative foreign exchange impact from the translation of foreign denominated production sales as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOverall tooling sales decreased by $42.0 million to $210.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGROSS MARGIN Three months ended December 31, 2017 to three months ended December 31, 2016 comparison Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change Gross margin $ 124,042 $ 104,312 19,730 18.9% % of Sales 14.1% 10.5% The gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 14.1% increased as a percentage of sales by 3.6% as compared to the gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2016 of 10.5%. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was generally due to:\nproductivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities; general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched, and old programs that ended production, during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016; and a decrease in tooling sales which typically earn low margins for the Company.\nThese positive factors were partially offset by operational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities including upfront costs incurred in preparation of upcoming new programs and related to new business in the process of being launched.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 to year ended December 31, 2016 comparison Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change Gross margin $ 484,601 $ 432,050 52,551 12.2% % of Sales 13.1% 10.9% The gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2017 of 13.1% increased as a percentage of sales by 2.2% as compared to the gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2016 of 10.9%.

Management uses Adjusted Net Income as a measurement of operating performance of the Company and believes that, in conjunction with IFRS measures, it provides useful information about the financial performance and condition of the Company.\nTABLE A Three months ended December 31, 2017 to three months ended December 31, 2016 comparison For the three months ended For the three months ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (a)-(b) (a) (b) Change NET INCOME (A) $32,366 $30,753 $1,613 Add Back - Unusual and Other Items: Gain on sale of land and building (1) (13,374 ) - (13,374 ) Unrealized gain on derivative instruments (2) (2,322 ) - (2,322 ) Impairment of assets (4) 7,488 - 7,488 TOTAL UNUSUAL AND OTHER ITEMS BEFORE TAX ($8,208) - ($8,208) Tax impact of above items (6) (292 ) - (292 ) Impact of US tax reforms on deferred tax asset (7) 19,313 - 19,313 TOTAL UNUSUAL AND OTHER ITEMS - AFTER TAX (B) $10,813 - $10,813 ADJUSTED NET INCOME (A + B) $43,179 $30,753 $12,426 Number of Shares Outstanding – Basic (‘000) 86,593 86,404 Adjusted Basic Net Earnings Per Share $0.50 $0.36 Number of Shares Outstanding – Diluted (‘000) 87,101 86,466 Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share $0.50 $0.36\nTABLE B Year ended December 31, 2017 to year ended December 31, 2016 comparison For the year ended For the year ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (a)-(b) (a) (b) Change NET INCOME (A) $159,543 $92,380 $67,163 Add Back - Unusual and Other Items: Gain on sale of land and building (1) (19,072 ) - (19,072 ) Unrealized gain on derivative instruments (2) (3,697 ) - (3,697 ) Executive separation agreement (3) 1,767 - 1,767 Impairment of assets (4) 7,488 34,579 (27,091 ) Restructuring costs (5) - 3,684 (3,684 ) TOTAL UNUSUAL AND OTHER ITEMS BEFORE TAX ($13,514) $38,263 ($51,777 ) Tax impact of above items (6) 177 (558 ) 735 Impact of US tax reforms on deferred tax asset (7) 19,313 - 19,313 TOTAL UNUSUAL AND OTHER ITEMS - AFTER TAX (B) $5,976 $37,705 ($31,729 ) ADJUSTED NET INCOME (A + B) $165,519 $130,085 $35,434 Number of Shares Outstanding – Basic (‘000) 86,527 86,389 Adjusted Basic Net Earnings Per Share $1.91 $1.51 Number of Shares Outstanding – Diluted (‘000) 86,779 86,527 Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share $1.91 $1.50 (1) Gain on sale of land and building\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company finalized and closed a sale-leaseback arrangement involving the land and building of two of its operating facilities in the Greater Toronto Area. The assets were sold for net proceeds of $31.0 million (net of closing costs of $0.5 million) resulting in a pre-tax gain of $13.4 million. The corresponding leaseback of the assets is for a term of ten years at market rates.\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, in connection with the relocation of an existing operation to another manufacturing facility, a building owned by the Company in Mississauga, Ontario was sold on an “as-is, where-is” basis. The building was sold for proceeds of $9.9 million (net of closing costs of $0.4 million) resulting in a pre-tax gain of $5.7 million.\n(2) Unrealized gain on derivative instruments\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the Company acquired 5.5 million common shares in NanoXplore Inc. (“NanoXplore”), a publicly listed company on the TSX Venture Exchange trading under the ticker symbol GRA, for a total of $2.5 million through a private placement offering (the investment is further described in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements and later on in this MD&A under the section “Investments”). As part of the transaction to acquire the common shares, the Company also received warrants entitling the Company to acquire up to an additional 2.75 million common shares in NanoXplore at a price of $0.70 per share for a period of up to two years after issuance. The warrants in NanoXplore represent derivative instruments and are fair valued at the end of each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded through profit or loss. As at December 31, 2017, the warrants had a fair value of $4.0 million which resulted in an unrealized gain of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $2.3 million was recognized in the fourth quarter, recorded in Other finance income. This unrealized gain has been added back for Adjusted Net Income purposes.\n(3) Executive separation agreement\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, David Rashid ceased to be an Executive Vice President of Operations of the Company. The costs added back for Adjusted Net Income purposes represents Mr. Rashid’s termination benefits (included in SG&A expense) as set out in his employment contract payable over a twelve-month period.\n(4) Impairment of assets\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, in conjunction with the Company’s annual business planning cycle, the Company recorded an impairment charge on PP&E of $7.5 million. The impairment charge related to specific equipment at an operating facility in Canada included in the North America operating segment. The equipment is no longer in use and is not expected to be re-deployed.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded impairment charges on PP&E, intangible assets and inventories totaling $34.6 million (US$26.6 million) related to an operating facility in Detroit, Michigan included in the North America operating segment. The impairment charges resulted from the cancellation of the main OEM light vehicle platform being serviced by the facility, representing the majority of the business, well before the end of its expected life cycle. This led to a decision to close the facility. The impairment charges were recorded where the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their estimated recoverable amounts.\n(5) Restructuring costs\nAs part of the acquisition of Honsel in 2011, a certain level of restructuring was contemplated, in particular, at the Company’s operating facility in Meschede, Germany. In connection with these restructuring activities, $1.8 million (€1.2 million) of employee related severance was recognized during the second quarter of 2016. No further costs related to this restructuring are expected.\nOther additions to the restructuring accrual during 2016 totaled $1.9 million (US$1.4 million) and represent employee-related payouts resulting from the closure of the operating facility in Detroit, Michigan as described above.\n(6) Tax impact of above items\nThe tax impact of the adjustments recorded to income in 2017 of $0.3 million reflects a lower tax effect on the gain on sale of land and building and the unrealized gain on derivative instruments due to the capital nature of the gains for tax purposes (capital gains are generally taxed at lower rates).\nThe tax impact of the adjustments recorded to income during 2016 of $0.6 million represents solely the corresponding tax effect on the $1.8 million in restructuring costs incurred in Meschede, Germany. The $34.6 million in impairment charges and $1.9 million in restructuring costs related to the closure of the operating facility in Detroit, Michigan, as described above, resulted in tax losses that were not benefitted and, as a result, not recognized as deferred tax assets. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets at a point in time, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences; however, forming a conclusion on the realization of deferred tax assets requires judgment when there are recent tax losses.\n(7) Impact of US tax reforms on deferred tax asset\nExtensive changes to the US tax system were enacted on December 22, 2017, which, among other changes, substantially reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% with effect from January 1, 2018. As a result of this change, the Company’s deferred tax asset in the US decreased as at December 31, 2017 with a corresponding one-time, non-cash increase in income tax expense of $19.3 million.\nNET INCOME (ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE COMPANY) Three months ended December 31, 2017 to three months ended December 31, 2016 comparison Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change Net Income $ 32,366 $ 30,753 1,613 5.2% Adjusted Net Income $ 43,179 $ 30,753 12,426 40.4% Net Earnings per Share Basic and Diluted $ 0.37 $ 0.36 Adjusted Net Earnings per Share Basic and Diluted $ 0.50 $ 0.36 Net Income, before adjustments, for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $1.6 million to $32.4 million from $30.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the unusual and other items recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017 as explained in Table A under “Adjustments to Net Income”, Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $43.2 million or $0.50 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, from $30.8 million or $0.36 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, was positively impacted by the following:\nhigher gross profit despite an overall decrease in year-over-year sales as previously explained; productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities; general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched, and old programs that ended production, during or a subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2016; and a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income due generally to the mix of earnings (23.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 24.5% for the fourth quarter of 2016).\nThese factors were partially offset by the following:\noperational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities; a year-over-year increase in SG&A expense as previously discussed; and a year-over-year increase in depreciation expense as previously discussed.\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 actual to guidance comparison: On November 14, 2017, the Company provided the following guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017: Guidance Actual Production sales (in millions) $ 790 - 830 $ 810 Adjusted Net Earnings per Share Basic and Diluted $ 0.45 - 0.49 $ 0.50 For the fourth quarter of 2017, while production sales of $810 million were within the published sales guidance range, Adjusted Net Earnings per Share of $0.50 exceeded the published earnings guidance range due generally to better than expected financial performance at certain operating facilities.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 to year ended December 31, 2016 comparison Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change Net Income $ 159,543 $ 92,380 67,163 72.7% Adjusted Net Income $ 165,519 $ 130,085 35,434 27.2% Net Earnings per Share Basic and Diluted $ 1.84 $ 1.07 Adjusted Net Earnings per Share Basic $ 1.91 $ 1.51 Diluted $ 1.91 $ 1.50 Net Income, before adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $67.1 million to $159.5 million from $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 largely as a result of the increase in the Company’s gross margin, as previously discussed, and the impact of the unusual and other items incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as explained in Table B under “Adjustments to Net Income”. Excluding these unusual and other items, net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $165.5 million or $1.91 per share, on a basic and diluted basis, from $130.1 million or $1.51 per share, on a basic basis, and $1.50 per share, on a diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted Net Income for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was positively impacted by the following:\nhigher gross profit despite an overall decrease in year-over-year sales as previously explained; productivity and efficiency improvements at certain operating facilities; general sales mix including new and replacement programs that launched, and old programs that ended production, during or subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016; a net foreign exchange gain of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net foreign exchange loss of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; a year-over-year decrease in finance expense on the Company’s bank debt and equipment loans; and a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income due generally to the mix of earnings (23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016).\nThese factors were partially offset by the following:\noperational inefficiencies and other costs at certain other facilities; a year-over-year increase in SG&A as previously discussed; a year-over-year increase in depreciation expense as previously discussed; and an increase in research and development costs due to increased new product and process research and development activity.\nADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Three months ended December 31, 2017 to three months ended December 31, 2016 comparison Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Three months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change Additions to PP&E $ 83,815 $ 112,721 (28,906) (25.6%) Additions to PP&E decreased by $28.9 million to $83.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $112.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 due generally to the timing of expenditures. Additions as a percentage of sales decreased year-over-year to 9.5% from 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company continues to make investments in the business in particular at new greenfield operating facilities as these new plants execute on their backlogs of new business.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 to year ended December 31, 2016 comparison Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 $ Change % Change Additions to PP&E $ 251,920 $ 249,454 2,466 1.0% Additions to PP&E increased slightly by $2.5 million year-over-year to $251.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $249.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additions as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year to 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 6.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. While capital expenditures are made to refurbish or replace assets consumed in the normal course of business and for productivity improvements, a large portion of the investment in 2017 continued to be for manufacturing equipment for new and replacement programs that recently launched or will be launching over the next 24 months.\nDIVIDEND\nA cash dividend of $0.03 per share has been declared by the Board of Directors payable to shareholders of record on March 31, 2018, on or about April 15, 2018.\nABOUT MARTINREA\nMartinrea currently employs approximately 15,000 skilled and motivated people in 44 operating divisions in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Slovakia, Spain and China.\nMartinrea’s vision for the future is to be the best, preferred and most valued supplier in the world in the products and services we provide our customers.
