With the organization well positioned for its next chapter, Ms. DuBoe feels it is time for her to pursue her own next chapter in social innovation. Ms. DuBoe has agreed to serve as CEO until her successor is in place.\n“The organization is on the right trajectory and in great hands with an amazing staff and Board. After 15 years with United Way, it’s a good time to turn the reins over to the next leader,” said Ms. DuBoe. “It’s been the honor of my life to serve the organization and work alongside the talented team, Board, donors, volunteers and agencies to fight for the financial stability, health, education and safety of every person in every neighborhood.”\n“Wendy has led the United Way to become one of the most respected and impactful social services organizations in Greater Chicago. The Board is thankful for Wendy’s leadership,” said Pat Canning, UWMC’s Board Chairman and Managing Partner of KPMG. “We will build off the significant momentum of our Neighborhood Network Initiative and are excited about the future of United Way.” Mr. Canning indicated that the Board will retain Koya Leadership Partners to conduct the search for a new CEO, to be led by Alison Ranney, managing partner and head of the Chicago office.\nUnited Way of Metro Chicago is the largest private funder of human services in the Chicago region, raising more than $578 million over the past 10 years. Under Ms. DuBoe’s leadership, United Way implemented its first ten-year measurable community impact plan, launched an innovative and coordinated model for social service delivery at the neighborhood level, and transformed 54 local United Ways into one unified entity.\nPrior to serving as UWMC CEO, Ms. DuBoe served as Interim CEO, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Community Investment Officer and was responsible for creating the organization’s first-ever ten-year regional community investment plan, LIVE UNITED 2020. Plan objectives were achieved four years early in 2016, with more than 9 million people benefiting through improved educational outcomes, access to healthcare, financial stability resources and critical safety net services.\n“Under Wendy’s leadership, United Way has been transformed into an organization that is uniquely qualified to deliver interconnected services in a way that helps communities thrive. Completing the plan four years early generated significant momentum that has helped to unleash the potential of United Way and our community partners,” said Deb DeHaas, United Way Board Member and Vice Chairman of Deloitte.\nBuilding on the success of LIVE UNITED 2020, United Way has instituted an innovative new model for coordinated community response across ten neighborhoods, known as the Neighborhood Network Initiative. Receiving recognition as a promising investment practice for neighborhood well-being, this large-scale collective impact approach has attracted millions of dollars of investment from private and public sources, promoted strategic alliances and generated exciting results.\n“The United Way Neighborhood Network Initiative has been instrumental in helping Austin leaders unite their efforts and coordinate community resources,” said Darnell Shields, Executive Director of Austin Coming Together. “Thanks to the Neighborhood Network approach we’ve been able to sustainably build support for the services that are most needed in the community, driving lasting change in our neighborhood and in the lives of all our residents.”\n“I’m truly thankful for my time with the United Way of Metro Chicago and am proud of the impact we’ve made within our region,” said Ms. DuBoe. “I strongly believe in the work that we do and I look forward to supporting the future success of the organization.”\nTo learn more about United Way of Metro Chicago, visit LIVEUNITEDchicago.org .\n---\nAbout United Way of Metro Chicago\nUnited Way of Metro Chicago fights for the health, education, financial stability and safety of every person in every neighborhood across the region.
