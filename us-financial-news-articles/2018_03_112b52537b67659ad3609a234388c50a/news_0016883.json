Some analysts have said the Ferragamo family had grown impatient with his strategy and expected a quicker turnaround.\nIn February last year, the group said it planned to grow revenue at twice the market rate between 2017 and 2020, backed by a drive to improve performance at existing stores and updates to its product ranges.\nBut since launching its new business plan, the group’s core profit margins have been falling, hurt in part by a clean-up of inventories.\nLast year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 249 million euros ($306 million) were broadly in line with a Thomson Reuters estimate of 244 million euros. As a percentage of sales, the EBITDA margin slipped to 17.8 percent from 22.5 percent in 2016.\nThe company cut its dividend to 0.38 euros per share, down from 0.46 euros paid on 2016 results.\nSince the December profit warning, Ferragamo shares are down about 4.1 percent against a 2.4 percent rise in Italy’s blue-chip index. Trading at 28.6 times its expected earnings, the stock is still seen as expensive by many analysts.\n$1 = 0.8124 euros Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari and Claudia Cristoferi, editing by Valentina Za and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T03:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:32:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
