It has dropped more than 50 percent in the last 12 months.\nHeymann thinks the stock, now trading at just over $14, could hit $20 to $22 a share this year.\nHowever, he conceded, \"It's a small part of the way back.\"\nThe industrial conglomerate is in the middle of restructuring its business in an attempt to restore investor confidence.\nâ€” Reuters contributed to this report. \nDisclosures: William Blair or an affiliate does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research report.
