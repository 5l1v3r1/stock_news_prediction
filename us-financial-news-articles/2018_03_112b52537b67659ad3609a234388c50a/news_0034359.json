In the past 4 years, we've managed to once again double Frutarom's revenues and profits, a result which reflects the successful implementation of the rapid and profitable growth strategy, combining profitable internal growth at higher growth rates than those of the markets in which we operate, together with the strategic acquisitions we have made which are contributing to the continuing and consistent improvement in our results.\n\"The accelerated 19.1% growth in our core activities in 2017, is a result of the continued rapid organic growth of our Flavors activity at an annual rate of 7.2%, and a quarterly rate of 10.2% 4 and our Specialty Fine Ingredients activity at an annual rate of 11.8% 4 and the contribution of the strategic acquisitions we have carried out and merged successfully.\n\"Following the 8 acquisitions we carried out in 2016, we made 12 more acquisitions in 2017, and two additional ones since the beginning of 2018, and we are successfully progressing with the plans for their full merger and integration. We are constantly working on establishing a robust and top quality pipeline of future acquisitions, which support the realization of our plans for rapid growth in our core business activities, while expanding the share of the Flavors activity, which includes establishing market leadership in Savory Solutions and expanding the portfolio of natural solutions we offer our customers in flavors, health, colors and natural antioxidant activities, and accelerating our growth and expanding our market share in North America and emerging markets with high growth rates.\n\"In Addition, we've expanded and deepened our activity in the field of Natural Specialty Fine Ingredients for infant nutrition and clinical elderly nutrition through the acquisition of Enzymotec, whose merger process is progressing successfully and the impressive growth rate of its core products continues. We've also expanded our activity in the growing field of Natural Specialty Fine Ingredients for cosmetics and personal care through the acquisition of IBR at the beginning of 2018.\n\"We are proceeding with our plan to establish global market leadership in natural herbal extracts, as we adopt a vision of embracing global collaborations with research institutes and farmers for the development of varieties and crops of strategic natural raw materials for flavors, colors, health, and cosmetics, which will support our customers' accelerated transition from synthetic to natural fine ingredients.\n\"Frutarom continues to carry out its plan of developing global activity in the field of fragrances with an emphasis on emerging markets with high growth rates through the acquisition of Turpaz and Pollena Aroma in 2017, and Meroar from Argentina in 2018, which have all joined Frutarom's smaller existing businesses in the field of fragrance extracts, especially in India, Africa and Latin America. We intend to further develop this important activity, among other things, by a pipeline of acquisitions that will accelerate our penetration and expand our activity in Fragrances.\n\"Frutarom started 2018 as a growing company with a turnover exceeding US$ 1.5 billion 2 with strong and experienced management, which we are constantly building up, with a global organization operating in over 150 countries, based on a production infrastructure of 73 plants and 90 research and development labs, 110 marketing and sales offices, approximately 5,600 employees, out of them over 1,000 in marketing and sales, and over 600 in R&D, catering to, and maintaining close daily contact with, over 30,000 customers (12,000 of which have joined us through the 39 acquisitions we've carried out in the past 5 years), with a broad and innovative product portfolio that places an emphasis on natural products at the interesting cross section of flavor and health, with a customer focus that gives Frutarom a substantial competitive edge, with local and medium sized producers and the private label manufactures (constituting more than 70% of Frutarom's customer base) growing at a faster rate than the large MNC's.\n\"Frutarom continues to maintain a high rate of liquidity and conservative leveraging, with a net debt/ EBITDA ratio of 1.85, based on a strong cash flow resulting from operating activities, which this year grew at a rate of 50.5% to a record US$ 187.5 million. Thanks to our robust capital structure and the strong cash flow we've attained, we can continue to seize acquisition opportunities, based on our strong top quality pipeline of acquisitions.\n\"We are certain that the organic, rapid and profitable growth, along with our strategic acquisitions, in combination with a continued improvement in the product mix, our focus on natural, healthy products, addressing the demands of billions of consumers worldwide, and the geographic expansion in North America and in the emerging markets with high growth rates, as well as the actions we've taken to optimize our resources, while realizing the cross selling opportunities and operational savings inherent in these acquisitions, establishing a global procurement platform and a strong pipeline of additional strategic, synergetic acquisitions, will support our continued profitable growth in the years to come and the attainment our strategic targets – US$ 2.25 billion in sales with an EBITDA margin of 23% in our core activities, by 2020.\"\nFrutarom, one of the world's 10 largest companies in the field of flavors and specialty fine ingredients, reports another record-breaking results for Q4 2017, and for the entire year, in sales, gross profits, operating profits, EBITDA, net income, earnings per share and cash flow.\nThe accelerated increase in revenues stems from a combination of the accelerated internal growth in Frutarom’s core activities and the acquisitions that were, and are, being successfully merged.\nSales\nFrutarom sales in 2017 rose 18.8% to an annual record of US$ 1,362.4 million, reflecting a 6.4% growth in pro-forma terms on a constant currency basis in comparison to 2016.
