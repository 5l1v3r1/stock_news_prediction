With Infinity’s technology, Cloudian now offers customers integrated file and object-based storage solutions that consolidate all unstructured data types into a limitlessly scalable storage pool. The result is simple storage management that reduces TCO by more than 70 percent when compared with traditional multi-silo NAS systems.\nThe acquisition is the culmination of an existing relationship between Infinity Storage and Cloudian. The companies worked together to launch the Cloudian HyperFile™ NAS controller, which delivers enterprise-class file services from Cloudian HyperStore. Cloudian HyperFile incorporates all NAS features essential for enterprise applications, including SMB(CIFS)/NFS support, snapshot, WORM, non-disruptive failover, scale-out performance, POSIX compliance and Active Directory integration.\nInfinity Storage is a proven innovator in enterprise file systems technology. The firm’s founder Caterina Falchi was an inventor of the write-once-read-many (WORM) file system that provides jukebox file management and transparent access to data within this protected environment. WORM was originally designed to preserve data integrity for regulatory compliance and now also plays a vital role in protecting data from corruption caused by malware or ransomware. Falchi joins Cloudian as vice president of file technologies.\n“For more than a decade, Infinity Storage software has helped enterprise customers simplify file management with enterprise-class features that provide a familiar user experience on next-generation storage platforms,” said Falchi. “While launching HyperFile with Cloudian, we immediately recognized that our company cultures and technologies meshed perfectly. We are genuinely thrilled to be joining the Cloudian team.”\nWhen combined with the limitless scalability of Cloudian HyperStore enterprise storage, HyperFile gives organizations new on-premises options for managing the tsunami of unstructured data, now growing at more than 50 percent annually. Scale-out platforms such as Cloudian’s are becoming an increasingly critical element of the IT landscape. Gartner predicts that, “By 2021, more than 80% of enterprise data will be stored in scale-out storage systems in enterprise and cloud data centers, up from 30% today.”*\n“This acquisition further accelerates Cloudian’s efforts to reduce IT workloads with self-protecting and easy-to-scale file systems that analysts agree are critical for next-generation storage management,” said Michael Tso, CEO of Cloudian. “Not only does Infinity bring deep technology expertise to the table, but also our two companies’ cultures fit perfectly, with the same uncompromising dedication to the customer, to the team and to technical excellence. We are excited to be growing together.”\n*Gartner, Magic Quadrant for Distributed File Systems and Object Storage, 17 October 2017\nAbout Cloudian\nCloudian turns information into insight with an infinitely scalable platform that consolidates, manages and protects enterprise data.
