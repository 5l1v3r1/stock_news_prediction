Thereafter, an integration plan would be drawn up, and only then would details would be made available to employees and markets.\nParent firm BASF said last week the merger will likely close by the end of the third quarter of 2018.\nReporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:12:27.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
