In the second half of 2020, the plant is scheduled to start processing gas extracted from highly productive oil fields in the subsalt area of the Santos Basin. \nReuters reported in August that Petrobras had tried to recruit major global players in the oil industry to build the plant, but got fewer foreign bids than expected due to contractual terms that some found too stringent. \nLarge Brazilian engineering firms implicated in the country’s biggest-ever corruption probe were excluded from bidding on the project, which was meant to be a model of clean contracting. \nYet global heavyweights such as Bechtel Corp, Areva SA and Thyssenkrupp AG balked at clauses letting Petrobras cancel the contract unilaterally, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters at the time. $1 = 3.32 reais Additional reporting by Bruno Federowski in Brasilia Editing by Brad Haynes and David Gregorio", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T17:08:40.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
