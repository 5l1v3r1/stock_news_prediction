But workers and others in this community, where steel has been made for well over a century, see a chance for more jobs and bigger paychecks.\nMany details of the president’s plan to levy a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports have yet to be announced. But steel-industry experts, union officials and workers in mills generally believe the trade protections would give a big lift to the domestic steel industry. American auto and appliance makers, meanwhile, warn the tariffs could increase their costs as well as prices for consumers.\n“Overall it’s going to be great if we’re able to compete against these other countries on a level playing field,” said Jim Johnston, president of Local 1219 of the United Steelworkers in Braddock. He said workers have had a wage freeze since 2014, and added, “Hopefully better wages and benefits come from this.”\nRelated\nSteel and Aluminum Makers Are Among Few to Praise Tariff Plans U.S. Allies Bristle at Trump Tariff Plan Trade Worries Hit Stocks Analysis: Market Signals Allies, Consumers Will Pay Steel-Tariff Bill Trump’s Steel-Tariff Plan Rattles GOP Lawmakers China Tried Hard to Ease Trade Tensions; Trump Had Other Ideas Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter Mr. Johnston, 36 years old, works at U.S. Steel ’s Edgar Thomson Steel Works, a sprawling complex along the Monongahela River east of Pittsburgh that has been churning out steel since Andrew Carnegie opened the plant in 1875.\nOn Friday, as steam was carried away by a stiff wind outside, two blast furnaces produced steel at temperatures of about 2,900 degrees Fahrenheit. Eight-inch-thick slabs of varying widths and lengths made at the plant are rolled thin at other facilities. Much of the steel winds up in washing machines and other appliances.\nDavid Burritt, U.S. Steel’s CEO, hasn’t said what the company would do after the tariffs take effect. A company spokeswoman referred to remarks Mr. Burritt made at the White House on Thursday, in which he agreed that so-called dumping—overseas companies selling steel at a below-market-rate price or sometimes below the cost of production in the U.S.—was killing jobs.\nIn recent years, U.S. Steel has idled operations in Lorain, Ohio, and Granite City, Ill., and experts said those plants could be among the first to come back online once tariffs take effect.\nBob Portogallo, owner of Peppers N’ At, said he supports any policy that would be good for his frequent customers.

Still, its population is just 2,100, down from a peak of about 20,000 in the 1920s.\nRelated Video President Trump signed an executive order in late Tuesday that imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels.

At Peppers N’ At, which has been offering pierogies and 22 beers on tap for nearly a year and a half, owner Bob Portogallo said plant workers are among his best customers.\nHe said of the tariffs: “I don’t have any opinion, except if it’s good for the mill and the guys, it’s good for us.” The plant employs about 600 workers, down from a peak of more than 2,000.\nA storefront in Braddock, Pa., which has many closed businesses but also some new restaurants.

He earns between $70,000 and $80,000 a year, including overtime.\nSome steel-industry analysts cautioned that tariffs could end up hurting steelmakers, for example if higher prices cause their customers to buy steel elsewhere. And they said much uncertainty remains.\n“Who would want to build a steel mill not knowing who is going to be president in three years when the steel mill is finished?” said Charles Bradford, a steel analyst in New York.\nBut many steel-industry backers remain optimistic and said companies with new or planned steel mills in the South and other states that are nonunion could also benefit.\n“It provides breathing space for companies and workers who feel they’re teetering on the edge,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a partnership between manufacturing companies and the steelworkers union.\nWrite to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T18:24:00.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
