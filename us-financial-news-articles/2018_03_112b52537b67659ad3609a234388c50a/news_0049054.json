Moscow has rejected the accusation, saying it amounts to “banditry” on Britain’s part.\nFILE PHOTO: Britain's Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, arrives at the BBC to appear on the Andrew Marr Show, in central London, Britain March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo “For many other governments, what happened in Salisbury sort of crystallized their own frustrations, their own disappointments with the way the Russian state has been behaving,” Johnson said in the interview.\nHe rejected the suggestion that the measures were leading towards a new and dangerous Cold War with Moscow.\n“It’s very, very important to stress that our quarrel is not with the people of Russia, not with Russian culture, civilization ... Our quarrel is exclusively with the Kremlin and the current administration ...\n“The objective of this global collective action is for the world to signal that the doubts and fears about that Kremlin action have crystallized,” Johnson said.\n“Russia is a great, great country, but it doesn’t have to be great in this way, and what the world is saying to Russia today is that particular style of behavior, ... these endless provocations — we’ve had enough of them.”\nReporting by Kevin Liffey; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T00:24:57.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
