The company, which expects to close the deal next month, is also using funds from a term loan.\nMorgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc will provide the financing for the deal, the company said.\nInovalon’s shares were up 1 percent at $12.52.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:23:53.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
