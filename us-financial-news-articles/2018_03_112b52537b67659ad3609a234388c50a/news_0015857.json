This must allow regulators to cooperate to make it work, Hammond said, something that Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has called for.\nLondon’s role as a global financial centre should be looked at as a European asset, not a British asset, Hammond said.\n“(This) is not a zero sum game, where any loss of market share in London is automatically a gain to another EU capital,” Hammond said in a speech in London’s financial centre.\nNew York, Singapore and Hong Kong instead would likely be the beneficiaries, he added.
