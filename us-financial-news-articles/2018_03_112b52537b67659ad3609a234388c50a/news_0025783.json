The council, which includes the finance minister and central bank governor, said in a statement after its quarterly meeting that it was monitoring the situation closely. France’s financial stability council has been concerned about record levels of private debt and heavy borrowing by large companies that are financing themselves at rock-bottom rates on the bond market. The council said in December that it could impose a counter-cyclical buffer on banks, effectively requiring them to hold extra capital against their risks, if corporate borrowing did not slow this year. Officials said there had been serious discussion on Tuesday about imposing the buffer.
