Bautista Agut overcame a slow start to outclass his opponent and stay in the hunt for his second title of the season. The Auckland Classic champion takes on wildcard Malek Jaziri for a place in the final. Jaziri defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas, 6-4 3-6 6-3. “I think I played very good tennis,” Bautista Agut said. “It was not easy to beat Borna... he’s very solid. He was hitting very good serves and playing very aggressively. I didn’t rest all match.” Bautista Agut, who trailed 3-1 early in the contest, fought back to claim the opening set in the tiebreak. He then won a decisive break at 4-4 in the second set and pushed on to reach his first Dubai semi-final. Jaziri recovered from losing the second set to pull away to reach his third semi-final on the Tour. “It’s a great feeling,” Tunisian Jaziri said. “I am playing the best tennis of my life.” Second seed Lucas Pouille battled back after losing the first set to Japan’s Yuichi Sugita to win 3-6 6-3 6-2. The Frenchman takes on the winner of the match between Filip Krajinovic and Evgeny Donskoy.
