Woebcken, president and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, speaks near a 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 9, 2017.

That has made executives nervous in an industry that is global. The Trump administration has also proposed tariffs on Chinese goods.
