In recent weeks, the flurry of high-profile firings and resignations appears to have gained momentum. News reports, as well as statements from Trump himself, heavily suggest more officials could be leaving the administration in short order. Joshua Roberts | Reuters Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson speaks to employees of the agency in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2017. \nThe Trump administration is snipping away at loose ends — and more cuts could be coming. \nIn his first year as president, Donald Trump has parted with top-level staff at a higher rate than his five most recent predecessors, according to a recent study . \nWithin Trump's first 12 months in the White House he lost Chief of Staff Reince Priebus , national security advisor Michael Flynn , senior advisor Steve Bannon and press secretary Sean Spicer , to name a few. \nIn recent weeks, the flurry of high-profile firings and resignations appears to have gained momentum. Since February alone , Trump's top diplomat, top economic advisor, staff secretary, communications director and personal assistant have exited his administration. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson 's dismissal on Tuesday came as a surprise even to Tillerson himself, according to a statement from a State Department spokesman who was fired the same day by the White House for reportedly contradicting the official message. \nBut they may not be the last shoes to drop, as recent news reports portray a White House in disarray. \nEven the president implied that further staff changes could be forthcoming. Following the revelation of Tillerson's removal on Tuesday, Trump told reporters outside the White House: \"We're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.\" \nHere's a list of Trump administration officials to keep an eye on: David Shulkin Getty Images U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin talks to reporters in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House May 31, 2017 in Washington, DC. \nDespite running the Department of Veteran Affairs for nearly the whole of Trump's presidency, Secretary Shulkin has managed to keep a much lower profile than many of his colleagues. A bombshell report from the Washington Post last week, however, revealed that Shulkin has shied away from his senior staff as much as he has from the press. \nThe Post, citing interviews with 16 administration officials and other observers, reported that Shulkin has distanced himself from his senior management team over perceived threats to his tenure. Mistrust runs so high that his office in Washington is now protected by an armed guard, the Post reported. \nIn February, Shulkin was pilloried by an inspector general's report for accepting tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament and allowing his wife to fly with him to Europe using taxpayer money. \nTrump is considering replacing Shulkin with Energy Secretary Rick Perry , the New York Times reported Tuesday . \nShulkin also happens to be the only member of Trump's Cabinet who was originally an appointee of the Obama administration — a circumstance that has not worked in the favor of other former Trump staff . Ben Carson Joshua Roberts | Reuters Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson speaks to employees of the agency in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2017. \nFor weeks, Carson 's role as the secretary of Housing and Urban Development has been engulfed in scandal over renovations to the executive dining room in HUD's Washington office that included the planned purchase of $31,000 in hardwood furniture. \nWhen reports of the exorbitantly priced dining set — well above the legal maximum of $5,000 — first emerged, a HUD spokesman said Carson played no role in ordering the dining room set and was unaware of it at the time. \nBut a trove of new emails show that Carson's wife, Candy, was involved in selecting the new furniture. Furthermore, some of the emails show Carson himself may have helped pick out the new set, CNN reported . \nOn Wednesday, HUD spokesman Raffi Williams told CNBC: \"When presented with options by professional staff, Mrs. Carson participated in the selection of specific styles.\" H.R. McMaster Getty Images National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster \nIn early March, NBC News reported that the White House was preparing for national security advisor McMaster 's imminent resignation, which could be coming as soon as April. \nMcMaster, a retired Army general and author of \"Dereliction of Duty,\" the much-heralded analysis of U.S. military strategy during the Vietnam war, joined the Trump administration in February 2017. He replaced Michael Flynn, who the White House said was fired after he allegedly misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \nMcMaster is often viewed as a moderating influence against the more hawkish military voices near Trump. But the recent firing of Tillerson and national economic advisor Gary Cohn 's departure could indicate that Trump is becoming further influenced by the anti-establishment sect of his Cabinet, which would pose a threat to McMaster's tenure.
