The move will allow Daiya to greatly expand strategic operations and accelerate innovation of its signature, plant-based foods, while also significantly increasing the number of new full and part-time positions.\nThe new facility features a vast 400,000 square foot space that will provide Daiya with enough capacity to generate $1 billion in revenue, and also affords increased space for distribution, warehousing and administrative offices. The company signed a long term lease with Blackwood Partners Management Corporation for the space. The building is BOMA BEST - Level Bronze by the Building Owners and Managers Association of BC, and previously served as a distribution center for The Brick.\n\"Today's consumers are now embracing plant-based foods as a great-tasting option that promotes a healthier lifestyle,\" says Terry Tierney, Daiya CEO. \"We are expanding to enable our teams to continue to do the work that will further surprise and delight consumers around the world and accommodate our aggressive hiring growth plans over the next 2-5 years. Our new headquarters represents a long-term investment in the futureâ€”not only for the Daiya brand but also for plant-based foods overall. Most importantly, it enables us to continue pioneering our delicious plant-based products for every part of the day and bringing the incredible benefits of a plant-forward lifestyle to more people around the globe.\"\nDaiya anticipates beginning product production in the new facility in Q2 of 2019 and estimates completion of the relocation of its employees by midyear 2020.\n\"Daiya is a forward thinking company that is having a very positive impact on our health and the global environment.
