(NYSE:EBS) today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the company’s management to implement a stock repurchase program for up to $50 million of the company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n“Given our strong balance sheet position, we have the ability to simultaneously make opportunistic share repurchases, invest in research and development, and continue to pursue our acquisition strategy as we work to achieve our 2020 operational and financial goals,” said Robert G. Kramer Sr., executive vice president, administration and chief financial officer of Emergent BioSolutions. “The implementation of this board-approved share repurchase program provides us with another tool to deliver shareholder value.”\nThe term of the board authorization of the repurchase program is until December 31, 2019. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nThe repurchase program will be funded using the company's working capital. As of December 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $178 million. The company had approximately 49.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 19, 2018.\nUnder the prior board-approved repurchase program, which expired on December 31, 2017, the company purchased approximately 789,000 shares, utilizing approximately $33 million of the $50 million authorized by the prior program.\nAbout Emergent BioSolutions\nEmergent BioSolutions Inc. is a global life sciences company seeking to protect and enhance life by focusing on providing specialty products for civilian and military populations that address accidental, intentional, and naturally occurring public health threats.
