Uber's logo is pictured at its office in Tokyo, Japan, November 27, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The proposed decision, issued by a commissioner for the California Public Utilities Commission, said that Uber should be classified as a charter-party carrier, a category of transportation known as TCP that mandates cars and buses comply with certain insurance and inspection requirements. As part of the proposed ruling, Uber is required to pay three years of back fees. There will be a period for public comment before the commission votes on the proposed regulation change.
