I don't believe that they're committed to doing that now,\" Cohen, currently the chairman and CEO of consultancy The Cohen Group, said Sunday at the China Development Forum in Beijing.\nWhile North Korea appeared willing to sit down with the U.S. to talk, according to Cohen, it was worth noting that the hermit nation had also never complied with prior agreements.\n\"I'm skeptical that they would really get rid of all their nuclear weapons,\" he said.\nCohen last year warned that North Korea was the \"most dangerous issue\" facing the world, a claim he said was still true today.\nOther analysts and experts have cautioned that it was important to manage expectations around the meeting . Following the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" policy on North Korea, the agreement to meet with Kim could potentially erode the effectiveness of sanctions, some indicated.\nAnother factor in the mix has been Trump's pick to replace H.R. McMaster as national security advisor: John Bolton , a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Bolton, who is regarded as a foreign policy super-hawk , had previously argued for preemptive strikes against North Korea.\nAlthough it's too early to tell how Bolton will influence policy, Cohen highlighted that rhetoric was an important consideration going forward.\n\"I think there's reason for concern, in terms of Mr. Bolton, in terms of his positions, because he is much more aggressive in terms of the use of force ... So I think we have to be careful of our language, that the rhetoric doesn't get ahead of the policy,\" Cohen said.\nâ€” CNBC's Nyshka Chandran contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T06:18:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
