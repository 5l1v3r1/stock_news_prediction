Smith would stay with Vice, but in a different role, and will probably be involved in deal making and on the content side. Variety reported Dubuc's replacement earlier. \nDubuc was recently considered to lead Amazon Studios following the ouster of Roy Price , but she ultimately withdrew her name from consideration.
