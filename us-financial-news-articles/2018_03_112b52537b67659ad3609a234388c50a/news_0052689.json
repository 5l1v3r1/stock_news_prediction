The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said \"The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify\".\nOn the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers' invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong.\nThe company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.\nThe head of the committee called Zuckerberg's decision \"astonishing\" and urged him to think again.\nChristopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.\nAggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie's remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.\nCambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.\nIn full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers this week Zuckerberg said the app built by a university researcher \"leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014\".\nHe apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy.\nThe U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.\nThe U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee had already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called \"substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.\"\n(Writing by Susan Thomas Editing by James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T01:04:44.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
