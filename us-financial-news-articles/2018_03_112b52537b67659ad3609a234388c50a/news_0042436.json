With our enhanced SecureTide product, expanded geographic presence and new Nautical platform, we believe we are well positioned to help our partners succeed in a cloud-centric world.”\n“We did our homework before making the decision to join forces with AppRiver,” said Dianne Skoll, Roaring Penguin’s founder and CEO. “The company’s reputation for incredible customer service, combined with its long track record in the security space, reassured us that our partners and clients will be well taken care of.”\nThe Roaring Penguin acquisition brings intellectual property, which includes innovative anti-spam techniques, that will integrate with AppRiver’s existing SecureTide platform and build on the strengths of both.\n“Cybercriminals never stop innovating, and neither can we,” said Joel Smith, AppRiver’s CTO and co-founder. “Many companies in the spam and virus filtering space have become stagnant in terms of new technology and cutting-edge tactics. We intend to stay ahead of the pack and the bad guys by continuously improving our security. Roaring Penguin’s automated system will give us an important edge.”\nSmith noted that Roaring Penguin’s machine-driven, statistical analysis methodology for identifying unwanted messages will make AppRiver’s proprietary MessageSniffer® engine more effective. AppRiver’s platform adds human cognition to advanced technology that will, in turn, improve the performance of Roaring Penguin’s filtering.\n“Each system will be enhanced by integrating with the other,” he said. “The result will be spam and virus protection that is more effective than either could be individually or even deployed in-line. The whole really is greater than the sum of the parts.”\nThe Roaring Penguin acquisition also gives AppRiver a beachhead in Canada from which it can expand its highly successful Office 365 business. Changing business rules had effectively limited AppRiver’s sales of the Microsoft platform to the US, even as it continued to grow its cloud-based cybersecurity customer base in Canada. With a physical location in Ottawa, the company can once again offer Office 365 in the thriving market north of the border.\n“Roaring Penguin becoming part of AppRiver just makes a lot of sense on many levels,” Skoll said. “We spent two decades developing and perfecting technology that will now be available to a much larger base of users as part of a true best-of-breed, spam and virus filtering system.”\nCustomers and partners of Roaring Penguin have been notified of the changes and the transition to AppRiver is expected to be complete by mid-year. Officials of both companies expect no disruption of service during the change.\nAbout AppRiver\nFounded in 2002 primarily as a spam and virus filtering company, AppRiver has since expanded its offering to a full suite of cybersecurity and productivity solutions including web malware protection, email encryption, secure archiving and email continuity services. The company is also among the world’s largest providers of Microsoft Office 365 and Secure Hosted Exchange, which are both backed by AppRiver’s award-winning, white-glove customer support. The company was recently awarded its fifth consecutive Stevie™ Award for exceptional customer service.\nMore than 60,000 companies worldwide use AppRiver to maintain secure and reliable messaging systems and protect themselves against a growing number of cybersecurity threats. Among AppRiver’s numerous growth milestones is its inclusion in Inc. 5000’s list of the fastest growing private companies in America for 11 consecutive years.\nFor more information or questions, contact:\nJim McClellan\n850.932-5338 x6452\njmcclellan@appriver.com\nAttachment:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9336a60f-1c74-421a-8417-21b1d6737a2e\nJim McClellan AppRiver 850-932-5338 jmcclellan@appriver.com\nSource: AppRiver", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9336a60f-1c74-421a-8417-21b1d6737a2e/en", "http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9336a60f-1c74-421a-8417-21b1d6737a2e", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G81LUvCRFtTFe8mYzjDV-E0uMabK7RGfttVEeCwUxiUijxac89E5VLCip2cxOaGMwrBMz5Nsmv4ta3kMn70R2-wCpEt1vzUBqsBp9MtzMDY66Vis1HWjDfKIMDOgIZihc8Ozc1vot_UQK5zyqn6O37F-TKE6uGQtnmzYVxJ-mBg8sq1a1i7vz1AifL3OMaQAQfD9adycK5HVpCdT-goOUGRUmOL1OQEx5-JVD64BcA1bAsLOBnYUd43KVZa3bZ6vjmcd5kjFqj9pMbugrgAjFQ=="], "published": "2018-03-26T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:02:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
