The index was -0.78 in the prior week.\nA negative reading suggests looser-than-average financial conditions, while a positive reading points to tighter-than-average conditions.\nOverall financial conditions are still loose, which is supportive of economic growth. But they have tightened since late 2017 with rising interest rates and increased market volatility, analysts said.\nThe gauge is a composite of three components that measure leverage, credit conditions and volatility and funding risk in the financial sector.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:32:55.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
