(“ANP”) Acquisition.\nAmerican Nutritional Products, Inc. certifications\nINCC is proud to be moving forward with acquiring ANP., a Carson City, Nevada nutraceutical manufacturer. Owned by the former owners of Vitamin Research Products (“VRP”), Rob and Maria Watson built the NSF cGMP Organic 55 thousand square foot facility to house the VRP and Complementary Prescriptions (“CP”) physician’s brands. Combined they have over 50 plus years of industry experience. In 2010 they sold the brands with revenues exceeding $25 million with the highest retention rate the buyers had ever seen (80 plus percent).\nIn 2016 after the buyers failed and vacated the building, Maria Watson made the decision to \"start over\".\nA little background on Maria. Tragically in 1987 Maria Watson lost her 3-year-old son Joshua to a drunk driver. After three years of horrific depression she was introduced to an amino acid formula, which changed her life and put her on a mission to help others. She immersed herself in research, learning everything she could about nutrients and their effects on the mind and body. For Maria, this is a passion NOT a job!\nRob was ready to retire … Maria lasted three weeks in retirement! Unable to sit still she accepted a 2 year position as CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) for Neogenis now Human N and was part of the team that created “SuperBeets”.\nThe facility outfitted with breakthrough technologies, cutting-edge tools, and the original team of formulators was regrouped and was ready with the name “American Nutritional Products Inc.”.\nANP capabilities include contract manufacturing and co packing of:\nPowders; Capsules; Creams Lotions; Liquids; Tinctures; Vape oils\nThis acquisition will provide Vertical integration between the BluDog brand and manufacturing.\nhttp://www.anp-nv.com/about/\nIn addition to www.BluDogProducts.com INCC will own, post acquisition, the following brands:\nhttps://www.perfectvitaminproducts.com/\nhttps://www.scientifichealthsolutions.com/\nhttps://www.fullspectrumhemp.com/\n“We are excited about integrating and acquiring more nutraceutical co-packers as we venture off into a traditional roll up. Between the economies of scale and the natural symbiosis of our brands and manufacturing I believe we have a real tiger by the tail!” said Antonio Uccello, CEO BluDog Products LLC.\nBluDog Products is strategically introducing a water-soluble CBD oil super food and wellness drinks (with an extended release formulation) that are easily absorbed.
