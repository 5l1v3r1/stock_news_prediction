Jakob Chychrun and Richard Panik also scored for Arizona while Max Domi furnished three assists and Christian Fischer provided a pair of helpers.\nCoyotes goalie Antti Raanta posted his fourth win in five games while stopping 31 of 34 shots.\nZach Parise and Mikko Koivu had Minnesota’s other goals. Wild netminder Alex Stalock blocked 21 of 25 shots. Arizona was good on one of two power plays, while Minnesota converted just one of four.\nParise put Minnesota on the scoreboard first, at 15:36 of the opening period, after taking a cross-ice pass from Nino Niederreiter. The tally came with Minnesota using an extra attacker due to a delayed Arizona penalty.\nParise, who has missed most of the season following back surgery that kept him sidelined until Jan. 2, has points in three of his past four games. The goal was only his fourth of the season.\nChychrun drew the Coyotes even during a power play at 17:28 of the second period. Normally a defenseman, Chychrun whipped in a shot after moving up to right wing for a face-off. Moments after the puck was dropped, he and Clayton Keller dug the puck out of Domi’s skates. A split second later, Chychrun put the puck in the net for only his second goal of the season.\nDvorak gave the Coyotes a 2-1 lead 4:32 into the third period, but Koivu replied for the Wild during a power play less than three minutes later. The score did not stay tied for long, though.\nPanik scored 49 seconds later, stuffing in Dvorak’s rebound to give the Coyotes a 3-2 advantage. Domi, who was the subject of trade speculation before Monday’s deadline, launched the scoring play by sending a lead pass to Dvorak.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:46:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
