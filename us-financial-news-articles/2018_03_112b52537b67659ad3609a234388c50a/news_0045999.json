He tweeted an image of a rose gold version of the phone and said that the device was “in production,” Mac Rumors reports . \nApple introduced the iPhone X, which starts at $999, in November of 2017 as its top-of-the-line smartphone. But some analysts say it hasn’t been as big a seller as anticipated thanks to its high price tag, and perhaps an additional color will help increase its appeal.
