A change to filtered tailings, for example, will reduce the environmental disturbance from tailings and waste rock, it added.\n“This compact mine plan utilizes industry best practice to minimize disturbance to the natural environment, including surface water and ground water impacts,” the report said.\nIt will cost an estimated $689 million to build the mine, which has 3.77 million ounces of gold reserves, 779 million pounds of copper and a 23-year operation plan.\nThe report projects a 21 percent after-tax internal rate of return and net present value of $925 million.\nGreece, which launched arbitration with Eldorado in November, has argued that the company violated its contractual obligations by submitting a deficient plan for a metallurgical plant to process ore.\nProceedings are expected to conclude by April 6, Eldorado said in a recent filing.\nLast year, as permitting delays slowed development in the second half, Skouries’ capital expenditure came in at $73.2 million.\nThe project ramp-down is near completion, Eldorado said in a filing. For 2018, it has forecast $20 million in development capital with future care and maintenance costs estimated at $3 million to $5 million annually.
