Many people feel helpless and think things can’t be changed and the central government will eventually take control over Hong Kong,” said 20-year-old student Peter Lee who attended a pro-democracy rally of a few hundred people.\n“But that’s why we need to come out now to demand changes, before it’s too late.”\nHis preferred candidate, student activist Agnes Chow, 21, has already been disqualified because she supports Hong Kong’s right to self-determination, which China sees as a front for outright independence.\nChow and her party, Demosisto, say they are not advocating independence but instead demanding a referendum on Hong Kong’s future, which would include independence, among other options.\nHong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula which guarantees it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including limited democracy.\nBut massive street protests in 2014 failed to ensure universal suffrage, with Beijing vetting candidates for the territory’s leader chosen by a small electoral group stacked with pro-Beijing elite.\nBanners showing portraits of pro-democracy candidate Au Nok-hin are displayed during an election campaign at the financial Central district in Hong Kong, China March 3, 2018.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip ‘STRATEGY TO DIMINISH AUTONOMY’ While city-wide elections that fill up half the 70-seat legislature once every four years are seen as the most open, international confidence in Hong Kong’s electoral freedom was shaken after candidates and elected lawmakers were ousted.\nThe European Union in January criticized a government decision to bar Chow from running, while former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who represented London in meetings with Beijing in the two years leading up to the 1997 handover, called the disqualifications “unacceptable”.\n“They reinforce the concern, that has already been expressed, that there may be a strategy to diminish Hong Kong’s autonomy in a step by step process over the years,” he wrote in a foreword to a report published by British non-government organization Hong Kong Watch on Thursday.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Among the 15 candidates is ousted lawmaker Edward Yiu, a 53-year-old surveyor and former professor who emerged as an unlikely politician after the 2014 protests.\nAfter working as a legislator for nearly a year, last July a Hong Kong court, citing a Beijing interpretation, ruled Yiu’s oath of office invalid because he had added a few phrases, including a vow to fight for universal suffrage.\n“This election is a vote of no confidence against the disqualifications and against authoritarianism,” Yiu said.\nHong Kong’s pro-democracy camp emerged victorious in the 2016 city-wide poll that saw a record turnout sending a crop of new young activists and protest leaders into the legislature.\nBut the city’s then chief executive won lawsuits against the six over the validity of their oaths, some laden with profanities and demands for independence, stripping them of their seats.\nTwo more by-elections are expected to be held after an appeal filed by two of the six legislators is over.\nAt the height of the oath-taking saga, Beijing’s parliament issued a pre-emptive legal interpretation over how Hong Kong oaths should be taken while the case was heard in court, sparking the ire of 2,000 lawyers protesting against its perceived interference over the city’s vaunted rule of law.\nBut the pro-establishment camp said it was the lawmakers’ own fault for not taking their oaths solemnly and challenging Beijing’s red line.\nReporting by Venus Wu; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T08:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T02:44:53.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
