Riley Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:RILY), a diversified provider of financial and business advisory services, has reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nRevenues totaled $110.2 million, up from $92.4 million in third quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $21.4 million Adjusted net income totaled $11.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share Net loss of $6.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share (includes additional one-time tax expense of $13.1 million or $0.50 per diluted share in form of non-cash charges related to impact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act)\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nRevenues totaled $322.2 million, up from $190.4 million in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $69.8 million Adjusted net income totaled $38.5 million or $1.59 per diluted share Net income totaled $11.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share\n\"2017 was a milestone year for our company with our acquisitions of FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities in June and July of last year. The fourth quarter marked the first time we introduced our combined brokerage division under the name of B. Riley FBR, Inc. In the first two quarters together, we’ve begun to realize the benefits of our larger, but leaner platform. Since merging the companies in the third quarter of 2017, B. Riley FBR has contributed to a 33% increase in revenues in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter for our Capital Markets segment,” said Bryant Riley, Chairman and CEO, B. Riley Financial. “We are excited by the overall momentum our combined Capital Markets business has created, namely through an enhanced equity research offering and a substantive increase in deal flow. Our ability to use our strong balance sheet to facilitate transactions has also had a meaningful effect, and we believe this is a key differentiator for both our clients and companies under coverage. Looking ahead, our focus on growing our current talent base, both from within and with strategic hires, will help us continue to build on this momentum as we look to expand on the breadth and depth of capabilities we offer our clients.”\n“2017 also represented another strong year for our Valuations and Appraisals business with record revenues of $33.3 million driven by an increase in the volume of appraisal engagements. Our Appraisals business continues to be one of our most consistent segments in terms of performance, and we’re pleased to see this continued steady growth,” added Riley. “Results in our Auction and Liquidations segment were less favorable in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016 in which we completed two large retail liquidation engagements. Despite that, our outlook for this business remains strong. Finally, we continue to be excited about our Principal Investments platform and the performance of United Online, which continues to generate significant income for us. We look forward to completing the acquisition of magicJack over the next several months, which should further increase the income contributions to our Principal Investments platform.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary\nThe increase in fourth quarter revenues to $110.2 million from the $93.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by the completed acquisitions of FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities in June and July of 2017, respectively.\nCapital Markets Segment : Revenues for the fourth quarter 2017 totaled $84.4 million compared to $16.5 million in reported revenue from the same year-ago period. The $67.9 million increase in year-over-year revenues was primarily driven by the acquisitions of FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities. On a sequential basis, results demonstrate a 33% increase in revenues from the $63.7 million recorded for the third quarter of 2017, the first full quarter in which results from FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities were included. Segment income generated $14.3 million for the quarter compared with $6.2 million in the same year-ago period. Auction and Liquidation Segment : Fourth quarter revenues totaled $4.2 million compared to $51.9 million in the same year-ago period. The decrease in fourth quarter revenues was primarily due to a $28.3 million decline in services and fees and a $19.3 million decrease in the sale of goods. Segment income totaled $0.1 million for the quarter, compared to $24.2 million in the same year-ago period. Reported revenues for this segment are expected to vary substantially from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Valuation and Appraisal Segment : Fourth quarter revenues totaled $8.5 million compared to $8.9 million in the same year-ago period. The decrease of $0.4 million was primarily due to a decline in fee-based revenues related to appraisal engagement. Segment income for the quarter totaled $2.5 million compared with $2.8 million in the same year-ago period. Principal Investments - United Online Segment : Fourth quarter revenues, which are primarily from services and fees for internet access and related subscription services, totaled $13.0 million compared to $15.9 million in the same year-ago period. Segment income for the quarter was $5.3 million, down from $5.8 million in the same year-ago period.\nThe company recorded a net loss of $6.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, due to an additional one-time tax expense of $13.1 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the form of a non-cash charge relating to the impact of U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. This compares to $12.4 million or $0.64 per diluted share recorded in the same year-ago period.\nAdjusted net income (excluding the impact of share-based payments, fair value adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, insurance settlement recovery, transaction costs, tax impact of aforementioned adjustments, and certain tax items) totaled $11.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to $14.8 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. (See note regarding \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.)\nAdjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction and restructuring expenses, insurance settlement recoveries, fair value adjustments, and share-based compensation) for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $21.4 million. This compares to $25.1 million in the same year-ago period. (See note regarding \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.)\nAs of December 31, 2017, B. Riley Financial had $132.8 million in unrestricted cash, $19.7 million of restricted cash, $31.5 million due from clearing brokers, $117.1 million of net securities and other investments owned, and $205.9 million of debt. Total B. Riley Financial stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was $266.0 million.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue for the full year 2017 totaled $322.2 million, up from $190.4 million for the same year-ago period.\nCapital Markets Segment : Revenues totaled $189.7 million compared to $39.3 million in 2016. The significant increase is attributed to the additional revenues driven by the acquisitions of FBR & Co. and Wunderlich Securities in 2017. Segment income for the year totaled $15.9 million, compared with $6.1 million in 2016. Auction and Liquidation Segment : Revenues totaled $47.4 million compared to $87.7 million in 2016, due to a decline in services, fees and the sale of goods for the year. Segment income totaled $11.2 million for the year compared to $41.1 million in 2016. Valuation and Appraisal Segment : Despite a slight decrease for the quarter, 2017 was a record year for this segment with annual revenue totaling $33.3 million compared to $31.7 million in 2016. The uptick in this segment was driven primarily by an increase in the volume of appraisal engagements conducted for the year. Segment income totaled $9.7 million for the year compared to $8.9 million in 2016. Principal Investments - United Online Segment : Revenues totaled $51.7 million for the year compared to $31.5 million in 2016. Segment income totaled $19.5 million for 2017 compared to $9.2 million in 2016. The significant increases in segment revenues and income are reflective of 2017 being the first full year with United Online under B. Riley Financial since its acquisition on July 1, 2016.\nNet income for the full year 2017 totaled $11.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $21.5 million or $1.17 per diluted share in the same year-ago period.\nAdjusted net income for the full year 2017 increased to $38.5 million or $1.59 per diluted share from $27.7 million or $1.51 per diluted share for the full year 2016. (See note regarding \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.)\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 increased to $69.8 million, compared to $48.9 million for the full year 2016. (See note regarding \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for further discussion of this non-GAAP term.)\nDeclaration of Dividend\nOn March 7, 2018, B. Riley Financial’s board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and a special dividend of $0.08, which will be paid on or about April 3, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 20, 2018.\nConference Call\nB.
