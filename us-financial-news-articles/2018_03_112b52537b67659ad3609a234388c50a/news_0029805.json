Counter-terrorism police are investigating the death as a precaution because of the associations that the man, aged in his 60s, is believed to have had. Police were called at 2246 GMT (6.46 p.m. ET) on Monday to a residential address in Clarence Avenue, New Malden, where a man in his 60s was found dead. “The death is currently being treated as an unexplained,” said London police.“There is no evidence to suggest a link to the incident in Salisbury.” Police did not release the man’s name saying the man had not been formally identified. Nikolai Glushkov, 68, who lived in Clarence Avenue and was a former associate of the late Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, was found dead in London on Monday, his associates said.
