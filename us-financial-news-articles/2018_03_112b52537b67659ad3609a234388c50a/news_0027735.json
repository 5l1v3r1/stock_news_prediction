The blast happened in the province of Kampong Speu, 50 km (31 miles) west of the capital, Phnom Penh, said provincial police chief Sam Samoun. “We don’t know what happened yet, all we know is that there was an explosion,” he said, adding that the two Australians were in their 40s and that Cambodian armymen made up the rest of the victims. The army is also investigating the blast, said defense ministry spokesman Chhum Sucheat. The Australian embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
