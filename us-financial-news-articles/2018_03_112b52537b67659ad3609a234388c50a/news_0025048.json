You know there is going to be a charge tomorrow and someone is going to play well. I just have to go out there and try to execute like I did today and see how it goes.\n“I’m going to rock up tomorrow and do the same as I’ve done all week. It’s such a hard golf course that you have got to play well. I’ll try to get a good night of sleep tonight and go from there.”\nScotland’s Stephen Gallacher is a shot below the leading duo after an impressive round that saw him hit five birdies and an eagle to card a five-under 67.\nArgentina’s Emiliano Grillo, who entered the weekend with a four-shot lead, had a round to forget after carding a six-over 78 to drop to joint-fourth alongside Briton Andrew Johnston and Austrian Matthias Schwab at five-under.\nSpaniard Pablo Larrazabal and American Kim Sihwan are joint-seventh at four-under while Paul Peterson, Portugal’s Ricardo Gouveia and Briton Aaron Rai are a further shot behind.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T22:49:28.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
