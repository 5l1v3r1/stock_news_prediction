REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo Smurfit reaffirmed its rejection of a takeover offer from International Paper Co ( IP.N ) (IP) on Wednesday after its U.S. rival revealed that it had offered 22 euros in cash and 0.3028 new International Paper share for each Smurfit share in a bid worth 8 billion euros.\nSmurfit Kappa shares, which surged more than 18 percent on Tuesday after it flagged the approach, were 5.8 percent higher at 35.80 euros by 1440 GMT, having hit an all-time high of 36.40 euros on the Bloomberg report.\nA spokesman for Smurfit Kappa declined to comment and repeated that the offer put forward by IP fails entirely to reflect the groupâ€™s prospects as an independent business and represents a valuation multiple significantly below recent comparable transactions.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin and Helen Reid in London; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:23:46.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
