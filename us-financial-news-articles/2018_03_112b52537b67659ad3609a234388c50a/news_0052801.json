They have begun to demand an explicit statement from Bahrain on its expectations for aid before they commit fresh money, fund managers in Europe and the Gulf said. \nAt the recent meetings with investors, Bahraini officials were asked about the prospects for aid but did not give specific answers, according to fund managers who attended the meetings. \n“Bahrain’s fundamentals on a stand-alone basis remain among the worst of all emerging market sovereigns globally,” said Richard Briggs, emerging markets credit strategist at London-based CreditSights. \n“That being said, support from Bahrain’s neighbours is likely to be forthcoming. Without that support Bahrain would be highly likely to be facing a balance of payments crisis.” \nThe pricing of the new sukuk, which yield 6.875 percent, was generous to investors, fund managers said. Yields on Bahrain’s existing sukuk maturing in 2024 and 2025 jumped about 50 basis points on Wednesday when Bahrain announced initial price guidance in the 7 percent area. \nDubai’s Mashreqbank estimated in a research note that the sukuk’s pricing offered investors roughly 55 bps more than its assessment of the instrument’s fair value, and significantly more than debt issued by similarly rated sovereigns such as Jordan and Sri Lanka. \nNevertheless, Bahrain may have found it easier and cheaper to sell sukuk than conventional bonds because of unsatisfied demand among Islamic funds and other institutions which only invest in sharia-compliant instruments. \nBahrain mandated BNP Paribas, Citi, Gulf International Bank, National Bank of Bahrain and Standard Chartered to arrange the bonds. It issued its latest international bond last September, raising $3 billion and receiving investor orders in excess of $15 billion.
