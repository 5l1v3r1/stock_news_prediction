Melrose will find out later on Thursday whether enough GKN investors have accepted its offer. \nStripping out Unilever and RELX, outbound M&A volumes were$27.2 billion, down from $42.3 billion in 2017, while inbound deals rose to $77.9 billion pounds, from $17.5 billion a year earlier, according to the data. TOP OF THE MARKET? \nThe biggest bid by an overseas acquirer for a British group was Comcast’s potential 22.1 billion-pound proposal for Sky, an attempt by the U.S. giant to gatecrash the takeover the broadcaster agreed with its 39 percent shareholder Twenty-First Century Fox late in 2016. \nBoth Fox’s pending bid for Sky and Melrose’s pursuit of GKN have drawn considerable scrutiny from British lawmakers. \nThe former has raised concerns about Rupert Murdoch’s influence over the UK media landscape, while the latter has sparked fears Melrose will break-up GKN, which is a mainstay of Britain’s engineering sector. \nIndeed, under Theresa May, who became prime minister in July 2016, the British government has adopted a more interventionist stance towards M&A by foreign companies. \nIn October, it proposed new rules that would give lawmakers more say over takeovers of firms involved in the more sensitive technology and defence sectors. \nEven so, that stance has not deterred overseas businesses from attempting to buy British firms, said Dominic Morris, the head of UK M&A at law firm Allen & Overy. \n“Yes, you could argue the government’s being more activist to some degree and people have to be mindful of that,” he said. “But do I think it’s right up there at the top of (acquirer’s) agenda? I’m not sure it is.” \nMore worrying for the M&A bankers and lawyers would be if the current boom in deals proved to be the top of the cycle, as it was 11 years ago, and activity begins to falter. \n“It feels very similar to 2007,” said Morris. “I would say if we’re not at the top of the market, we must be pretty close to it.” ($1 = 0.7112 pounds) (Reporting by Ben Martin Editing by Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T17:24:15.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
