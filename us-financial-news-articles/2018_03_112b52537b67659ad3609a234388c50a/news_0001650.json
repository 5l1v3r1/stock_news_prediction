Brou is leaving the government to become president of the commission of regional bloc ECOWAS.\nFor decades, Ivory Coast largely neglected its mining potential in favour of developing its agricultural commodities sector. It is the world’s leading cocoa producer.\nSince Ouattara assumed office, the government has sought to diversify its economy, including passing one of Africa’s most business-friendly mining codes.\nThe sector recorded revenues of 539 billion CFA francs ($1.02 billion) last year, up from 483 billion in 2016, the government announced in January.\nGold is the principal mining export with companies including Randgold Resources, Toronto-listed Endeavour and Australia’s Newcrest. Perseus Mining is to open a gold mine in the first quarter of this year.\nIvory Coast also produces manganese, nickel and small amounts of diamonds.
