All these information have been put before him time and again by many of his advisers, and he seems just so intent on imposing duties that he's neglecting to really take into consideration these costs,\" Ikenson said.\nIkenson said it is estimated that economic contribution by the steel-using industries is 15 times more than the steel producers. In addition, such businesses employ 57 workers to every one employee of the steel producers, he said.\nMajor steel and aluminum users in the U.S. include the automobile sector, construction, aerospace and even the beverage industry .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T09:19:45.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
