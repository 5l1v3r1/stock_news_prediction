REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo The Stockholm arbitration court decided on Wednesday that Gazprom would have to pay $2.56 billion to Naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit, Gazprom said.\nThe court had previously delivered a separate verdict in the dispute over gas supplies between Gazprom and Naftogaz. At the time, both companies claimed victory.\nOn Thursday, Gazprom said the latest court ruling meant it was obliged to pay $2.56 billion to Naftogaz.\nBut it said the court’s decision had created a“material imbalance, which infringes the basic principals of Swedish law, which regulates the (gas) contract.”\nUkraine is a major transit country for Russian gas supplies to Europe where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the gas market.\n“Gazprom will defend its rights by all available means in accordance with the applicable law,” Gazprom said in a statement.\nThe gas row is part of a broader political conflict between the two countries, which flared up after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion erupted in eastern Ukraine.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Andrew Osborn and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:54:11.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
