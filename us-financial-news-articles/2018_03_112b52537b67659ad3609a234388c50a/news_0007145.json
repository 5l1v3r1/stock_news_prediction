It will also invest close to $60 million over the next five years to modernize its Saint-Nazaire factory, where the nacelles for the Haliade-X will be built.\nGE, already a major global player in onshore wind, entered the offshore wind turbine market through its takeover of France’s Alstom in 2015.\nGE said the new turbine - which will have a direct-drive power generator rather than a gearbox - will be 30 percent bigger than its nearest competitors.\nIn June 2017, MHI Vestas, a joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, launched a 9.5 MW offshore turbine, currently the world’s most powerful wind turbine.\nStanding 187 meters tall and with 80-metre blades, it is an upgrade of MHI Vestas’ 8 MW V164 turbine, which is already in operation at the Burbo Bank Extension and Blyth offshore wind farms in Britain.\nMHI Vestas has also been named preferred supplier for Britain’s Triton Knoll and Moray East offshore wind farms for a total of 190 of the 9.5 MW turbines.\nAn MHI Vestas spokesman declined to comment on future turbine development.\nThe size of offshore wind turbines - which unlike onshore turbines is not limited by overland truck transport - has grown rapidly in recent years as bigger turbines capture more wind and reduce maintenance costs and capital spending.\nOnshore wind turbines in Europe have average capacities of about 2.7 megawatt, less than half the 6 MW average capacity of offshore turbines, according to trade group Wind Europe.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:21:37.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
