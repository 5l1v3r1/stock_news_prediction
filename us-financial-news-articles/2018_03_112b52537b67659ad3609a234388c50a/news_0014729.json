REUTERS/Henry Nicholls Hammond also said he expects a transition deal between Britain and the EU to be formalized later this month. This must allow regulators to cooperate to make it work, Hammond said, something that Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has called for.\nLondon’s role as a global financial center should be looked at as a European asset, not a British asset, Hammond said.\n“(This) is not a zero sum game, where any loss of market share in London is automatically a gain to another EU capital,” Hammond said in a speech in London’s financial center.\nNew York, Singapore and Hong Kong instead would likely be the beneficiaries, he added.\nReporting by Huw Jones, David Milliken, Andrew MacAskill, writing by Andy Bruce; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T22:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:23:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
