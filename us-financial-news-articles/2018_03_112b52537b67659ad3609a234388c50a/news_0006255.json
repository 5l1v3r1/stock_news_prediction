He also said, during a question-and-answer portion of his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Fed policy-makers are not seeing strong evidence of a decisive pickup in domestic wages. At 10:50 a.m. (1550 GMT), the difference between five-year and 30-year Treasury yields was more than 1 basis point wider at 49.8 basis points, Tradeweb data showed.
