This is a pattern of behavior seen in the Guppy Multiple Moving Average indicator. It is a three-part pattern.\nThe first part is when a rally approaches the lower edge of the long-term GMMA and then retreats. That's a compression in the short-term GMMA and it happened Feb. 26.\nThe second part of the test pattern is a rebound rally that penetrates the long-term GMMA before retreating from this resistance feature. The short-term GMMA also turns up and touches the lower edger of the long-term GMMA. That rebound rally and retreat is currently developing.\nThe third part of the pattern is a new rebound rally that moves above the upper edge of the long-term GMMA before developing a new retreat that uses the long-term GMMA as a support level.\nUsually the long-term GMMA is also turning up and developing some compression. The pattern is confirmed with a new rebound rally that takes the short-term GMMA above the long-term GMMA.\nSometimes there is a fourth test and retest retreat and rally before the new uptrend is confirmed.\nThe current retreat's first support feature is the upper edge of the trading consolidation band near 3,290.\nThe second support feature is the lower edge of the trading consolidation band near 3,260. A retreat to that level, and a rebound, would trigger an adjustment in the position of the up-sloping trend line. The index is currently testing that area as a support level.\nThe rally and retreat behavior is a good feature because it helps to establish a second anchor point for a new trend line. The retreat, and a future rebound are consistent with stable trend development.\nThere are two key resistance features for any rally rebound.\nThe first resistance feature is the upper edge of the long-term GMMA currently near 3,333.\nAnother resistance feature is near 3,440. That is the value of a long-term support and resistance level.\n ", "external_links": ["https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2018/03/20/guppy", "http://www.guppytraders.com/"], "published": "2018-03-20T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T15:25:39.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
