(NASDAQ:SUPN) (the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system diseases, announced today that, subject to market and other conditions, it intends to offer $350 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”) in a private offering. The Notes will be sold only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company also expects to grant to the initial purchasers of the Notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $52.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes.\nThe Notes will mature on April 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Prior to October 1, 2022, the Notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date of the Notes. Upon any conversion, the Company’s conversion obligation will be settled in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election. The interest rate on, the initial conversion rate of, and other terms of the Notes will be determined by negotiations between the Company and the initial purchasers of the Notes.\nThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, companies, products and technologies and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including without limitation, capital expenditures and research and development activities for potentially acquired or in-licensed product candidates, and to fund the cost of convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties, as described below. In addition, the Company expects to receive proceeds from the separate sale of the warrants, as described below.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the Notes or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “Hedge Counterparties”). The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to cover the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that will initially underlie the Notes, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Company also expects to enter into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Hedge Counterparties relating to the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to sell additional warrants to the Hedge Counterparties and use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the additional Notes and from the sale of the additional warrants to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions with the Hedge Counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution of the Company’s common stock and/or reduce the amount of any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Notes upon conversion of the Notes. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect with respect to the Company’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.\nIn connection with establishing the initial hedges of the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions, concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes, the Hedge Counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, and shortly after the pricing of the Notes, may purchase the Company’s common stock in secondary market transactions. These activities could have the effect of increasing, or reducing the size of a decline in, the market price of the Company’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Hedge Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or by purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company, including the Notes, in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions following the pricing of the Notes from time to time (and are likely to do so during any “observation period” (as that term is defined in the indenture governing the Notes) related to a conversion of Notes). Any of these hedging activities could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes.\nThe offer and sale of the Notes and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion thereof, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, and the Notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\nAbout Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSupernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.
