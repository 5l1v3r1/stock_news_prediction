The $28 million per year Cousins would earn is slightly more than Jimmy Garoppolo's $27.5 million per year . \nCousins, who earned $23.9 million last season , is easily already a multimillionaire, but you wouldn't guess it based on what he drives: a dented GMC Savana passenger van with more than 100,000 miles on it. He and his wife bought it from his grandma for $5,000 in 2014. \n\"It's better to buy appreciating assets than depreciating,\" Cousins told Kevin Clark of The Wall Street Journal in 2016 . \"No yachts, no sports cars.\" \nThe starting quarterback makes a good point. The moment you drive a new car off the lot, its value depreciates by about 20 percent . A post shared by Kirk Cousins (@kirk.cousins) on Jan 4, 2017 at 11:09am PST \nCousins' frugal habits also include living in his parents' basement during the summer. \n\"For a good portion of the off-season, the eminently practical Cousins holes up beneath the floorboards of his teenage home in Holland, Michigan. ... He shares the space with his wife, Julie,\" GQ reported in 2017 . \nThe couple move to a warmer climate during the first few months of the year: the basement of Julie's parents' home in Georgia. \"It works well,\" Cousins told GQ. \"We don't pay rent.\" \nThey do plan on eventually moving into their own place. After waiting to make sure they were in a good financial position to invest in real estate, Cousins and his wife bought a lakefront property on which they're building a four-bedroom home . \nAt the end of the day, \"you don't know how long you're going to play,\" Cousins told the WSJ. \"You've got to save every dollar even though you are making a good salary. You never know what's going to happen so I try to put as much money away as I can.\" show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T20:19:55.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
