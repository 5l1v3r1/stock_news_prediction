Last month, Kylie Jenner sent the stock tumbling after tweeting about her Snapchat displeasure and said, \"ugh this is so sad.\"\ntweet\nRihanna piled on this week in an Instagram diatribe about an ad that slipped through Snap's review process, adding to an ongoing conversation about the responsibility that social media companies have in moderating content .\nMahaney admits that these issues \"are all major problems,\" but he said that Snap's work on its advertising marketplace could help it win some market share from the industry giants.\n\"We have yet to see any asset — internet advertising asset — gain real traction, like $4 or $5 billion a year in annual revenue, if the company name wasn't Google or Facebook ,\" Mahaney said. \"We'll see really if Snapchat can escape the Facebook-Google death stars, but they are putting in a lot of necessary changes.\"\nWhile the new user interface may be unpopular, Mahaney trusts that the company did the necessary testing before rolling it out to the public.\nSnap \"wouldn't expand the user interface for the entire population if they hadn't seen results,\" he said.\nSnap isn't among Mahaney's top three stock picks, but he can still make a case for buying it. He has a $21 price target, representing a 24 percent increase from the current price.\n\"I think there is an interesting play on the long side, if you have a stomach for volatility,\" he said.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966432754089918465", "https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2018/03/16/snap"], "published": "2018-03-16T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T21:46:31.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
