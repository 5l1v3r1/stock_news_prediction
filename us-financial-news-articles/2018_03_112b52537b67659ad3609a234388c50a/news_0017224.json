I'll stay tuned in, just from a different perch.\"\n\"I am thrilled to be a part of Nightly Business Report, a show with a rich history and tradition of excellence,\" said Griffeth. \"Tyler has left some big shoes to fill, but I am up for the challenge and look forward to working once again with my longtime friend, colleague and college classmate — Sue Herera.\"\nWith more than 30 years' experience in business television, Griffeth is one of the most respected financial journalists in the country. He joined CNBC in 1991 when NBC purchased Financial News Network (FNN) , bringing his extensive knowledge of the markets to CNBC's Business Day programming.

He holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from California State University, Northridge, and received an honorary doctorate from the university in 2017.\n\"Since CNBC began producing NBR five years ago, the program has seen strong growth in viewership and has become a destination for some of the best storytelling in business news,\" said Nikhil Deogun, Senior Vice President and Editor in Chief, CNBC Business News. \"I want to thank Tyler for his incredible work on NBR and I am confident that with Bill and Sue at the anchor desk, the program is well-positioned for future success.\"\nAbout \"Nightly Business Report\":\n\"Nightly Business Report produced by CNBC\" (NBR) is an award-winning and highly-respected nightly business news program that airs on public television.
