Now 112 live with them, aged between one-week-old and 14 years.\nPOISONED, STARVED, ABANDONED No one knows the true scale of infanticide in Nigeria.\nBabies are typically killed with poisonous plants, although those whose mothers die in childbirth can be strapped to her body and buried, or abandoned in a room until they starve to death, the couple said.\nIn most cases, the mothers of the babies at Vine Heritage died in childbirth, Ajayi said, with a lack of healthcare facilities and medical staff in villages largely to blame.\nNigeria has one of the worst rates of maternal mortality in the world, according to the World Health Organisation, with 814 deaths for every 100,000 live births in 2015.\nAjayi said the couple did not put the children up for adoption but looked after them until it is safe to “return them to their families”.\nChinwe pointed out two children, aged 14 and three, who had been strapped to their mothers’ corpses, and another, three, who was starved for six days as his family waited for him to die.\n“Before, we used to go to the villages to beg for the babies. Now they bring them to us,” she said, crediting a program launched five years ago by the National Orientation Agency (NOA), a government body that communicates policy.\nOFFICIAL EFFORT NOA director Garba Abari said the campaign - called ‘Eliminating Negative Cultural Practices’ - was launched after the government found out about the couple’s work but it operates only in Abuja although children are killed elsewhere in Nigeria.\nAbari said the authorities had failed to find civil society groups to work with them to combat infanticide as there was a lot of denial in communities and suspicion of outsiders.\nTo that end the NOA employed local people to work on the issue and Abari said this seems to be working with the government receiving no reports of infanticide in Abuja in more than a year.\n“You just don’t go to confront them to say that you are coming to talk to them to stop it ... The best thing is to use the traditional leaders and heads of communities,” he said.\nBut challenges remain, he said.\n“First is denial by the community that such a practice exists. But to date (we know) it exists,” he said.\nChinwe said some months no babies are brought to the center but in others seven come, with the couple relying on donations to support the children, some of whom sleep six to a bed.\nBut, she said, they never turn away children. They did that once in 2005 when the facility was too full to take in newborn twins. Two weeks later, she learned the babies had been killed.\n“From that time, we decided that we would never turn back any babies,” she said.\nThe center is also home to 19 teenagers who come from some of the villages from which babies were rescued, Ajayi said, so they can see how the children are raised.\nDuring school holidays, the teenagers go home and tell the villagers what they have seen, Ajayi said, which he hopes will help the villagers understand that their beliefs are unfounded.Back in Kaida, Ayuba described her joy at seeing her twins, Mabel and Bethel, when she can afford to go to Vine Heritage.\nBut, she said, if she had another set of twins she would not keep them - although she would not let them be killed either.\n“Even if I wanted to keep them, people in the community would not like that,” she said.\nReporting by Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani; Editing by Robert Carmichael and Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
