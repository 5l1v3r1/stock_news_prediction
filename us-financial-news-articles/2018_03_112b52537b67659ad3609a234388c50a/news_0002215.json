I’ve not even seen their livery, I just know it’s red.”\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne, in the now Renault-powered McLaren after that team’s split with Honda at the end of last year, did 110 laps and was second quickest although he was using the much faster hyper-soft tires.\nVandoorne’s time of 1:19.854 was still half a second slower than Hamilton‘s.\nThe Belgian’s Spanish team mate and double world champion Fernando Alonso did another 51 laps and was fifth on the timing screens.\nFrench driver Pierre Gasly, in the Honda-powered Toro Rosso, did the most mileage -- an impressive 147 laps -- while Vettel completed 120 and was third fastest on a day that started wet but dried out.\n“I’d have liked to have driven more, but we can do that next week (at the second test), when we will start to get a clearer picture,” said Vettel, who spent some time in the garage as mechanics worked on the car.\nMexican Sergio Perez had his first taste of the new Force India, after the snow stopped him getting any mileage on Wednesday, and lapped eighth fastest.\nThe second and final pre-season test starts on Tuesday at Barcelona’s Circuit de Catalunya.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T22:37:02.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
