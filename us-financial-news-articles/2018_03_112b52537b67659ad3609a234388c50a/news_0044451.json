Residents from the neighbourhood said the house was frequented by foreigners, according to the witness, who did not want to be identified for security reasons.\nPictures in local media showed a body on the ground with several limbs and its head missing, and a car with its windows blown out and dozens of holes in one side.\nU.S. forces have carried out occasional air strikes targeting militants in Libya over the past few years.\nThey also launched an air campaign against Islamic State in the group’s former Libyan stronghold of Sirte in 2016, as local forces battled to oust jihadists from the city.\nLast year, the United States said it had killed dozens of suspects in air strikes in desert areas south of Sirte as it tried to stop militants regrouping.\nSaturday was the first time it had acknowledged a strike as far south as Ubari, which lies about 700 km (435 miles) south of Tripoli, on the road to Libya’s border with Algeria.\nLibyan and Western officials have long warned about the risk of militants linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda using southern Libya as a base.\n“We are committed to maintaining pressure on the terror network and preventing terrorists from establishing safe haven,” the U.S. Africa Command statement said.\nIt gave no information about the identity of those targeted.\nLibya slid into conflict after a 2011 Nato-backed uprising and has had rival governments based in Tripoli and the east for the past four years.\nCompeting factions have fought for influence in the country’s south, where the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is aligned with the eastern-based government, recently stepped up military activity.\nCommunal violence has also flared in recent weeks in Sabha, about 170 km northeast of Ubari, displacing hundreds of families.\nOn Saturday, LNA jets carried out strikes targeting Chadian mercenary forces southeast of Sabha, air force commander Mohamed Manfour said.\nInstability in southern Libya has drawn in fighters from Chad and Sudan’s Darfur region who have battled for opposing sides in Libya’s internal conflict.\nEditing by Dale Hudson and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T09:12:40.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
