For John, those traits have proved vastly more lucrative than a traditional education.\n\"Hunger is the key,\" John tells CNBC Make It. \"I don't believe [college is] necessary for success.\"\nDavid A. Grogan | CNBC Daymond John With Americans holding nearly $1.38 trillion in student loan debt at the end of 2017, many young people are re-thinking whether college is a necessary expense.\nBut John doesn't nix the idea completely.

Those people then out-work the people the people that are already working there, and I hired most of the interns.\n\"You wouldn't have that opportunity if you didn't go to college,\" he adds.\nSo people who skip college should hustle to take advantage of other opportunities around them, he says.\n\"If you don't have the resources go to college, well then you better be on the Internet. You better be at that library. You better be wherever you can acquire the knowledge,\" John says.\nAnd whether in school or at work, it is important to find mentors. \"The number one reason why people are successful is access to mentors,\" he explains. At school, \"those [mentors] are professors, those are other students in college around you.\"\nWhen it comes down to it, John puts it this way: \"Should you go to college? Absolutely if you can. Is it necessary? No.\"\nDon't miss: Why 'Shark Tank's' Daymond John refuses to watch football or binge on 'Game of Thrones'\nLike this story?
