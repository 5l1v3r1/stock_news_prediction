It declined to immediately give the nationalities of the victims.\nThe statement said MINUSMA was reinforcing its security presence in central Mali, which has seen a surge in violence by Islamist militants, in cooperation with the country’s army as well as regional and international forces.\n“These acts demonstrate (the militants’) disarray and in no way affect MINUSMA’s determination to carry out its mandate,” said Mahamat Saleh Annadif, who heads the U.N. mission.\nReporting by Souleymane Ag Anara; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Aaron Ross and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:14:59.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
