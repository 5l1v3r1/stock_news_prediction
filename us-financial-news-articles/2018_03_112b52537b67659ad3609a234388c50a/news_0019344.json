(the “Company”, “Marcus & Millichap”, “MMI”) (NYSE:MMI), a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services, today reported the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal revenues increased by 7.2% to $202.8 million compared to a 6.9% decline in the fourth quarter of 2016 Financing revenue increased by 22.6% to $15.5 million driven by significant growth in financing purchase transactions Private Client Market segment brokerage transactions were up slightly in contrast to a 7.0% decline experienced during the fourth quarter of 2016 Brokerage commissions in the Larger Transaction Market segment increased by 5.1% compared to a difficult comparison of 15.1% gain in this segment during the fourth quarter of 2016 Net income was $8.5 million, or $0.22 per common share (basic and diluted), which included a $11.6 million one- time charge in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income was $20.1 million, or $0.52 per common share, basic and $0.51 per common share, diluted when excluding this charge.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nTotal revenues increased to $719.7 million Financing revenue increased by 14.3% to $49.7 million Private Client Market segment brokerage transactions, which represented approximately 68% of the Company’s brokerage commissions, increased 2.3% compared to prior year, despite an estimated decline for the year in market transaction activity Brokerage transactions in the Larger Transaction Market segment declined by nearly 2.0% compared to an outsized 29.7% gain in this segment in 2016 Net income was $51.5 million, or $1.32 per common share (basic and diluted), which included a one-time charge of $11.6 million in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusted net income was $63.2 million, or $1.62 per common share (basic and diluted) when excluding this charge.\nHessam Nadji, President and CEO stated, “Marcus & Millichap ended 2017 on a positive trajectory with revenue growth of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter in contrast to revenue decline of 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our intensified client outreach initiatives, sales force expansion and our team’s commitment to client service provided the impetus for modest revenue growth for the year despite uncertainty that pushed many investors to the sidelines.” Mr. Nadji continued, “We are encouraged by our continued market share growth in the Private Client Market segment in light of a more challenging environment and slower sales. Our initiatives to expand our financing capabilities are also showing progress as reflected in revenue growth of 22.6% for our financing business in the fourth quarter and 14.3% for the year.” Mr. Nadji added, “We look forward to 2018 with cautious optimism. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is projected to be very constructive, not only for the real estate industry at large, but also for the Company given our reduced tax rate going forward. Lower tax liability, coupled with a gradual increase in market activity and further share gains, should grow our free cash flow and further strengthen the balance sheet. The Company is well positioned for strategic acquisitions and investments to make our platform more competitive. We are focused on executing these strategies to enhance long-term shareholder value.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $202.8 million, compared to $189.2 million for the same period in the prior year, increasing by $13.6 million, or 7.2%. The growth in total revenues was driven by the increase in real estate brokerage commissions, other revenues and, to a lesser extent, financing fees. Real estate brokerage commissions increased by 2.7% to $177.3 million primarily due to an increase in sales volume and, to a lesser extent, improved rates in the Private Client Market and Middle Market segments. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates due to a larger proportion of transactions from the Larger Transaction Market segment. Other revenues increased by 164.9% to $9.9 million primarily due to a large consulting and advisory services fee during the fourth quarter of 2017 with no comparable fee during the same period in 2016. Financing fees grew by 22.6% to $15.5 million primarily due to a significant growth in financing purchases.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 8.8% to $175.4 million, compared to $161.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in cost of services and selling, general and administrative expenses. Cost of services increased by 8.3% to $131.7 million. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues rose by 70 basis points to 65.0% compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals, who are generally compensated at higher commission rates.\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 10.1% to $42.3 million, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher costs associated with (i) sales operations support and promotional marketing expenses; (ii) compensation related costs, including salaries and related benefits and management performance compensation; (iii) stock-based compensation expense and (iv) expansion of existing offices. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal costs and accruals.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.5 million, or $0.22 per common share (basic and diluted), compared to net income of $17.2 million, or $0.44 per common share (basic and diluted), for the same period in the prior year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time charge in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this charge of $11.6 million, adjusted net income was $20.1 million, or $0.52 per common share, basic and $0.51 per common share, diluted. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $32.1 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $31.3 million for the same period in the prior year.\nFull Year 2017 Results Compared to Full Year 2016\nTotal revenues for 2017 were $719.7 million, compared to $717.5 million for 2016, increasing by 0.3%. Total operating expenses for 2017 were up 2.1% to $623.6 million compared to $610.9 million for 2016. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained flat at 62.0%. Net income for 2017 was $51.5 million, or $1.32 (basic and diluted) per common share, compared with net income of $64.7 million, or $1.66 (basic and diluted) per common share for 2016. Net income for 2017 included a one-time charge in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this charge of $11.6 million, adjusted net income was $63.2 million, or $1.62 per common share (basic and diluted). Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 decreased by 5.6% to $111.7 million, from $118.3 million for 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 1,819 investment sales and financing professionals.\nBusiness Outlook\nWe believe that the Company is positioned to continue to gain market share by leveraging a number of factors, including our leading national brand predominantly within our Private Client Market segment and specialty groups, experienced management team, infrastructure investments and proprietary technology. The size and fragmentation of the Private Client Market segment, in particular, continues to offer long-term growth opportunities with the top ten brokerage firms making up only 25.2% market share. This market segment consistently accounts for over 80% of commercial property sales transactions and over 60% of the commission pool. The Company’s growth plan also includes further expansion into various specialty property types such as hospitality, self-storage, seniors housing and the Larger Transaction Market segment, as well as expansion of its financing division, Marcus & Millichap Capital Corporation.\nKey factors likely to influence the Company’s business in 2018 include:\nVolatility in market sales and investor sentiment driven by: Slowdown in market sales in the short- to mid-term in view of a maturing cycle, rising interest rates, and bid-ask spread gap between buyers and sellers, financial regulation and economic initiatives. Possible boost to investor sentiment and sales activity based on Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, regulatory easing and proposed economic initiatives which are expected to increase real estate demand. Experienced agents’ larger share of revenue production in a more challenging market environment resulting in a higher average commission payout. Reduction of MMI’s effective tax rate to the 25.5%-27.5% range from nearly 40% in prior years reflecting a positive impact on its corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Volatility in the Company’s Larger Transaction Market segment. The potential for merger and acquisition activity and subsequent integration.\nThese factors, in addition to the business’s typical transaction closing date variability, highlight the importance of viewing the Company’s business through a long-term, at least annual, perspective.\nConference Call Details\nMarcus & Millichap will host a conference call today to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time/5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in its business operations to evaluate the performance of its business, develop budgets and measure its performance against those budgets, among other things. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate its overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company finds Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, the Company does not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also considers its U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company’s financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 8,480 $ 17,174 $ 51,524 $ 64,657 Adjustments: Interest income and other (1) (1,221 ) (516 ) (3,514 ) (1,761 ) Interest expense 370 378 1,496 1,533 Provision for income taxes (2) 20,138 10,921 47,702 42,445 Depreciation and amortization 1,388 1,223 5,363 4,387 Stock-based compensation 2,972 2,102 9,145 7,035 Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 32,127 $ 31,282 $ 111,716 $ 118,296 (1) Other for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 includes net realized gains (losses) on marketable securities, available-for-sale. (2) Provision for income taxes for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, includes a one-time charge in the amount of $11.6 million in connection with the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, net due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the Company adopted a new accounting pronouncement in 2017 that required any windfall tax benefits, net of shortfalls to be recorded as a discrete item in the Company’s provision for income taxes. These windfalls/shortfalls arise from the difference in the grant date price and the vesting date price of employee and non-employee directors vesting of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and restricted stock awards. The Company recognized $2.7 million and $2.9 million in windfall tax benefits, net during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively as a reduction in the Company’s provision for income taxes. (3) The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to higher total revenues, partially offset by a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to revenues. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to revenues, partially offset by higher total revenues.
