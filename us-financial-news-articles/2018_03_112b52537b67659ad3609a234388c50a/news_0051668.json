Higher rates tend to make the euro more attractive to yield-seeking investors.\nThe single currency dropped 0.3% to $1.2405 in late New York trading.\nAt the same time, a slide in oil prices helped lift the dollar against the currencies of some commodities-producing countries. The dollar rose 0.35% against the Russian ruble to 57.40, while also gaining against the Mexican peso and Brazilian real. U.S. crude for May delivery lost 30 cents a barrel, or 0.5% to $65.25.\nSome emerging-market investors also have been spooked by a trade spat between the U.S. and China, after President Donald Trump last week threatened to levy tariffs on as much as $60 billion of imports from China, while Beijing announced retaliatory measures. Although those concerns have moderated in recent days, investors worry that looming trade restrictions could slow growth in China and hit demand for commodities, a key export of many developing countries.\nThe dollar inched down against the yen, as a late-day drop in U.S. stocks sent some investors into the Japanese currency, which tends to attract buying during times of political or economic uncertainty. The dollar fell less than 0.1% to ¥105.34.\nDespite Tuesday’s gains, many market participants continue to be wary regarding the U.S. currency’s longer-term prospects. The dollar is down more than 3% in 2018 and has fallen by 7.45% over the past 12 months. The losses have come despite expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates three times this year.\nSome investors have attributed at least part of those declines to concerns over protectionist trade policies, which have historically weighed on the dollar. The ICE Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six major currencies, fell nearly 20% between 2001 and 2003, as the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel imports, data from TD Securities showed. It declined around 12% between 1993 and 1995 in response to contentious trade relations between the U.S. and Japan.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T02:37:20.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
