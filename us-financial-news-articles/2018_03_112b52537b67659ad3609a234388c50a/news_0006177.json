(“Hexion” or the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Hexion posted solid Segment EBITDA gains, sales growth of 18% and volume increases of approximately 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017,” said Craig A. Rogerson, Chairman, President and CEO. “Our fourth quarter Segment EBITDA reflected continued strong demand and year-over-year gains in our base epoxy resins, North American forest products resins, and global formaldehyde businesses.”\nMr. Rogerson added: “Looking ahead, our outlook is positive for the key end markets we serve. We also expect to further realize the structural cost savings from our recently announced restructuring initiatives, which will support 2018 Segment EBITDA growth. These savings, along with continued growth across most product lines, are expected to drive improved Segment EBITDA in 2018 versus the prior year.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet Sales. Net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $895 million, an increase of 18% compared with $758 million in the prior year period. The increase in reported net sales was primarily driven by the pass-through of higher raw material costs and broad-based volume gains throughout the entire portfolio with significant gains in base epoxy resins, Versatic™ Acids and Derivatives, our global forest product resins and formaldehyde, and oilfield proppants businesses.\nSegment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $74 million, an increase of 7% compared with the prior year period. Fourth quarter 2017 results were driven by growth in base epoxy resins, North America and Latin America forest product resins and global formaldehyde businesses, and phenolic specialty resins. Excluding $4 million of insurance proceeds in the prior year period related to the Versatic™ Acids and Derivatives business that did not reoccur, fourth quarter 2017 Segment EBITDA increased 14%.\nFiscal Year 2017 Results\nNet Sales. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.6 billion, an increase of 4% compared with $3.4 billion in the prior year period. The increase in reported net sales was primarily driven by volume gains in base epoxy resins, Versatic™ Acids and Derivatives, global forest product resins and formaldehyde, and oilfield proppants businesses. Net sales increased 10% when adjusting for recent divestitures.\nSegment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $365 million, a decrease of 16% compared with the prior year period, or 9%, when adjusted for divestitures. In fiscal year 2017, growth in our base epoxy resins and global forest product businesses partially offset declines in our specialty epoxy business.\nGlobal Restructuring Programs\nIn 2017, the Company achieved approximately $26 million of cost savings, including reductions in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and targeted site rationalizations. In addition, Hexion recently identified approximately $40 million in additional structural cost savings with approximately 90% of the savings related to headcount reductions. At December 31, 2017, Hexion had $50 million of total in-process cost savings comprised of $12 million in SG&A savings and $38 million in manufacturing savings. The Company has taken the majority of the actions and the impact will be essentially realized over the next 12 months.\nPortfolio Optimization Initiatives\nHexion continues to position the Company for profitable growth by strategically managing its portfolio. In January 2018, Hexion announced that it sold its ATG business to MÜNZING CHEMIE GmbH. The Company received approximately $50 million in proceeds from the transaction, or approximately twelve times Segment EBITDA over the last twelve months. Hexion will use the sale proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, Hexion has initiated a process for the sale of a portion of its Epoxy, Phenolic and Coatings Resins Segment. The Company expects that sale proceeds will be used to reduce its debt. The Company does not intend to comment further on its strategic activities unless and until it otherwise deems further disclosure is appropriate or required.\nSegment Results\nFollowing are net sales and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. See “Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” for further information regarding Segment EBITDA and a reconciliation of net loss to Segment EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (In millions)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Sales (1) : Epoxy, Phenolic and Coating Resins $ 515 $ 430 $ 2,052 $ 2,094 Forest Products Resins 380 328 1,539 1,344 Total Net Sales 895 758 3,591 3,438 Adjustment for dispositions (2) — — — (185 ) Adjusted Net Sales $\n895\n$ 758 $ 3,591 $ 3,253 Segment EBITDA: Epoxy, Phenolic and Coating Resins $ 31 $ 28 $ 174 $ 258 Forest Products Resins 62 56 257 240 Corporate and Other (19 ) (15 ) (66 ) (65 ) Total Segment EBITDA 74 69 365 433 Adjustment for dispositions (2) — — — (30 ) Adjusted Segment EBITDA $\n74\n$ 69 $ 365 $ 403 (1) Intersegment sales are not significant and, as such, are eliminated within the selling segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, Hexion had total debt of approximately $3.7 billion compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2016. In addition, at December 31, 2017, the Company had $346 million in liquidity comprised of $97 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, $227 million of borrowings available under the Company’s senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”) and $22 million of time drafts and availability under credit facilities at certain international subsidiaries. Pro forma liquidity reflecting proceeds from the ATG transaction totaled approximately $395 million. Hexion expects to have adequate liquidity to fund its ongoing operations for the next twelve months from cash on its balance sheet, cash flows provided by operating activities and amounts available for borrowings under its credit facilities.\nEarnings Call\nHexion will host a teleconference to discuss Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 results on Friday, March 2, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

A replay will also be available through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.\nCovenant Compliance\nThe instruments that govern the Company’s indebtedness contain, among other provisions, restrictive covenants regarding indebtedness (including an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio incurrence test), dividends and distributions, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, affiliate transactions and capital expenditures.\nThe indentures that govern the Company’s 6.625% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 10.00% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 10.375% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, 13.75% Senior Secured Notes and 9.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Secured Indentures”) contain an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio incurrence test which may restrict our ability to take certain actions such as incurring additional debt or making acquisitions if the Company is unable to meet this ratio (measured on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis) of at least 2.0:1. The Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio under the Secured Indentures is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA to (b) net interest expense excluding the amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs, each measured on a LTM basis. See “Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” for further information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Schedule 5 to the release for a calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio.\nThe Company’s ABL Facility does not have any financial maintenance covenant other than a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 that would only apply if the Company’s availability under the ABL Facility at any time is less than the greater of (a) $35 million and (b) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the total ABL Facility commitments at such time. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility is generally defined as the ratio of (a) Adjusted EBITDA minus non-financed capital expenditures and cash taxes to (b) debt service plus cash interest expense plus certain restricted payments, each measured on an LTM basis. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s availability under the ABL Facility exceeded such levels; therefore, the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio did not apply.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nSegment EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses. Segment EBITDA is an important measure used by the Company's senior management and board of directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Corporate and Other primarily represents certain corporate, general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the other segments. Segment EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net loss or other results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See Schedule 4 to this release for reconciliation of net loss to Segment EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash and certain non-recurring items and other adjustments calculated on a pro forma basis, including the expected future cost savings from business optimization programs or other programs and the expected future impact of acquisitions, in each case as determined under the governing debt instrument. As the Company is highly leveraged, it believes that including the supplemental adjustments that are made to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the Company’s ability to comply with its financial covenants and to obtain additional debt in the future. Adjusted EBITDA and Fixed Charges are not defined terms under U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition, liquidity or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not take into account certain items such as interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, depreciation and amortization expense (because the Company uses capital assets, depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue), working capital needs, tax payments (because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, it is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate), non-recurring expenses and capital expenditures. Fixed Charges under the Secured Indentures should not be considered an alternative to interest expense. See Schedule 5 to this release for reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and the Fixed Charges Ratio.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

(3) Primarily includes certain professional fees related to strategic projects, retention program costs, business optimization expenses, management fees and expenses related to legacy liabilities. (4) Represents pro forma impact of in-process cost reduction programs savings. Cost reduction program savings represent the unrealized headcount reduction savings and plant rationalization savings related to cost reduction programs and other unrealized savings associated with the Company’s business realignments activities, and represent our estimate of the unrealized savings from such initiatives that would have been realized had the related actions been completed at the beginning of the period presented. The savings are calculated based on actual costs of exiting headcount and elimination or reduction of site costs.

(6) The Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, among other actions, is restricted under the indentures governing certain notes, unless the Company has an Adjusted EBITDA to Fixed Charges ratio of 2.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2017, we did not satisfy this test. As a result, we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to make investments; however, there are exceptions to these restrictions, including exceptions that permit indebtedness under our ABL Facility (available borrowings of which were $227 at December 31, 2017).\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180302005226/en/\nInvestors and Media:\nHexion Inc.\nJohn Kompa, 614-225-2223\njohn.kompa@hexion.com\nSource: Hexion Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hexion.com&esheet=51767268&newsitemid=20180302005226&lan=en-US&anchor=www.hexion.com&index=1&md5=a395072c548ffb1a91f1fcffd1674fe5", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180302005226/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hexion.com&esheet=51767268&newsitemid=20180302005226&lan=en-US&anchor=www.hexion.com&index=2&md5=f7cd1ca2252509e6f474288ea843a358"], "published": "2018-03-02T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T15:15:22.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
