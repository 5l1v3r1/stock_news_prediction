Perhaps that is why only 8% of all home sellers in 2017 were for sale by owner, or FSBO, according to a survey of 7,866 home buyers released by the National Association of Realtors in October.\nGiving real-estate agents a selling edge is the Multiple Listing Service, a database of home listings that fee-paying agents contribute to. Without use of the MLS, solo sellers have a tough time marketing their homes. “Even if they create a website for their property, how are they pushing that out to potential buyers using search-engine optimization or other tools?” asks David Dweck, a real-estate agent with Signature Real Estate in Boca Raton, Fla. “How are they using social media properly unless they are marketing-savvy, which most aren’t and don’t have the time for?”\nLast year, homes listed with a real-estate agent had a median sales price of $250,000, compared with $190,000 for owner-listed homes, NAR reported in the 2017 survey. Even factoring in the typical 6% commission, the agent-assisted sale would still net $235,000.\n‘ 8% of all home sellers in 2017 were for sale by owner, or FSBO, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors ’\nStill, there are numerous websites that provide services to FSBOs. For example, Ladera Ranch, Calif.-based Fizber.com will list a house on its website free. For $99, the company will prepare a digital brochure and video tour of the property and list it on Zillow, Trulia and Redfin for additional exposure.\nSellers wanting to list their home in the local MLS can opt for a $295 package, although that will obligate them to pay a real-estate commission to the selling agent, typically 3%.\nPJ Mitchell, Fizber’s president, says only 18% of homes that sold after being listed on Fizber were sold without the MLS, so sellers may want to keep that option open. He also says that 70% of sellers who initially posted a FSBO listing with Fizber ultimately hired a full-service real-estate agent to sell the house.\nAnother hurdle for homeowners who list their homes is ensuring that a buyer has sufficient cash—or a mortgage—to pay for the house. A broker typically ensures that the buyer is financially qualified by reviewing the preapproval letter or contacting a lender. “There is an important distinction between a prequalification letter, which means your prospective buyer has only had a conversation with a lender, and a preapproval letter, which means that the buyer is approved as long as he gets an appraisal that is satisfactory,” says Charles Nilsen, national director of residential lending for Boston Private, a private bank.\nMore Jumbo Jungle\nBuying a Home With an LLC: A Primer March 7, 2018 The Little-Known Bidding-War Strategy That Some Home Buyers Use February 14, 2018 Self-Employed Workers Face Mortgage Hurdles February 7, 2018 Here are some things to consider if you’re thinking of selling your house on your own:\n• Importance of earnest money. Potential buyers who plan to pay in cash should provide the seller with bank or investment statements to prove they have sufficient assets. For buyers unwilling to provide this information, Mr. Nilsen suggests that sellers ask for at least 20% up front in earnest money that would be forfeited if money issues scuttle the sale. “That is a method to ensure performance or at least provide fair compensation for tying up your home,” he says.\n• Hire an appraiser. Pricing correctly is essential to ensure the seller gets top dollar without turning off potential buyers by overpricing the house. But sellers often believe their house is worth more than it actually is. According to the National Quicken Loans Home Price Perception Index for February, appraisers valued homes an average of 0.53% lower than what owners estimated. An appraisal can provide a reliable valuation and may even help buyer and seller arrive at an agreeable sales price.\n• Find a qualified real-estate attorney. Without the assistance of a real-estate agent to guide them through the sales process, FSBOs should seek out the help of a real-estate attorney. An attorney can help qualify a buyer, negotiate contract terms, handle title problems, advocate for the seller after inspections are completed and handle the settlement. “On a luxury sale, a seller should have an attorney,” says Zachary Schorr, a real-estate attorney in Los Angeles. “It’s a marginal expense, and getting advice on documents and the transaction is invaluable.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T18:49:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
