(NASDAQ:BKYI), an innovative provider of biometric authentication and security solutions, today reported results for its fourth quarter (Q4’17) and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided initial revenue guidance for 2018. BIO-key will host a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. EDT (details below) to review its 2017 results and 2018 outlook and financial guidance.\nFinancial Highlights:\n2017 2016 Chg. License Revenue $3.2M $1.2M +167 % Hardware Revenue $1.9M $1.0M +90 % Service & Maintenance Revenue $1.2M $0.8M +50 % Total Revenue $6.3M $3.0M +110 % Gross Profit $3.0M $2.2M +36 % Net Inc. (Loss) ($4.3M) ($4.2M) +2 % Note: BIO-key's 2017 gross profit and net loss reflected $1.5M of non-cash amortization expenses related to software license rights. 2017 net loss also included $531K of non-recurring fees and costs related to BIO-key's uplisting of its shares to the Nasdaq Capital Market. 2016 results included $2K of non-cash expense related to software license rights.\nBIO-key's CEO Michael DePasquale commented, \"Our 2017 growth was the result of solid sales execution across the business, supported by the increasing realization by enterprise customers that passwords alone are inadequate to protect networks, data and transactions. Growing recognition of how biometric solutions can solve both external and internal enterprise security vulnerabilities is accelerating the pace of biometric adoption, a trend we believe will continue in 2018.\n\"In addition to growing our competitive offerings of software and hardware solutions, our large and expanding network of distributors and strategic partners provides us with broad reach into markets locally and around the world. In particular, Asia Pacific continues to represent a substantial market opportunity and we are expanding our presence there to take advantage of the region's potential.\n“Our prospects for 2018 remain rooted in a few key strategic initiatives:\nExpanding our base of OEM relationships:\nBIO-key continues to pursue partnerships with leading hardware and applications developers to incorporate our state-of-the-art biometric capabilities into their customer solutions. With the growth of the Internet of Things, we see opportunities with partners to embed our biometric modules in various connected devices. This initiative builds on our already successful model of supporting OEMs, such as NCR Corporation, OmniCell, and healthcare solution providers who continue to drive expanded market penetration of BIO-key technologies. Increasing our Footprint in Asia:\nBIO-key sees substantial growth potential in Asia, where we continue to build on the capabilities and reach of our Hong Kong subsidiary and growing base of partnerships. To further leverage this investment, we are working to establish support, sales and marketing teams to expand our ability to serve large customer opportunities in India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore and China. Expanding our Hardware Distribution:\nIn addition to increasing the reach of our enterprise reader and sensor solutions through integration partners, we are focused on increasing the distribution of our consumer facing products, such as biometric and bluetooth-enabled locks and other products. We have made our products widely available through online distribution outlets, including Amazon and our own e-commerce website. Additionally, we've partnered with OEM’s, resellers and large distributors which are delivering steady sales growth. Expanding BIO-key's global distribution will continue to be a priority in 2018.\n\"As multi-factor biometric solutions gain increasing traction in mainstream use, we believe these core initiatives position BIO-key for significant growth in 2018 and beyond\".\nInitiating 2018 Revenue Financial Guidance\nBased on specific opportunities, growth initiatives in place and recurring revenue streams, BIO-key is initiating revenue guidance of $8M-12M for the full year 2018. Within this revenue range, management expects that BIO-key can generate positive cash flow from operations in 2018. However, given the variability of contract sizes, timing, and the challenges inherent in estimating partner and OEM-based activity, BIO-key is unable to provide quarterly guidance and cautions investors to expect variability in its quarterly financial performance both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis.\nConversion of Series B-1 Preferred Stock into Common Stock at $3.60 Per Share\nOn March 23, 2018, holders of Series B-1 convertible preferred shares converted 60,420 Series B-1 shares, and accrued dividends on all outstanding Series B-1 shares through February 2, 2018 in the amount of $417,084 into approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.60 per share, representing approximately an 84% premium to BIO-key's recent share price of $1.96. The forgoing conversions increased BIO-key’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock to approximately 9.5 million and reduced approximately $263K of future annual dividends payable on the Series B-1 shares.\nQ4 2017 Results\nQ4'17 total revenue increased by $1.4M to $3.1 million from $1.7 million in Q4'16, principally due to an expanded license contract agreement with an existing Fortune 500 customer.\nGross margin decreased to 72% in Q4'17 from 82% in Q4'16, due primarily to $390K of non-cash software license amortization recognized in Q4'17 versus none in Q4'16. Q4'17 operating expenses decreased slightly on lower research and development costs and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\nBIO-key's Q4'17 net income was $0.5M, or $0.04 per diluted share after preferred dividends, compared to a net loss of ($0.5M), or ($0.12) per basic share after preferred dividends in Q4'16. The improved bottom line performance was primarily due to higher software license revenues in Q4'17 compared to Q4'16.\n2017 Results\nFull year 2017 revenue rose 110% to $6.3M versus $3M in 2016, due primarily to an expanded software license agreement from a repeat Fortune 500 customer. Hardware, including readers and locks, represented 30% of total revenues in 2017 versus 32% in 2016.\nGross margin declined to approximately 49% in 2017 compared to 75% in 2016, principally due to the impact on gross margin of $1.5 million in non-cash amortization of intangible assets related to our FingerQ IP, which we began expensing in Q1'17. Operating expenses rose to $7.3M in 2017 compared to $6.4M in 2016, due to a $1.2M increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition to higher marketing and sales costs to support growth at our Hong Kong subsidiary and higher sales levels in 2017, SG&A costs also included $531K of one-time costs related to our June 2017 Nasdaq uplisting.\nBIO-key’s 2017 net loss was ($4.3M), or ($0.76) per basic share after preferred dividends, compared to a loss of ($4.2M) or ($0.89) per basic share after preferred dividends in 2016. Per share results in 2017 and 2016 are based on a weighted average of 6.6 million and 5.6 million basic shares outstanding, respectively, reflecting the impact of the Company’s 1-for-12 reverse split effected December 2016.\nConference Call and Webcast Replay\nDate/Time: Thursday, March 29, 2018 at 10 am ET Dial-In number: 1-877-418-5460 U.S. or 412-717-9594 (Intl.)
