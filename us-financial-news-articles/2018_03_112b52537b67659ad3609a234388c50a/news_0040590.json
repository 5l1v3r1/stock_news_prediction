(Nasdaq:VTL), a biotherapeutic company developing ELAD®, a cell-based therapy targeting the treatment of acute forms of liver failure, today announced that the VTL-308 phase 3 trial has reached its enrollment target of 150 subjects.\n“We are delighted to report that we have reached target enrollment in VTL-308 before the end of the first quarter as expected,” said Russell J. Cox, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “We would like to thank the investigators in this trial and their staffs for enrolling the targeted population and for providing care to these subjects. We would also like to thank the patients and their families for participating in this unique cell therapy trial.”\nVTL-308 is the Company's phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with severe alcoholic hepatitis (sAH). The trial, which enrolled its first subject in May of 2016, was designed based on learnings from pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of the Company's VTI-208 clinical trial. Subjects in VTL-308 were randomized 1:1 to either ELAD plus standard-of-care, or standard-of-care alone. The primary endpoint is overall survival through at least 91 days assessed using the Kaplan Meier statistical method.\nThe trial’s statistical plan incorporated an event-driven feature to allow for the extension of enrollment if a preliminary review of blinded data from VTL-308 was found to be inconsistent with prior expectations. During the first quarter of 2018, a review by independent statisticians concluded that the overall event rate experienced in VTL-308 subjects through year end 2017 was consistent with the trial’s original statistical plan, and therefore recommended the Company retain the trial’s original enrollment target of 150. The Company remains on track to report topline results for VTL-308 in the third quarter, likely in September.\nAbout Vital Therapies, Inc.\nVital Therapies, Inc. is a biotherapeutic company developing a cell-based therapy targeting the treatment of acute forms of liver failure.
