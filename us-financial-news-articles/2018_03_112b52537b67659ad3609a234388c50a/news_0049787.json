REUTERS/Hannah McKay May said she wanted her government to come up with a long-term plan for health spending which should come sooner than a planned broad review of public spending next year.\n“We need to – I think – get away from the annual approach we see to the NHS budget,” May told lawmakers. “The government will provide a multi-year funding settlement in support of the plan consistent with our fiscal rules.”\nThe Sunday Times newspaper reported at the weekend that the government could spend up to 4 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) a year more over 10 years as it seeks to head off one of the main policy promises of the opposition Labour Party.\nFinance minister Philip Hammond this month agreed to relax a seven-year squeeze on the pay of many health workers as the country’s budget deficit continued to narrow.\nBritain’s healthcare system, which delivers free care for all and accounts for a third of government spending on public services, is one of the most important issues for voters and is often regarded as a weakness for May’s Conservative party.\n($1 = 0.7060 pounds)\nWriting by William Schomberg; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:12:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
