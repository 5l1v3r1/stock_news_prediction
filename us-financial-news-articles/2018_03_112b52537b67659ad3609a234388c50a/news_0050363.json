Riley FBR in Boston.\n“In general, the market is trapped between two narratives.”\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to seven-week lows of 2.76 percent on rising demand for safe havens amid stock market volatility.\nSpooked by brewing trade tensions and a broad reversal in technology shares, global investors have cut their equity exposure to a four-month low in March, while reducing their holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years.\nAt 9:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 129.06 points, or 0.54 percent, at 23,977.48 and the S&P 500 was up 8.78 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,613.78.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 4.21 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,945.01.\nAmazon fell 3.7 percent after President Donald Trump blasted the company with a list of complaints, a day after news website Axios reported that Trump wants to rein in the company’s growing power using federal antitrust laws.\nThe S&P consumer discretionary index was the only loser among the 11 major S&P sectors.\nGameStop shares fell 10.8 percent after the company provided disappointing full-year sales forecast.\nEconomic data released on Thursday did little to change the expectations on interest rate hikes.\nCore personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge, rose 1.6 percent on an annualized basis through February, in line with economists’ expectations.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in January.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 5.59-to-1 ratio and for a 3.20-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
