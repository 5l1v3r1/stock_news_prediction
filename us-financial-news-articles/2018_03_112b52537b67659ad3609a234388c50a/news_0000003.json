The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 342,889 contracts on Feb. 27, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. A week earlier, speculators held 214,480 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures. On Tuesday, Powell told the U.S. House Financial Services Committee the economy has strengthened since December and he is confident that inflation will rise. His remarks raised bets the Fed may raise rates four times in 2018, one more than what policy-makers projected in December. In response, traders sold shorter-dated Treasuries heavily, propelling the two-year yield to a nine-year peak and flattening the yield curve. The speculative net short in Eurodollar futures reached a record peak at 3.19 million contracts on Feb. 27, reflecting traders' view the U.S. central bank is open to hiking rates faster if the economy picks up steam due to last year's tax cuts and a stronger global backdrop. Meanwhile, concerns about a faster pace of rate increases sparked a sell-off on Wall Street on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, Powell, in his return to Congress for the second part of his semi-annual testimony on the economy as Fed chief, told the Senate Banking Committee he did not see evidence the economy is overheating. This provided some relief to the stock market and revived some appetite for shorter-dated Treasuries.
