(NYSE America: PLYM) (the “Company”) today announced its consolidated financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and other recent developments. A comparison of the reported amounts per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 to prior-year periods has been affected by an increase in the common stock outstanding resulting from the completion of, and the use of proceeds from, the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO\") in June 2017, as discussed below.\nFourth Quarter and Subsequent Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, closed on the acquisition of 19 buildings totaling 3.4 million square feet for total consideration of $115.2 million in three separate transactions. Reported results for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflect a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $5.3 million, or $(1.44) per weighted average common share; net operating income (“NOI”) of $5.3 million; Funds from Operations (“FFO”) of $0.01 per weighted average common share; and Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”) of $0.05 per weighted average common share. For the fourth quarter of 2017, declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 for the common stock and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.46875 per share (pro-rated to $0.3542 per share to reflect a partial quarter) for the 7.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“the Preferred Stock”). On November 14, 2017, closed on the issuance of an additional 240,000 shares of its Preferred Stock representing a total of 2,040,000 shares and gross proceeds of $51.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. On March 6, 2018, the Company fully leased its 527,127-square-foot 3500 Southwest Boulevard building in Columbus, Ohio, eliminating Plymouth’s largest lease expiration for 2018.\n2017 Highlights\nAcquired 29 buildings totaling 5.2 million square feet for total consideration of $173.3 million in eight separate transactions. Raised a total of $101.5 million in net proceeds through an initial public offering of common shares and a public offering of Preferred Stock. Secured $79.8 million in financing from an affiliate of Goldman Sachs for a 15-building portfolio acquisition and a $35 million senior secured credit facility from Key Bank National Association (subsequently increased to $45 million) to fund additional acquisitions. Reported results for 2017 reflect a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $9.6 million, or $(4.45) per weighted average common share; NOI of $16.6 million; FFO of $(0.12) per weighted average common share; and AFFO of $0.38 per weighted average common share.\nJeff Witherell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Plymouth Industrial REIT, noted, “We finished the year strong and exceeded our expectations across all of our operating segments. We completed a significant number of accretive acquisitions, which added over five million square feet to our portfolio. These new properties help diversify us geographically and expand our presence in targeted markets, while increasing our NOI and implied value. Based on an adjusted fourth quarter run rate, we expect to see significant growth in year-over-year NOI for 2018 based solely on our existing portfolio, which in turn should result in improved earnings results across all our key metrics.\n“The strong momentum we established through the fourth quarter has continued to date in 2018 as we have eliminated our largest lease expiration, built the acquisition pipeline with several near-term opportunities and secured an expansion of our senior secured credit facility to $45 million. We are well-positioned to execute our strategy to create value for shareholders.”\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nThe completion of the IPO on June 14, 2017 provided the Company with a meaningfully different capital structure compared to the prior-year period. The Company believes the use of IPO proceeds and related higher share count, makes year-over-year comparisons less meaningful, particularly on a per share basis.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $5.3 million, or $(1.44) per weighted average common share outstanding, compared with net income attributable to common stockholders of $248,000, or $0.75 per weighted average common share, for the same period in 2016. The increase in net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses from non-recurring items of $0.8 million, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $1.4 million, including a one-time charge of $0.2 million for intangibles written down due to early termination of a lease (which was subsequently substantially re-leased), an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million for debt related to acquisition activity, and a one-time real estate tax expense adjustment of $0.5 million.\nConsolidated total revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $8.4 million, compared with $5.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nNet operating income (NOI) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $5.3 million compared with NOI of $3.5 million for the same period in 2016.\nEBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $3.2 million compared with $5.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $22,000, or $0.01 per weighted average common share, compared with $(1.9) million, or $(5.82) per weighted average common share, for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of significantly lower non-cash interest expense compared with 2016 due to the recapitalization in October 2016 and the increase in weighted average shares following the IPO in June 2017.\nAFFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $190,000, or $0.05 per weighted average common share, compared with $(1.9) million, or $(5.63) per weighted average common share, for the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of significantly lower non-cash interest expense compared with 2016 due to the recapitalization in October 2016 and the increase in weighted average shares following the IPO in June 2017.\nInvestment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had real estate investments comprised of 49 industrial buildings totaling 9.2 million square feet with occupancy of 96.5%. The following summarizes the Company’s investment activity during the fourth quarter of 2017:\nOn November 30, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of a 15-building portfolio of Class B industrial buildings totaling 3.0 million square feet in the greater Chicago area for $99.75 million in total consideration. The purchase price, which is projected to provide an initial yield of 8.1%, included $19.95 million in cash and a $79.8 million, two-year secured term loan at an initial annual interest rate of 4.35%. On December 21, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of a three-building portfolio of industrial buildings totaling 330,361 square feet in Atlanta for $11.425 million in cash at an initial yield of 8.3%. On December 22, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of a 75,000-square-foot light manufacturing building in the greater Chicago area for $4.1 million in cash at an initial yield of 9.7%.\nLeasing Activity\nOn March 6, 2018, the Company fully leased its 527,127-square-foot building located at 3500 Southwest Boulevard in Columbus, Ohio to Stonecrop Technologies. The lease, which is scheduled to commence March 15, 2018, eliminates the Company’s largest 2018 lease expiration. Plymouth also opened a new regional office in Columbus that serves the Company’s properties there as well as Cincinnati, Cleveland and Indiana.\nCapital Markets Activity\nOn October 25, 2017, the Company closed its underwritten public offering of 1,800,000 shares of its Preferred Stock. On November 14, 2017, the Company closed on the issuance of an additional 240,000 shares of its Preferred Stock representing a total of 2,040,000 shares and gross proceeds of $51.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\nOn March 5, 2018, the Company increased its senior secured revolving credit facility with KeyBank National Association to $45 million. The facility expires in August 2020 and has one 12-month extension option. The facility has an accordion feature that allows total borrowing capacity under the line to be increased up to $75 million.\nQuarterly Distributions to Common Stockholders\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.46875 per share for the Company’s Preferred Stock for the fourth quarter of 2017. The initial dividend was pro-rated to $0.3542 per share to reflect the period commencing October 25, 2017, the original issue date, and ending on December 31, 2017. This pro-rated dividend was paid on January 2, 2018 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2017.\nOn December 15, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.375 per share for Company’s common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017. The dividend was payable on January 31, 2018, to stockholders of record on December 29, 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company introduced the following guidance for 2018. The information provided contains estimates based on the Company’s anticipated results of operations for 2018. All estimates exclude any potential impact from additional acquisitions:\nTotal revenues of $42.4 million to $43.8 million Net operating income of $28.0 million to $28.9 million General and administrative expenses of $4.4 million to $5.2 million, including non-cash expenses of $0.8 million to $1.0 million 4.2 million common shares outstanding\nEarnings Conference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast, both open for the general public to hear, on Friday, March 9, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

As a result, we are required to include in this report a statement of why management believes that presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors.\nNone of NOI, EBITDA, FFO or AFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, and we believe that to understand our performance further NOI, EBITDA, FFO, and AFFO should be compared with our reported net income or net loss and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nNOI\nWe consider net operating income, or NOI, to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management understand the core operations of our properties. We define NOI as total revenue (including rental revenue, tenant reimbursements, management, leasing and development services revenue and other income) less property-level operating expenses including allocated overhead. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, and other non-operating items.\nEBITDA\nWe believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of our industrial properties. We also use this measure in ratios to compare our performance to that of our industry peers.\nFFO\nFunds from operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, impairment losses and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. Other equity REITs may not calculate FFO (in accordance with the NAREIT definition) as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs’ FFO. FFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nAFFO\nAdjusted funds from operation, or AFFO, is presented in addition to FFO. AFFO is defined as FFO, excluding certain non-cash operating revenues and expenses, acquisition and transaction related costs for transactions not completed and recurring capitalized expenditures. Recurring capitalized expenditures includes expenditures required to maintain and re-tenant our properties, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. AFFO further adjusts FFO for certain other non-cash items, including the amortization or accretion of above or below market rents included in revenues, straight line rent adjustments, impairment losses, non-cash equity compensation and non-cash interest expense.\nWe believe AFFO provides a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management’s analysis of the operating performance of our properties. As a result, we believe that the use of AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance.\nAs with FFO, our reported AFFO may not be comparable to other REITs’ AFFO, should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of our funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends.\nPLYMOUTH INDUSTRIAL REIT, INC.
