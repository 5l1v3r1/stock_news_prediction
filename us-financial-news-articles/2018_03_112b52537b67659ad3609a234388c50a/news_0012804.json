He is involved in all facets of portfolio management including working with the senior Portfolio Managers and CIOs to develop and apply the macro and sector level views at the individual portfolio level. Additionally, Brown works closely with the sector teams and portfolio construction to implement trades and optimize portfolios.\n“We congratulate Steve on earning this outstanding recognition from industry peers,” said Jerry W. Miller, President of Guggenheim Investments. “Steve’s significant achievements reflect our firm’s strong commitment to providing clients with the industry’s top talent across all portfolio management and investment functions.”\nBefore joining the portfolio management team in 2012, Brown worked in the non-mortgage asset-backed securities group. His responsibilities on that team included trading, sourcing and evaluating investment opportunities and monitoring credits.\nBrown previously held roles within treasury services and structured products at ABN AMRO and Bank of America in Chicago and London.

These payments may vary based on the rate loans are repaid. Some asset-backed securities may have structures that make their reaction to interest rates and other factors difficult to predict, making their prices volatile and they are subject to liquidity and valuation risk. CLOs bear similar risks to investing in loans directly. • Investments in loans involve special types of risks, including credit, interest rate, counterparty, prepayment, liquidity, and valuation risks. Loans are often below investment grade, may be unrated, and typically offer a fixed or floating interest rate. • High yield and unrated debt securities are at a greater risk of default than investment grade bonds and may be less liquid, which may increase volatility.\nRead the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus (if available) carefully before investing. It contains the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information, which should be considered carefully before investing.
