Neymar is not a project,” Sacchi said.\n“We won Serie A (in 1988) with Marco van Basten... who played three full games out of 30. If the project had been Van Basten, we would not have won anything.\n“We won the Champions League with (Ruud) Gullit and you know how many games he played (in 1989-90)? Only one.”\nSacchi said that PSG have yet to develop the right club culture.\n“To win something, the most important thing is the club, its vision, its competence, its rules and its choices. Only after comes the team,” the Italian said.\n“I have the feeling that at PSG, this hierarchy is not respected.”\nIn the second leg against Real, midfielder Marco Verratti was sent off midway through the second half after arguing with the referee, behaviour Sacchi said should not be tolerated by the club.\n“The authority must come from the club. Last year, Juventus saw that some players were protesting because the coach (Massimiliano Allegri) was replacing them or that they were becoming arrogant, what did they do? They left Bonucci out,” said Sacchi.\n“He sat in the stands on a Champions League night and the next summer they sold him. They sent the signal that at the club, it is not the players who make the rules.”\n($1 = 0.8134 euros)\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:42:21.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
