(OTC Pink:TOMDF) ( http://www.Todosmedical.com ) today announced the results of a clinical trial recently completed at Kaplan Hospital in Rehovot, Israel. The trial related to the proprietary TM - B1 Assay for breast cancer screening initiated in 2016 and which was recently completed. The trial was prospective, two arms, unblinded and consisted of 220 female subjects.\nThe results of the TM - B1 trial presented a high degree of accuracy of approximately 90% with respect to identifying healthy versus benign versus breast cancer in female subjects tested. TM-B1 results were compared against known gold standard methods, such as mammography, ultrasound and biopsy.\n“We believe that we are approaching an era where detecting breast cancer at an early stage will be done by a simple blood test. We are thrilled and very pleased with the results we achieved. We believe that this clinical trial is a very important step in our path to commercialization. It confirms results we have from previous trials and shows the potential benefits our test may bring to the market. This achievement is the result of intensive work done using our TBIA (Total Biochemical Infrared Analysis) innovative technology and demonstrates the potential strength of TBIA as a platform for cancer detection. We intend to keep up the momentum in exploring TBIA capabilities in detecting other types of cancers,” said Rami Zigdon, Chief Executive Officer of Todos Medical.\nTM-B1 test is based on biochemical analysis of blood components - plasma and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) using infrared spectroscopy. The TM-B1 assay is indicated for women aged 25 years and older without a diagnosis of inflammatory disease. The assay is intended to be used as a diagnostic method to indicate whether a breast malignancy is present or not. TM-B1 results are intended to be used in conjunction with other common diagnostic tests as part of breast cancer screening.\nAbout Todos Medical\nTodos Medical Ltd. (OTC Pink:TOMDF), an Israeli company headquartered in Rehovot, is a cancer in-vitro-diagnostic company engaging in the development of a series of blood tests for the early detection of a variety of cancers. The company has developed two cancer screening tests based on TBIA, a method for cancer screening using peripheral blood analysis. The TBIA screening method is based on the cancer’s influence on the immune system which triggers biochemical changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma. This proprietary and patented method incorporates biochemistry, physics and signal processing. The company’s two cancer screening tests, TM-B1 and TM-B2 are CE marked in the EU.\nFor more information, the content of which is not part of this press release, please visit http://www.Todosmedical.com .\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
