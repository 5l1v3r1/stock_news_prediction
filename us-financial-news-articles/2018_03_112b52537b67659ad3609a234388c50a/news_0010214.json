Its markets are fast-growing and nearly twice as profitable as the global average.”\nHowever, that growth is by no means evenly spread, either geographically or among income groups.\nOnly five countries -- South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Angola and Morocco -- currently account for 68 percent of Africa’s total banking revenue.\nAnd about 60 percent of the total retail revenue growth of nearly $18 billion expected over the next five years will be concentrated in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Ghana.\n“Where you are in Africa matters - in a big way,” the report said. “About 65 percent of African banks’ profitability and 94 percent of their revenue growth are attributable to their geographical footprint.”\nAnd though only 15 percent of Africans had annual income above $5,000 last year, McKinsey’s research indicated that nearly 70 percent of retail banking revenue growth through 2025 will come from customers earning between $6,000 and $36,000.\nMeanwhile, heavy staff costs and labor-intensive, paper-dominated processes hold back productivity, the report said.\nCredit risk also remains a concern, with non-performing loans accounting for more than 5 percent of African banks’ portfolios.\nReporting by Joe Bavier; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:15:10.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
