However, after soaring 9 percent this year, Worth says the technical setup points to new highs for the old tech darling.\n\nA look at the five-year chart of Oracle reveals a well-defined cup-and-handle formation which Worth says \"is usually resolved by an up.\" In the same period, he highlights a falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential breakout above Oracle's 52-week high of $53.48.\n\nFurthermore, Worth noted that since Oracle has broken above its dot-com bubble high the stock has showed signs of strength.\n\"Often after breaking out from well-defined tops you check back to the top, pivot and start to go up again,\" he explained.\n\n\"I love it. I want to be long Oracle going into its earnings,\" Worth says. \"The charts speak for themselves.\"\nOracle shares were trading lower, around $51.57, on Monday afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T19:58:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
