But don't worry if you haven't made any travel plans yet — here are tips on booking and where to go without breaking the bank.\nBooking tips\nTo get the best deal on flights, you should travel mid-week, according to Hopper , an app that uses data to predict and analyze airfare. Friday is the most popular day to depart, says Hopper, so it's also the most expensive. In fact, it will cost you 20 percent more than flying on a Tuesday, the cheapest day to depart.\nWhen it comes to your return trip, Hopper's Spring Break Cheat Sheet recommends avoiding a Sunday flight — it will cost you 10 percent more than returning on a Friday. Also try avoiding peak spring break travel time. Hopper pegs the most expensive times to travel from a U.S. airport this spring between April 2 and April 15, when flights can have a 25 percent premium.\nWhere to go\nBeyond booking, where you go can also make a difference for your budget. Here some popular but affordable destinations offering deals this spring break season. Keep in mind that flight deals are often fleeting and airfare fluctuates frequently.\nKey West, Florida\nThis sunny location was named the Top Domestic Deal Destination for Under $500 in a report from travel search engine Kayak . Domestically, Key West is seeing the biggest drop in airfare when compared to last year, Kayak says, with prices down 13 percent and a median airfare of $421.\nWhile a search for hotel prices in Key West for the beginning of April yield pretty hefty rates — from over roughly $250 a night to over $410 a night — Airbnb offers some pretty affordable and unique accommodation options. For example, this Key West boat rental sleeps three and starts at $165 a night.\nLas Vegas\nLas Vegas ranked fifth on Kayak's list for Top Domestic Deal Destinations Under $500, with airfare down 12 percent this year at a median price of $238.\nAirlines often offer flash sales for tickets to this hot spot too.

As of Friday, rates at the beginning of April are going for a little less than $150 a night, and the hotel offers amenities like indoor and outdoor pools, walk-out balconies, a spa and a salon.\nWalt Disney World, Orlando, Florida\nBefore the summer crowds flock to the most magical place on earth, use spring break as an excuse to squeeze in a trip.\nDisney World is currently offering up to 20 percent off rooms at select Disney Resort hotels. The deal is valid for stays most nights from April 15 through June 10, when you book through April 7. The offer is valid for Disney Resort hotels like Disney Deluxe Villas and Disney Deluxe Resorts.\nHowever, be prepared for at least a few long lines.
