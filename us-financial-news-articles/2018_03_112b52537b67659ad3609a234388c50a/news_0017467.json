The government has said that it is better to route the line through park rather than build in populated areas, which would require land seizures.\nActivists said the raised railway through the park will affect animals’ routes and breeding grounds.\nBut Paul Gathitu, a spokesman for the government’s Kenya Wildlife Service, said human encroachment was more of a concern to animals than the railway line, which will be at least eight meters off the ground and painted to blend with nature.\n“There’s a lot of land use changes with people encroaching on their routes,” he said.\nReporting by Kevin Mwanza, Editing by Katy Migiro.
