Federal investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were heading to the school, the agency said. \nIt occurred amid a re-energized national debate over school shootings in the United States following an attack on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 students and faculty. \nThe shooting came four days before the March For Our Lives — partly organized by student survivors of the Parkland rampage — takes place in Washington to urge lawmakers to pass tighter gun control laws. \nA student who said his name was Jonathan Freese said in a telephone interview on CNN that he had been on lockdown with classmates for nearly an hour, but he did not hear gunshots himself. The interview ended as police came to his classroom door. \nMaryland Governor Larry Hogan said he was monitoring events at the school. \"Our prayers are with students, school personnel, and first responders,\" he said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T15:13:10.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
