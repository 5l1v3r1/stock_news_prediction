Wall Street shares suffered a 2-3 percent blow on Tuesday, tech-heavy Asian bourses fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday and European bourses opened sharply lower .\n“There’s a general rotation from risky assets towards safe haven assets... with weakened equities and trade war tensions in the general backdrop,” said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder.\n“In the euro zone, you also see data coming somewhat on the disappointing side and the ECB striking a more dovish tone.”\nEconomic sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro slipped for the third month in a row in March, while bank lending slowed, data this week showed.\nECB Governing Council members Erkki Liikanen and Jozef Makuch said on Tuesday underlying inflation in the euro zone may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust, so the central bank needed to remain patient in removing stimulus.\nMost euro zone bond yields were down by as much as 2 basis points on the day.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield fell to its lowest level in more than three months at 1.84 percent, down 3 basis point on the day. Its gap over better-rated German peers was at 135 bps.\nItaly sold 5.5 billion euros in an auction of bonds maturing in 2023 and 2028, fulfilling its target of 4.5-5.5 billion euros. Analysts said the auction showed there was still strong appetite for Italian debt, despite the country’s uncertain political future.\nThe Italian Treasury sold the February 2028 BTP at a yield of 1.83 percent, the lowest 10-year Italian funding cost since November.\nAfter an inconclusive election in Italy on March 4, the prospects of a coalition agreement between the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement have grown.\nElsewhere, British bonds outperformed, with yields dropping by 5-6 basis points. The yield on the 10-year gilt fell to as low as 1.362 percent, its lowest since late January.\nA new French bond maturing in 2036 and indexed to eurozone inflation booked was introduced on Wednesday.\nReporting by Fanny Potkin Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:14:58.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
