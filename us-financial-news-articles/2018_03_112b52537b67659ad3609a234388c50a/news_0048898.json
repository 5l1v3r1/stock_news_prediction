Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo \nU.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said she needed a better understanding of how Take-Two Interactive Software Inc’s flagship game is “generally played,” before deciding whether its “realistic” depiction of tattoos licensed by Solid Oak Sketches LLC amounted to fair use. \nSolid Oak is seeking damages for the depiction of tattoos belonging to James, Eric Bledsoe and Kenyon Martin, for which it owns copyright registrations.

The New York-based company has said it does not comment on legal matters. \n“The judge got it right,” Darren Heitner, a lawyer for Solid Oak, said. “It absolutely would have been premature to rule in the opposite fashion, and we look forward to proceeding with the case.” \nSwain said that before deciding whether Take-Two committed copyright infringement, she wanted to know how the “average lay observer” would see the tattoos while playing the game, and how prominent the tattoos actually were. \n“The visibility and prominence of the tattoos on screen are affected by countless possible game permutations that are dependent on individual players’ choices,” Swain wrote. \nGrand Theft Auto is among Take-Two’s other franchises. \nThe case is Solid Oak Sketches LLC v. Visual Concepts LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-00724.
