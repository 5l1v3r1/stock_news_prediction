The second tranche of 1 billion euros will be paid out under the condition that Greece makes progress “in reducing its stock of arrears and improving the effectiveness of the e-auction system”, the ESM said.\nThe European Commission’s vice president, Valdis Dombrovskis, welcomed the decision and urged Greece to successfully end the current bailout programme.\nAthens is expected to implement more reforms - including privatisations and liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets - before August in exchange for more loans.\nAround one third of the available funds under the bailout programme is expected to remain unspent.\n“Today’s decision by the ESM Board of Directors acknowledges the hard work by the Greek government and Greek people in completing an extensive set of reforms,” ESM Managing Director Klaus Regling said.\nThe new loans will be used to service Greece’s debt, pay domestic arrears and accumulate a cash buffer, the ESM said.\nThe cash buffer could reach 20 billion euros by the end of the programme, a figure EU officials believe could support sustainable growth and help the country return to tap financial markets at lower costs.\nA further relief on Greece’s huge public debt, one of the largest in the world in relation to the size of the economy, could be offered by the end of the bailout programme under new conditions yet to be decided.\n$1 = 0.8070 euros Reporting Francesco Guarascio Editing by Gabriela Baczynska and Mark Heinrich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
