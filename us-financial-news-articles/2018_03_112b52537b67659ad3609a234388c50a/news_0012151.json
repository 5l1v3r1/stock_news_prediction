Claire Lepercq/CatComm-RioOnWatch Vale Encantado, which means “Enchanted Valley, installed a biodigester with the help of a local university to generate cooking gas for some of the favela’s 25 homes and for a local eco-tourism cooperative.\n“We are the first community to set up a sewerage treatment system here,” Otavio Barros, head of the Vale Encantado Residents’ Association, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“Everyone used to throw (waste and sewerage) into an open sewer...(so) we set up a piping system,” said Barros.\nRio has about 1,000 slums, which are home to nearly one in four of the city’s population and typically lack a range of infrastructure and services, experts say.\nThe initiative is among 111 projects in a network of sustainable solutions in the slums, known as favelas.\nThe projects were mapped in a report launched last week by Catalytic Communities (CatComm), a charity that works with people in favelas toward better integration of informal settlements.\nOtavio Barros working on the construction of a sewerage biodigester in slum Vale Encantado in the midst of Rio de Janeiro’s Tijuca forest, September 2017. Claire Lepercq/CatComm-RioOnWatch Under the umbrella name “Sustainable Favela Network”, the projects help to build resilience and environmental sustainability in favelas, CatComm said.\nMost of the initiatives tackle environmental issues such as waste management, community gardens and the preservation of natural surroundings.\nWaste biodigester built in slum Vale Encantado in the midst of Rio de Janeiro’s Tijuca forest (FYI I’m trying to get a confirmation of the date for this, at it was built in 2014). Claire Lepercq/CatComm-RioOnWatch Rio’s Pontifical Catholic University built Vale Encantado’s biodigester as part of a state-funded research project.\nBarros said the original goal was to connect all 25 houses at Vale Encantado to the biosystem. But a 10,000 reais ($3,000) funding shortfall means just five houses are fully using it.\n“We are looking for another partner. What is lacking is not much ... I worked to build it, and my house is not linked,” he said.\nOnce the system is fully implemented the idea is to persuade people to bring organic waste to the cooperative in exchange for fresh bread that it will bake using the energy generated. There is no other bakery close to the slum, Barros said.\n“Then I can make a sustainable cycle: solid waste generates gas, I bake the bread and it comes back to the community,” Barros said.\nReporting by Karla Mendes, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
