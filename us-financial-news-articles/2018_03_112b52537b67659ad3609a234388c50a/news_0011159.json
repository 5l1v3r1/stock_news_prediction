Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda speaks next to Japan's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso (L) during a financial and monetary committee session at the Lower House of the parliament in Tokyo, Japan, February 16, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai Some have called on the BOJ to raise its bond yield target before inflation hits the bank’s 2 percent target, arguing that 2 percent was too high a level to aim for in a country that has suffered from two decades of deflation. “As European and U.S. central banks normalise monetary policy and Japan’s inflation picks up, markets may put upward pressure on long-term interest rates,” Kuroda told parliament. “I’m hesitant and cautious at this stage of immediately yielding to such market pressure and raising our long-term yield target,” he said.
