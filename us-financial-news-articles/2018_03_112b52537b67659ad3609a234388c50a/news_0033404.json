The agency said it was reviewing 425,000 2012-2013 Kia Forte cars and 2011 Hyundai Sonata cars and will determine if any other manufacturers used similar air bag control units. Hyundai issued a recall last month for 154,753 U.S. Sonatas after non-deployment reports were linked to electrical overstress in the airbag control unit but said it did have a fix yet. The automakers did not immediately comment early Saturday.
