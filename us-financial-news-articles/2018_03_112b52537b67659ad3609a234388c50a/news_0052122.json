The three men communicated in September and October 2016, when Mr. Gates worked with Donald Trump’s campaign, according to the prosecutors’ document.\nMr. van der Zwaan has admitted he hid from prosecutors the fact that the three men were in touch that recently. The conversations among the men concerned the potential criminal prosecution in Ukraine of Mr. van der Zwaan and others, according to court documents.\nThe disclosure helps connect the dots between the cases against Mr. Gates and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Mr. Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Messrs. Gates and Manafort were accused of alleged financial misdeeds connected to their political consulting work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine before the 2016 campaign. Mr. Manafort also faces tax and bank-fraud charges relating to actions he took as recently as January 2017.\nMr. Mueller, appointed in the wake of Mr. Trump’s firing last year of James Comey as FBI director, has been examining potential links between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign apparatus. U.S. intelligence has determined Russia interfered in the U.S. election to undermine faith in the democratic process, and aspired to help Mr. Trump’s chances of winning. Moscow has denied the accusation, and Mr. Trump has also denied colluding with Russia and referred to Mr. Mueller’s probe as a “witch hunt.”\nMr. Gates pleaded guilty last month in connection with the case and agreed to cooperate in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry . Mr. Manafort has denied the charges and is scheduled to go to trial later this year . Mr. van der Zwaan pleaded guilty last month to lying to Mr. Mueller’s investigators about his contacts with Mr. Gates and the business associate in Ukraine.\nIn a filing on Tuesday, lawyers for Mr. Manafort argued that the charges against Mr. Manafort, which deal with Ukraine consulting work that ended in 2014 and with personal financial issues, have “no connection to coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign” and therefore fall outside Mr. Mueller’s purview.\nIn addition, former Trump national security adviser Mike Flynn and former campaign foreign-policy adviser George Papadopoulos have pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators about their contacts with Russians. Mr. Mueller has also secured an indictment against three Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens on charges of engaging in a widespread effort to interfere in the election.\nThe new details about the connections among Messrs. van der Zwaan and Gates and a business associate identified as a former spy and referred to as “Person A” were laid out in a memo filed by Mr. Mueller’s office urging a court to sentence Mr. van der Zwaan to jail. He faces up to six months.\nAccording to the prosecutors’ memo, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents working on Mr. Mueller’s investigation determined that “Person A has ties to a Russian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016.”\n“During his first interview…van der Zwaan admitted that he knew of that connection, stating that Gates told him Person A was a former Russian Intelligence Officer with the GRU,” prosecutors said in the filing. An attorney for Mr. Gates didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhen it comes to the Russia investigation, the word \"Collusion\" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. The description of “Person A,” who is identified in court documents as “a close business colleague” of Messrs. Manafort and Gates who worked in Ukraine at Mr. Manafort’s company, is consistent with Konstantin Kilimnik. Mr. Kilimnik declined to comment Wednesday but has previously said he worked for several years as a language instructor at the Military Institute of Foreign Languages and has denied any ties to Russian intelligence.\nMr. van der Zwaan, who is also the son-in-law of one of Russia’s richest men, was an associate at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, where he had worked with Messrs. Gates and Manafort in 2012 to prepare a report for the Ukraine Ministry of Justice evaluating the criminal trial of the former Ukraine prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. He admitted in February that he misled the special counsel’s office about his last contacts with Mr. Gates and others, hiding that they had spoken in September 2016.\nIn a filing arguing for a sentence of probation, lawyers for Mr. van der Zwaan said he had lied about the conversations in an effort to protect his job, not to hinder the investigation. Mr. van der Zwaan had improperly recorded a related conversation he had with a Skadden partner and didn’t want the firm to find out about the recording, his lawyers said. Mr. van der Zwaan lost the job.\nNewsletter Sign-up Mr. van der Zwaan had also not flagged some relevant emails from his personal account that would be of interest to the special counsel’s office because they involved conversations he had in 2012 and 2013 about potentially working directly with Messrs. Gates and Manafort. He didn’t want his law firm to find out about those communications, his lawyers said.\nThe 33-year-old Dutch citizen has been living in a hotel in New York since November 2017, while his wife is in London and expecting a baby in August, according to the court document. “His days are empty and lonely,” Mr. van der Zwaan’s lawyers wrote.\nThe Tuesday disclosure isn’t the first reference Mr. Mueller’s office has made to Mr. Manafort’s alleged ties to Russian intelligence. In December, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors withdrew support for less-restrictive confinement of Mr. Manafort before his trial, saying that Mr. Manafort had been secretly writing an editorial with a business colleague “assessed to have ties to a Russian intelligence service.”\n—Alan Cullison contributed to this article.\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:05:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
