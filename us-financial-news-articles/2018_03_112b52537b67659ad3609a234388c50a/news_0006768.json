The S&P 500 rose 0.43 percent to 2,756.19 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.52 percent to 7,368.17.\nA string of retail earnings drove gains in the S&P retail index, which was up 0.94 percent.\nOnline retailer Etsy jumped 18 percent after its revenue beat estimates, and off-price apparel seller TJX rose 6.5 percent after reporting upbeat same-store sales.\nShares of No.2 home improvement chain Lowe’s fell nearly 9 percent after its quarterly profit and margins missed estimates as it spent heavily to take on competition.\nCelgene fell 6 percent after U.S. health regulators rejected the company’s application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug.\nA Reuters analysis showed global investors cut their equity exposure to a three-month low in February, though most still expect stocks to test new highs despite rising bond yields.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, was last at 2.8825 percent after spiking as much as 2.9250 percent on Tuesday.\nWall Street’s main volatility gauge, the CBOE Volatility index eased to 17.56 points after hitting as much as 18.98 during Powell’s testimony.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,960 to 475. On the Nasdaq, 1,577 issues rose and 628 fell.
