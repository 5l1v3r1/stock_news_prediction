Beijing told Washington that U.S. export restrictions on some high-tech products are to blame.\n\"China has already prepared, and has the strength, to defend its national interests,\" Liu said on Saturday.\nFiring off a warning shot, China on Friday declared plans to levy additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, imposed after a separate U.S. probe.\nshow chapters 30% of CFO are concerned about trade policy 23 Hours Ago | 01:31 Zhang Zhaoxiang, senior vice president of China Minmetals Corp, said that while the state-owned mining group's steel exports to the U.S. are tiny, the impact could come indirectly.\n\"China's direct exports to the U.S. are not big. But there will be some impact due to our exports via the United States or indirect exports,\" Zhang told reporters on the sidelines of the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday.\nChina's state-run Global Times said Beijing was only just beginning to look at means to retaliate.\n\"We believe it is only part of China's countermeasures, and soybeans and other U.S. farm products will be targeted,\" the widely-read tabloid said in a Saturday editorial.\nWei Jianguo, vice chairman of Beijing-based think tank China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, told China Daily that Beijing could impose tariffs on more U.S. products, and is considering a second and even third list of targets.\nPossible items include aircraft and chips, Wei, a former vice commerce minister, told the newspaper, adding that tourism could be a possible target.\nSoybeans, autos, planes The commerce ministry's response had so far been \"relatively weak\", respected former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei said at the forum.\n\"If I were in the government, I would probably hit soybeans first, then hit autos and airplanes,\" said Lou, currently chairman of the National Council for Social Security Fund.\nU.S. farm groups have long feared that China, which imports more than third of all U.S. soybeans, could slow purchases of agricultural products, heaping more pain on the struggling U.S. farm sector.\nshow chapters Stocks fall as trade war fears heat up 4:21 PM ET Fri, 23 March 2018 | 03:33 U.S. agricultural exports to China stood at $19.6 billion last year, with soybean shipments accounting for $12.4 billion.\nChinese penalties on U.S. soybeans will especially hurt Iowa, a state that backed Trump in the 2016 presidential elections.\nBoeing jets have also been often cited as a potential target by China.\nChina and the U.S. had benefited by globalization, Blackrock's Larry Fink said at the forum.\n\"I believe that a dialogue and maybe some adjustments in trade and trade policy can be in order. It does not need to be done publicly; it can be done privately,\" he said.\nApple's Tim Cook called for \"calm heads\" amid the dispute.\nThe sparring has cast a spotlight on hardware makers such as Apple, which assemble the majority of their products in China for export to other countries.\nElectrical goods and tech are the largest U.S. import item from China.\nSome economists say higher U.S. tariffs will lead to higher costs and ultimately hurt U.S. consumers, while restrictions on Chinese investments could take away jobs in America.\n\"I don't think local governments in the United States and President Trump hope to see U.S. workers losing their jobs,\" Sun Yongcai, general manager at Chinese railway firm CRRS Corp, which has two U.S. production plants, said at the forum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T14:01:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
