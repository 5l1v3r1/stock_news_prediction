Husteel shares ( 005010.KS ) rose 3.4 percent, while Seah Steel ( 003030.KS ) and Seah Besteel ( 001430.KS ) gained 2 percent and 4.9 percent respectively.\nThe sub-index for iron, steel and metal .KS34 rose 1.7 percent, edging back from earlier gains, ahead of a 0.8 percent gain in the broader market .KS11 .\nAuto shares were mixed, with Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) 1.3 percent weaker and Kia Motors ( 000270.KS ) up 0.5 percent.\nUnder KORUS revisions, U.S. automakers will be able to bring into South Korea 50,000 vehicles per automaker per year that meet U.S. safety standards, not necessarily Korean standards, up from 25,000 vehicles previously.\nSouth Korea and the United States earlier this month held a third round of negotiations on revising their trade pact. Reducing South Korean non-tariff barriers to U.S. automotive exports has been a priority for the Trump administration.\nTrump late on Thursday issued a proclamation that South Korea, Argentina, Australia, Brazil and the European Union would get temporary exemptions from steel and aluminum tariffs, along with Canada and Mexico’s earlier exemptions. The exemptions run until May 1 as discussions continue.\nReporting by Dahee Kim and Hyunjoo Jin; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:06:14.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
