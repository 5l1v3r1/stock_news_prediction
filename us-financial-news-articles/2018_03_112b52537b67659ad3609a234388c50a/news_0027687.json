Enrollment remains on track, and we continue to expect to report topline data from the study in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, the ContraFect research team presented important new microbiologic data at scientific venues throughout the year. These data extend our understanding of the antimicrobial activity and resistance profile of CF-301 and further support the therapeutic potential of CF-301 and our broader lysin pipeline,” said Steven C. Gilman, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ContraFect. “We are excited that the next wave of potential therapies to combat the global threat of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens may emerge from our suite of Gram-negative lysin discovery programs, which are currently focused on lysins targeting drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ). We are confident in the outlook for the year ahead, and we look forward to successfully completing our Phase 2 study and advancing our robust portfolio of novel anti-infectives,” continued Dr. Gilman.\n2017 Highlights\nInitiated Phase 2 Clinical Trial of CF-301\nIn May 2017, the Company initiated a multi-center, multi-national Phase 2 clinical trial of its lead lysin product candidate, CF-301, for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis, caused by methicillin-resistant or methicillin-susceptible Staph aureus. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CF-301 used in addition to standard of care antibiotics vs. standard of care antibiotics alone.\nBased on review of safety data after completion of approximately one-third of study patient enrollment, there have been no serious adverse events reported to be related to study drug, no adverse event reports of hypersensitivity related to study drug and no discontinuations of study drug due to adverse events.\nPresented Clinical and Preclinical Data Supporting CF-301\nIn April 2017, the Company presented data from its CF-301 program at the 27 th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease, which included long-term immunologic follow-up data from its Phase 1 clinical trial of CF-301 demonstrating safety and tolerability, and methodology for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to CF-301 in a clinical setting.\nIn June 2017, the Company presented data from its CF-301 program at the American Society for Microbiology Microbe 2017 conference, which included data from its Phase 1 clinical trial of CF-301 supporting the cardiovascular safety profile of CF-301 and the absence of a pro-inflammatory response to CF-301. In addition, clinical microbiology data demonstrating CF-301’s post-antibiotic effect, resistance profile, and methodology for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to CF-301 in a clinical setting were presented.\nIn September 2017, the Company presented data from its CF-301 program at Infectious Disease Week 2017, which included preclinical data demonstrating CF-301 works synergistically with a wide range of commonly used anti-staphylococcal antibiotics, as well as surveillance data showing the potent activity of CF-301 against current Staph aureus strains from infected patients.\nIn October 2017, the Company presented an overview of its Gram-negative lysin discovery program at the 4 th Antibacterial Discovery and Development Summit, which highlighted the potential to engineer bacteriophage-derived lysins to target antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria, in particular P. aeruginosa , a highly virulent pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.\nStrengthened Balance Sheet\nIn July 2017, the Company raised $40.0 million in gross proceeds in an underwritten public offering of common stock and warrants. In March 2017, the Company received a funding award from Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X) to support the discovery and development of lysin therapeutics to treat infections caused by drug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa . The award will consist of $1.1 million in initial funding, and subsequent additional awards totaling $1.0 million upon the achievement of certain objectives.\nEnhanced Intellectual Property\nIn August 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued the Company a patent covering the novel intranasal and inhalation methods of administration of effective amounts of 1mg/kg or less of CF-404, the Company’s monoclonal antibody cocktail in development for the potential treatment of influenza.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses were $4.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.5 million in the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to grant funding received and a decrease in expenditure on external consultants. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in our Phase 2 clinical trial costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.3 million in the comparable period in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in administrative personnel and severance related costs.\nResearch and development expenses were $17.3 million and general and administrative expenses were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to research and development expenses of $22.1 million and general and administrative expenses of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to lower research headcount and related laboratory expenses, a decrease in expenditure on external consultants and the receipt of grant funding during 2017. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in our Phase 2 clinical trial costs. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to lower severance costs, administrative headcount and related expenses and legal costs.\nNet loss was $4.8 million, or $0.06 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net income of $0.6 million, or $0.01 per share, for the comparable period in 2016. The change in net loss per share includes a decrease of $4.7 million, or $0.06 per share, in the non-cash gain for the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nNet loss was $15.5 million, or $0.28 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $28.5 million, or $0.85 per share, for the comparable period in 2016. The change in net loss per share includes an increase of $5.2 million, or $0.09 per share, in the non-cash gain for the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, ContraFect had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $46.9 million compared to $35.2 million at the end of 2016. The Company anticipates that current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of 2019.\nAbout ContraFect\nContraFect is a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing therapeutic protein and antibody products for life-threatening, drug-resistant infectious diseases, particularly those treated in hospital settings. An estimated 700,000 deaths worldwide each year are attributed to antimicrobial-resistant infections. We intend to address life threatening infections using our therapeutic product candidates from our lysin and monoclonal antibody platforms to target conserved regions of either bacteria or viruses (regions that are not prone to mutation). ContraFect's initial product candidates include new agents to treat antibiotic-resistant infections such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staph aureus ) and influenza. The Company’s lead lysin, CF-301, is currently being studied in a Phase 2 multicenter, multinational, randomized, controlled clinical trial in patients with Staph aureus bacteremia including endocarditis. ContraFect is also conducting research focused on the discovery of lysins to target Gram-negative bacteria.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains, and our officers and representatives may make from time to time, “ ” within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.
