He said the Trump administration“sees the stock market as a report card for success and markets have so far said this trade war is not a good idea.”\nTrump’s hard talk regarding steel and aluminum tariffs“sounds like we’re shifting back to posturing to get a better NAFTA deal,” Hogan added.\nTrump said on Monday that Canada and Mexico could avoid being caught in his planned hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports if they ceded ground to Washington in trilateral talks on a new North American trade deal.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 191.66 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,729.72, the S&P 500 gained 21.58 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,712.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.00 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,314.87.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.46 percent.\nEmerging market stocks lost 0.49 percent, weighed lower by Asia overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.08 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.66 percent, but Nikkei futures rose nearly 1 percent.\nThe euro, which earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent versus the U.S. dollar, edged higher against most major peers, including the greenback.\nThe common currency was whiplashed by weekend elections, as Germany’s Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, while results from Italy pointed to a messier outcome than expected - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no group able to form a stable government.\nThe dollar index rose 0.09 percent, with the euro up 0.1 percent to $1.2329.\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 106.09 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3847, up 0.33 percent on the day.\nThe Mexican peso lost 0.44 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.88 and the Canadian dollar was down 0.82 percent against the greenback at 1.30 per dollar.\nCrude prices rose on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns OPEC will not be able to increase its production capacity.\nU.S. crude rose 2.17 percent to $62.58 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.64, up 1.97 percent on the day.\nTreasury yields turned higher as stocks surged pointing to more risk tolerance in markets.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.8826 percent, from 2.857 percent late on Friday.\nThe 30-year bond last fell 17/32 in price to yield 3.1597 percent, from 3.132 percent late on Friday.\nSpot gold dropped 0.2 percent to $1,319.70 an ounce.
