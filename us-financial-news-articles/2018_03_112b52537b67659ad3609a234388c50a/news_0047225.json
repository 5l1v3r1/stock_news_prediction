More than 6,000 similar lawsuits have been filed, the bulk of them against AbbVie.\nIn a separate trial, a federal jury in January found AbbVie not liable in a lawsuit by an Arizona man who claimed he had suffered a pulmonary embolism as a result of using AndroGel.\nAccording to court filings, the jury on Monday concluded that AbbVie had not falsely marketed the drug and was not strictly liable, but found that the company acted negligently.\nIt awarded Mitchell $200,000 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages.\nAbbVie and lawyers for Mitchell both did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the verdict.\nMitchell suffered a heart attack in 2012 after almost five years of treatment with AndroGel, but recovered after several months, according to his lawsuit.\nIn the first AndroGel decision against AbbVie, a jury in October ordered the company to pay more than $140 million to a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. AbbVie has asked Kennelly to throw out that verdict over inconsistencies during trial.\nOther pharmaceutical companies are facing similar lawsuits over their testosterone replacement therapies.\nBut Eli Lilly and Co, Endo International and GlaxoSmithKline have told Kennelly in recent months that they have tentatively agreed to settle hundreds of lawsuits against them. The terms of those settlements were not disclosed.\nMore than 4,000 cases are still pending against AbbVie.
