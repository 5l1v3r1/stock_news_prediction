REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh \nSyria’s conflict marked seven years this week, having killed hundreds of thousands, and displaced at least 11 million more, including nearly 6 million who have fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes on the rebel pocket in eastern Ghouta killed 30 people gathering to leave for government territory on Saturday. \nThe UK-based war monitoring group said the strikes on Zamalka town also injured dozens. There was no immediate comment from Damascus, which says it only targets armed militants. \nThe Observatory said a new wave of 10,000 people had left the insurgent pocket for government territory in Ghouta, where the government launched a fierce assault a month ago. \nThe Turkish military denied on Saturday that it had struck a hospital in Afrin, where it has waged an offensive since January against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia that controls the region. \nThe YPG and the Observatory said a Turkish air strike on Afrin town’s main hospital had killed 16 people the night before.
