Sales activity declined in 80% of all local markets in February compared with the same month last year, the association said.\nThe drop in sales activity “confirms that many home buyers moved purchase decisions forward late last year before tighter mortgage rules took effect in January,” Gregory Klump, CREA’s chief economist, said in a statement.\nThe latest round of tightening at the federal level requires all prospective buyers—including those with a down payment of more than 20%—to undergo a so-called stress test before a bank can issue a loan. Under the stress test, buyers would have to qualify for a mortgage at whichever rate is higher: either 2 percentage points above the negotiated rate, or the Bank of Canada’s five-year benchmark rate.\nMr. Klump said momentum for home sales activity going into the second quarter of 2018 will also likely be weighed down by uncertainty in British Columbia. Last month, the province introduced another round of measures aimed at curbing foreign demand, including a higher tax on foreign buyers that applies to a wider geographic area.\nThe actual, not seasonally adjusted, national average price for homes sold in February was down 5% from one year earlier, CREA said. It said the average price is heavily skewed by sales in the Vancouver and Toronto areas, two of the country’s most active and expensive markets.\nCREA said in its quarterly forecast that it anticipates national sales activity will fall by 7.1% while the national average price is expected to decline by 2.3% in 2018 from the previous year.\n“Some home buyers will likely to stay on the sidelines amid heightened housing market uncertainty and continue saving a larger down payment before purchasing,” the agency said.\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T22:30:16.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
