European Defense Group MBDA's company logo is pictured in Schrobenhausen near Ingolstadt, Germany, June 25, 2015. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle MBDA will manufacture new Brimstone missiles for the UK Armed Forces, which will use them for the Royal Air Force’s Typhoon fighter aircraft and in future for the RAF’s new Protector RPAS and new Apache attack helicopters. Airbus ( AIR.PA ) and BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) both have 37.5 percent stakes in MBDA, while Italian group Leonardo ( LDOF.MI ) owns 25 percent of the company. MBDA vies with Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) of the United States for position as the world’s second largest missiles maker after Raytheon ( RTN.N ), according to industry analysts. MBDA head Antoine Bouvier also told reporters on Tuesday that the company expected tougher competition for contracts under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, as MBDA reported a dip in orders for 2017 compared to 2016.
