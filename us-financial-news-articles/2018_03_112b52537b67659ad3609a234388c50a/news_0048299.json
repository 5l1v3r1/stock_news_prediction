The company envisions American companies using its host of sites in 30 Chinese cities as well.\nThe New York opening follows two acquisitions in China this year that along with a Series C round of funding lifted the company’s valuation to about $ 1.7 billion, Ucommune said.\nThe company’s focus outside of China is Southeast Asia, where it has sites in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei, and plans to open sites in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, Mao said.\nWhile the coworking leader in China, Ucommune has only about 7 percent of that market, he said.\n“For us it’s all about building an ecosystem,” Mao said.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Daniel Bases and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2FNerRO", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T03:19:49.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
