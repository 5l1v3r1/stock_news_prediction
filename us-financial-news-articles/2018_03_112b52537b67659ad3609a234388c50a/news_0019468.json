Its exports shrank 73.9 percent to 488 GWh in 2017 from 1,869 in 2016.\nPower production relies wholly on rainwater.\nAlmost all of the electricity in Albania is produced by its three big communist-era hydropower stations and new private ones built after 2006 when the country faced long blackouts and the government launched a drive to add new sources of energy.\nNetwork losses of electricity, a term which covers both technical losses and theft, were down 5.5 percent in 2017, the institute said.
