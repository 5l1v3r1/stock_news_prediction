Hooker Guirado, who had started 38 of France’s last 44 internationals, suffered a knee injury during last Saturday’s 22-16 victory over England and is unavailable for selection. Coach Jacques Brunel has made three changes to the starting side that beat England with Benjamin Fall moving to fullback from the wing, where he replaces Hugo Bonneval, who suffered a concussion in the Paris fixture and drops out of the squad. Elsewhere, Gael Fickou is promoted from the replacements to take Fall’s place out wide in the side named on Thursday, while Adrien Pelissie replaces Guirado in the middle of the front row and tight-head prop Sedate Gomes Sa comes in for Rabah Slimani. France are fourth in the standings on 10 points, one point behind second-placed Wales. Unbeaten Ireland, who are on 19 points, have already secured the title. Bastareaud missed the narrow defeats against Ireland and Scotland at the start of the competition due to a suspension he picked up for making homophobic remarks towards an opponent during a Champions Cup game in January. The hulking midfielder returned for France’s 34-17 victory against Italy and put in another convincing performance in the win over England.
