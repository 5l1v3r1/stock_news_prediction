REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton The Investec Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slipped to 57.2 in February from 59.8 in January, a survey showed on Monday.\nThe index average for the last 12 months was 58.6, and has remained above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since August 2012, when Ireland was halfway through a three-year financial bailout.\nGrowth in new export business registered its second-lowest pace in 15 months, but almost twice as many of the managers polled still expected higher new export orders than expected a contraction.\nThe backlogs of work subindex rose but saw its lowest growth rate in three months.\nOverall growth in services reflected new domestic orders, better economic conditions, improved sentiment and a favorable exchange rate, the survey’s authors said.\nBusiness confidence strengthened to a five-month high, with 51 percent of the panel, comprising around 450 Irish service companies, predicting a rise in activity over the coming year.\n“Given the improving global economic backdrop, we think that this optimism is well-placed,” Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O’Sullivan said.\nDetailed PMI data are only available under license from Markit and customers need to apply to Markit for a license.\nReporting by Graham Fahy, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:29:55.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
