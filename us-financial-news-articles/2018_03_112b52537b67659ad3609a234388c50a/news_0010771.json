This is especially apparent after elections, when candidates’ victories are often laid at the feet of singular wizards with names like Rove, Plouffe and Bannon. And it’s in the best interest of said wizards to wink as if they—rather than fresh candidates with resonant messages and good timing—pulled off the great win.\nItalian thinkers have a word for this. Dietrologia literally means “behind-ology,” or the obsession with determining who is supposedly responsible for a phenomenon. Simple explanations won’t do; there must be underlying plots that explain why some candidates and products touch a social nerve.\nPhoto: istock/getty images This type of thinking reminds me of my favorite book when I was a conspiracy-minded teenager in the 1970s— Wilson Bryan Key’s “Subliminal Seduction,” which argued that Americans were being manipulated by hidden messages in advertising. The most famous example was a magazine ad displaying ice cubes in a liquor glass, which, upon closer inspection, appeared to contain the letters S-E-X. The implication was that the mind’s subconscious was inevitably drawn to the promise of sex, which led to the purchase of the liquor brand. No one disputes that Madison Avenue experimented with these techniques, but experts are overwhelmingly skeptical that they were effective.\nToday, our culture is drowning in an updated version of subliminal seduction, except the vehicle is social media rather than glossy magazine pages. Americans are now ostensibly under the influence of sinister forces ranging from right-wing “bots” to Russian “fake news.”\nCertainly we should be on guard against political propaganda, but a healthy dose of skepticism wouldn’t hurt either. Mind control is harder to pull off in practice than in theory; if there is targeted brainwashing, there’s also a lot of white noise. I’ve spent 35 years in the crisis-management business, where mass conversion is supposedly the cornerstone of success. But I see desperation among so-called hidden persuaders, not vast control.\nEvery organization peddling a product or idea hires consultants demanding that the message “go viral.” Almost all such efforts fail. But consultants can’t admit this to well-paying clients, so they throw out concepts like “social-media strategy,” “stakeholder engagement” and “search-engine optimization.” They hope big clients are so afraid of looking obsolete, they don’t put too much effort into figuring out what all this actually means.\nThis is the same spirit surrounding the debate about Russia’s role in the 2016 election. Theories are bobbing in a soup of emotionally charged words that mean totally different things—collusion, hacking, meddling.\nLast month Newsweek published a story alleging that right-wing media unleashed bots that might have accelerated the downfall of Sen. Al Franken over allegations of sexual misconduct. This subject was trending among my Facebook friends, some of whom were not pleased when I pointed out that these stories conflated correlation with causation. Did motivated parties exploit Mr. Franken’s troubles using online mischief? Almost certainly. Did they create the core allegations and cultural conditions that gave rise to the overdetermined #MeToo media vortex? Doubtful. Commotion isn’t necessarily conspiracy. (Newsweek retracted the story two days later.)\nWe know that Russia made a hearty effort to sow discord in the U.S. election by undermining Hillary Clinton’s campaign, but that doesn’t mean the Kremlin’s efforts played the decisive role. There is a big difference between influencing something and controlling it. And just as it’s in the interest of campaign managers to take outsize credit for engineering an election win, it is in the interest of those displeased with the results to lay blame on social bots and algorithms. In this environment, the best proof of dietrological conspiracies is their lack of evidence, especially where cause and effect are concerned. An absence of evidence simply proves that the conspirators were that good.\nWe are asking the right questions about the enormous power of social networks to shape public opinion, whether there are real people behind those accounts or not. But we need to raise our level of skepticism and ask whether it’s possible that in addition to being fooled by bad actors, we are being thrown off the scent by biases we don’t even know we have—and by the very human desire to see messages in ice cubes.\nMr. Dezenhall is CEO of Dezenhall Resources, a crisis-management firm.
