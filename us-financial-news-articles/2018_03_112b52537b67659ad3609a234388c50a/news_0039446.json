Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini said on Tuesday that North Korea denuclearisation was not on the table. Last weekend, North Korean and Swedish foreign ministers ended three days of talks in preparation for a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
