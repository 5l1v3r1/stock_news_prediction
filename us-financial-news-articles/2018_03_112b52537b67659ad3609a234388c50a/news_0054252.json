REUTERS/David McNew/File Photo \nThe academy began an investigation when it received a complaint against Bailey from an unidentified individual on March 13, the organization said in a statement. \nThe membership and administration committee “unanimously determined that no further action was merited on this matter. The findings and recommendations of the committee were reported to the Board which endorsed its recommendation. John Bailey remains President of the Academy,” it said. \nIn a memo sent to academy staff, Bailey said allegations in Hollywood trade publications that he tried to touch a woman inappropriately a decade ago on a movie set were untrue, Variety reported on Saturday. \nReuters could not independently confirm any of the allegations. \nBailey, a cinematographer whose credits range from “Groundhog Day” to “How to Be a Latin Lover,” said in the memo that media reports describing complaints to the academy were false and served only to tarnish his 50-year career, Variety reported.
