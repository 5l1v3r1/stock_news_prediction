(“Strata-X” or the “Company”) (TSX-V:SXE) (ASX:SXA) are pleased to announce that the Company has acquired two new Prospecting Licenses for its Serowe CSG Project covering 406,735 acres. The new licenses offset those already held by the Company in addition to offsetting lands of ASX listed peers. The Serowe CSG Project now spans 680,000 acres in heart of the Botswana CSG fairway, that are 100% owned and operated by the Company.\nWith the goal of developing the CSG resource, the Company has selected a Botswana environmental firm to seek the necessary environment approvals required before the appraisal program can begin. The environmental approvals are expected in the third quarter of 2018. The proposed appraisal programme is designed to prove commercial completion methods and convert resources to reserves. To achieve this, the Company plans to apply the latest completion and production methods to yield commercial gas flow rates. Once that is achieved, the Company can convert resources into reserves.\nRon Prefontaine, Chairman of the Board, stated that, “With the new licenses, Strata-X now has 680,000 acres in its 100% owned Serowe CSG Project, which is located within the Kalahari Basin CSG fairway. The new additions provide our shareholders material upside for our proposed appraisal programmes in Botswana.”\nThe new acreage lies adjacent to a bitumen highway between Serowe, the regional capital, and Orapa, the site of the world’s largest diamond mine and large potential energy market.\nTenement Renewal Terms\nThe new Prospecting Licenses known as PL016-2018 and 017-2018 carry a primary term of 3 years with two, 2-year extensions. To complete the issuance of the PL016-2018 and 017-2018 Prospecting Licenses, Strata-X Australia Pty Ltd, owner of the existing Republic of Botswana subsidiary’s Rhino CBM Pty Ltd and Sharpay Enterprises Pty Ltd, created a new wholly owned Republic of Botswana subsidiary to hold Licenses called Jab Right Pty Ltd.\nAbout Strata-X\nStrata-X is a Denver, Colorado (USA) based company and is engaged in the business of oil and gas exploration and development with a variety of exploration opportunities in the States of California and Illinois in the United States of America and the Republic of Botswana. Strata-X has 89,825,208 common shares outstanding and trades under the symbol \"SXE\" on the TSX-V and \"SXA\" on the ASX.\nFor further information please contact:\nTim Hoops (USA)\nPresident\n+1 855-463-2400\ninfo@strata-x.com\n(1) Prospective Resources figures are from an audit report prepared by MHA Petroleum Consultant, a qualified reserves auditor, dated and effective 26 October 2016 following their audit in accordance with the COGE Handbook of the available technical data including the geological interpretation, information from relevant nearby wells, analogous reservoirs and the proposed program for the Project, prepared and presented to MHA by Strata-X. Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development project. Prospective Resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development. A high level of uncertainty exists with the Prospective resources given the lack of historical drilling, available data and other productivity factors that limit the economic viability of coal seam gas deposits. The Report reviewed only Prospective Resources as the project is not sufficiently developed to assign Contingent Resources or additional Petroleum Reserves to it. Stated Prospective Resource figures are Best Estimate – undiscovered natural gas quantities and net of a 6% royalty and are shown at a 100% working interest in the Project. The total costs associated with establishing the commerciality of this project are unknown at this time given the early stage of the Project’s development. There is no certainty that any portion of the resources will be discovered, if discovered, there is no certainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
