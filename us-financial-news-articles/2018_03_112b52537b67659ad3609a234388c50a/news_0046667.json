(Nasdaq: PIH) (the “Company”), a property and casualty insurance holding company offering specialty insurance to customers in Louisiana, Texas and Florida through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Maison Insurance Company (“Maison”), today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial and Operating Highlights\n(unless noted all financial comparisons are to the prior-year quarter)\nBook value per share of $7.82 at December 31, 2017 versus $7.62 at September 30, 2017. Gross premiums written of $23.9 million, up 101.5% from $11.8 million. Net premiums earned increased 34.2% to $10.2 million from $7.6 million. Pre-tax income of $3.0 million, which was a quarterly record for the Company, versus $2.3 million. Net income was approximately $1.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company incurred a one-time charge of $0.5 million to income tax expense, due to the reduction of the value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets to the new corporate federal income tax rate of 21%.\n2017 Full-Year Financial and Operating Highlights\n(unless noted all financial comparisons are to the prior-year period)\nBook value per share of $7.82 at December 31, 2017 versus $7.78 at December 31, 2016. Gross premiums written were $72.7 million, a 41.6% increase from $51.3 million. Net premiums earned were $35.2 million, a 15.6% increase from $30.4 million. Net income was $294 thousand for the full year 2017 compared with $11 thousand a year ago. On a fully diluted per share basis, 2017 net income was $0.05 compared to zero in the prior year. Direct and assumed policy count at December 31, 2017 increased to 50,671 up approximately 42% from 35,612 at December 31, 2016.\nManagement Comments\nDoug Raucy, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We closed out 2017 with nice momentum on multiple fronts, led by very solid fourth quarter financial results which allowed us to finish out a profitable year with book value of $7.82 at December 31 st , 2017, which was up four cents from a year ago. We are very proud of these results, particularly when we look back on the weather events we faced during the year, punctuated by Hurricane Harvey in August.”\nMr. Raucy continued, “During 2017, our business in Texas led our growth, with Gross Premiums Written in the state up approximately three times to $17.7 million, versus $4.8 million last year. We continue to evaluate and pursue specific target markets consistent with our strategic focus. In addition, we kicked off our entry into the Florida market by participating in the December depopulation from Florida Citizens’ with a focus on wind-only business, which netted us approximately 3,500 new policies. We continued to grow our book of business overall through the year, finishing with approximately 50,700 policies in force at year-end, for a year over year gain of roughly 42%.”\nOperating Review\n(Unaudited) (Audited) ($ and share amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Gross premiums written $ 23,862 $ 11,843 101.5% $ 72,679 $ 51,327 41.6% Ceded premiums written $ 6,157 $ 5,127 20.1% $ 22,583 $ 20,541 9.9% Gross premiums earned $ 16,508 $ 13,125 25.8% $ 58,977 $ 48,947 20.5% Ceded premiums earned $ 6,338 $ 5,546 14.3% $ 23,775 $ 18,499 28.5% Net premiums earned $ 10,170 $ 7,579 34.2% $ 35,202 $ 30,448 15.6% Total revenues $ 11,154 $ 8,132 37.2% $ 38,148 $ 32,256 18.3% Gross losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 6,355 $ 3,461 83.6% $ 46,589 $ 31,786 46.6% Ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 4,264 $ 2,006 112.6% $ 30,689 $ 15,414 99.1% Net losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 2,091 $ 1,455 43.7% $ 15,900 $ 16,372 (2.9)% Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs $ 3,213 $ 2,344 37.1% $ 11,080 $ 8,492 30.5% General and administrative expenses $ 2,769 $ 1,936 43.0% $ 9,304 $ 6,918 34.5% Loss and amortization charges related to MSA termination $ 96 $ 92 4.3% $ 372 $ 355 4.8% Income before tax expense $ 2,985 $ 2,305 29.5% $ 1,492 $ 119 1,153.8% Net income $ 1,390 $ 1,592 (12.7)% $ 294 $ 11 2,572.7% Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 6,005 5,962 0.7% 5,970 6,048 (1.3)% Ratios to Gross Premiums Earned: (1) Ceded ratio 12.6% 27.0% (14.4) pts (11.7)% 6.3% (18.0) pts Gross loss ratio 38.5% 26.4% 12.1 pts 79.0% 64.9% 14.1 pts DPAC ratio 19.5% 17.9% 1.6 pts 18.8% 17.3% 1.5 pts G&A ratio 16.8% 14.8% 2.0 pts 15.8% 14.1% 1.7 pts Combined gross ratio 87.4% 86.1% 1.3 pts 101.9% 102.6% (0.7) pts Ratios to Net Premiums Earned: (1) Net loss ratio 20.6% 19.2% 1.4 pts 45.2% 53.8% (8.6) pts Net expense ratio 59.8% 57.7% 2.1 pts 59.0% 51.8% 7.2 pts Net combined ratio 80.4% 76.9% 3.5 pts 104.2% 105.6% (1.4) pts (1) See “Definitions of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures” Section\nQuarterly Financial Review\nPremiums\nGross premiums written grew 101.5% to $23.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, versus $11.8 million in the prior year quarter. The Company saw growth in many of its markets, including voluntary production growth in Texas, while participation in the Florida and Louisiana Citizens’ depopulation programs in December resulted in over 7,400 new policies for the Company. Gross premiums earned increased 25.8% to $16.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared with $13.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 66% of the Company’s 50,700 direct and assumed policies were from voluntary policies obtained from the Company’s independent agent network. An additional 32% of the policy total consisted of take-out policies from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Company (“CPIC”), Florida Citizens’ and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”). The remaining 2% of the Company’s policies were comprised of assumed wind/hail only business in Texas through an agreement with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company.\nThe Company has continued to evaluate its existing book of business with an emphasis on risk-adjusted returns and rate adequacy. Accordingly, we have terminated our quota-share agreement with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company effective January 1, 2018.\nNet premiums earned increased 34.2% to $10.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared with $7.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nLosses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe gross loss ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 38.5% compared to 26.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The net loss ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 20.6% compared to 19.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Gross loss ratio for the fourth quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by catastrophe losses as we experienced development of approximately $4 million on Hurricane Harvey on a gross basis ($0 development on a net basis) during the fourth quarter 2017. Our gross core loss ratio, which consists of losses from non-weather related claims as well as weather related claims that are not classified as catastrophe losses, decreased to 14.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, from 21.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.2 million, a $0.9 million increase over $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of gross premiums earned, this expense rose 160 basis points to 19.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 17.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily due to an increase in the effective premium tax rate that we incurred in Louisiana due to a change in the applicable Louisiana statute, whereby the Company no longer qualifies for certain credits on its premium taxes which were related to the amount of cash deposited in Louisiana domiciled banks. We anticipate that deferred policy acquisition costs will temporarily decline on a percentage basis in 2018 as a result of our depopulation of policies from Florida Citizens, which does not charge companies a ceding commission on policies depopulated under its take-out program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.8 million versus $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross premiums earned increased to 16.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 14.8% for the prior year period. The increase in General and Administrative expense on both an absolute dollar and percentage basis was the result of an increase in the number of employees, outside professional service expenditures and underwriting reports, which expenses were all incurred in conjunction with our premium growth, including the expansion into the State of Florida.\nNet Income\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $1.4 million, compared to net income of $1.6 million in the prior year period. The Company reported net income of $0.23 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2017, based on approximately 6.0 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to a net income of $0.27 per diluted share during the prior year period, based on approximately 6.0 million weighted average shares outstanding. Fourth quarter 2017 net income was negatively impacted by a tax charge of $0.5 million related to the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets resulting from the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Pre-tax income was $3.0 million in Q4 2017, versus $2.3 million in the prior year quarter.\nBalance Sheet / Investment Portfolio Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company held cash, cash equivalents and investments with a carrying value of approximately $78.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s investment in fixed maturities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers, including short-term investments, comprised 93% of the investment portfolio.\nYearly Financial Review\nPremiums\nGross premiums written increased 41.6% to $72.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year over year increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of policies written, with the Company experiencing policy growth in all three states. Growth was particularly robust in Texas, with gross premiums written surging to $17.7 million in 2017 versus $4.8 million in 2016. Gross premiums earned increased 20.5% to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $48.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net premiums earned increased 15.6% to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLosses and Adjustment Expenses\nThe gross loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 79.0%, up 14.1 points from the prior year period ratio of 64.9%. The net loss ratio declined 8.6 points to 45.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 53.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the net loss ratio was due primarily to a lower net CAT loss ratio when compared with 2016 as the Company experienced two CAT events in 2017 compared with three in 2016. During 2017, CAT losses accounted for a net loss ratio of 19.0%, versus 32.2% in the prior year. We also experienced prior period redundancy of $(2.2) million, or (6.2%), in 2017, compared with $(0.4) million, or (1.2%) in 2016. The Company’s core losses generated a net loss ratio of 32.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the net core loss ratio was primarily driven by claim severity.\nThe following table reflects the four major components to our net loss ratio for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, that we use to analyze the Company’s loss experience.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 2016 Losses ($) Loss Ratio (%) Losses ($) Loss Ratio (%) Weather-Related Non-Catastrophe Losses $ 3,551 10.1% $ 1,133 3.7% Non-Weather Related Losses 7,858 22.3% 5,815 19.1% Subtotal Core Losses (1) 11,409 32.4% 6,948 22.8% Catastrophe Losses (2) 6,700 19.0% 9,805 32.2% Prior Period Development (Redundancy) (3) (2,209) (6.2)% (381) (1.2)% Total $ 15,900 45.2% $ 16,372 53.8% (1) We define Core Loss as net losses and LAE less the sum of Catastrophe Losses and prior period development (redundancy). (2) Property Claims Services (PCS) defines a catastrophic event as an event where the insurance industry is estimated to incur over $25,000 of insured property damage that also impacts a significant number of insureds. For purposes of the above table, we have defined a Catastrophe as a PCS event where our estimated cost exceeds $1,500. (3) Prior Period Development is the amount of ultimate actual loss settlement value which is more than the estimated reserves recorded for a particular liability or loss, while redundancy represents the ultimate actual loss settlement value which is less than the estimated and determined reserves recorded for a particular liability or loss. Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.1 million, a $2.6 million increase from $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Expressed as a percentage of gross premiums earned, amortization costs rose 150 basis points to 18.8% from 17.3% due primarily to an increase in the effective premium tax rate that we incurred in Louisiana due to a change in the applicable Louisiana statute, whereby the Company no longer qualifies for certain credits on its premium taxes which were related to the amount of cash deposited in Louisiana domiciled banks. We anticipate that deferred policy acquisition costs will temporarily decline on a percentage basis in 2018 as a result of our depopulation of policies from Florida Citizens, which does not charge companies a ceding commission on policies depopulated under its take-out program.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $9.3 million versus $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Employee costs and professional fees drove the preponderance of the increase as the Company invested in staff needed to support growth in Texas and Florida, while also utilizing external professionals to review its rates in Louisiana and Texas as well as to assist the Company in developing its products for the Florida market.\nNet Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $294 thousand, or $0.05 per share, compared to net income of $11 thousand, or zero cents per share, reported in the prior year.\nSubsequent Activity\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 640,000 shares of 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the “Preferred Stock”), and on March 26, 2018, the Company issued an additional 60,000 shares of Preferred Stock in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option. Boenning & Scattergood, Inc. acted as sole book-running manager of the offering, and American Capital Partners, LLC and Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC acted as co-managers. Net proceeds received by the Company were approximately $16.4 million. The Company used $1.5 million of the net proceeds to repurchase 60,000 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock from IWS Acquisition Corporation, an affiliate of Kingsway Financial Services, Inc., and expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds to support organic growth, including spending for business development, sales and marketing and working capital, and for future potential acquisition opportunities.\nConference Call Details\nDate: Tuesday, March 27, 2018 Time: 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time Participant Dial-In Numbers: Domestic callers: (877) 407-0619 International callers: (412) 902-1012 Access by Webcast\nThe call will also be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the “Investor Relations” section of PIH’s website at www.1347pih.com or by clicking on the conference call link: http://1347pih.equisolvewebcast.com/q4-2017 . An audio recording of the call will be archived on the Company’s website.\nDEFINITION OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company assesses its results of operations using certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are defined below. The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating performance in the same manner as management does.\nThe non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how the Company defines its non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nThe Company analyzes performance based on ratios common in the insurance industry such as loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The Company’s ratios are calculated as shown in the following table.\nRatio Numerator Divisor Ceded ratio Ceded premium earned minus ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses Gross premium earned Gross loss ratio Gross losses and loss adjustment expenses Gross premium earned DPAC ratio Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs Gross premium earned G&A ratio General and administrative expenses Gross premium earned Net loss ratio Net losses and loss adjustment expenses Net premium earned Net expense ratio Deferred policy acquisition costs plus general and administrative expenses plus loss and amortization charges related to MSA termination Net premium earned The gross combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the ceded ratio, gross loss ratio, DPAC ratio, and G&A ratio. The net combined ratio is calculated as the sum of the net loss ratio and the net expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nAbout 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.\n1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. is a specialized property and casualty insurance holding company incorporated in Delaware. The Company provides property and casualty insurance in Louisiana and Texas through its wholly-owned subsidiary Maison Insurance Company (“Maison”). Maison was recently licensed in the State of Florida and began covering risks in the state via the assumption of policies from Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation on December 19, 2017.
