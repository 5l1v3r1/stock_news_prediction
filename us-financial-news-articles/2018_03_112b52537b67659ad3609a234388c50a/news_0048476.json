She will assume responsibility for HR affairs as the new fourth member of the global testing service provider's Executive Board and take on the position of Labor Relations Director in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act.

Braun, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of TÜV Rheinland AG, commented, “We are delighted to have gained an experienced HR manager in Ruth Werhahn. She is hugely familiar with the energy industry, an industry in which companies and their employees are facing significant change and major challenges.” Having been in charge of business development of the Scandinavian markets and served as Head of Electric Mobility at E.ON, she was also involved in shaping key future-oriented topics for several years.\nDr. Michael Fübi, CEO of TÜV Rheinland AG, said, “The knowledge and expertise of our employees is our greatest resource. Several important tasks lie ahead, particularly in HR, and the addition of Ruth Werhahn to the Executive Board allows us to tackle them even more effectively.
