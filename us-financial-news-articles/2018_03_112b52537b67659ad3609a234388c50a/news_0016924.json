REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “I read in some papers that France is being the toughest in the current negotiations. This is not correct,” Le Maire said in speech at the Chatham House think tank.\n“We are not in favour of a hard Brexit nor of a soft Brexit. We are in favour of a fair Brexit, a Brexit which would be in the interest of both the UK and Europe,” he added.\nFrench officials have repeatedly said that Paris’ main objective in Brexit negotiations was to maintain the unity of the 27 remaining countries and that the only point of contact for British diplomats should be the Commission’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.\nReporting by Helen Reid and Fanny; writing by Leigh Thomas; editing by Michel Rose\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:53:19.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
