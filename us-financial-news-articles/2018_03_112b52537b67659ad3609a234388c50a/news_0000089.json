President Donald Trump announced he would impose hefty tariffs on the two metals to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighbouring Canada.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 1 cent at $60.98 by 0432 GMT after touching a two-week low of $60.18 a day earlier.\nGlobal benchmark Brent was up 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $63.90 a barrel, after settled down 1.4 percent on Thursday, also a two-week low. Brent is set for a weekly fall of 5.1 percent.\nU.S. crude is on track for a 4 percent drop this week, its first weekly decline in three, having given up much of the gains in recent weeks when sentiment was boosted by a fall in inventories at the Cushing delivery point for WTI.\n\"The market is not showing any obvious signs of turning around the mood.
