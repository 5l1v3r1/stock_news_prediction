That was when Davis made the biggest play of the game.\nSneaking inside the San Antonio defense for the offensive rebound after the second miss, Davis was fouled, and he made both free throws to push New Orleans’ lead to three points.\nPatty Mills and Rudy Gay missed 3-pointers on San Antonio’s last-gasp possession, and Davis finished off the Spurs with two more free throws with 3.4 seconds to play.\nMoore scored 17 points for New Orleans while Rajon Rondo and Nikola Mirotic hit for 13 apiece. Darius Miller added 11 points and Ian Clark had 10 for the Pelicans, who won for the seventh straight game, their longest winning streak since 2011. Rondo had 12 assists.\nGay led the Spurs with 19 points, while Murray added 18, Manu Ginobili scored 17 points, Joffrey Lauvergne tallied 14, and Mills and Tony Parker contributed 11 and 10 points, respectively, for San Antonio.\nSan Antonio led by as many as 13 points in the first half before settling for a 60-51 advantage at halftime. Ginobili led the Spurs with 13 points off the bench while Murray poured in 11 in the first half.\nHoliday paced New Orleans with 13 points with Davis hitting for 10 and clawing his way to eight rebounds.\nNext up for San Antonio is a home game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday while the Pelicans head to Dallas for a road contest against the Mavericks on Sunday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T12:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:19:51.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
