Dorsey’s unique perspective underscores Next Coast’s relentless focus on bringing the best resources to help the entrepreneurs that they serve. Dorsey’s addition to the Venture Partner program will provide extremely valuable insight into the generational behavior that impacts Next Coast’s investing and the companies in its portfolio.\n“Jason and his firm’s research have a comprehensive, birds-eye view on big trends in the marketplace and how the world is changing,” said Michael Smerklo, co-founder and managing director of Next Coast Ventures. “Jason’s expertise on the Millennial and Gen Z generations - what we call ‘digital natives’ - will give our firm and our portfolio companies the most cutting-edge tools to understand and quantify the ever-changing nature of consumer behavior - and how to leverage those insights.”\nDorsey is the president and co-founder of The Center for Generational Kinetics where he leads Millennial and Gen Z research, speaking, and strategy to uncover the hidden, generational drivers that solve tough business challenges. He’s helped reposition global brands to win Millennial customers, advised on billion-dollar acquisitions, and taken clients from last to first in employee retention. Last year, the Center worked with 180 clients on four continents in industries ranging from automotive, healthcare, and retail to advertising and technology. Dorsey wrote his first bestselling book at age 18 and currently serves on the board of directors at Ultimate Software (NASDAQ: ULTI) and continues to advise numerous CEOs and corporate boards.\n“This is a unique opportunity to work with both great entrepreneurs and Next Coast’s leadership. I believe my experience working with brands in almost every sector, coupled with my firm’s extensive research on generational behavior, will be a great asset to Next Coast Ventures,” said Dorsey. “I am eager to work with their portfolio companies on branding, sales and go-to-market strategies - and I’m also excited to work with the entire NCV team on refining their investment focus and helping evaluate big trends that impact their investment decisions.”\nSince day one, Next Coast Ventures has been ‘built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs,’ and remains hyper-focused on leveraging their network of industry experts to help its portfolio. By soliciting feedback from their portfolio’s leadership, Next Coast has brought on Venture Partners to help with everything from talent and team building to understanding product development and technology trends. However, Dorsey’s unique vantage point will offer a more lateral perspective than other Venture Partners, as he can provide a rare inside look at the major trends that impact Next Coast’s investing and the companies in its portfolio.\nAbout Next Coast Ventures\nNext Coast Ventures is an Austin-based venture capital firm founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs.
