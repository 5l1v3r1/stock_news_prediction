However, it will only become final once a deal is struck on the whole package.\nWholesale broadband providers will be exempt from most of the obligations that regulators usually impose on dominant telecoms providers. Regulators will only be able to impose obligations on “fair and reasonable pricing” if justified by a “market analysis”, according to the text of the deal seen by Reuters.\nTelecoms companies such as Telecom Italia, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica have argued that current rules requiring them to open up their networks to competitors at regulated prices do not allow them to get a return on investment.\nThe Commission proposed easing the rules where firms agree to co-invest in new networks together, but the European Parliament and member states are still trying to find a compromise.\nEU lawmakers want to ensure that a co-investment agreement has actually been concluded before easing regulation.\nReporting by Julia Fioretti; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:22:50.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
