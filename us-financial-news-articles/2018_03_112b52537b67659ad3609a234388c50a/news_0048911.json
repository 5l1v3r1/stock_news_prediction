Stocks have been volatile lately, with Monday trading showing a sharp rebound from a Friday plunge. show chapters 7:50 PM ET Fri, 5 Jan 2018 | 04:14 \nThat, however, comes amid what Mester described as a strong global backdrop. \n\"For the first time in many years, economic activity around the world is picking up and forecasts for global growth are being revised up,\" she said. \"This should have a positive feedback effect on the U.S. economy via exports.\" \nIn addition, aggressive fiscal policy in the form of tax cuts and increased spending likely will head 0.5 percentage points annually to growth over the next several years, she said. \nThe Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy for the central bank, last week approved a quarter-point interest rate hike , citing good prospects for growth. Mester said she agreed with the decision, though she did not commit to a path ahead. \n\"It seems appropriate to remove some of the monetary policy accommodation to ensure we avoid a build-up in risks to macroeconomic stability that could arise if the economy were allowed to overheat,\" she said. \nThe Fed's target rate is now between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent. The FOMC is expected to approve at least two more rate hikes in 2018.
