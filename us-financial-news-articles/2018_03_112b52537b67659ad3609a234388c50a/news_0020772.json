Highlights from the report include:\nThe Partnership reported net income of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, which compares to net income of $3.8 million for the third quarter 2017;\nThe Partnership reported Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $21.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, up approximately 21 percent when compared to the third quarter 2017;\nIn February 2018, the Partnership declared and paid a fourth quarter 2017 cash distribution on common units of $0.4508 per unit ($1.8032 per unit annualized);\nThe Partnership’s fourth quarter 2017 cash available for distribution (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $9.9 million, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.5 times; and\nAfter completing an extensive capital program, which resulted in the commercial in-service of the Raptor Gas Processing Facility and SECO Pipeline in 2017, the Partnership intends to use excess cash flow to reduce debt, further improve its balance sheet, and internally finance growth.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n“After years of planning, focused investment, and the strategic divestiture of non-core producing assets, we successfully completed the transformation of SNMP to a midstream master limited partnership in 2017,” said Gerry Willinger, Chief Executive Officer of the general partner of SNMP. “As part of this transformation, we completed an extensive capital program, improved our existing asset base, completed and expanded the Raptor Gas Processing Facility, developed the SECO Pipeline, and positioned the Partnership to achieve free cash flow heading into 2018.\n“The Raptor Gas Processing Facility, a joint venture that is 50 percent owned and operated by Targa Resources Corp. (“Targa”), began commercial operations in June 2017 with 200 million cubic feet equivalent per day (“MMcfe/d”) of processing capacity, and was expanded in the third quarter 2017 to capacity of 260 MMcfe/d. We developed our wholly owned SECO Pipeline on a parallel path with the completion of the Raptor Gas Processing Facility. The SECO Pipeline was brought on-line in August 2017, and connects to the Raptor Gas Processing Facility, providing 400 MMcfe/d of capacity to transport dry gas to multiple markets in South Texas. These assets, together with Western Catarina Midstream and the Carnero Gathering Pipeline, a joint venture with Targa that feeds the Raptor Gas Processing Facility, form the basis of our midstream strategy in South Texas and provide stable, fee-based cash flow to support our continued growth.\n“As we look to expand our strategic position in South Texas, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the Partnership’s exposure to production activities which, by their nature, are sensitive to commodity prices and are less suited for our business model going forward. To that end, we closed the sale of our remaining operated Oklahoma production assets in July 2017 for approximately $5.5 million. More recently, in November 2017, we closed the sale of certain non-operated production assets in Texas for approximately $6.3 million. We intend to pursue additional strategic divestitures of producing assets, with an eye toward continuing to expand the contribution of our fee-based, midstream activities.\n“With the completion of the Raptor Gas Processing Facility and SECO Pipeline, our fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled when compared to Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2017. As a result, our cash available for distribution in the fourth quarter 2017 was approximately $9.9 million, which covered our distribution on common units by 1.5 times.\n“Importantly, although our total capital spending in 2018 is expected to be considerably lower when compared to 2017, we continue to see opportunities for cash flow growth this year. Our South Texas midstream assets are strategically positioned to capture upside from the development activity of Sanchez Energy Corporation (NYSE:SN) at Comanche and Catarina, and we anticipate increasing volumes through our facilities in 2018 and the years to come.\n“Having posted eight consecutive quarters of distribution growth, we elected this quarter to hold our distribution flat at $0.4508 per common unit. This decision, which we did not take lightly, comes as the capital markets increasingly favor coverage and balance sheet strength over growth. As a result, it is apparent that the capital markets are not rewarding the Partnership for its current distribution stream, let alone increases in our quarterly distribution. As evidenced by our distribution coverage ratio, we believe we have sufficient cash flow to consider distribution increases in the future. However, until such time that the capital markets become less restrictive, we believe it is more prudent to use excess cash flow to reduce debt, further improve the Partnership’s balance sheet, and internally finance growth.”\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Partnership’s revenue totaled $18.7 million during the fourth quarter 2017. Included in total revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 is $16.2 million from the midstream activities of Western Catarina Midstream and the SECO Pipeline and $6.1 million from production activities. The balance of the Partnership’s fourth quarter 2017 total revenue came from hedge settlements ($0.4 million) and a loss on mark-to-market activities ($4.0 million), which is a non-cash item.\nThe Partnership’s revenue for the full year 2017 totaled $88.1 million. Included in total revenue for the full year is $55.8 million from the midstream activities of Western Catarina Midstream and the SECO Pipeline and $28.4 million from production activities. The balance of the Partnership’s total revenue for the full year came from hedge settlements ($9.1 million net, which includes a $3.6 million gain related to the August 2017 hedge repositioning) and a loss on mark-to-market activities ($5.2 million), which is a non-cash item.\nEarnings from the Partnership’s midstream joint ventures with Targa totaled $3.5 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $7.9 million for the full year 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, the Partnership recorded net income of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, which compares to net income of $3.8 million for the third quarter 2017 and a net loss of $12.9 million in the fourth quarter 2016. The Partnership reported a net loss of $3.0 million for the full year 2017, which compares to net income of $19.2 million for the full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the fourth quarter 2017 was approximately $21.4 million, which is up approximately 21 percent when compared to the third quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $17.8 million. For the full year 2017, the Partnership reported Adjusted EBITDA of $65.0 million which is 17 percent higher when compared to full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $55.4 million. The Partnership’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is discussed in further detail below.\nLIQUIDITY UPDATE\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, the Partnership had $189 million in debt outstanding under its credit facility, which has a current borrowing base of $249.3 million and an elected commitment amount of $200 million. The midstream portion of the borrowing base is approximately $211 million, which results in the Partnership’s midstream collateral more than covering the $200 million elected commitment amount.\nThe Partnership had approximately $0.3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of Dec. 31, 2017.\nHEDGE UPDATE\nFor the full year 2018, the Partnership has hedged approximately 0.5 billion cubic feet of its natural gas production at an effective NYMEX fixed price of approximately $3.00 per million British thermal units and approximately 260 thousand barrels of its crude oil production at an effective NYMEX fixed price of approximately $59.74 per barrel. The Partnership has additional hedges covering a portion of its production in 2019 through 2020. More information on the Partnership’s hedge positions can be found in the SNMP Investor Presentation posted at www.sanchezmidstream.com .\nCOMMON UNITS\nThe Partnership had 14,965,134 common units issued and outstanding as of March 6, 2018.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nOn Feb. 8, 2018, the Partnership declared a fourth quarter 2017 cash distribution on its common units of $0.4508 per unit ($1.8032 per unit annualized). The Partnership also declared a fourth quarter 2017 distribution to the holders of its Class B preferred units equal to $0.28225 per Class B preferred unit.\nBased on fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $21.4 million, cash interest expense of $2.9 million, maintenance capital of $0.6 million, and $8.8 million in preferred distributions, the Partnership generated approximately $9.9 million in cash available for distribution (a non-GAAP financial measure) during the fourth quarter 2017, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.5 times.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe Partnership will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Friday, March 9, 2018 to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results.\nTo participate in the conference call, analysts, investors, media and the public in the U.S. may dial (844) 824-3837 shortly before 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

The Partnership has ownership stakes in oil and natural gas gathering systems, natural gas pipelines, and a natural gas processing facility, all located in the Western Eagle Ford in South Texas.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAdditional information about SNMP can be found in the Partnership’s documents on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( www.sec.gov ) and in the “Investor Presentation” available on the Partnership’s website ( www.sanchezmidstream.com ).\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution, non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to our reported net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, in this news release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss) adjusted by: (i) interest (income) expense, net, which includes interest expense, interest expense net (gain) loss on interest rate derivative contracts, and interest (income); (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization; (iv) asset impairments; (v) accretion expense; (vi) (gain) loss on sale of assets; (vii) unit-based compensation programs; (viii) unit-based asset management fees; (ix) distributions in excess of equity earnings; (x) (gain) loss on mark-to-market activities; (xi) commodity derivatives settled early; (xii) (gain) loss on embedded derivatives; and (xiii) acquisition and divestiture costs. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the tables at the end of this release. Cash available for distribution is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense; distributions on preferred units; and maintenance capital. For a reconciliation of cash available for distribution to Net Income (Loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the tables at the end of this release.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are significant performance metrics used by our management to indicate (prior to the establishment of any cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner) the distributions that we would expect to pay to our unitholders. Specifically, these financial measures indicate to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support a quarterly distribution or any increase in our quarterly distribution rates. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are also used as quantitative standards by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts, our lenders and others to assess: (i) the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; (ii) the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness; and (iii) our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing or capital structure.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution is net income (loss). Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial metric, please see the tables below.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains, and the officers and representatives of the Partnership and its general partner may from time to time make, statements that are considered forward–looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted by: (i) interest (income) expense, net, which includes interest expense, interest expense net, (gain) loss on interest rate derivative contracts, and interest (income); (ii) income tax expense (benefit); (iii) depreciation, depletion and amortization; (iv) asset impairments; (v) accretion expense; (vi) (gain) loss on sale of assets; (vii) unit-based compensation programs; (viii) unit-based asset management fees; (ix) distributions in excess of equity earnings; (x) (gain) loss on mark-to-market activities; (xi) commodity derivatives settled early; (xii) (gain) loss on embedded derivatives; and (xiii) acquisition and divestiture costs. (2) Represents estimated maintenance capital expenditures attributable to our controlling interest in our midstream and production assets. Maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain, over the long-term, our operating capacity, operating income or asset base. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures to develop and replace our oil and natural gas reserves as well as the repair, refurbishment and replacement of gathering and transportation assets, to maintain equipment reliability, integrity and safety and to address environmental laws and regulations.
