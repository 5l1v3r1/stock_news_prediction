Weak wage growth has added to the strain on many households while the overall economy has slowed.\n“Housing market activity is expected to remain lacklustre as the extended squeeze on consumer purchasing power only gradually eases, confidence is fragile and appreciable caution persists over engaging in major transactions,” Howard Archer, economist at the EY ITEM Club, said.\n“Potential house buyers also look highly likely to face further interest rate hikes over the coming months.”\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates again in May to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent.\nNationwide said it expected house prices would be broadly flat over 2018, with a marginal gain of around 1 percent over the year as a whole.\nEarlier this month, rival mortgage lender Halifax said house prices increased at their slowest annual pace in almost five years during February.\nThe Bank of England is due to publish mortgage approval and bank lending data for February at 0830 GMT.
