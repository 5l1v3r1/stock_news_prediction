A planned sale of Audi's Italian motorcycle brand Ducati collapsed last year amid opposition from labor leaders.\n\"There are no decisions (on a trucks IPO),\" Mueller said. \"If there are decisions one day, then we will inform about those in a very qualified way.\"\nSeparately, Mueller said he was \"very satisfied\" with the level of support for structural changes from the carmaker's supervisory board, without elaborating.
