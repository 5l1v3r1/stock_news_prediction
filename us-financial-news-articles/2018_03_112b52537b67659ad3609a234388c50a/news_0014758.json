Based on the action we saw today it’s hoping it doesn’t turn into a trade war,” said Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders Investment Management in New York, adding that “North Korea helps around the margin.”\nAt 2:50 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 53.66 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,928.42, the S&P 500 gained 9.28 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,730.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.51 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,372.21.\nMost of the S&P&rsquo;s 11 sectors rose with the materials index leading the gainers with a 1.3 percent gain. Utilities was the weakest sector with a 1 percent drop.\nAmong bigger movers, shares in Target were down 4.7 percent after the big-box retailer reported lower-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter.\nQualcomm dropped 4.5 percent after a U.S. government national security panel said it identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom Ltd’s $117-billion bid for the chipmaker.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.93-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 16 new lows.
