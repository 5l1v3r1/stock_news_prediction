They earn about 15 percent less per hour relative to their male counterparts, a survey by the European Commission showed.\nWomen staged strikes in dozens of cities across Spain last year, but this will be the first nationwide walkout.\nThe strike is expected to draw teachers, journalists, healthworkers and politicians, including Madrid’s Mayor Manuela Carmena and her Barcelona counterpart Ada Colau.\nSimilar strikes are planned in other countries - including Britain, Poland and Ireland - as the movement for women’s rights continues to gain momentum around the world.\nOne in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual violence, mostly by someone they know, according to the United Nations organization UN Women.\nReporting by Ana Ionova, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
