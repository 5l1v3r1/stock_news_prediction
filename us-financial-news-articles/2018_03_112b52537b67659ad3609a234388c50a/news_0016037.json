While major reductions in work force are difficult, we are confident that Rent-A-Center will be better positioned for long-term growth and profitability,\" Fadel said in a prepared statement. \"Additionally, we remain focused on delivering a more targeted value proposition and look forward to building on our momentum from our January and February performance.\"\nIn conjunction with the workforce announcement, Rent-A-Center reiterated that its board is continuing to look at \"strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including evaluating a sale of the company.\"\nRent-A-Center has received bids to acquire the company and is engaged with potential buyers.
