The words “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include risks related to the satisfaction of closing conditions and other factors that are set forth in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, under the caption “Risk Factors.” The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made and, other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nInvestor Contact\nJeff Bray\nVice President, Investor Relations\n857-990-4235\ninvestors@rapid7.com\nPress Contact\nCaitlin Doherty\nCommunications Program Lead\n857-990-4240\npress@rapid7.com\nSource:Rapid7", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-iLjSUfNgp8_KX__xS_0iUEyToQ9SK509A-jKV_l-Ud2tW18FEk1C4YO7Nhe0uCUafT39vdHcAI7nyo9Cg5-X-XyGqkv6cSfU0VelG0nMvg=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/06ff63c6-b10c-4136-b7b8-ee70f03d0bfd", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dtxtroG34K05e0AiKVLq8xJv7QT_MVJzBSTf-7sB5uJKeJydzPG6AhA_FUWC-zdPUYwOiyVY5aHSQ5hf27UvIvth5IURfh-1kRbd2jejhli7xMa6uvlcBU58CX-9e5hT", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3GrnfvyJn9NAidf64qyOBJvZHagx4k-oAcLL7Lyz73KRV5bd-c5cxnPOyS7AVx-X8LtQcBlwUCT5CQqfCSWQXA=="], "published": "2018-03-14T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T08:20:50.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
