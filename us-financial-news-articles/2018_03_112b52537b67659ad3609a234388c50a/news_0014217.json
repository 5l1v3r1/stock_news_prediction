Achieved the 1,000th Algovita ® SCS System implantation in U.S. in December 2017. Completed follow-on public offering of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $26.0 million in February 2018. Completed second amendment to the Company’s existing loan and security agreement and drew down second tranche for $12.5 million in February 2018.\nScott Drees, CEO, said, “In 2017, our first full commercial year, we demonstrated our ability to compete in the SCS market, delivering over $10 million in Q4 Algovita revenue. As we move into 2018, we expect to continue growing our SCS market share by demonstrating the clinical benefits of our Algovita system through clinical studies, obtaining MRI approvals, and building physician awareness of the benefits of the Algovita system. We also anticipate CE mark approval in the second quarter of 2018 of the Virtis sacral neuromodulation system (SNM), and are on track for FDA approval, with the expectation of a commercial launch in the United States in the second half of 2018.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.0 million, a 188% increase from $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue for the full year 2017 was $31.8 million, a 154% increase from $12.5 million for the full year 2016. Total Algovita revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.4 million, a 416% increase from $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total Algovita revenue for the full year 2017 was $25.6 million, a 514% increase from $4.2 million for the full year 2016.
