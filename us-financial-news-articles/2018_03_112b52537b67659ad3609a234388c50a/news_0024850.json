Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports Playing for a third consecutive day due to weather delays in Indian Wells, the 36-year-old Swiss showed no sign of wear en route to a 6-2 6-1 thrashing of the Serbian in the pair’s first ever meeting. Federer, who had looked slightly off his game in his rain-disrupted third round match against Federico Delbonis, was his dominant self on Monday, winning 89 percent of his first service points while cracking six aces to just one double fault. Krajinovic had no answer for Federer’s serve or relentless return game and ended up winning just 31 of the match’s 93 points. With rivals Rafa Nadal, Stan Wawrinka and Andy Murray electing not to enter the tournament, and Novak Djokovic and Kei Nishikori both out of the running, the path appears clear for the Swiss to win a record sixth Indian Wells title. Despite the promising outlook, Federer insisted he was taking it one match at a time. “You can’t really look ahead to semi-finals, finals and speculate about who you could play,” he told reporters.

I have to stay sharp.” Next up for Federer is a meeting on Wednesday with France’s Jeremy Chardy, who upset his countryman Adrian Mannarino earlier on Monday.
