On average, a family physician is paid $211,717 ($275,000 Canadian) for clinical services and a surgical specialist is paid $354,915 ($461,000 Canadian), according to the same report.\nThis is total gross pay, however, and does not take into account overhead each doctor pays to operate, as the Canadian Institute for Health Information is careful to point out to CNBC Make It .\nIn May 2016, one physician publicly broke down the cost of running his family practice, and though he brought in $231,033 ($300,000 Canadian), he was left with $136,906 ($177,876 Canadian) after subtracting his business expenses — but before taxes and employment benefits are taken out.\nThe cost of medical school in Canada is subsidized by provincial governments, according to The Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada . The cost varies depending on whether a student is a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or foreign student and the particular school. For Canadian citizens or permanent residents, tuition for the first year of medical school ranges from $2567 ($3,334 Canadian) to $20,064 ($26,056 Canadian), according to The Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada's website .\nThe same group, the Médecins Québécois pour le Régime Public (MQRP) , that published the aforementioned public letter, also published a letter on February 17 opposing $500 million worth of pay increases for specialist doctors. The group called the pay increase \"indecent.\"\nAnd on February 1, the MQRP published a letter denouncing working conditions of nurses. \"The nurses are exhausted by a heavy workload. They argue that the chronic lack of staff and the fatigue caused by repeated overtime, sometimes mandatory, for lack of replacement of the team, have an impact on the safety of patient care,\" the letter says.\nSee also:\nHow one company keeps its millennial employees from quitting\nRemote Canadian general store offering jobs and free land got over 100,000 applications\nA business in Canada is offering a job and 2 free acres of land if you relocate\nshow chapters This mother of two got the job 100,000 people emailed about 11:28 AM ET Fri, 9 Dec 2016 | 01:01 Like this story?
