It is close to the oil export ports of Brega and Zueitina.\nNo further details or claim of responsibility were immediately available. Some six cars were damaged by the blast, a witness said.\nThe town is controlled, as is much of eastern Libya, by forces of Khalifa Haftar allied to a parallel government based in the east.\nReporting by Ayman al-Warfalli; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:42:40.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
