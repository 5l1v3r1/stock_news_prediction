German tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom arrives for a court hearing in Auckland, New Zealand, September 24, 2015. A New Zealand court hearing will determine whether Dotcom will face charges of copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering in the United States related to the Megaupload file-sharing site he founded in 2005. REUTERS/Nigel Marple The Human Rights Review Tribunal’s decision might be relevant for his high-profile U.S. extradition case, which is with the Court of Appeal. Dotcom says the information he requested in July 2015 and denied one month later could be presented as evidence in that case. German-born Dotcom faces extradition to the United States relating to his Megaupload site, which was shut down in 2012 following an FBI-ordered raid on his Auckland mansion. German tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom (C) arrives surrounded by supporters and security for a court hearing in Auckland, New Zealand, September 24, 2015. A New Zealand court hearing will determine whether Dotcom will face charges of copyright infringement, racketeering and money laundering in the United States related to the Megaupload file-sharing site he founded in 2005. REUTERS/Nigel Marple U.S. authorities say Dotcom and three co-accused Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million (352.96 million pounds) and generated more than $175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material. Dotcom, who has New Zealand residency, is fighting those charges and the extradition. The Human Rights Review Tribunal awarded Dotcom damages of NZ$30,000 ($21,816) for the “loss of a benefit” and NZ$60,000 for “loss of dignity and injury to feelings”.
