It allows parents to control who their kids communicate with using the app. \nYet a group of child-advocacy groups in January asked the company to discontinue it , citing multiple studies showing that heavy social media use had negative mental health effects on teens and adolescents. \nWhen CNBC asked Facebook last month if it planned to continue the product, the company replied in an email that read in part: \n\"Since we launched in December we've heard from parents around the country that Messenger Kids has helped them stay in touch with their children and has enabled their children to video chat with fun masks. We worked to create Messenger Kids with an advisory committee of parenting and developmental experts, as well as with families themselves and in partnership with National PTA. We continue to be focused on making Messenger Kids be the best experience it can be for families.\" John Shinal Technology Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T23:39:43.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
