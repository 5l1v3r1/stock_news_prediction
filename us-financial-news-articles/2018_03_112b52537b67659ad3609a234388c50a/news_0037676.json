The 35-year-old hooker, who led Ireland to a grand slam victory in the Six Nations championship on Saturday, has played 111 times for his country, making him Ireland’s third most-capped player. Best took the captaincy in 2016 and led the team to their first ever victory over New Zealand as well as a first win over the Springboks on South African soil. “I feel I can continue to make a contribution to both Ireland and Ulster Rugby and am delighted to have extended my IRFU contract to the next World Cup,” Best said in a statement on the IRFU website.
