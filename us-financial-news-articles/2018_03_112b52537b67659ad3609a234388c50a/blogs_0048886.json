We think that product will stand on its own two feet relatively quickly.\" \nCurrently there are more than 85,000 Uber drivers in Australia, according to Greenacre . \nStill, competition has not always been favorable for Uber, which struggled with containing losses in recent years. The firm's losses surged 61 percent in 2017 to $4.5 billion , though its loss in the fourth quarter narrowed from the prior period. \nSince taking over from Travis Kalanick last year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has focused on cleaning up the company's battered reputation and instilling financial discipline to push toward profitability. Last November, Khosrowshahi said Uber had plans to try and go public by 2019. \nRecently, the firm agreed to sell its business in Southeast Asia to Singapore-based regional rival Grab. Before that, Uber sold its China business to local competitor Didi Chuxing and merged its operations in Russia and neighboring countries with local tech company Yandex. \nWhen asked if he thought Uber was struggling in emerging markets, Greenacre said Uber has a \"thriving business\" in places like India and the Middle East . Yet, Indian media recently reported that Japan's SoftBank , which is an investor in Uber and India's Ola, could be pushing for a merger between the two firms in the future. \n\"Dara, our CEO, has come out and said we will continue to invest really heavily in those types of areas, as well as invest heavily in our more core markets and Australia is one of those markets,\" Greenacre said. \n\"What he has also made clear is that we need to show a path to profitability and a path to IPO and this is all part of that,\" he added. \nâ€” CNBC's Alex Sherman contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T07:21:29.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
