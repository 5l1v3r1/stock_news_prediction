(NYSE: AIG) today announced that in accordance with the terms of the outstanding warrants (CUSIP number 026874156) (the “Warrants”) to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, the Warrant exercise price will be reduced to $43.8498 per share from $44.0005 per share and the number of shares of AIG Common Stock receivable upon Warrant exercise will increase to 1.027 from 1.023.
