(NYSE: MED), a leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven, healthy living products and programs, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Highlights:\nMedifast revenue of $78.0 million for the quarter and $301.6 million for the year OPTA VIA revenue of $68.6 million for the quarter and $256.6 million for the year Net income of $7.3 million for the quarter and $27.7 million for the year Earnings per diluted share of $0.60 for the quarter and $2.29 for the year\n\"Our financial results exceeded our expectations and we are pleased to report a strong finish to the year with revenue through our OPTA VIA Coaches model generating record growth,\" said Dan Chard, Medifast's Chief Executive Officer. \"Looking ahead, our OPTA VIA coach community is now stronger than ever and very well-positioned to build upon the current business momentum as they share our mission of offering the world lifelong transformation, one healthy habit at a time.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Medifast revenue increased 24.8% to $78.0 million from revenue of $62.5 million for the fourth quarter last year.\nOPTA VIA revenue increased 32.4% to $68.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $51.8 million for the fourth quarter last year. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of growth. The total number of active earning OPTA VIA Coaches for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 15,000, compared to 12,500 for the fourth quarter of 2016. The average revenue per active earning OPTA VIA Coach for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9.7% to $4,562 compared to $4,158 for the fourth quarter last year.\nMedifast Direct revenue decreased 2.9% to $6.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $6.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter advertising spend decreased $0.1 million from $1.6 million for the fourth quarter last year.\nRevenue in the Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers decreased to $2.6 million from $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of last year. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by fewer franchise centers in operation during the period combined with a decline in activity within the centers and a decrease in resellers. The Company ended the quarter with 16 franchise centers and 18 reseller locations in operation compared to 37 franchise centers and 19 reseller locations at the end of the same period last year.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Wholesale business unit revenue was consistent with the prior year period at $0.2 million. This business model was integrated into the OPTA VIA coach model at year end.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $59.1 million compared to $47.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company's gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 40 basis points to 75.8% from 75.4% for the fourth quarter last year. The increase in gross margin percentage was a result of a continued favorability in shipping costs and more accurate product forecasting in the quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") increased $9.1 million to $49.6 million compared to $40.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of higher OPTA VIA commission expense. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 63.6% compared to 64.8% in the fourth quarter last year.\nThe fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate was 25.4%, compared to 38.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of a discrete change in accounting for taxes associated with share-based compensation which vested in the fourth quarter along with the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, based on approximately 12.1 million shares outstanding. Fourth quarter 2016 net income was $4.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share based on approximately 12.0 million shares outstanding.\nFiscal 2017 Results\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Medifast revenue was $301.6 million as compared to revenue of $274.5 million in 2016. As a percentage of revenue, OPTA VIA represented approximately 85.1%, Medifast Direct represented 10.6%, Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers represented 4.0%, and Medifast Wholesale represented 0.3%.\nNet income for 2017 increased $9.9 million to $27.7 million, or $2.29 per diluted share based on approximately 12.1 million shares, compared to $17.8 million, or $1.49 per diluted share for the comparable period last year based on approximately 11.9 million shares outstanding. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, adjusted net income, excluding the asset impairment charge and restructuring charges, was $22.6 million, or $1.89 per diluted share.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company's balance sheet remains strong with stockholders' equity of $108.6 million and working capital of $88.1 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities increased $22.0 million to $98.8 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $76.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Company remains free of interest bearing debt.\nThe Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $5.8 million, or $0.48 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of 2017, and has approximately 850,000 shares remaining on its repurchase authorization as of December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nThe Company expects first quarter revenue to be in the range of $88.5 million to $91.5 million and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.87. For the full year 2018, the Company expects revenue of $350 million to $360 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.15 to $3.25. The full year 2018 earnings guidance assumes a 22% to 23% effective tax rate.\nBoard of Director Changes\nMedifast also today announced upcoming changes to its Board of Directors, including the nomination of Michael Hoer as Board Director.\nOther changes to the Board include the resignation of Glenn Welling, Founder and Chief Investment Officer of Engaged Capital effective as of today. Mr. Welling joined the Medifast Board in June 2015.

Previously, Mr. Hoer spent 18 years working for Continental Grain Company, where he held the position of President and Managing Director of Continental Grain Asia.\n\"On behalf of the entire Board, we thank Glenn and Charley for their service and many contributions to Medifast,\" said Dan Chard, Chief Executive Officer of Medifast. \"The Medifast team remains committed to the further successful execution of our strategic plan and we look forward to working collaboratively with the Board of Directors to advance Medifast's international footprint and to continue to generate strong returns for the Company's shareholders.\"\nConference Call Information\nThe conference call is scheduled for today, Tuesday, March 6, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET.
