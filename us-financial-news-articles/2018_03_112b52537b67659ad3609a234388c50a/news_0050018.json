REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nSuperior Court Judge Elihu Berle said in a proposed decision Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies had failed to show that the threat from a chemical compound produced when roasting coffee was insignificant, court documents showed. \nStarbucks and other plaintiffs in the case have until April 10 to file objections. \nOfficials from Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ), McDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ), Dunkin’ Donuts ( DNKN.O ) and Peet’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nThe California-based Council for Education and Research on Toxics sued Starbucks and other companies on grounds they failed to provide warnings to consumers that the coffee they sold contained high levels of acrylamide, a toxic and carcinogenic chemical, court documents showed.
