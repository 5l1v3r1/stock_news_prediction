REUTERS/Hazir reka/File Photo/File Photo \nThe six Turkish nationals were arrested in Kosovo on Thursday, at Turkey’s request, over alleged links to schools financed by the Gulen movement, which Ankara blames for a failed 2016 coup. \nOn Friday Haradinaj sacked the Kosovo interior minister and secret service chief for failing to inform him about the arrests. \n“Today we have decided to start an investigation of all (state) structures that were involved in arresting and deporting the six Turkish men,” Haradinaj said on Saturday after an urgent meeting of Kosovo’s security council. \nAnkara accused the six arrested men of being recruiters for a network run by the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, and said they had helped people accused of connections to the network to leave Turkey. Ankara blames Gulen and his movement for the coup attempt in 2016. Gulen denies involvement. \nHuman Rights Watch criticised the Kosovo authorities over the arrests. \n“In addition to the questionable arrests, the men were sent to a country where they face a serious risk of torture,” the watchdog said in a statement. \nKosovo has been under pressure from Turkey in recent weeks to take action against schools funded by the Gulen organisation. \nFamily members of the six had stayed at Pristina airport until the early hours of Saturday after rumours spread that they might still be in Kosovo. \nThey left after the police said the six had been sent to Turkey on Thursday. \n“My father was kidnapped,” said one family member, Mustafa Gunakan, outside the airport. “We thought we were safe in Kosovo. We never thought it would end this way.” \nFlorian Bieber, a Balkans expert at the University of Graz, said the incident could be damaging for Kosovo, which is seeking to build closer ties with the European Union. \n“It certainly will hurt Kosovo, both for throwing doubt on the rule of law and political authority and for cooperation with a regime that is authoritarian and increasingly antagonistic with the EU,” Bieber told Reuters.
