But the administration has not released a formal plan, that could could later this week .\nThe proposed tariffs are still in a state of limbo, Kristin Dziczek, director of the Industry, Labor & Economics Group at the Center for Automotive Research, told CNBC. \n\"It is important to point out that none of this is policy yet,\" she said. But she added that so far, the process has been quite different from what the industry has been accustomed to in the past. \nThe tariffs are being proposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That provision typically is meant to allow the Commerce Department to impose a tariff on any material that might be essential to national security. \nBut when Section 232 has been invoked in the past, it is usually pretty specific, targeting a specific metal originating from a particular trading partner, Dziczek said. Even the grade of the material is often specified. \nBut this is far more broad. It names no specific trading partner and includes all steel and aluminum coming into the United States, she said. \nThere is a larger problem looming though, Dziczek said. There is already a global oversupply of steel, and while tariffs might cause a supply shortage in the short term, they could lead U.S. producers to boost capacity, eventually further contributing to the oversupply in the global market. \nGeneral Motors' U.S. rival Ford has said in recent months that it has had trouble managing the effects of swings in metals prices .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T22:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:24:26.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
