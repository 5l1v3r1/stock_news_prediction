After the November ruling, Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party said it was strongly dissatisfied and called for Beijing to allow Li to return to Taiwan.\nLi admitted during his trial to having criticized China’s ruling Communist Party and to having shared articles and arguments promoting Taiwan’s multi-party democracy.\nChina views self-ruled Taiwan as a wayward province and said last week Taiwan would face the “punishment of history” for any attempt at independence.\nReporting by Twinnie Siu; Writing by Christian Shepherd; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T16:54:23.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
