(\"Claire's\" or the \"Company\") announced that it is pursuing a financial restructuring in order to eliminate a substantial portion of debt from the Company's balance sheet and position Claire's for long-term success pursuant to a chapter 11 reorganization process commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware by Claire's and certain of its U.S. affiliates. Claire's international subsidiaries are not part of the Company's U.S. chapter 11 filings.\nThe Company's management is confident that, through the restructuring process, Claire's will cement its position as one of the world's leading specialty retailers of fashionable jewelry, accessories, and beauty products for young women, teens, \"tweens\" and kids for many years to come. Unlike other retailers that have come before it, Claire's has commenced its restructuring process from a position of unique operational strength:\nThe Company expects to report adjusted EBITDA for FY2017 (on a 52-week basis) of approximately $212 million, up nearly 13% from FY2016. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is included in this release. The Company expects to report an adjusted EBITDA margin for FY2017 (on a 52-week basis) of approximately 16.1%, up nearly 170 basis points from FY2016. The Company expects to report net sales and net income for FY2017 (on a 52-week basis) of approximately $1,318 million and $29 million, respectively. Claire's is growing, not shrinking, its business. The Company expects its concessions business to grow by more than 4,000 stores in 2018. Claire's continues to be the world's leading ear piercer, having pierced over 100,000,000 ears worldwide, and approximately 3,500,000 ears in FY2017 in the United States alone. The Company's iconic ear piercing services are unmatched and cannot be replicated online. The Company is utilizing the chapter 11 process to effectuate a balance sheet—not an operational—restructuring. The Company is current on payments to its trade vendors, and has ample liquidity to maintain strong partnerships with its domestic and non-domestic suppliers, including by making timely payments on customary trade terms. The Company has obtained $135 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing commitments, including an asset-based lending facility and a term loan from Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citi\"). The Company's restructuring efforts are supported by holders of approximately 72% of the Company's First Lien Debt, 8% of its Second Lien Notes, and 83% of its Unsecured Notes.\nThe Company has commenced its restructuring process having executed a Restructuring Support Agreement (the \"RSA\") with its Ad Hoc Group of First Lien Creditors led by Elliott Management Corporation and Monarch Alternative Capital LP that collectively holds approximately 72% of the Company's First Lien Debt, 8% of its Second Lien Notes, and 83 % of its Unsecured Notes. Pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the RSA, members of the Ad Hoc Group of First Lien Creditors have agreed to provide the Company with approximately $575 million of new capital, including financing commitments for a new $75 million asset-based lending facility, a new $250 million first lien term loan, and $250 million as a preferred equity investment. With these commitments in place, Claire's expects to complete the chapter 11 process in September 2018, emerge with over $150 million of liquidity, and reduce its overall indebtedness by approximately $1.9 billion.\n\"This transaction substantially reduces the debt on our balance sheet and will enhance our efforts to provide the best possible experience for our customers,\" said Ron Marshall, Claire's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Marshall continued, \"We will complete this process as a healthier, more profitable company, which will position us to be an even stronger business partner for our suppliers, concessions partners, and franchisees.\"\nClaire's expects to operate its business in the ordinary course during its restructuring process, and its Claire's® and Icing® locations worldwide will continue to provide their customers with the assortment of products and quality of service they have come to expect to find in the Company's stores. In connection with its restructuring, the Company has filed a series of customary motions seeking court approval of the Company's honoring wage-, benefits-, and critical- and foreign-vendor-related claims. Cash flows from operations, coupled with the RSA and the Company's fully-underwritten $135 million DIP facility from Citi, will provide Claire's with ample liquidity to enter into, operate within, and emerge from chapter 11 seamlessly.\nLazard Frères & Co. LLC is serving as investment banker to Claire's; FTI Consulting, Inc. is serving as restructuring advisor to Claire's; Hilco Real Estate, LLC is serving as real estate advisor to Claire's; and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is serving as legal counsel to Claire's.\nThe Ad Hoc First Lien Group is represented by Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Millstein & Co.\nCourt documents and additional information are available on the website administered by the Company's claims and noticing agent, Prime Clerk LLC, at https://cases.primeclerk.com/claires or may be obtained by calling the Claire's Restructuring Hotline, toll-free in the U.S., at (844) 276-3027.

We use Adjusted EBITDA and as a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA margin, as important tools to assess our operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure in highlighting trends in our business. We reinforce the importance of Adjusted EBITDA with our bonus eligible associates by using this metric in our annual performance bonus program. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is effective, when used in conjunction with net income, in evaluating asset performance, and differentiating efficient operators in the industry. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the covenants contained in our debt agreements and it is the metric we use to communicate our financial performance to our debt investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations under GAAP and should not be used as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to represent cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We compensate for the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA by using it only to supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business. Adjusted EBITDA has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nSome of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash used for capital expenditures; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized often will have to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash requirements for such replacements; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital requirements; and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash necessary to make payments of interest or principal on our indebtedness.\nWhile Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet indebtedness service requirements, it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation.\nCLAIRE'S STORES, INC.
