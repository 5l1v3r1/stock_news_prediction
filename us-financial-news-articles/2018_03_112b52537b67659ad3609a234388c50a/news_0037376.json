Additional terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nIn 2016, Vanterra completed an anchor investment in WM's HPH Specialized Fund I, a single-asset vehicle focused on acquiring lower-middle market brands in the Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (\"VMS\") and Natural Personal Care sectors and integrating them into Nutranext LLC (FKA \"Wellnext LLC\"), a vertically-integrated developer, manufacturer, and marketer of dietary and nutritional supplements.\nUnder WM Partners' direction, Nutranext nearly doubled its revenues and more than quadrupled its EBITDA. This growth was driven by a combination of operational organic growth and four strategic add-on acquisitions of leading nutritional supplements brands in fast-growing categories in the retail and DTC channels that complemented Nutranext's existing portfolio. The vision with Nutranext was to create a scalable platform that would be attractive to a potential buyer by consolidating the highly fragmented U.S. supplements market by acquiring and integrating leading brands. With these acquisitions, Nutranext expanded its national footprint with offices across the U.S., diversified its product mix into other leading categories such as collagen, anti-stress and sleep products, optimized its distribution capabilities across all channels, and strengthened the team.\nVanterra's strategic investment into WM Partners and Nutranext resulted from the Firm's growing activity in the health & wellness sector and multi-year industry deep dive. The supplements subsector alone is a $41 billion industry 1 .\nIn addition to Nutranext, Vanterra has made direct investments into multiple other health & wellness and consumer lifestyle companies. Vanterra benefits from a flexible investment approach and has established a number of other specialized fund platforms in partnership with management teams in sectors such as healthcare services, energy & materials, secondaries, credit, and special situations.\nAbout Vanterra Capital\nVanterra Capital is a global private equity firm that manages assets for a diverse investor base of ultra-high net worth partners and leading institutions.
