Vodafone Qatar was the worst performer, losing 3.76 percent. The company’s board announced last week a decision to reduce the share capital of the company by halving the nominal value of the company to 5 riyal per share.\nThe real estate sector also weighed on the index, with United Development Company and Barwa Development Company losing 1.79 percent and 0.88 percent respectively.\nThe Dubai exchange was broadly flat, losing only 0.05 percent. Abu Dhabi, though, slipped 1.87 percent, pulled by First Abu Dhabi Bank which dropped 6.47 percent as the stock went ex-dividend.\nFAB announced a cash dividend of 0.7 dirhams. On the ex-dividend date, the exchange reduces the stock price by the amount of the dividend to account for the fact that new investors are not eligible to receive dividends and are therefore unwilling to pay a premium.\nSAUDI ARABIA * Index went up 0.96 percent to 7,437.61 points.\nDUBAI * Index shed 0.05 percent to 3,204.91 points.\nABU DHABI * Index dropped 1.87 percent to 4,523.49 points.\nQATAR * Index went down 0.29 percent to 8,429.30 points.\nEGYPT * Index rose 1.99 percent to 16,022 points.\nKUWAIT * Index was flat 6,805.74 points.\nBAHRAIN * Index was up 0.01 percent to 1,374.766 points.\nOMAN * Index dropped 0.81 percent to 4,947.400 points.
