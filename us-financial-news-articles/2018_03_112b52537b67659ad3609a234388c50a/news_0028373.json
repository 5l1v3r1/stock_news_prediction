Some of the people said they can’t get anyone to respond to questions at the retailer, which filed for bankruptcy in September and faces a $5 billion debt load. Toymakers Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc. touched their daily lows on the news. \nToys “R” Us also recently stopped negotiating settlements with vendors on money owned before it filed for bankruptcy, some of the people said. A representative for Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys “R” Us declined to comment. \nHow a Toys ‘R’ Us liquidation threatens to curb toymakers’ innovation \nThe bleak situation lends evidence to the notion that Toys “R” Us is moving toward winding down its U.S. operations for good. Bloomberg reported last week that the retailer was making preparations for a liquidation of its domestic business. \nThe company has failed to find a buyer or reach a debt restructuring deal with lenders, leaving it with few options, people familiar with the situation said at the time. A hearing in bankruptcy court is scheduled to be held on Thursday, after being delayed. \nThe struggles of Toys “R” Us have taken a toll on the two largest U.S. toymakers, Hasbro and Mattel. Shares of those companies fell on Friday after Bloomberg reported about the possible liquidation, then dipped again on Tuesday. \nHasbro fell less than 1 percent to $89.32 as of 3:32 p.m. in New York, while Mattel dropped 3.4 percent to $14.49.
