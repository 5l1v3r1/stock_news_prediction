President Donald Trump is ramping up the pressure on Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 1.11% and its relationship with the USPS, suggesting on Twitter that the online retailer is exploiting the public mail system for its own gain . The controversy flared as the president said Amazon avoids paying taxes, puts retailers out of business and treats the Postal Service as “their Delivery Boy.” The WSJ’s Heidi Vogt and Paul Ziobro write the flood of shipments from Amazon into postal channels in fact has helped keep the USPS viable. Amazon uses an operation available to all private carriers in which they ferry parcels to local postal centers near the final destination to save money on delivery. The parcel business has helped offset a steep and ongoing decline in First Class mail. The big concern the USPS has with the program is that Amazon may pull shipments away as it ramps up its own logistics network.\nLabor peace seems to be breaking out across domestic U.S. freight operations. The Teamsters union and ABF Freight System struck a tentative new contract agreement just a couple of days before the current pact was due to expire. The WSJ reports the deal settles a period of uncertainty at one of the country’s biggest less-than-truckload operators , and even came with some breathing room compared to negotiations in 2013 that had to be extended for two months after the earlier contract expired. Along with another contract Teamsters members ratified earlier this week at far smaller Standard Forwarding, a business with around 500 members, the agreement suggests relatively amicable labor relations these days in freight operations. That could be the result of improved financial strength at companies as freight demand has heated up and wages have increased. ABF parent Arbest Corp. earned a $36.6 million in the fourth quarter last year, far ahead of earnings a year earlier even before a $24.5 million gain from the new tax law.\nTougher food-safety demands are drawing technology and funding into farm-focused supply chain s . FoodLogiQ LLC, which develops supply-chain software to track food safety, raised $19.5 million in a new funding round, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, including backing from the venture-funding arm of Tyson Foods Inc. The interest from Tyson is a sign of the growing attention food distributors are paying to suppliers , and of the heightened role that traceability has in supply chains that stretch from far-flung growers to food-processing companies and, finally, to restaurants and supermarkets. That’s become an imperative as consumers press for more information on where their food comes from, and because of new regulations that require U.S. companies to set detailed plans to prevent foodborne illness. FoodLogiQ is one of a handful of software specialists expanding in the market, which one research group expects reach $14 billion in global sales next year.\nTRANSPORTATION Photo: Bloomberg News Handling cargo at seaports is tough work, and one of the hardest parts about it may be getting into the dockworkers’ union. A longshore worker is charging in a gender-discrimination case that the hurdles are unlawfully high for anyone who’s pregnant or recently given birth . The WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips reports the complaint, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleges that other workers are able to pile up hours needed to join the union even when they’re on leave for military service or out due to a disability. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union disputes that, but the case is only just beginning. ACLU lawyers say other workers could come forward in light of the complaint and the class may have standing to sue the union and terminal operators, depending on the EEOC’s ruling,\nQUOTABLE\n‘ I think Amazon faces a day of reckoning with or without Trump.
