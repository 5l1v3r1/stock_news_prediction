REUTERS/Jorge Cabrera In a statement, DESA denied involvement in the crime and said Castillo is“innocent,” adding that it“rejects this decision that comes from international pressure and smear campaigns of various NGOs on the company.” Caceres, a 43-year-old teacher who won the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, was shot dead at her residence on the night of March 2, 2016. Castillo is the second alleged mastermind captured for her murder. Eight other people, including company employees, hired assassins and members of the army, have been arrested and tried. Honduras has seen repeated confrontations between indigenous populations with mining and hydroelectric operations. President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who won reelection in December in a vote marred by fraud allegations, has sought to boost investment in such ventures. Members the activist group that Caceres led gathered Friday in front of prosecutors’ offices in the capital to demand the arrest of more prominent local businessmen they allege are connected to the crime.
