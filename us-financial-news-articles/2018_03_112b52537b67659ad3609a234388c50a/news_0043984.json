REUTERS/Sait Serkan Gurbuz Austin Rollins, a student at Great Mills High School, shot Jaelynn Willey, 16, with his father’s handgun in a hallway at the school last Tuesday, according to the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office.\nWilley, who had been in a relationship with Rollins that had recently ended, died days later.\nAbout three minutes after Rollins shot Willey, sheriff’s deputy Blaine Gaskill fired one round at him, striking his gun. At the same time, Rollins shot himself in the head, the sheriff said in a brief statement on Monday.\nRollins was wounded and died at a hospital. Gaskill was unharmed.\nDesmond Barnes, a 14-year-old student, was struck in the leg by the same bullet that hit Willey, the sheriff said. Barnes was treated at a hospital and released a day after the shooting.\nDetails of the shooting emerged after hundreds of thousands of people marched over the weekend to demand the U.S. government tighten gun laws.\nLed by survivors of a Florida high school shooting in February that claimed 17 lives, the marchers called on lawmakers and President Donald Trump to confront the issue after decades of shooting sprees at U.S. schools and colleges .\nReporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T10:42:11.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
