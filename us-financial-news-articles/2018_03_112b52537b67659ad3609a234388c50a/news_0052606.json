There were several factors that led to financial difficulty, prompting this wind-down.”\nWhen asked if Render Media will consider selling its sites, a spokeswoman said the company is working with its lender to figure out its options.\nIn a note to clients, Render Media blamed changes to Facebook’s branded content guidelines , which led it to no longer support its partner publishing network with articles. The spokeswoman for the company also said that the social media site’s recent news feed algorithm tweak contributed to the decision, among other factors.\nThe changes to Facebook’s branded content guidelines, which specify that owners of pages aren’t allowed to pay other page owners to share content they didn’t create, were made earlier this year to curb the spread of low-quality content, according to a spokeswoman from Facebook. That was part of Render Media’s business model.\n“The combined impact of several recent events have severely restricted Render’s cash flow and its ability to sustain its business,” the company wrote in the note to clients. “We are working with our lender as we attempt to wind down Render’s operations. We are aware that we have outstanding amounts owed to you, and we working to maximize the remaining value of the business.”\nRender Media had laid off most of its staff over the last several months, cutting about 40 of its 46 staffers since December, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe branded content changes, along with a related tweak to Facebook’s news feed algorithm that reduces the amount of content from publishers in favor of posts from friends and family, have stymied companies that rely heavily on traffic from Facebook to prop up their businesses. Earlier this year, the female-focused digital publisher LittleThings closed its doors, after the news feed change caused its traffic to plummet by 75%.\nThe news marks an abrupt reversal for Render Media, which in 2016 was named the second fastest-growing media company in America, according to Inc. Magazine’s Inc. 5000, a ranking of the fastest-growing private companies. A 2017 press kit from Render Media touted the company’s explosive growth on social media, saying it was adding “nearly 1 million fans every month.”\nBut in recent months, Render Media’s traffic plunged. In February, the company’s network of sites drew 8.1 million unique viewers, a 68% decrease compared with the same period a year before, according to comScore.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/render-media-honored-in-the-top-2-of-the-2016-inc-5000-list-300316076.html", "http://rndr-corp.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rndrcorp_prod/s3fs-public/pdfs/130/RNDR_PressKit_Feb2017_v6.pdf"], "published": "2018-03-29T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T08:13:36.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
