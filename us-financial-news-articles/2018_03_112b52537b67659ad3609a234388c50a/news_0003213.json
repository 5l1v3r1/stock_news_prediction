But the company shelved its plans after liquor producer Constellation Brands bought a 10 percent stake in Canopy, according to a video of the speech posted on the club’s website.\nA Nasdaq listing would put Canopy in the company of fellow Canadian marijuana company Cronos Group , which on Tuesday became the first pot company to trade on Wall Street.\nCronos is up 26 percent since its closing price on Monday, compared with a 2.9 percent decline in the Nasdaq Composite Index.\nThe pursuit of U.S. listings by Canadian pot producers is growing evidence of investor demand for access to a sector that has seen monumental growth over the past several months. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange traded fund went from essentially zero to $400 million in net assets within a month, Vahan Ajamian, research analyst at Beacon Securities, said in a note on Monday.\n“When Constellation put money into our business, the number of U.S. institutional investors interested in us went way up,” Linton said.“The Nasdaq is doing a great job not allowing people to list who break federal laws and that’s a place where we should list in due course.”\nCanopy shares jumped 9.5 percent to close at a C$29.96 on Thursday, its highest level since Feb. 20.\nLinton did not specify a time frame for a Nasdaq listing, but Ajamian estimated it could occur in the second quarter of 2018 in a note on Thursday.
