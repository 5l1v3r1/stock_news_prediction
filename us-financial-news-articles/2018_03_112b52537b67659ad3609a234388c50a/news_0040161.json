In the past, Bolton has recommended scrapping the Iran nuclear deal and justified the need for U.S. strikes against North Korea.\nBolton's hawkish views could encourage Trump to do what he wants on North Korea and Iran, said Sherman, who is currently a non-resident senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School and a senior counselor at consultancy Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\"There is an enormous amount at stake here and my greatest concern is that the president is dealing with each of these pieces in silos, without understanding how they all interconnect and how we have to work out a comprehensive strategy,\" she said.\nDefense Secretary James Mattis may try to ease tensions behind the scene but it's unclear how successful he may be, Sherman continued.\nTrump has set a mid-May deadline for European powers to meet his demands on revisions to an agreement that would place limits on Tehran's nuclear program.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's April visit to Washington will be \"crucial\" to the fate of the deal, Sherman said, noting that Macron appears to get along with Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T10:20:36.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
