(NYSE:TIF) reported its financial results for the full year and the three months (“fourth quarter”) ended January 31, 2018. Results were consistent with guidance previously issued when the Company reported its holiday sales results for the November-December period on January 17, 2018. Management further elaborated on its financial guidance for the full year ending January 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2018”).\nIn the full year:\nWorldwide net sales increased 4% to $4.2 billion, reflecting sales growth in most regions and across most jewelry categories; comparable store sales were equal to the prior year. On a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes the effect of translating foreign-currency-denominated sales into U.S. dollars (see “Non-GAAP Measures”), worldwide net sales also increased 4% and comparable store sales were equal to the prior year. Net earnings of $370 million, or $2.96 per diluted share, were 17% below the prior year’s $446 million, or $3.55 per diluted share. However, net earnings in 2017 included charges recorded in the fourth quarter totaling $146 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net earnings in the prior year included a net charge recorded in the fourth quarter totaling $38 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to certain impairments. Excluding all such charges, net earnings of $516 million, or $4.13 per diluted share, in 2017 were 10% higher than the prior year’s $470 million, or $3.75 per diluted share (see “Non-GAAP Measures”).\nIn the fourth quarter:\nWorldwide net sales rose 9% to $1.3 billion, resulting from growth in all regions and across all product categories; comparable store sales rose 3%. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, worldwide net sales rose 6% and comparable store sales were 1% above the prior year. Net earnings of $62 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, were 61% below the prior year’s $158 million, or $1.26 per diluted share. However, as noted above, the Company recorded tax-related charges in the fourth quarter of 2017 and certain impairment charges in last year’s fourth quarter. Excluding all such charges, net earnings rose 15% to $208 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, from last year’s $182 million, or $1.45 per diluted share (see “Non-GAAP Measures”).\nAlessandro Bogliolo, Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased to be finishing the year with solid sales growth, both geographically and across product categories. Most important, however, is to generate sustainable growth in sales, margins and earnings over the long-term. Confirming what we recently indicated, we believe that increasing investment now in certain areas, such as technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations, which we expect will hinder pre-tax earnings growth in the near-term, is needed to generate that lasting long-term growth. We have assessed our business and are focused on the following six strategic priorities: Amplifying an evolved brand message; Renewing our product offerings and enhancing in-store presentation; Delivering an exciting omnichannel customer experience; Strengthening our competitive position and leading in key markets; Cultivating a more efficient operating model; and Inspiring an aligned and agile organization to win.”\nMr. Bogliolo added, “We will only be truly satisfied when we create greater excitement for our customers and also generate growth that reflects the full potential of our brand. The TIFFANY & CO. brand is strong and we have a very talented, dedicated and passionate team to pursue these strategic priorities and lead us to success. We are committed to nurturing the exceptional legacy we have been entrusted.”\nNet sales by region were as follows:\nIn the Americas, total net sales rose 2% to $1.9 billion in the full year and 5% to $619 million in the fourth quarter; comparable store sales increased 1% and 5% in the respective periods. There were no meaningful geographic differences across the region. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 1% in the full year and 5% in the fourth quarter; comparable store sales were unchanged in the full year and up 4% in the fourth quarter. In Asia-Pacific, total net sales increased 10% to $1.1 billion in the full year and 13% to $320 million in the fourth quarter; comparable store sales declined 1% and rose 3% in those respective periods. Total net sales growth reflected higher wholesale and retail sales; on a comparable store sales basis, the full year decline reflected strong sales growth in mainland China that was offset by lower sales in most other countries, while the fourth quarter sales growth benefited from performance across Greater China. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 8% in the full year and 9% in the fourth quarter, with comparable store sales declining 2% and 1% in the respective periods. In Japan, total net sales of $596 million in the full year were 1% below the prior year, while sales in the fourth quarter rose 2% to $189 million; comparable store sales declined 1% and rose 1%, respectively. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 1% in both the full year and fourth quarter; comparable store sales rose 2% in the full year and were unchanged in the fourth quarter. In Europe, total net sales rose 6% in the full year to $483 million and 13% to $165 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting the positive effects from currency translation, new stores and e-commerce sales growth; comparable store sales declined 2% and rose 1% in the respective periods, which management attributes in part to softness across much of the region as well as negative effects from new stores on existing store sales. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales rose 3% in the full year and 4% in the fourth quarter, and comparable store sales declined 4% and 8%, respectively. Other net sales were $125 million in the full year and $41 million in the fourth quarter, representing increases of 26% and 48% over the respective prior-year periods. Growth in both periods reflected higher wholesale sales of diamonds as well as comparable stores sales growth of 2% and 6%, respectively. Tiffany opened nine Company-operated stores in the full year and closed seven. At January 31, 2018, the Company operated 315 stores (124 in the Americas, 87 in Asia-Pacific, 54 in Japan, 46 in Europe, and four in the UAE), versus 313 stores a year ago (125 in the Americas, 85 in Asia-Pacific, 55 in Japan, 43 in Europe, and five in the UAE). From a product category perspective, in the full year, sales increased in the Jewelry Collections category (which now combines the previously-reported High, Fine and Solitaire Jewelry and the Fashion Jewelry categories) and the Designer Jewelry category and decreased in the Engagement Jewelry category, while in the fourth quarter, all categories achieved varying degrees of sales growth.\nOther highlights:\nGross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) was 62.5% in the full year and 63.7% in the fourth quarter, compared with 62.2% and 64.1% in the respective prior-year periods. In both periods, favorable product input costs were partly or completely offset by the dilutive effects from increased wholesale distribution and increased wholesale sales of diamonds. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 2% in both the full year and fourth quarter, reflecting a favorable comparison to the prior year, in which the Company had recorded certain impairment charges totaling $38 million (see “Non-GAAP Measures”); excluding those charges, SG&A expenses in the full year and fourth quarter were 5% and 10% above the respective prior-year periods as a result of higher labor and incentive compensation costs, higher store occupancy and depreciation expenses and increased marketing spending in both periods of 2017. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales (“operating margin”) was 19.1% in the full year and 23.0% in the fourth quarter, compared with 18.0% and 20.9% in the respective prior-year periods. Excluding the aforementioned prior-year charges (see “Non-GAAP Measures”), the operating margin in the full year rose fractionally from the prior year’s 19.0% and in the fourth quarter declined from last year’s 23.9%. Interest and other expenses, net in the full year and fourth quarter were lower than the respective prior-year periods. The effective income tax rate increased to 51.3% in the full year and to 79.4% in the fourth quarter, compared with 34.1% and 36.0% in the respective prior-year periods, largely as a result of charges related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition to the impact of this new legislation, the effective income tax rate in the full year and fourth quarter was reduced by an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction, lower state taxes and a benefit from the implementation of a new accounting standard related to the treatment of excess tax benefits from the vesting or exercise of share-based compensation, while the 2016 full year rate included a benefit from the conclusion of a tax examination. The Company generated $932 million of cash flow from operations in 2017 (versus $706 million in 2016) and, after subtracting $239 million of capital expenditures (versus $223 million in 2016), generated $693 million in free cash flow (see “Non-GAAP Measures”) in 2017 (versus $483 million in 2016). Net inventories of $2.3 billion at January 31, 2018 were 4% above the prior year, and consistent with full year sales growth. The majority of the increase was attributed to currency translation. The Company repurchased more than one million shares in the full year, including almost 400,000 shares in the fourth quarter, at a total cost of $99 million in the year and $39 million in the fourth quarter, representing an average price of $95 in the year and $99 in the fourth quarter. At January 31, 2018, $211 million remained available for repurchases under the program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $500 million of the Company’s Common Stock and that expires on January 31, 2019. At January 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion and total debt (short-term and long-term) was $1.0 billion; total debt as a percentage of stockholders’ equity was 31% at January 31, 2018 versus 37% a year ago.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook:\nManagement’s guidance for fiscal 2018 includes: (i) worldwide net sales increasing by a mid-single-digit percentage over the prior year both as reported and on a constant-exchange-rate basis; (ii) earnings before income taxes equal to or slightly below the prior year; (iii) net earnings increasing to a range of $4.25 - $4.45 per diluted share and (iv) net earnings and EPS increasing in the first quarter with subsequent quarters’ earnings over the balance of the year affected by the amount and timing of anticipated higher investment spending. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company’s plans and assumptions for the full year, including: (i) low-to-mid-single-digit comparable sales growth (which, beginning in 2018, will include Company-operated stores, e-commerce and catalog sales for the periods that are presented), with varying degrees of growth in all regions; (ii) worldwide gross retail square footage increasing 2%, net through nine store openings, two closings and at least 15 relocations; (iii) operating margin below the prior year as a result of SG&A expense growth (affected by higher investment spending in technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations) at a higher rate than sales growth, partly offset by a higher gross margin; (iv) interest and other expenses, net in line with the prior year; (v) an effective income tax rate in the high 20’s; (vi) no meaningful effect in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis; and (vii) minimal benefit to net earnings per diluted share from share repurchases.\nManagement also expects: (i) net cash provided by operating activities of $660 million and (ii) free cash flow (see “Non-GAAP Measures”) of $380 million. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company’s plans and assumptions for the full year, including: (i) net inventories increasing approximately in line with sales growth, (ii) capital expenditures of $280 million and (iii) net earnings in line with management’s expectations, as described above.\nToday’s Conference Call:\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) to review actual results and the outlook.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(Unaudited)\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThe Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Internally, management also monitors and measures its performance using certain sales and earnings measures that include or exclude amounts, or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of including or excluding amounts, from the most directly comparable GAAP measure (“non-GAAP financial measures”). The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with useful supplemental information that will allow them to evaluate the Company's operating results using the same measures that management uses to monitor and measure its performance. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nNet Sales\nThe Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars (“constant-exchange-rate basis”). Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis are calculated by taking the current year’s sales in local currencies and translating them into U.S. dollars using the prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of sales performance and of comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. 2016 Full Year 2017 vs. 2016 GAAP\nReported\nTranslation\nEffect\nConstant-\nExchange-\nRate Basis\nGAAP\nReported\nTranslation\nEffect\nConstant-\nExchange-\nRate Basis\nNet Sales:\nWorldwide 9 % 3 % 6 % 4 % — % 4 % Americas 5 — 5 2 1 1 Asia-Pacific 13 4 9 10 2 8 Japan 2 1 1 (1 ) (2 ) 1 Europe 13 9 4 6 3 3 Other 48 — 48 26 — 26 Comparable Store Sales:\nWorldwide 3 % 2 % 1 % — % — % — % Americas 5 1 4 1 1 — Asia-Pacific 3 4 (1 ) (1 ) 1 (2 ) Japan 1 1 — (1 ) (3 ) 2 Europe 1 9 (8 ) (2 ) 2 (4 ) Other 6 — 6 2 — 2 Net Earnings\nInternally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of the Company's results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts:\n(in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Charges related\nto the\n2017 Tax Act a\nNon-GAAP Quarter Ended January 31, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 239.5 $ (146.2 ) $ 93.3 Effective income tax rate 79.4 % (48.5 )% 30.9 % Net earnings 61.9 146.2 208.1 Diluted earnings per share 0.50 1.17 1.67 Year Ended January 31, 2018 Provision for income taxes $ 390.4 $ (146.2 ) $ 244.2 Effective income tax rate 51.3 % (19.2 )% 32.1 % Net earnings 370.1 146.2 516.3 Diluted earnings per share 2.96 1.17 4.13 a\nNet expense recognized in 2017 related to the estimated impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”). The charges recorded included: Estimated tax expense of $94.8 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the impact of the reduction in the U.S. tax rate on the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities; Estimated tax expense of $56.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the one-time transition tax effected via a mandatory deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits; and A tax benefit of $4.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, resulting from the effect of the 21% statutory tax rate for the month of January 2018 on the Company’s annual statutory tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2018. Because the Company’s fiscal year ended on January 31, 2018, the Company’s statutory tax rate for fiscal 2017 is 33.8%, rather than 35.0%.\n(in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Impairment\ncharges b\nNon-GAAP Quarter Ended January 31, 2017 Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses $ 531.7 $ (38.0 ) $ 493.7 As a % of sales 43.2 % 40.1 % Earnings from operations 256.5 38.0 294.5 As a % of sales 20.9 % 23.9 % Provision for income taxes c 88.7 14.0 102.7 Net earnings 157.8 24.0 181.8 Diluted earnings per share * 1.26 0.19 1.45 Year Ended January 31, 2017 SG&A expenses $ 1,769.1 $ (38.0 ) $ 1,731.1 As a % of sales 44.2 % 43.3 % Earnings from operations 721.2 38.0 759.2 As a % of sales 18.0 % 19.0 % Provision for income taxes c 230.5 14.0 244.5 Net earnings 446.1 24.0 470.1 Diluted earnings per share * 3.55 0.19 3.75 *\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nb\nExpenses associated with the following: $25.4 million of pre-tax expense ($16.0 million after tax expense, or $0.13 per diluted share) associated with an asset impairment charge related to software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system; and $12.6 million of pre-tax expense ($8.0 million after tax expense, or $0.06 per diluted share) associated with impairment charges related to financing arrangements with diamond mining and exploration companies.\nc The income tax effect resulting from the adjustments has been calculated as both current and deferred tax benefit (expense), based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying adjustment. Free Cash Flow\nInternally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary purposes after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a useful supplemental basis for assessing the Company’s operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow:\nYears Ended January 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 932.2 $ 705.7 Less: Capital expenditures (239.3 ) (222.8 ) Free cash flow a $ 692.9 $ 482.9 a Increases in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in 2017 reflected more effective management and timing of payables and reduced payments for income taxes partly offset by increased inventory purchases. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in 2017 and 2016 included voluntary cash contributions of $15.0 million and $120.0 million, respectively, made by the Company to its U.S. pension plan.
