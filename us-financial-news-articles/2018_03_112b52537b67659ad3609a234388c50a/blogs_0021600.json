The trade essentially has Gordon selling two calls at the same strike at the body of the butterfly, and then buying one call at a higher price, and one at a lower price.\nIn this case, Gordon wants to sell two of the April 13 weekly 55-strike calls, and then buy the April 13 weekly 50-strike calls and the April 13 weekly 60-strike calls. The trade costs Gordon about $1.60, which is the maximum amount Gordon can lose if Intel closes below $50 or above $60 on April 15 expiration, based on the format of the trade.\nIn a butterfly spread, a trader would make the maximum reward if the stock closed at the price of the butterfly's body. For Gordon's trade, this means that should Intel close at $55 on April 1, he could make a maximum reward of $335.\nBut since profits begin to trail off as the price gets further away from $55 in either direction, Gordon wants to make sure he has a point at which to get out of the trade.\n\"I want to try and make 25 percent return off that $1.60,\" he said, meaning that he'd get out of the trade as soon as he gets a $2 return on the trade.\nIntel closed at $50.74 on Thursday.\nDisclaimer Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
