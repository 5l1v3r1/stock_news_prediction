Celgene’s wholly owned subsidiary will accept for payment all shares that were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to expiration of the tender offer, and payment for such shares will be made promptly, in accordance with the terms of the tender offer.\nCelgene expects the merger to close in the coming days, with Juno becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. As a consequence of the merger, each outstanding Juno share not tendered and purchased in the offer (other than those as to which holders properly exercise dissenters’ rights and those owned at the commencement of the tender offer by Celgene or its direct and indirect subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive the same $87.00 per share, net to the holder in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, that was offered in the tender offer. Following completion of the merger, Juno’s common stock will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nAbout Celgene\nCelgene Corporation, headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation.
