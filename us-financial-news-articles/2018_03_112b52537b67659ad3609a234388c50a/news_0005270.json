So hopefully this would create a more mature market,” he said.\nICOs raised about $5.5 billion dollars last year, from just $200 million in 2016. The total market capitalization for the more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies that trade on digital asset exchanges has reached nearly half a trillion dollars so far this year.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T20:43:38.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
