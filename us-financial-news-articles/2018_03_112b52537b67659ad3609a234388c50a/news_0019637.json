A further 37 cases were awaiting laboratory test results.\nLast week the World Health Organization said there had been 1,081 suspected cases and 90 deaths reported from 18 of Nigeria’s 36 states. Centres to manage the outbreak had been set up in four states, it said.\nNigeria, which has some 190 million inhabitants, has the biggest economy in Africa.\nThe disease is also endemic in Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Benin, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Togo, according to the WHO.\nAdditional reporting by Camillus Eboh and Kate Kelland in London; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:59:00.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
