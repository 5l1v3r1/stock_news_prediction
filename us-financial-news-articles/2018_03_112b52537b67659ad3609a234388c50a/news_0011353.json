REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Speaking to broadcaster JTBC, An’s aide, Kim Ji-eun, said An had sexually harassed and repeatedly assaulted her.\n“Over the past eight months I have been sexually assaulted four times,” she told broadcaster JTBC.\n“An recently talked to me about the growing sense of the #MeToo movement and it seems to me that he looked nervous and asked me if I was okay, then he said he was sorry,” Kim said, adding that An nevertheless assaulted her again.\nBoth An and Kim were not immediately reachable for comment.\nThe ruling Democratic Party quickly moved to expel An from the party, with party head Choo Mi-ae saying that the alleged acts “should have never happened.”\nA youthful-looking 52-year-old, An became an unexpected challenger to Moon during last year’s presidential primaries, and his strong showing raised speculation that he could emerge as a future leader.\nDespite espousing some conservative leanings in a liberal party, An was seen by many as a down-to-earth, uncomplicated politician, traits that served him well in a nation roiled by the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in 2016.\nSupporters nicknamed An the “EXO of South Chungcheong,” after a popular K-pop band, and his Instagram postings include a soap opera parody photo and a New Year video message featuring his cat.
