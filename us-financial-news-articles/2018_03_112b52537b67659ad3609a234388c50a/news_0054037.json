Twelve-month inflation in Argentina was 25.4 percent in February compared to 25 percent the month before.\nArgentina’s central bank held its benchmark rate at 27.25 percent on Tuesday, saying indicators suggested core inflation would remain high in March.\nIn explaining its fourth consecutive decision to hold the seven-day interbank lending rate steady, the central bank said the pace of hikes in regulated prices for utilities and transportation would slow down after April.\nAranguren added that he would sign a resolution on Wednesday outlining the payment process for the $1.5 billion in subsidies the government owes to oil companies under a natural gas production incentive program, which has been plagued by payment delays.\nThe government will pay in 30 monthly installments beginning in January 2019, fully paying off the debts within two-and-a-half years.\nSeparately, the Energy Ministry announced increases in local ethanol prices on Wednesday. Corn-based ethanol prices will increase 10.5 percent immediately followed by another 7.96 percent increase at the beginning of April. Sugar-based ethanol prices will rise 7.5 percent now and 3.54 percent in April.\nThat means that at the beginning of April, corn-based ethanol will cost 13.16 pesos ($0.6534) per liter while sugar-based ethanol will cost 16.16 pesos per liter. Gasoline in Argentina is required to contain 12 percent ethanol.\n$1 = 20.1400 Argentine pesos Reporting by Walter Bianchi and Luc Cohen Writing by Hugh Bronstein Editing by Bill Trott and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:06:12.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
