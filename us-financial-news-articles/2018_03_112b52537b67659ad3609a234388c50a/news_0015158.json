He finished the game with 12 points as his younger brother Jontay Porter led Mizzou with 20 points.\nThe Tigers went out to a 10-0 lead and were up 12-3 before hitting a scoring drought that would last just over eight minutes. They were 0-of-14 from the field in that stretch and fell behind 19-12 before Porter Jr. got his second basket, a 3-pointer at the 5:35 mark of the period.\nBut Georgia kept working behind a solid defense and the scoring efforts of Maten and Hightower, who finished the half with 14 and 11 points, respectively to give the Bulldogs a 33-24 lead at the break.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:29:15.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
