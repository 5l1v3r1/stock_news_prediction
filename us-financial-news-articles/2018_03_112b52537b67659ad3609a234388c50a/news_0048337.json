Volumes were smaller but with a 20 percent drop in output on the previous year it was to be expected and sales in value were good,” Michel Fruchet, chairman of French foie gras producers group Cifog, told reporters. \nFoie gras sales fell 12.8 percent by volume in supermarkets in 2017, but rose 1 percent by value, Cifog said. Volumes had fallen 9.3 percent and sales value was down 1.9 percent in 2016. \nThe bird flu crises in 2016 and 2017 have forced French foie gras farmers to change production methods at costs the industry has passed in prices to customers. \nInvestments include new equipment such as cleaning tools and extra premises to confine birds when they are most at risk of contracting the virus. \n“In a strained context when we were concerned that the price could deter consumers, it was not the case and we are reassured,” Cifog general secretary Marie-Pierre Pe said. \nFrench duck farmers have received nearly 350 million euros ($432 million) in subsidies to help them cope with the bird flu crisis, with input from France and the European Union. About 3,500 farms benefited from the support overall, Cifog said. \nThe number of ducks produced in France fell to 23 million in 2017 from 29 million in 2016 and 37 million in 2015, Pe said.
