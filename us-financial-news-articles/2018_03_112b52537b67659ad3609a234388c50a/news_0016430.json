Gulen has denied involvement.\nMore than 50,000 people have been jailed and over 150,000 sacked or suspended from the military, schools and the public institutions in a crackdown following the coup attempt.\nCritics say Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the strict measures are required given the security threats it faces.\nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Daren Butler and David Dolan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T10:20:43.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
