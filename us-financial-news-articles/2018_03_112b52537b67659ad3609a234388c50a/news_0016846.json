This could create a scenario in which the global economy starts \"running too hot\" for the central banks — thus prompting them to start hiking interest rates.\n'Inflation scare' Earlier this week, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said raising U.S. interest rates would give the country the best chance to keep pushing the economy forward .\nKaplan forecast three rate hikes by the U.S. central bank this year, a sentiment reflected in financial markets. Markets believe a March rate hike is almost a certainty judging by trading in the fed funds futures market, a key indicator of where investors think the Fed funds rate will move.\nA subsequent hike is expected in June, with a third likely coming in September, according to the CME's FedWatch tracker .\nTing Shen | Xinhua | Getty Images Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve The European Central Bank ( ECB ) kept its interest rates unchanged at a meeting on Thursday, though it also removed a key commitment to increase the \"size and/or duration\" of its massive bond purchasing program. This fueled expectations the central bank may soon normalize monetary policy in the euro area.\nWhen asked whether he thought rising inflation would be the key risk to continued economic strength, Phelps replied that while he thought the frenzied market sell-off last month was triggered by an \"inflation scare,\" it would likely \"cool off\" again this year.\nIn December, Goldman Sachs echoed Phelps' sentiment, saying that while it was \"pro-risk\" in equities this year, the investment bank's top strategists expected time was \"running out for Goldilocks.\"\n— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T16:14:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
