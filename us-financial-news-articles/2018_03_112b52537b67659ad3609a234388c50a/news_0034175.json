Blechman, 87, is a New Yorker magazine cover artist, animated filmmaker and illustrator. His latest book is “Amadeo & Maladeo” (Fantagraphics), a graphic novel fictionalizing the life of Mozart and his imaginary brother. He spoke with Marc Myers.\nI smelled smoke. It was late at night in 1940 and everyone in our Brooklyn home was asleep. I was 10 and ran into my parents’ bedroom to tell them. My father rushed downstairs to see what was going on. The furnace had caught fire. We cleared out quickly.\nThe damage was so great that we were forced to move to an apartment building on Ocean Avenue. My parents never thanked me for saving everyone. They weren’t very complimentary people.\nI hated living in an apartment instead of a home. The neighborhood’s social experience each day was fighting or watching others fight. Fist-fighting was a way of life then. Most took place in vacant lots. I wasn’t especially strong but I was fast.\nMr. Blechman at age 6 in Brooklyn. Photo: R.O. Blechman I never drew as a kid. I did put out my own newspaper, though. Someone had given me a little printing press with rubber type. You set the type and then printed pages by inking the letters.\nAs a kid, I was a showoff. But I was very shy and often sat in back of the class. Yet every now and then I’d step out from the shadows and do something crazy to command attention.\nMy real name was Oscar and my middle name was Robert. I reversed the initials in later years. I hated Oscar. One day, in my aunt’s car, I told her I wanted to change my name. Buddy was popular then. She liked Buddy and encouraged me to use it. Which I did, but I made the mistake of keeping it through college. To this day, I’m still known as Buddy at Oberlin reunions. And I cringe.\nMy father, Samuel, was known as Chick. He was a partner in a 10-story dry-goods store on Lower Broadway. My mother, Mae, was a homemaker and an accomplished pianist. She was a beautiful woman who played popular music and jazz, and had taken lessons with Teddy Wilson.\nMy brother, Burt, was older than me by a few years. I hated him. We fought like cats and dogs. I was the cat. He was a vicious, mean guy with me.\nA self-portrait drawn for The Wall Street Journal. Illustration: R.O. Blechman When I was 11, we moved into Manhattan. World War II had just started, along with gas rationing. The car trip from our new apartment to his store was much shorter. Our home was on Central Park West and 91st Street. We were on the third floor, so we didn’t have a view of the park. But from our living room I became an avid student of street life. The room I shared with my brother overlooked the building’s courtyard. Every so often, an organ-grinder would show up with his monkey and play there. People would shower him with coins.\nIn the next-door apartment was an artist, Maxa Nordau, a beautiful bohemian French woman. She encouraged me to apply to Manhattan’s High School of Music & Art. I guess I wanted to impress her. She helped me with my portfolio, which led to an entrance exam that I passed. This was the start of my art career.\nMy big break came later when I returned to New York from Oberlin. In the bus terminal, someone shouted, “Don’t move.” It was Bob Gill, a former Music & Art classmate. He was there sketching people for Seventeen magazine.\nMr. Blechman provided the storyboard and illustrations for this 1967 Alka-Seltzer TV ad. More House Call\nNew Yorker Illustrator R.O.

One was a book-jacket designer who sent me to an editor at book publisher Henry Holt. The editor wanted holiday-theme stories. A friend suggested I adapt a medieval one about a juggler. So I set to work on a book, drawing the illustrations and writing minimal text in longhand. I brought in “The Juggler of Our Lady.” Holt published it in ’53.\nI brought in “The Juggler of Our Lady.” Holt published it in ’53.\nMy shaky-line drawing style began in the early ’60s, It came naturally, mostly as an expression of who I was.\nToday, my wife, Moisha, and I live in Ancram, N.Y. About 15 years ago we moved into a Victorian home here built in the 1850s on 125 acres. I have a gorgeous studio in a stand-alone structure on the land that we gutted and enlarged. It has its own kitchen and bathroom. Big windows let in lots of light. Other windows are antique stained glass.\nIn the 1960s, Moisha and I were in Paris browsing used-book sellers. I came across “Contes pour Maxa” (“Tales for Maxa”). It’s a series of children’s stories written by Max Nordau in 1929 and illustrated by his daughter, Maxa, my former neighbor. I keep the book in my studio now. The drawings are charming and distinctive. I’m a little intimidated by them. I think I was as much in love with her art as I was with her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T01:12:23.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
