Mogherini said there had been impressive progress on key reforms but more was needed. The EU aims to disburse the first tranche of a new assistance package worth 1 billion euros to Ukraine before the end of the year but the conditions of that aid are yet to be discussed, she said.

The West threw its backing behind Ukraine after the 2013/2014 Maidan protests brought a pro-Western government to power, but since then critics have accused Poroshenko and the government of dragging their feet over reforms. That has given rise to talk of “Ukraine fatigue” to reflect frustration at the slow pace of change. While Mogherini was in Kiev on Monday, the European Union announced the extension for another six months of its sanctions against Russia, imposed over the annexation of Crimea and support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.
