Published 16 Hours Ago Updated 15 Hours Ago Reuters \nAmazon Japan said on Thursday it had been raided by the Japan Fair Trade Commission on suspicion of possible anti-trust violation. \nCiting sources related to the matter, Kyodo news agency said the online retailer is suspected of possibly asking suppliers to shoulder part of the cost incurred from selling their products at a discount on Amazon Japan. \nAmazon Japan said it was cooperating fully with regulators, declining to elaborate. \nAmazon Japan had come under regulatory scrutiny before. In a previous anti-trust probe, the Fair Trade Commission found the firm had required suppliers that sell their products on multiple platforms to list them on Amazon Japan at the same or lower price. \nAmazon Japan agreed to drop the practice and the regulators ended the probe last June. \nThe Japan Fair Trade Commission declined to comment on the case.
