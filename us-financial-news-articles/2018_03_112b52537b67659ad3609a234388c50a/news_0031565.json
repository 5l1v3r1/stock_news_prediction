Management notes that there are a total of 21 gold mines currently on the land. As of today (March 16, 2018), the price of Gold is currently trading at approximately $1,316.50 per Troyoz. That could mean this land has significant value for the Company. According to a study previously done on the property, the Company believes this land could have a value in excess of $1 billion at current gold prices.\nIn addition, the Stefanovic families continue to purchase shares with the stated goal of reaching 90% ownership of the Company’s total outstanding share pool. The effective trading float is further limited by a total of 1.6 billion shares that remain restricted to a price of $1 per share.\nManagement further indicates that the Company has begun to take steps toward an uplisting to a higher exchange. Shareholders can expect further details to be released on this matter in the very near future.\nManagement is also announcing today that it will be using Twitter. The Company will be using Social Media to communicate with its Shareholders and the Investment Community.\nFinally, the Company’s legal team is continuing to work with the OTC Markets Group toward the removal of the Caveat Emptor designation. The necessary paperwork has already been filed and the Company is awaiting further details and a timely resolution to the matter.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nStatements in this press release that are not statement of historical or current fact constitute “forward-looking statements.” Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other unknown factors that could cause the Company’s actual operating results to be materially different from any historical results or from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
