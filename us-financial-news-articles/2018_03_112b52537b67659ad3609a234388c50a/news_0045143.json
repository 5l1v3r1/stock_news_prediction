View Pictures/REX/Shutterstock By Chris Morris 10:36 AM EDT \nParis may have Disneyland , but if you want an authentic French theme park, head down to Bordeaux instead. \nLa Cité du Vin , or “The City of Wine,” may lack thrill rides, but you can still get dizzy. \nOffering 20 themed areas exploring the history and culture of wine, along with workshops and a simulated boat ride, it’s a favorite of oenophiles. €20, or $24,80, covers admission to the park’s permanent tour, a multimedia guide, and one glass of wine at the end of the day (with 20 varieties to choose from). The permanent exhibition invites visitors to discover and experience wine as a universal, living cultural heritage. View Pictures/REX/Shutterstock \nWhile La Cité du Vin falls short of Disney-style attendance numbers, it’s still a fairly popular destination. Last year, it welcomed 445,000 visitors , mostly from France itself. Given that the facility is just two years old and hasn’t made a major marketing push, that’s a respectable number. \nBordeaux, of course, is one of the premiere wine regions in France, but it’s a bit remote. To help increase tourism, France launched two high-speed rail lines to the region last year. France is, after all, the most visited country in the world , with 82.6 million visitors in 2017, according to World Atlas.
