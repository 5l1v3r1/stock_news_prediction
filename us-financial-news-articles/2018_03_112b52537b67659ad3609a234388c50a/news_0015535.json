Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and may include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions, statements regarding plans, objectives, intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results, events, operations, services, product development and potential, and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"intends\", \"estimates\", \"plans\", \"will be\" and similar expressions. Although Sanofi's management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things, risks related to the successful integration of Sanofi and Bioverativ, that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that the expected benefits of the acquisition will not be realized, risks related to future opportunities and plans for the combined company, including uncertainty of the expected financial performance and results of the combined company, and the possibility that, if Sanofi does not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, the market price of Sanofi's shares could decline, as well as other risks related Sanofi's business, including the ability to grow sales and revenues from existing products and to develop, commercialize or market new products, competition, including potential generic competition, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including future clinical data and analysis, regulatory obligations and oversight by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or the EMA, including decisions of such authorities regarding whether and when to approve any drug, device or biological application that may be filed for any product candidates as well as decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of any product candidates, the absence of a guarantee that any product candidates, if approved, will be commercially successful, risks associated with intellectual property, including the ability to protect intellectual property and defend patents, future litigation, the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives, and volatile economic conditions. While the list of factors presented here is representative, no list should be considered a statement of all potential risks, uncertainties or assumptions that could have a material adverse effect on Sanofi's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The foregoing factors should be read in conjunction with the risks and cautionary statements discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi, including those listed under \"Risk Factors\" and \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Sanofi's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2017. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof and, other than as required by applicable law, Sanofi does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements.\nAttachment:\nhttp://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fecde754-7096-48ae-9bae-7e93be59e6c8\nSource:Sanofi", "external_links": ["http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fecde754-7096-48ae-9bae-7e93be59e6c8", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SCIG8bCsKFh-RBGktHcnYCaZzqGa7o3fog1ImlrQ1zb88sjMITRLhtz4uTnlt1OA_OFNXtA7zty1JKTrLw7GSlFd89Wz9SVAIdkr3p1to90ZLcfZdZJQ2ef62CqR9gOYCxMWekOTZLYPhHEMZ-GBgjcBIbowEx66XfzJqdJGzcL1TIzFNmFiU-ixiaWwSKZZ34MpQY8jR5W4NcxCC7DD-VmWTtcS3Aw3r5YlNowT9peW_JAUdf2JUc-81VCsEYcj3Ghh3FT23y5hfGRcRkenxg=="], "published": "2018-03-08T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T18:47:08.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
