(TSX:ECN) (“ECN Capital” or the “Company”), announced today its intention to make a substantial issuer bid pursuant to which the Company will offer to purchase for cancellation up to C$115 million of its outstanding common shares (“ Shares ”) from shareholders for cash (the “ Proposed Bid ”). The Proposed Bid will proceed by way of a modified-Dutch auction within a price range of not less than $3.49 per Share and not more than $3.90 per Share (in increments of $0.05 per share within that range). We intend to fund the Proposed Bid with a combination of cash drawn on the Company’s existing credit facility and available cash on hand. The Company anticipates that the Proposed Bid will commence in early March 2018 and will be scheduled to complete mid-to-late April 2018.\n“ECN remains firmly committed to its M&A strategy and has several “on-target” opportunities it is pursuing. Our capital position is such that following execution of our planned acquisitions, our equity firepower allows us to return capital to shareholders. Today, our Board of Directors has approved the launch of a substantial issuer bid. This decision reflects our solid financial position, strong ongoing earnings and confidence in ECN’s fundamental value. We are proud to be in a position to continue to pursue growth opportunities and, concurrently, return capital to shareholders”, said Steven K. Hudson, ECN’s Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Proposed Bid demonstrates ECN Capital’s confidence in the strength of its business, its strong financial position, and its confidence in ECN Capital’s fundamental value. In the view of management, the recent trading price of the Shares is not fully reflective of the value of the Company's business and future prospects and therefore, the purchase of Shares under the Proposed Bid represents an attractive investment and an equitable and efficient means of providing value to its shareholders. ECN Capital’s management and its Board of Directors have agreed not to tender any Shares to the Proposed Bid.\nThe tender process allows shareholders to individually select the price, within the specified range (and specified increments), at which they are willing to sell their Shares. When the Proposed Bid expires, we will select the lowest purchase price that will allow us to purchase the maximum number of Shares properly tendered to the Proposed Bid, and not properly withdrawn, having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding C$115 million. If Shares with an aggregate purchase price of more than C$115 million are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn, we will purchase the Shares on a pro rata basis except that \"odd lot\" tenders (of holders beneficially owning fewer than 100 Shares) will not be subject to pro-ration.\nECN designates all deemed dividends arising as a result of the repurchase of the Shares pursuant to the Proposed Bid as eligible dividends. Dividends are designated to be eligible dividends pursuant to subsection 89(14) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any applicable provincial legislation pertaining to eligible dividends.\nThe Company anticipates that it will suspend its current normal course issuer bid and automatic securities purchase plan prior to the commencement of the Proposed Bid and that no subsequent purchases will be completed under such normal course issuer bid and automatic securities purchase plan until the Proposed Bid is completed.\nThe terms and conditions of the Proposed Bid have been approved by the Board of Directors of ECN Capital. The Proposed Bid will not be conditional upon any minimum number of shares being tendered and will be subject to various other conditions that are typical for a transaction of this nature. Details of the Proposed Bid, including instructions for tendering Shares, will be included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular and other related documents (the “ Proposed Bid Documents ”), which are expected to be mailed to shareholders, filed with applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities and made available without charge on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website at www.ecncapitalcorp.com , should the Company determine to proceed with the Proposed Bid.\nECN Capital has engaged CIBC Capital Markets as its financial advisor and dealer manager in connection with the Proposed Bid. ECN Capital has also engaged Computershare Trust Company of Canada (“ Computershare ”) to act as depositary.\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Shares. The solicitation and the offer to buy Shares will only be made pursuant to the Proposed Bid Documents. The Board of Directors of ECN Capital has approved the Proposed Bid. However, none of the Company, its Board of Directors, the dealer manager or the depositary makes any recommendation to shareholders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering Shares to the Proposed Bid. Shareholders are strongly urged to read the Proposed Bid Documents carefully and to consult with their financial and tax advisors prior to making any decision with respect to the Proposed Bid.\nAbout ECN Capital Corp.\nWith total owned and managed assets of more than C$5.5 billion, ECN Capital Corp.
