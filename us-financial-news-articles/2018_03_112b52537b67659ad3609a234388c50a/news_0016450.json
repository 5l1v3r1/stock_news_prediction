If convicted, they could be fined at least 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,534).\nThe legislation also mandates the establishment of special courts to expedite trafficking cases, setting a deadline of one year for trial and repatriation.\nGovernment data shows that reports of human trafficking rose by almost 20 percent in 2016 against the previous year, to 8,132 cases.\nIn some cases, victims who were sexually exploited, trapped in bonded labor, or forced into marriage have struggled to survive and feed their families since escaping. They said they feared being trapped back into slave labor.\nMany victims are from poor backgrounds and have little or no literacy, according to Justice and Care, which created the curriculum for the new course.\n“They are most vulnerable to go back to the same vicious circle of sex trade or child labor if they are not given proper means of livelihood,” said the charity’s Joyita Ambett.\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Jared FerriePlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
