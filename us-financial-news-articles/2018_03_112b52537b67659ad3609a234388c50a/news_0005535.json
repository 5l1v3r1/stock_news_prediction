(Nasdaq:CORI), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty transdermal products, today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Corium also intends to grant the initial purchaser of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $20,000,000 aggregate principal amount of notes.\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. is acting as the sole manager for the offering.\nThe notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Corium, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will mature on March 15, 2025 and be convertible, at the option of the holders, into shares of Corium’s common stock. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, initial effective conversion price and other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the note offering.\nCorium intends to use approximately $56 million to repay in full its outstanding borrowings under its term loan agreement with CRG, and the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nThis announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of Corium’s common stock, if any, into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. Any offers of the notes will be made only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nThe notes and any shares of Corium’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nIn February 2018, Corium received feedback via email from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) that the FDA had completed its preliminary review of data submitted before and after Corium’s August 2017 meeting with the FDA and that the results of Corium’s pilot bioequivalence study for Corplex Donepezil may, on their face, suffice as the sole basis for demonstrating bioequivalence between Corplex Donepezil and oral Aricept for the purpose of submitting a New Drug Application (“NDA”). The FDA confirmed that the final acceptability of the results of the pilot study for approval purposes would be determined by the FDA’s review of Corium’s NDA, once submitted. Corium is in the process of evaluating the optimal path forward based on this feedback, taking into consideration that dosing in Corium’s pivotal bioequivalence trial has already been completed. Full review of a data package is required for an NDA review, and there can be no assurance that the FDA would ultimately conclude that the pilot study is sufficient to support bioequivalence or that the FDA would approve an NDA filed on that basis.\nAbout Corium\nCorium International, Inc. is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products that leverage the company's broad experience with advanced transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems.
