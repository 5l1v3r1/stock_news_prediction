The per share public offering price for each class of common stock in the current offering will be $10.99 for Class A shares, $10.56 for Class T shares and $10.06 for Class I shares effective after the close of business on March 15, 2018.\nWhile CNL Healthcare Properties II was not required to conduct a valuation until June 30, 2018, this is the second voluntary valuation conducted by the company. In September 2017, the board of directors approved a NAV of $10.00 per share for all share classes, as of June 30, 2017. This most recent valuation was conducted to align with the recommendation of the Investment Program Association (IPA), a trade association, to estimate the NAV per share as of calendar year-end. CNL Healthcare Properties II expects to update its estimated NAV at least annually.\n“Our second NAV was positively impacted by a number of factors, including the continued strong performance of our seniors housing property and the acquisition of the Mid-America Surgery Center in December,” said Stephen H. Mauldin, chairman, president and CEO of CNL Healthcare Properties II. “The valuation both reflects the high quality of our investments early in the company’s life, as well as the unmatched financial support that our advisor is providing to the company and our shareholders through the waiver or subordination of significant amounts of fees and expenses.”\nThe company engaged CBRE Capital Advisors, Inc. (CBRE Cap), an independent investment banking firm, to conduct the valuation. The valuation committee, comprised exclusively of independent board members, directed and reviewed the valuation process and recommended an estimated NAV per share of $10.06, which is at the midpoint of the range of values provided by CBRE Cap. The recommendation was unanimously approved by the full board of directors. CBRE Cap is not responsible for the estimated value per share approved by the board of directors and did not participate in the determination of the offering prices for each class of shares of the company’s common stock.\nThe estimated NAV is based on the estimated value of the company’s assets minus the estimated value of its liabilities divided by the approximate number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis, calculated as of Dec. 31, 2017. The valuation process was completed in compliance with the company’s valuation policy and certain methodologies promoted by the IPA.\nAbout CNL Healthcare Properties II\nCNL Healthcare Properties II intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ending Dec. 31, 2017, or the first year in which it commences material operations.
