Over the past couple of years, we used our cash flow to solidify our balance sheet and to renew and expand our drybulk fleet. Indeed, since 2016, we grew our drybulk fleet by 37% and reduced its average age by 12%, on a deadweight tons basis. In the process, we established a unique platform in the drybulk sector capable of generating significant cash flow. We will share free cash flow with our unit holders through distributions, which we hope to increase as market opportunity and cash flow permit.”\nDistribution Policy\nNavios Partners announced its board of directors has adopted a distribution policy under which it intends to declare quarterly cash distribution in the amount of $0.02 per unit, or $0.08 annually.
