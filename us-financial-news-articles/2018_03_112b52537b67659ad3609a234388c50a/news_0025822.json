But they resulted from a historic financial crisis, a recession and stimulative spending. Last year's annual fiscal deficit was $666 billion.\nReceipts last month totaled $156 billion, down 9 percent from February 2017, while outlays stood at $371 billion, an increase of 2 percent from the same month a year earlier.\n(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T01:50:33.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
