Barbara Havers—the blunt-spoken co-star of Elizabeth George’s long-running series of police-procedural novels—is used to working with a partner, the high-born yet egalitarian Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley. But in Ms. George’s “The Punishment She Deserves” (Viking, 692 pages, $28) , Havers is sent on special assignment to the rural English town of Ludlow with a different companion: the autocratic Detective Chief Superintendent Isabelle Ardery.\nThe mismatched duo’s assignment is to re-examine the local authorities’ investigation into the suicide of an Anglican deacon while in police custody. The deacon, Ian Druitt, had been locked up after an anonymous accusation of pedophilia. But as Havers talks with residents of Ludlow, she begins to question not only the crimes of which Druitt had been accused but also the explanation given for his death. When her superior urges her to back off, an unsatisfied Havers asks Inspector Lynley back in Scotland Yard: “How many ways is cover-up spelled?”\nOnce Lynley himself is on the case, Havers is free to pursue new leads. The book’s canvas then widens to include a number of conflicted characters: college students thwarted by dysfunctional families; adults crippled by grief, lust or drugs; children endangered by imperious parents. “The Punishment She Deserves” is filled with passages rich with descriptive detail and emotional nuance. Several alternating plot threads unspool at length, all of which weave tightly together with pleasing inevitability. (As Havers observes: “See, it’s turning out that everyone’s connected to everyone else.”) What has been said before deserves repeating: From suspense to social commentary, from violence to pathos, from villainy to possible redemption, Ms. George can do it all, with style.\n“To Die but Once” (Harper, 325 pages, $27.99) , the latest book by Jacqueline Winspear featuring psychologist and investigator Maisie Dobbs, also splits its time between London and rural England—but in 1940, when Britain is at war with Germany amid the naval evacuation of stranded troops at Dunkirk. The country is united in resolve and in worry. “Little island like this,” one citizen says, “we’re sitting ducks.”\nA pub owner who lives near Dobbs is so anxious about the fate of his 15-year-old son that Dobbs agrees to investigate pro bono. The lad is not in combat but apprenticed to a painting firm assigned to refurbish buildings for the Royal Air Force in the countryside, and he has since fallen out of touch with his family. When his battered corpse is found on some railroad tracks, authorities rule “death by misadventure.” Dobbs thinks it’s murder—and she calls upon police and government contacts for information and help. Her greatest asset as a private inquiry agent, though, may be her uncommon, near-psychic empathy. She senses the emotions of those she encounters as if they were her own. To her, an autopsy is not only an opportunity for discovery but “a chance to show compassion for the dead.”\n“To Die but Once” is told on a human scale, as Dobbs works to unearth a scheme of coercion, bribery, black marketeering and government fraud—all of which paint the boy’s death in a more sinister light. The wartime details (sandbags in front of shop fronts, blackout curtains, ambulance-driving classes) transport us with ease to a milieu where danger is omnipresent but—thanks to the presence of steadfast figures like Dobbs and her like-spirited colleagues—so is hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T14:53:51.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
