This will leave the ministry room to set plans and strategies for the development of the Iraqi energy sector,” said Jawahiri.\nThe move has been years in the making and revives a company originally established in the 1960s and merged into the Oil Ministry in 1987.\nKurdish lawmakers voted with the majority to establish the new company, despite ongoing acrimony between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government following a September referendum on Kurdish independence.\nThe central government took charge of half of the oilfields that fell under Iraqi Kurdistan’s control in 2014, including the oil city of Kirkuk, soon after the northern region voted for independence in the referendum which Baghdad opposed.\nKirkuk crude sales have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the oilfields from the Kurds last October.\nIraq’s oil production is currently averaging more than 4.5 million barrels per day.\nReporting by Ahmed Rasheed; writing by Raya Jalabi; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:04:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
