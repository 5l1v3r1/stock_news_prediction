Steel producers and automakers in Asia declined sharply. U.S. President Donald Trump said that the U.S. will impose tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum. The dollar extended losses against the yen after BOJ Governor Kuroda said the central bank would consider exiting easy monetary policy if inflation targets are met. Updated 7 Hours Ago CNBC.com \nAsian stocks closed lower on Friday, with steel producers and automaker names recording steep drops. The fall in regional markets tracked sharp losses on Wall Street following a tariff announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump. \nTrump said on Thursday that the U.S. will impose tariffs of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum. The tariffs will be implemented broadly, without targeting specific countries. \nMarkets stateside fell on the news as investors worried about retaliatory actions from U.S. trade partners that could potentially result in a trade war. In addition, tariffs are also seen as inflationary as they could mean higher prices for consumers. \nJapan's trade minister responded to the news on Friday, saying that Japanese steel exports were not a threat to U.S. national security, Reuters reported, citing local wire service Jiji. Symbol CNBC 100 --- \nCanada, the largest source of U.S. steel imports, indicated it would respond to U.S. tariffs with its own measures . The European Union, meanwhile, said it would \" react firmly and commensurately\" to defend its interests. \n\"Given uncertainty whether the move presages a path of increased tariff application for the U.S., we expect risk sentiment to remain fragile for now,\" Chang Wei Liang, a strategist at Mizuho Bank, said in a note.

Sony lost 1.23 percent and SoftBank Group tumbled 3.55 percent. \nAgainst the safe haven yen , the dollar extended losses after two straight days of declines to trade at 105.88. \nThe greenback's decline against the yen steepened late in Asian trade following comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.

Automakers were also firmly in negative territory, with Hyundai Motor down 3.41 percent. \nAlthough South Korea is among the top three sources of U.S. steel imports , it might not be too badly hurt as steel is predominantly traded within Asia, according to Moody's Investors Service. \n\"The direct impact [of the tariffs] is moderate on Korean steelmakers to low on all the rest of Asia,\" Marie Diron, managing director of Moody's Investors Service, said in a statement. \nDown Under, the S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.74 percent to close at 5,928.9, with gold producers the only sector to finish the day in the green.
