The number of formal workers fell in February to the lowest levels since 2012, IBGE said.\nWith wages adjusted for inflation stagnating, the central bank may struggle to lift inflation back to its targeted range after undershooting it for the first time ever last year.\nEarlier this month, the bank surprised observers by hinting at an additional interest rate cut in May even as the benchmark Selic rate was at an all-time low. Double-digit unemployment, as well as widespread idle capacity at companies, have kept a lid on inflationary hikes.
