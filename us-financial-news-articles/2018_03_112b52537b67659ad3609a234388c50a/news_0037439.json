We realized that consumers had various levels of privacy needs, so to meet those needs, DatChat was developed as a complete messaging platform with ephemeral and privacy features that are always available when you need them,\" stated Myman.\nAbout DatChat\nDatChat was founded three years ago by a team dedicated to creating a personal privacy platform that always provides privacy, control and security.
