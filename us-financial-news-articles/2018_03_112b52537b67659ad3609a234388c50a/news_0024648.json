The Blackhawks snapped a two-game skid.\nZdeno Chara scored for the Bruins, whose six-game winning streak ended.\nA four-minute high-sticking penalty against Chara set the stage for Kane’s go-ahead tally. Kane ripped a wrist shot from the top of the left circle for his team-leading 25th goal of the season.\nSeabrook finished the scoring with 1:05 to go on a slap shot from the right circle.\nBlackhawks goaltender Anton Forsberg made 31 saves to earn his ninth victory. On the opposite end of the rink, Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask turned aside 36 shots in the loss.\nChicago opened the scoring on the power play with 12:34 to play in the first period. Defenseman Erik Gustafsson shuffled a pass to Jonathan Toews at the top of the right circle. Toews unleashed a one-timer that Anisimov redirected from his position in front of the crease.\nThe goal marked Anisimov’s 20th of the season and his sixth in the past 12 games. The 29-year-old has reached the 20-goal mark in each of his first three campaigns with the Blackhawks.\nBoston evened the score with 9:03 remaining in the third period. Chara ripped a slap shot from the high slot for his seventh goal of the season and the 195th of his career.\nBoston played without several of its top playmakers. Veteran forward Brad Marchand was a late scratch because of an upper-body injury. David Backes served the final game of a three-game suspension for an illegal hit. Patrice Bergeron remained out because of a lower-body injury.\nThe Blackhawks played their first game without forward Anthony Duclair, who suffered a right knee injury Saturday and could miss several weeks. Duclair has 23 points (11 goals, 12 assists) in 56 games this season with Chicago and Arizona, which shipped him to the Blackhawks in January.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T13:01:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
