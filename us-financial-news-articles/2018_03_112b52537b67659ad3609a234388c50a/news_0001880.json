The ECB now expects real GDP to hit 2.4 percent in 2018, 1.9 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020.\n\"The outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2019 and remains unchanged for 2020 and 2018,\" Draghi said.\nViraj Patel, forex strategist at ING, told CNBC that Draghi did \"just enough to appease the hawks in the committee.\" \"It's the confirmation that normalization is on track,\" he said.\nEuro higher As a result, the euro rose against the dollar on the more hawkish movement from the central bank, trading at $1.2411 at about 12:55 p.m. GMT (7:55 p.m. ET).\nDraghi said that the ECB is monitoring the exchange rate \"with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook.\"\nBack in January, the ECB said that the exchange rate was a \"source of uncertainty.\"\nThis is because the currency had surged since the start of the year, especially against the dollar.
