It plans to update on the process on March 15.\nThe company is expected to allow one or more bidders to perform due diligence before filing a binding bid.\nLast year, Gorenje, one of Slovenia’s largest exporters, said it was seeking a strategic partner to improve cost efficiency and strengthen the brand.\nJapan’s Panasonic, which had looked at making a takeover bid for Gorenje, decided against the idea in November 2016. It owns almost 11 percent of the company.\n$1 = 0.8082 euros Reporting by Marja Novak; editing by Jason Neely\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:34:14.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
