Beijing has maintained that debt risks are under control and its commitment to deleveraging will not waver. \nThe banking and insurance regulators were merged earlier this month as part of a broader re-organization of government departments. \nThe move to tighten oversight of China’s $42 trillion banking and insurance sectors comes as Beijing reins in riskier lending practices and cuts high corporate debt. \nChina has also cracked down on Chinese conglomerates for their aggressive acquisitions of overseas assets. \nIt has additionally launched a campaign to root out officials engaged in corrupt practices in the financial sector.
