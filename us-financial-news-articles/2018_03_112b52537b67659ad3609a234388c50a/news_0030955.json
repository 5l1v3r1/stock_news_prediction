Over the last four quarters, Kroger has returned more than $2.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends combined.\"\nUnder the repurchase program, Kroger is authorized to repurchase its outstanding common shares from time to time in open market or privately-negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trading plans intended to comply with SEC Rule 10b5-1. The share repurchase program has no expiration date but may be suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.\nThe company expects, subject to board approval, to have an increasing dividend over time.\nKroger's financial strategy is to use its free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining its current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. The company continually balances the use of its cash flow to achieve these goals.\nAt The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR), we are dedicated to our Purpose: to Feed the Human Spirit TM .
