He was responding to a question about the significant decline in the stock market after the administration announced actions against China that sparked fears of a trade war . \nMr. Mnuchin characterized the trade actions, including the threat of U.S. tariffs on goods imported from China, as part of a negotiation between the two countries with the goal of reducing the U.S. trade deficit and easing U.S. companies’ access to Chinese markets. \n“If they open up their markets it is an enormous opportunity for U.S. companies,” he said. “We are having very productive conversations with them.” \n“I am cautiously hopeful we reach an agreement, but if not we are proceeding with these tariffs,” he said, adding “in a negotiation you have to be prepared to take action and that is what President Trump is doing.” \nMr. Mnuchin said the administration’s trade strategy was already bearing fruit, pointing to South Korea. Officials say the U.S. and South Korea are close to amending an existing trade agreement, and last week the U.S. exempted South Korea and other countries from steel and aluminum tariffs Mr. Trump had threatened to impose on them. \nMr. Mnuchin said that he expected to sign a new agreement with South Korea “soon” and that it includes “a quota so South Korea will reduce the amount of steel that they send into the United States.” \nWrite to Ryan Tracy at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T22:16:40.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
