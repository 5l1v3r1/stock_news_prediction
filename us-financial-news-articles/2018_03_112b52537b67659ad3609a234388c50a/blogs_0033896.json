Just show up to participating Dairy Queen or DQ Grill & Chill locations outside of malls to accept the offer.\nAs a bonus, Dairy Queen will also be collecting donations for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, so you can put the money you’d normally spend on a cone towards a good cause. Dairy Queen says it raised $300,000 for local hospitals during last year’s Free Cone Day on the first day of spring.\nI am #FreeConeDay . Coming to your DQ this Tuesday, March 20th. Start your summer vacation on the first day of spring with one free small vanilla cone. pic.twitter.com/Oh9JOx6ajs\n— Dairy Queen (@DairyQueen) March 14, 2018\nRita’s Italian Ice\nAnother opportunity for free frozen treats on the first day of spring comes from Rita’s Italian Ice. On March 20, head over to the chain for a free cup of Italian ice — or water ice, as some people call it — if you’re into a more fruity dessert.\nOf course, you can always redeem offers both at Rita’s and Dairy Queen if you’ve got the time — and stomach — for it. Rita’s first day of spring tradition is even more storied than its ice cream competitor — this will be Rita’s 26th year in a row giving out free cups for the occasion. Additionally, three lucky customers who come up with the best reason to “ditch their daily responsibilities” on March 2 0and grab a Rita’s cup instead will win a free trip to Miami.\nFirehouse Subs On March 16, Firehouse Subs started offering a free upgrade from a standard sandwich platter to deluxe. Customers save $10 with the deal, which runs through April 2. It’s not a first day of spring deal, per se, but a start of spring season, if you will.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T12:00:10.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
