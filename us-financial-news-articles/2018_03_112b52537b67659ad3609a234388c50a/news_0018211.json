He is also a former congressman, federal prosecutors said in a separate statement.\nNetto is accused of accepting bribes in connection with the contract to build the dam. In a statement, his attorneys denied any wrongdoing. The values received by Netto were fees for consultancy services, they said, referring to the bribery claims.\nIllegal payments were also allegedly made by the construction firms to political parties, including the Workers’ Party and President Michel Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement party, prosecutors said.\nNorte Energia did not have an immediate comment.\nThe Workers’ Party said the prosecutor’s accusations were baseless and politically motivated in an election year. The Brazilian Democratic Movement party denied receiving bribes from the Norte Energia consortium.\nThe investigation said that the companies responsible for building Belo Monte were “expected to pay bribes to political parties and their representatives equal to 1 percent of the value of the contract.”\nThe Belo Monte dam on the Xingu River in the north of Brazil will have installed capacity of 11,233 megawatts when all generating units are turned on, according to Norte Energia’s website.\nThat would be enough to supply electricity to 60 million people, it said.\nReporting by Pedro Fonseca, Writing by Ana Mano, Editing by Angus MacSwan and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:30:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
