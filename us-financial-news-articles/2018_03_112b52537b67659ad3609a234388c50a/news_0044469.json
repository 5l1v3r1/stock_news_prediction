Digital currency ethereum is up more than 800 percent over the past 12 months, according to Coinbase data.\nBitmain dominates the \"bitcoin\" industry with its specialized ASIC chips that are more efficient at mining than graphic chips from AMD and Nvidia. Bernstein has said Bitmain likely made as much as Nvidia did last year. Analysts estimate that most of Bitmain's revenue is generated by selling mining rigs powered by the company's chips.\nRolland believes Bitmain's specialized chip offering for ethereum will hurt demand for PC graphics cards. He estimated ethereum mining-related sales accounted for about 20 percent of AMD's sales and 10 percent of Nvidia's revenue.\nAs a result the analyst lowered his price target for AMD shares to $7.50 from $13, representing 29 percent downside from Friday's close.\nHe also reduced his forecast for Nvidia shares to $200 from $215, but did not downgrade the company.\n\"Nvidia has a stronger and more durable gaming franchise which would help it work through this potential Ethereum-related unwind,\" he wrote.\nThe analyst reiterated his neutral rating for Nvidia shares.\nAMD and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAMD shares declined 3.3 percent Monday, while Nvidia's stock rose 2 percent.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T16:51:28.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
