The trade group argued that it was unconstitutional for the Thruway Authority to use the toll revenue for anything other than maintaining toll roads. \nATA and the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, which represented the state Thruway Authority, could not immediately be reached for comment. \nATA originally sought an order blocking the Thruway Authority from using toll revenue for canals, and money damages for revenue it had already used. \nIn 2016, control of the canals were transferred from the Thruway Authority to the state’s Power Authority, making the request for a court order moot. However, ATA continued to seek damages. \nMcMahon handed a victory to ATA in August 2016, ruling that the use of toll revenue for canals was unconstitutional. However, the Thruway Authority then filed a new motion to dismiss the case, citing the 1991 federal law for the first time. \nIn her order granting that motion, McMahon called it “unfortunate” that the Thruway Authority had not made it earlier, saying that New York taxpayers had paid for “thousands of hours of unnecessary legal work.” \nNonetheless, she said the agency was right and dismissed the case. \nATA appealed, asking the 2nd Circuit to revive the case, but the panel on Thursday upheld McMahon’s interpretation of the law. \nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T19:43:03.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
