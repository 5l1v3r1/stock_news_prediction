We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer,” Trump tweeted early on Thursday.\nReuters reported late on Wednesday that several top U.S. steel and aluminum executives had been invited to the White House on Thursday for what could be a major trade announcement.\nTrump has vowed to take steps to crack down on imports of steel and aluminum and has been considering imposing hefty tariffs on imports of the metals from China and other countries.
