By contrast, only 18 percent of victims aged 70 or older reported losing money. \nThe dollar value associated with the fraud complaints were much higher for those aged 70 and older, however. Those in their 20s reported a median loss of $400. That's compared to $621 for those in their 70s and $1,092 for those 80 and up. \nIn all, the data collected by the federal watchdog group includes 2.7 million complaints, down slightly from total complaints in 2016. Dollar losses reported from fraud, however, increased $63 million from last year to almost $905 million. \n\"While we received fewer overall complaints in 2017, consumers reported losing more money to fraud than they did the year before,\" acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Tom Pahl said in a statement published with the data. \"This underscores the importance of the FTC's work in educating consumers and cracking down on the scammers who try to take their money.\" sturti | Getty Images Financial schemes and scams were most frequently reported to have stemmed from a phone call. The most popular scams \nPhony debt collections, identity theft and impostor scams, in which someone pretends to be a trusted person such as a government worker, a tech support agent or a family member in an emergency, were the schemes most frequently reported. \nImpostor scams proved notably widespread and dangerous: One out of every five people who reported a complaint was caught up in one, and those who were fooled lost a median of $500 each. \nStill, as successful as these scams are, others are even more lucrative. Travel, vacation and timeshare-plan schemes topped the list of fraud categories that accounted for the highest median loss, at $1,710 each. \nMortgage foreclosure relief and debt management scams also cost people a lot of money, with an associated median loss of $1,200 each. Business and job opportunity schemes rounded out the top three with a $1,063 median loss. \nContact by telephone was the method of communication reported in 70 percent of fraud cases recorded by the FTC. Wire transfers continued to be the most-frequently reported method of payment in fraud cases, accounting for $333 million in losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:25:51.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
