In addition, we are raising the lower end of our annual revenue guidance range due to the increased certainty we have regarding our operations as we approach our fourth fiscal quarter. Investors are reminded that the recent Tax Reform legislation is expected to add approximately $100 million to net income, which was incorporated in our previous guidance issued on January 31, 2018 and is also reflected in the current guidance. The table below summarizes our FY18 expectations and represents our views as of March 18, 2018.\n(In millions except for tax rate and earnings per share)\nCurrent Fiscal Year\n2018 Guidance\nPrevious Fiscal Year\n2018 Guidance\nRevenue $4,400 - $4,500 $4,350 - $4,500 Net income $285 - $291 $277 - $283 Effective corporate tax rate -3.4% -3.4% Diluted earnings per share $11.26 - $11.50 $10.95 - $11.19 Diluted weighted average shares 25.3 25.3 CACI provides information solutions and services in support of national security missions and government transformation for Intelligence, Defense, and Federal Civilian customers.
