Rugby Union - European Champions Cup - Ospreys vs Saracens - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - January 13, 2018 Ospreys' Dan Biggar celebrates after kicking a penalty Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers Biggar will resume his partnership with scrumhalf Gareth Davies having sat out the 38-14 victory over Italy in the previous fixture. They will form part of backline that also includes Hadleigh Parkes and Scott Williams as the centre-pairing, and Liam Williams, George North and Leigh Halfpenny forming an all British & Irish Lions back-three. There had been some suggestion in the build-up that Gareth Anscombe would continue in the number 10 jersey, but coach Warren Gatland has gone for the greater experience of Biggar. “There have been some tough selection calls, but that is exactly what we want, we want to be in a position where there are selections and decisions to be made and we have had to make some tough ones this weekend,” Gatland, whose side are second in the standings, said in statement on Thursday. There was also much change in the pack as lock and captain Alun Wyn Jones returns to the side, along with prop Rob Evans, hooker Ken Owens and flank Josh Navidi. “Saturday is a huge opportunity for us to finish the campaign well, at home in front of our fans,” Gatland said. “France will be coming to Cardiff in good spirits after their victory over England last weekend so it is set to be a huge encounter. “We have picked a team and a squad we believe can deliver this weekend against France.” There will be an additional incentive for the victory on Saturday as Wales seek to finish runners-up to champions Ireland. Finishing second will secure them 3.3 million pounds ($4.60 million) in prize money. But defeat could drop them to fifth, with a reduced reward of 1.3 million pounds. A loss, coupled with wins for England over Ireland and Scotland over Italy, could lead to Wales potentially losing out on 2 million pounds.
