It plans to sell the package across its line, GMC said.\nAmong other things, it includes a 2-inch factory-installed suspension lift, s tandard four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case, locking rear differential and skid plates, o ff-road-tuned shock absorbers, a few different wheel and tire options, and a s tandard 5.3 liter V-8 engine.\nGMC is typically known for selling trucks that share much of their DNA with Chevrolet, but offer high-end trims and other features. Chevrolet released an off-road-ready version of its mid-size Colorado pickup called the ZR2 in 2017.\nFord has also been ramping up its selection of more rugged vehicles with a planned Ford Bronco, and a still-unnamed smaller off-road SUV.\nWATCH: Here's why people are lining up to spend $100,000 on this SUV show chapters Hereâ€™s why people are lining up to spend $100,000 on this SUV 6:33 PM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 03:18", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T06:51:44.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
