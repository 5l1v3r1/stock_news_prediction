After his departure, the bank brought in new management to address a 1.9 billion pound funding shortfall.\n$1 = 0.7221 pounds Reporting by Emma Rumney, writing by Sinead Cruise, editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:50:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
