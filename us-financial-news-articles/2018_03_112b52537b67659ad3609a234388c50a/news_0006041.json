Revenue from the ready-mixed concrete segment increased $13.4 million, or 4.6%, driven by volume and pricing increases both organically and from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. The Company's ready-mixed concrete sales volume was 2.3 million cubic yards for the quarter, up 3.3% year-over-year. Ready-mixed concrete average sales price per cubic yard increased $1.71, or 1.3%, to $133.96 compared to $132.25 in the prior year fourth quarter.

The resulting operating margin was (0.1)% compared to 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, our consolidated Adjusted Gross Profit decreased $9.4 million to $61.5 million, with an Adjusted Gross Margin of 18.0% compared to 22.2% in the prior year fourth quarter.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Aggregate products Adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter increased $1.6 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Total Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss attributable to U.S. Concrete was $3.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $15.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Sandbrook, President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of U.S. Concrete, stated, \"We completed another exciting and opportunistic year, reaching new highs in volumes, revenue and profit driven by solid growth both organically and through acquisitions. For the full year 2017, total revenue of $1.3 billion increased 14.4% from the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA increased 20.3% to $192.3 million. We continue to capitalize on opportunities that leverage our market strength and operational efficiencies as evidenced by our sixth straight year of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We are particularly proud of our performance in light of significant weather headwinds in every quarter of 2017 within our various regions. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our ready-mixed concrete segment achieved year-over-year volume and average sales price growth of 3.3% and 1.3%, respectively. Our leadership position in our markets enabled us to achieve our 27th straight quarter of year-over-year ready-mixed concrete price increases to $133.96 per cubic yard. We also continue to improve average selling prices for our aggregate products, achieving a 9.2% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2017.\"\nMr. Sandbrook concluded, \"We are very pleased that we continue to drive superior execution of our strategy and achieve high levels of operational excellence. The underlying demand trends in all of our major markets continue to be positive. Overall, the economic fundamentals across our markets are very positive and with the recently passed tax reform and pre-cursor to a potential infrastructure bill, we remain optimistic about the overall economy and construction industry. Our ready-mixed concrete backlog and existing acquisition pipeline continue to provide excellent opportunities for continued growth.\"\nBALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.6 million compared to $23.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter.

Acquisition-related professional fees consists of fees and expenses for accountants, lawyers and other professionals incurred during the negotiation and closing of strategic acquisitions and does not include fees or expenses associated with post-closing integration of strategic acquisitions. We define Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the amount determined by dividing Total Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We have included Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin herein because they are widely used by investors for valuation and comparing our financial performance with the performance of other building material companies. We also use Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Total Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay our income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds actually available for capital expenditures. In addition, our presentation of Total Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures other companies report. Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP.
