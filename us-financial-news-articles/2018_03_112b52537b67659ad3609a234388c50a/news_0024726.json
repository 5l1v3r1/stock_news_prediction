We’ll take it.”\nThe marker was the 17th in 18 games for the 33-year-old Staal, who is challenging for the NHL goal-scoring lead with 37, three behind leader Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals.\nThe score was tied 1-1 after the first period and the Wild led 3-2 after 40 minutes before counting two more goals in the game’s final minute.\nZach Parise, Matt Cullen, Charlie Coyle and Marcus Foligno also scored for the Wild as Minnesota earned its third straight win and improved to 8-2-1 in its past 11 games.\nCoyle scored into an empty net in the final minute as Vancouver goaltender Anders Nilsson was pulled for an extra attacker. After Coyle scored, Foligno put home a shot with Nilsson back in net. Cullen and Coyle each recorded an assist as well.\nMichael Del Zotto and Jussi Jokinen, with his second goal in two games, replied for the Canucks, who suffered their second straight loss and finished 1-2-2 on their five-game home stand.\nMinnesota netminder Devan Dubnyk saved 30 of 32 shots en route to his 30th win of the season. Nilsson finished with 28 saves on 32 shots.\nThe Canucks were looking for a better effort from themselves after being embarrassed 2-1 on Wednesday by the lowly Arizona Coyotes in a game that was much more one-sided than the score indicated.\nDel Zotto put the Canucks on the scoreboard first — only 53 seconds into the game — as he picked up his own rebound off the end boards and put in a wraparound.\nBut Parise drew the Wild even less than two minutes later on a shot from a sharp angle. The goal extended Parise’s scoring streak to six games.\nThe Canucks thought they had taken the lead with 3:24 left in the first period, but a video review showed that Sam Gagner directed the puck in with his skate.\nCullen gave the Wild a 2-1 advantage at 2:46 of the second period as he beat Nilsson on a forehand-to-backhand deke during a rush. Jokinen created a 2-2 tie just over five minutes later as he put in Erik Gudbranson’s rebound, setting the stage for Staal’s heroics.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:17:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
