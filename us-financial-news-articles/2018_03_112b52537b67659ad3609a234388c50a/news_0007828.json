Several other former Insys employees, including sales representatives, and medical practitioners, have also faced criminal charges.\nFollowing Kapoor’s arrest in October, Insys said it expected to pay at least $150 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department. No deal has been announced.\nMotahari said he had no update on the timing of a settlement, though he was “cautiously optimistic” the company was moving in the right direction.\n“We are committed to resolving our outstanding legal issues and look forward to putting those issues behind us as we are radically transforming this company,” he said.\nNet revenue included $30.7 million from Subsys and $800,000 from Syndros, a liquid dronabinol that Insys launched in mid-2017 to treat anorexia in people with AIDS who have lost weight, and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.\n“While I’m not satisfied with our short-term results with either product, there remain opportunities to do better as we move forward,” Motahari said.\nHe said Insys was focused on developing products in the pipeline and was also exploring licensing Subsys and Syndros to companies in Europe and South America.\nReporting by Nate Raymond and Anuron Kumar Mitra; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Richard Chang\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T08:49:02.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
