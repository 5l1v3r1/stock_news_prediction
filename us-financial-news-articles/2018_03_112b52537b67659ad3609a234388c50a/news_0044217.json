We knew that we had a strong race pace, better than qualifying,” said Alonso, who has not had a podium since his final year at Ferrari in 2014.\n“We capitalized on some of the problems that the others had today and we had an attack from Verstappen on the last 20 laps and we were able to defend. I’m happy, it was great work by the team.\n“Definitely it’s going to be better and better,” added the 36-year-old, who finished a place ahead of Verstappen and one behind Red Bull’s Australian Daniel Ricciardo.\n“I think there is a lot of potential in the car still to be unlocked.\n“It’s the first race with this combination, McLaren and Renault power unit, so a lot more to come and hopefully from Bahrain we see another step forward and Red Bull will be the next target.”\nBahrain is the next race on the calendar on April 8.\nEditing by Alan Baldwin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:15:34.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
