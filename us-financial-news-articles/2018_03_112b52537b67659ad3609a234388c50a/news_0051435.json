Simon Property Group ( SPG.N ) fell 1.9 percent, Macerich Co. ( MAC.N ) slid 4.0 percent, Kimco Realty ( KIM.N ) slipped 0.42 percent and GGP tumbled 5.3 percent.\n(GRAPHIC: Mall REITs v. overall real estate sector - reut.rs/2DZHUGd )\nThe best malls, called Class A by real estate brokers, have easily filled the vacancies left by the wave of bankruptcies in the retail industry and most have waiting lists for potential tenants, Brown said.\nThat is not the case for Class B and C properties, whose vacancies mar the outlook for better properties.\n“This is only likely to worsen as we begin to see more bankruptcies this year, and I believe the trend will peak late 2018 or early 2019,” he said.\nGGP’s stock fell because the offer is not a great price, said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia.\n“You end up with this security that’s externally managed, that’s invested in Brookfield funds and that has this diversified portfolio of all these different assets, Crowe said.\nThere’s a lack of institutional capital that is willing to take on the changing retail environment, he said, but the fall in the stock price could encourage others to bid for GGP.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Daniel Bases and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://reut.rs/2DZHUGd", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T05:28:37.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
