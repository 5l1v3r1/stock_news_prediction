The agency imposed record fines on companies that failed to follow safety rules.\nFrom 2014 through 2016, U.S. auto safety recalls set annual records of almost 50 million or more annually. In the prior 20 years, annual U.S. auto recalls ranged from 10.2 million to 30.8 million.\nUnder aggressive enforcement by the Obama administration, automakers issued a record 924 recall campaigns in 2016, up 7 percent over the previous high in 2015. In 2017, total recall campaigns fell to 813.\nU.S. traffic deaths jumped 5.6 percent in 2016 to a decade-high of 37,461. They were up 0.1 percent in the first nine months of 2017, according to preliminary NHTSA data.\nSince President Donald Trump took office, NHTSA has not imposed any new vehicle safety fines. The agency remains without a permanent head more than 13 months after Trump took office and Democrats have urged him to nominate a candidate.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Susan Thomas\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T01:04:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
