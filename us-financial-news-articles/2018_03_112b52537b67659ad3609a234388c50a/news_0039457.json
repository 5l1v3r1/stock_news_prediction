Joseph Wolk, currently the vice president of investor relations, is slated to take over the post in July, before Mr. Caruso’s departure.\nHe came to J&J in 1999 through the acquisition of biotech company Centocor Inc. and rose to the CFO role in 2007, according to company filings.\nDuring Mr. Caruso’s tenure, J&J completed three of its largest acquisitions. These included the $30 billion purchase of rare-disease drugmaker Actelion LTD, the $21.3 billion transaction for orthopedic device-maker Synthes, Inc., and the $16.6 billion deal for Pfizer Consumer Healthcare.\n“Dominic made a big impact inside our company, and he is well-respected throughout our industry. ” said CEO Alex Gorsky in a statement. A call seeking further comment wasn’t immediately returned.\nMr. Wolk also has been with J&J for 19 years, according to the company’s announcement. He has served on the finance leadership team since 2014, reporting to Mr. Caruso. He previously was CFO of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of J&J.\nThe New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&J is one of the largest U.S. health-products companies by revenue and a bellwether for the health-care sector. The company’s 2017 sales rose 6.3% to $76.5 billion, while net earnings totaled $1.3 billion.\n—Tatyana Shumsky contributed to this article.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T03:59:03.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
