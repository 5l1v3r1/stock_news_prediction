Its partners are Austria’s OMV with 20 percent and Norway’s Statoil and Germany’s Wintershall [WINT.UL] with 15 percent each.\nLundin’s shares were up 0.63 percent at 0808 GMT, slightly outperforming a European oil and index up 0.25 percent.\nReporting by Gwladys Fouche, editing by Joachim Dagenborg and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:16:15.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
