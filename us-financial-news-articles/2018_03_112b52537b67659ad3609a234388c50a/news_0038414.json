REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Earlier this month, Kroger joined other U.S. retailers such as Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc ( DKS.N ) to bar sale of firearms to buyers under 21, following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school. Fred Meyer said it was working on plans to phase out sales of firearms and ammunition. The firearm business generated about $7 million annually, the company said, also highlighting “softening consumer demand”. The company operates 133 stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and sells firearms in 43 of them.
