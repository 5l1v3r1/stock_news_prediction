Robinhood also makes money on interest held in client cash accounts as well as by selling client trades to market makers.\nAs of last year, the median age of Robinhood’s users was around 30, meaning they are less likely to have ample cash in spare accounts to spend compared with older clients at big brokerages. The company is banking that the younger investors’ assets will grow over time, and that it will be able to sell them additional services. Robinhood has sought to keep costs low by shunning marketing and reducing overhead.\nInvestors also see opportunity in Robinhood’s recent introduction of trading in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, according to a person familiar with the investment. Those trades are also commission-free.\nAt about $5.6 billion, Robinhood is already valued at a third of E*Trade Financial Corp. , which has a market capitalization of $15 billion. For investors in this latest round to earn a solid return on their investment they will be betting that Robinhood can approach that valuation.\nRobinhood was founded in 2012 by two 20-something Stanford University math graduates, Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. Now in their 30s, the founders have said they were inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011 to make financial services accessible to everyone regardless of income .\nWrite to Rolfe Winkler at rolfe.winkler@wsj.com and Douglas MacMillan at douglas.macmillan@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:33:57.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
