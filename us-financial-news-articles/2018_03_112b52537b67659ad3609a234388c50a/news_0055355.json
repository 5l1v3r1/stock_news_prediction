Democrats hold a majority in both bodies. \nSix other states - California, Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington - already have laws on the books to legalize medical aid in dying for terminally ill patients, terminology preferred by advocates to the phrase “physician-assisted suicide.” \nThe District of Columbia also has enacted such a statute. \nSupporters have sought to widen legalization of the practice as a way to help end-stage cancer and other patients with incurable diseases to die with less pain and suffering. \nOpponents have included some religious groups and some advocates for the elderly and disabled who have argued that unscrupulous caregivers or relatives could pressure vulnerable patients to take their own lives. \nOregon was the first to legalize physician-assisted suicide with a statute that took effect in 1998. Since then, some 200 end-of-life prescriptions have been written a year and about two-thirds of them being used, according to Aubrey Hawk, a spokeswoman for Compassion and Choices.
