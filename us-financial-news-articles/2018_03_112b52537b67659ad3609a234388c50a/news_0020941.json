A severe winter has disrupted rail lines in recent quarters, delaying deliveries of sand from the U.S. Mid West and Canada.\nNo.3 U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and sand miner Fairmount Santrol Holdings have said they expect rail delays of sand deliveries to affect their quarterly results.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:28:37.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
