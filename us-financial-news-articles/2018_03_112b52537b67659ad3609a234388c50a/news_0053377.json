No outstanding cash borrowings under $125 million revolving credit facility. Issued $500 million of 7.875% unsecured senior notes due 2025. Tax Receivable Agreement liability was reduced by $105.6 million as a result of the recent tax reform legislation.\nALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Five Point Holdings, LLC (“Five Point” or \"the Company\") (NYSE:FPH), an owner and developer of mixed-use master-planned communities in California, today reported fourth quarter 2017 financial results.\n“2017 was a transformational year for Five Point in which we became a public company with sufficient liquidity to fund the company’s land development needs while also making significant progress at our communities,” said Emile Haddad, Chairman and CEO of Five Point. “The combination of vibrant job growth and limited housing supply in our core markets bodes well for our land portfolio heading into 2018. Buyer demand at the Great Park Neighborhoods in Irvine remains strong and we continue to move forward with our development program at Newhall Ranch in Los Angeles County. In San Francisco, our design and development program for residential, retail, and commercial uses continues to be refined with a focus on the Candlestick portion of the community. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet while pursuing our twin goals of investing in long-term land assets that can generate substantial free cash flow while developing a commercial portfolio of income producing properties.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Consolidated Results\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $848.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and no cash borrowings under our operating company’s $125 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Total capital of Five Point was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, reflecting $3.0 billion in assets and $1.1 billion in liabilities.\nIn November 2017, the Operating Company issued $500.0 million of 7.875% unsecured senior notes due 2025 in a private placement. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include funding development activities at our communities.\nResults of operations\nRevenues. Revenues were $22.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily generated from the sale of remnant parcels in Sacramento and Los Angeles County in addition to management services revenue and collection of various builder fees attributable to previous land sales. There were no land sales at Newhall Ranch or The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Park during the fourth quarter 2017.\nOther income. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized $105.6 million of other income resulting from an adjustment to reduce the payable pursuant to our tax receivable agreement, primarily as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017's reduction in the corporate tax rate.\nEquity in loss from unconsolidated entities. Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The loss was primarily due to our proportionate share of the Great Park Venture's net loss during the quarter of $77.4 million. After adjusting for amortization and accretion of the basis difference, our equity in loss from our 37.5% percentage interest in the Great Park Venture was $12.0 million. Equity in earnings from our 75% interest in the Gateway Commercial Venture was $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nSelling, general, and administrative. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $29.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and were largely comprised of employee related costs, including $4.5 million in share based compensation expense.\nNet income (loss). Consolidated net income for the quarter was $81.9 million primarily due to the adjustment to the payable associated with the tax receivable agreement. The net loss attributable to Non-Controlling Interests totaled $13.4 million. As a result, net income attributable to the company was $95.3 million.\nSegment Results\nNewhall Segment – We are continuing land development activities and expect to start deliveries in Mission Village in late 2019. Mission Village is approved for up to 4,055 homesites and approximately 1.6 million square feet of commercial development. Although we entered into a settlement with key national and state environmental and Native American organizations in September 2017, we are still involved in related lawsuits with two local environmental groups that did not join the settlement regarding the approvals and permits that have been issued for development areas within Newhall Ranch.\nTotal revenues were $15.8 million for the fourth quarter 2017. In October 2017, we sold the remaining 153 residential homesites on approximately 24 acres at our property in Sacramento, California for gross proceeds of $7.2 million. Additional land sale revenues in the period represent recognition of deferred revenue, and collection of various builder fees related to prior period land sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $5.7 million for the fourth quarter.\nSan Francisco Segment – We are continuing our land development activities at Candlestick and Hunter’s Point. We are working with the City of San Francisco to increase the total amount of commercial square footage entitlement at Shipyard/Candlestick by over 2 million square feet. We currently expect to receive approval for the increased entitlement in 2018.\nTotal revenues were $1.9 million for the fourth quarter 2017. Revenues during the quarter are mostly attributable to fees generated from our management agreements in which we provide certain management services to ventures in which Lennar is an investor. There were no land sales at The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $7.5 million for the fourth quarter.\nGreat Park Segment – As of December 31, 2017, based on reports we receive from third party homebuilders, the percentage of homes sold in Parasol Park, the only active development area within the Great Park Neighborhoods was 78%. As of March 2018, Parasol Park is now more than 90% sold out, and the Great Park Venture opened a new development area in early March where we previously delivered 1,007 homesites to eight builders.\nTotal segment revenues were $19.8 million for the fourth quarter 2017, partially resulting from the recognition of deferred land sale revenues from prior period land sales in addition to the collection of builder marketing fees that were also recognized. The Great Park segment's net loss for the quarter was $75.9 million, mostly attributable to the Great Park Venture’s recognition and accrual of incentive compensation management fee expense for services provided by the Great Park Venture’s managers.\nWe do not consolidate the financial results of the Great Park Venture but instead account for our 37.5% percentage interest using the equity method. After taking into account the investment basis difference adjustment, the Company’s investment in the Great Park Venture decreased by $12.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nCommercial Segment – For the three months ended December 31, 2017, our commercial segment recognized $6.3 million in revenues from the triple net lease with Broadcom and our property management services. Expenses were mostly comprised of depreciation, amortization and interest expense totaling $4.5 million. Our segment net income was $0.6 million and our share of equity in income from the Gateway Commercial Venture totaled $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nCorporate Developments\nOn March 21, 2018, we appointed Lynn Jochim, formerly our Executive Vice President, and Kofi Bonner, formerly our Regional President-Northern California, to be our Co-Chief Operating Officers, and we appointed Greg McWilliams, formerly our Regional President-Southern California, to be our Chief Policy Officer.\nConference Call Information\nIn conjunction with this release, Five Point will host a conference call today, Thursday, March 29, 2018 at 5:00 pm Eastern Time.
