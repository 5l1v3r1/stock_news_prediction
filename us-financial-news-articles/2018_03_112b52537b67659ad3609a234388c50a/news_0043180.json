They were housed at a club facility on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, where the older player coerced them into sex acts.\nIndependiente on Monday declined to comment on the widening of the investigation.\nIndependiente is one of Argentina’s most successful soccer teams, having won the Copa Libertadores, South America’s equivalent of Europe’s Champions League, a record seven times.\nWriting Andrew Downie; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T01:54:36.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
