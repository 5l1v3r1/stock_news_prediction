For comparability of reporting, management considers this information in conjunction with GAAP amounts in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following tables provide a reconciliation of the EBITDA, EBITDA Adjusted, and Net Income Adjusted; presented for both the Consolidated financials as well as Attributable to U.S. Geothermal only (consolidated less minority interest).\nEBITDA is calculated as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. EBITDA is presented as a metric commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company’s ability to service and/or incur debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA reflects EBITDA adjusted to exclude discretionary exploration costs, non-cash stock compensation as well as the value assigned to stock options granted, and write-off of discontinued exploration activities and other large non-recurring items.\nNet Income, As Adjusted reflects Net Income before Tax and other large non-recurring items and is provided to support year over comparisons. The Company recognized a Deferred Tax Asset starting in 2015, and though tax amounts are now reflected in our Financials as required by GAAP, any current tax obligation is offset by a reduction in the recognized Deferred Tax Asset.\nConsolidated Summary of Financial Results Three Months and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions) Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Net Income (loss) $0.15 $2.52 $(0.45) $3.59 Interest $1.19 $1.21 $4.76 $4.43 Income Tax Expense $2.01 $0.88 $1.86 $0.58 Depreciation & Amortization $1.58 $1.63 $6.48 $6.38 EBITDA $4.93 $6.24 $12.65 $14.98 Exploration costs, Stock based comp. $0.09 $0.19 $0.81 $1.09 Non-recurring Expenses $0.06 $0.00 $1.50 $0.99 Adjusted EBITDA $5.08 $6.43 $14.96 $17.06\nNet Income, As Adjusted (Consolidated) (in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Net Income (loss) $0.15 $2.52 $(0.45) $3.59 Income Tax Expense $2.01 $0.88 $1.86 $0.58 Non-recurring Expenses $0.06 $0.00 $1.50 $0.99 Net income, As Adjusted $2.22 $3.40 $2.91 $5.16\nATTRIBUTABLE TO U.S. GEOTHERMAL (Consolidated less Minority Interests): Summary of Financial Results (Attributable to U.S. Geothermal) (in millions) Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Net Income (loss) $(0.26) $0.95 $(2.27) $0.46 Interest $1.04 $1.05 $4.14 $3.78 Income Tax Expense $2.01 $0.88 $1.86 $0.58 Depreciation & Amortization $0.79 $0.81 $3.25 $3.26 EBITDA $3.58 $3.69 $6.98 $8.08 Exploration costs, Stock based comp. $0.09 $0.19 $0.81 $1.09 Non-recurring Expenses $0.06 $0.00 $1.50 $0.99 Adjusted EBITDA $3.73 $3.88 $9.29 $10.16\nNet Income, Attributable to U.S. Geothermal As Adjusted (in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Three Months Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDec. 31, 2016 Net Income (loss) Attributable to U.S. Geothermal $(0.26) $0.95 $(2.27) $0.46 Income Tax Expense $2.01 $0.88 $1.86 $0.58 Non-recurring Expenses $0.06 $0.00 $1.50 $0.99 Net Income (loss) Attributable to U.S. Geothermal, As Adjusted\n$1.81 $1.83 $1.09 $2.03\nSource:U.S. Geothermal, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a08577bf-165e-4891-bf83-13b97e3bb8d7", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0ki3d07lG4sKKV1PDtqJ0vYemeLvg1DWj4MJSrmmuyCz090EtiKeQglkUceQAFevegVtd4y5k8n4aY-8zC8WW6JnrIMHY8VteSIOjq5TA10=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7KjokcnFEN1NgZC-9ahdJHUWuuGQySXF8qkm1srrf3IzKS5yuvFNbQEXtmvSrhNqPUtpExTUZQTLbrYiWJM4dpsc9Ck8BPgG9FFsQRGUkzE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=QovCxPQ5ZIpXuRTKRlVWk6xhkrDg7bk28P2czSeCkgWXqqY8No1i1qoX_Qzr-RP9X0mYvGTwGaDPOYL2uxOCkw=="], "published": "2018-03-09T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T03:25:27.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
