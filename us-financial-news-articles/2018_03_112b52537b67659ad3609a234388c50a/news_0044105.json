They were followed by Brazil, at $651 billion, and China, at $400 billion.\nLocal market instruments turned over $2.747 trillion, a 14.4 percent decrease from the $3.209 trillion in 2016.\nMexican debt instruments were the most frequently traded last year in local markets at $500 billion, EMTA said. Brazil, India, South Africa and China were also highly traded locally.\nThe survey includes debt instruments from over 90 emerging market countries as reported by 45 banks, asset managers and hedge funds, EMTA said.
