(OTCQB:OMTK) today reported results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 – highlighted by a strategic focus on ramping up foreign sales, following the completion or near-completion of multi-year natural gas engine development programs in several key countries.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $260,004 compared with $361,152 a year earlier, primarily due to the timing of foreign sales from development phases to large scale production in foreign markets. For the same period, the company reported a net loss of $485,818, or $0.02 per share, compared with $193,800, or $0.01 per share, a year ago, primarily due to a non-cash inventory reserve adjustment of $305,458. The inventory reserve adjustment represents a non-cash charge for slow-moving inventory and is recorded as a separate line item component of total cost of goods sold.\nGross margin for the quarter includes the non-cash inventory reserve adjustment noted above, resulting in a negative gross margin of $188,379 compared with positive gross margin of $106,539 a year earlier.\nRevenues for the full year were $1.1 million compared with $1.3 million in 2016, primarily due to decreased diesel-to-natural gas engine conversion kit sales and the timing of development program completions noted above. For the full year, the company reported a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per share, compared with a net loss of $901,392, or $0.04 per share, a year earlier – primarily reflecting an increase in the non-cash charge for the inventory reserve adjustment noted above.\nGross margin for the full year includes the non-cash inventory reserve adjustment noted above, resulting in a gross margin of $169,062 compared with gross margin of $532,101 a year earlier. Adjusted gross margin as percentage of sales was 44 percent compared with 48 percent a year earlier, excluding the previously noted non-cash inventory reserve adjustment.\nResults for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflect non-cash expenses, including the value of options and warrants granted in the amount of $131,522, depreciation and amortization of $24,586 and inventory reserve adjustment of $305,458. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, non-cash expenses and income included the value of options and warrants granted for $174,242, depreciation and amortization of $27,593 and inventory reserve adjustment of $93,635.\n“During the past year, we have seen a dramatic shift from domestic to international demand for engine conversions -- primarily due to oil prices remaining relatively low, though we still expect the domestic market to regain momentum. At this point, air pollution regulations and the price disparity between diesel and natural gas in foreign markets, mostly as a result of higher taxes on diesel fuel, are providing meaningful development programs for Omnitek outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia, and we expect a transformative year for the company as sales begin ramping up in these markets,” said Werner Funk, president and chief executive officer of Omnitek Engineering Corp.\nFunk noted the 200-nation “Paris Agreement on Climate Change” remains an important catalyst for alternative solutions to diesel fuel, with natural gas particularly appealing in both foreign and domestic markets -- especially since the fine-particles (PM2.5) and black carbon emissions from diesel engines and potent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are abated when using natural gas.\nAt December 31, 2017, current liabilities totaled $1.2 million and current assets totaled $1.6 million, resulting in positive working capital of approximately $455,000 and a current ratio of 1.4 to 1.\nAbout Omnitek Engineering Corp.\nOmnitek Engineering Corp. develops and sells proprietary diesel-to-natural gas conversion systems and complementary products, including new natural gas engines that utilize the company’s technology -- providing global customers with innovative alternative energy and emissions control solutions that are sustainable and affordable.\nSome of the statements contained in this news release discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other \"forward-looking\" information.
