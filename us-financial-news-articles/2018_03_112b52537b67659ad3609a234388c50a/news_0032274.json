(\"Acadia\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ACHC) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired Acadia securities between February 23, 2017 and October 24, 2017 (the \"Class Period\"), including in connection with an August 22, 2017 public offering (the \"Offering\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/achc .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities Exchange Act of 1933.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the class period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse information to investors. The complaint specifically alleges that the Company: (1) falsely stated that the quality of its U.K. operations gave it a \"competitive strength,\" which would drive future growth and profitability; and (2) issued false and misleading guidance about its actual and projected 2017 revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and earnings per share (\"EPS\").\nOn October 24, 2017, Acadia revealed its financial results for the third quarter of 2017. The Company suffered a drastic shortfall in EBITDA for its U.K. facilities, supposedly due to a \"lower census and higher operating costs,\" and lowered its financial guidance for 2017, which included lowering its EPS guidance by as much as $0.24 per share. Following these announcements, Acadia stock dropped 26% to a close at $32.68 per share on October 25, 2017.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
