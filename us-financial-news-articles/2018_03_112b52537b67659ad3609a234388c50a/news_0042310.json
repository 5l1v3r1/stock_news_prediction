Advertising Week Europe is over for another year. The central themes this time around? Facebook’s troubles, the forthcoming European General Data Protection Regulation, diversity and transparency. Digiday rounds up what execs were talking about in and around London’s Picturehouse Central.\nOn the Pull Major marketers have been quiet on the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica hubbub so far. But this week, two brands said they were pulling ad spend from the platform. Germany’s second-largest bank, Commerzbank, said Thursday that it is suspending Facebook ads , the company’s head of brand, Uwe Hellmann, told business newspaper Handelsblatt. He added that “brand safety and data security are very important to us.” Meanwhile, one brand’s crisis is another brand’s PR opportunity: Mozilla, owner of the Firefox browser and a big proponent of web privacy, said Wednesday that it’s also pressing pause on Facebook advertising . I’d wager it’s not one of the social network’s biggest advertisers. The Mozilla Foundation spent $47 million in total on “branding and advertising” in 2016, according to its latest annual report. As for the latest over at 1 Hacker Way, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview with WSJ that the company’s investigation into outsiders’ handling of user information will help identify and deter bad actors but won’t be able to uncover where all the data eventually ended up .\nGoogDPR One of the big questions surrounding GDPR is exactly how ad tech vendors that don’t have first-party relationships with consumers are going to get their consent to continue using their data for ad-targeting purposes. Google does have a first-party relationship with its consumers on products like Gmail and search, but most consumers probably aren’t aware of its ad tech brands such as DoubleClick and AdSense. As I reported for WSJ, Google is set to update its ad policies in the coming days, asking the third-party websites and apps that use Google’s ad tech to be responsible for obtaining consent . GDPR nerds might find it interesting that Google is seeking to be the “co-controller” of publishers’ user data, a distinct definition from a “processor” in the legislation. Separately, Google also plans to offer publishers a way to serve nonpersonalized ads to users who don’t consent to their data being used for ad targeting.\nThe Flat of the Land “Team Detroit,” WPP’s dedicated agency for Ford; “We Are Unlimited,” Omnicom’s dedicated agency for McDonald’s; “Publicis Emil” for Mercedes-Benz—holding companies are no strangers to creating bespoke agencies for their biggest clients. Health-care giant Johnson & Johnson now has three : WPP’s “Neighborhood” and Omnicom’s “Velocity” on the creative side and a dedicated media agency at Interpublic Group. The creation of the two creative agency groups, which also includes some of the holding companies’ PR agencies, is the result of a monthslong review, which had a goal of creating a “flatter” and inevitably cheaper model, CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports. People familiar with the matter say the company was looking to generate savings of around 30% by better integrating its agencies, preventing different groups doing overlapping work and creating new production models. But while WPP and Omnicom may now have fewer people billing hours on the account, they should make up some of that revenue through the added business J&J is consolidating with the pair. It’s another example of how the old agency model—where clients worked with a sprawling web of specialist agencies—is being shaken up.\nBills, Bills, Bills CMO Today’s Benjamin Mullin reports : Journalists wailed in January when The Awl Network announced it was shutting down two of its most-beloved brands: The Hairpin, a website aimed at women, and The Awl, a quirky site devoted to reporting, essays and internet ephemera. But two of the sites, Splitsider and the Billfold, have managed to hang around like an evergreen blog post. New York Media announced Thursday that it plans to acquire Splitsider , a comedy website, and roll it into Vulture, its home for all things pop culture. Meanwhile, personal finance site the Billfold has gone independent, setting up a Patreon page and using the proceeds to pay its network of freelance staffers. The site now rakes in roughly $2,000 a month through contributions. Editor Nicole Dieker, who is the site’s only full-time employee, says the Billfold also relies on a mix of sponsored content and Google ads to help pay the bills. Total revenue for February was $3,730, enough to run the site on a judicious budget. And, since it’s the Billfold, budgeting isn’t really a problem.\nBest of the rest The Justice Department, which is seeking to block AT&T’s $85 billion bid to buy Time Warner, argued in court Thursday that the merger could mean at least $400 million in pay-TV price increases because AT&T, which owns the DirecTV satellite service, would have newfound marketplace leverage if it folds in Time Warner’s stable of programming, including the Turner networks and HBO. AT&T and Time Warner lawyer Daniel Petrocelli called the government’s claims “preposterous” and “dead wrong,” saying the case was simple because the Justice Department couldn’t offer proof that the deal would lessen competition.
