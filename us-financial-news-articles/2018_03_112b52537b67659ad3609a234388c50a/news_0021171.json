The Cougars are projected as a top-six seed and have a chance to enhance their resume Saturday, when they face No. 11 Wichita State in an AAC tournament semifinal showdown. The Shockers and Cougars split their two meetings in the regular season, with each team winning on their own floor.\nB.J. Taylor finished with 20 points for UCF, and Ceasar DeJesus added 10 points.\nThe Cougars took command midway through the first half. Davis hit a jumper, and Breaon Brady followed with a three-point play to give Houston a 26-15 lead with nine minutes to go before halftime. Armoni Brooks hit two 3-pointers in the final two minutes of the half, sending the Cougars into the locker room with a 40-27 lead.\nUCF (19-13) exceeded expectations this season under coach Johnny Dawkins and would seem like a candidate for the NIT. The Knights rank third in the nation in points allowed, despite losing 7-foot-6 center Tacko Fall to injury late in the year and being without Taylor for two months. Taylor, the team’s leading-scorer, injured his ankle in the season-opener and didn’t return until mid-January.\nThe Knights couldn’t hold down hot-shooting Houston, though. The Cougars shot 54.7 percent from the floor and outrebounded UCF 35-27. Houston’s 84 points were the most given up by the Knights all season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:00:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
