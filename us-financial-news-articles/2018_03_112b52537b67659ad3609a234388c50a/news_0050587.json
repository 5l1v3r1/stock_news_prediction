President Moon Jae-in has proposed a 4 trillion won ($3.73 billion) supplementary budget and increased business subsidies to boost jobs for the youth.\nGeneral Motor’s shutdown of one of its plants in South Korea is likely to be a headwind for the local economy, the BOK added, with hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake depending on the loss-making carmaker’s management decisions.\nThe U.S. automaker said on Tuesday the due diligence in South Korea is “going smoothly” and that the revised trade deal between the two countries would “help ease investment risks”.\nSeoul and Washington agreed earlier this week to revise an existing trade pact, with U.S. automakers winning improved market access and Korean steelmakers avoiding hefty tariffs.
