REUTERS/Darren Staples/File Photo Factories churned out 145,475 vehicles last month, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).\n“Another month of double-digit decline in production for the UK is of considerable concern, but we hope that the degree of certainty provided by last week’s Brexit transition agreement will help stimulate business and consumer confidence over the coming months,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.\nLondon and Brussels agreed a deal which will see Britain retain free and unfettered trade with the European Union until at least the end of 2020 - 21 months after it formally leaves the EU - although trading arrangements after that date are subject to future talks.\nThe SMMT has called on Prime Minister Theresa May to secure a long-term agreement that maintains Britain’s competitiveness, since several investment decisions loom in the next 12 months.\nPeugeot ( PEUP.PA ) will decide whether to keep open its Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant with new model investment, while Britain’s biggest automaker Jaguar Land Rover ( TAMO.NS ) is due to choose whether to build electric cars in its home market.\nReporting by Costas Pitas; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T03:19:10.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
