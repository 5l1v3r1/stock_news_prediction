Chandrababu Naidu, who is also the southern party’s president, told reporters on Wednesday night.\n“As the next step, we will take a decision on whether to continue with NDA or not. It’s a crucial time. We have to stand, we have to fight, we have to get it done.”\nThe NDA, or National Democratic Alliance, is led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). A BJP spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe TDP’s best known face in the capital, New Delhi, is Federal Civil Aviation Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, whose resignation could be a blow to Modi’s goals of boosting domestic aviation and selling money-losing national carrier Air India.\nRaju’s TDP colleague, Y.S. Chowdary, is the junior minister for science and technology and earth sciences.\nBoth ministers are expected to issue statements in parliament on Thursday before submitting their resignations, said a government source in Andhra Pradesh, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to talk to media.\nFederal authorities formerly gave “special category” status chiefly to hilly states, whose rugged terrain made it difficult for them to compete with other states in attracting investments.
