REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo “It is important that we have found common ground for the key milestones with the intent to approve the acquisition of Monsanto in the nearest future,” Bayer said. The German company last month filed a lawsuit in a Russian court against FAS after it made any approval conditional on Bayer sharing plant breeding technologies in Russia among other remedies, while extending the review of the deal. An arbitration court in Moscow on Wednesday postponed the preliminary hearing of Bayer’s lawsuit until April 11 at the German company’s request, Russian news agencies reported.
