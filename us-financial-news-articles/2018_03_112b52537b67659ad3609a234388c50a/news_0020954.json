The city cut PM2.5 concentrations by 10.8 percent last year.\nTangshan plans to invest more than 100 billion yuan ($15.80 billion) this year on projects to “upgrade” its economy.\nHowever, Wang Litong, mayor of Handan, a heavily polluted steel hub and the only city in Hebei to see PM2.5 rise in 2017, was not called upon to speak at the meeting.\nForeign media were not allowed to ask questions at the event, or given access to question officials. State-owned media agencies were allowed to ask questions and officials read their answers from prepared statements.\n$1 = 6.3290 yuan Reporting by David Stanway and Muyu Xu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T17:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:34:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
