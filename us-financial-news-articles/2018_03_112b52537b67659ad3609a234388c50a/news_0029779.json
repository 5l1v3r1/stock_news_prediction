In a statement prepared for a parliamentary hearing, Governor Lee Ju-yeol said a successful meeting between Trump and Kim would be credit positive for South Korea’s sovereign rating, and reduce capital outflow risks. A successful summit could also strengthen the won in currency markets, although Lee said it was too early to discuss the exact impact on the economy. Lee is scheduled to attend a parliamentary confirmation hearing on March 21 before he starts his second term in April. Lee was reappointed by President Moon Jae-in to lead the BOK for another four years. U.S. President Donald Trump has agreed to meet North Korea’s Kim by the end of May. South Korean President Moon Jae-in also plans to hold a summit with Kim by the end of April.
