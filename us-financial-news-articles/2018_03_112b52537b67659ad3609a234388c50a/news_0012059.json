The United States is by far the largest market in North America.\nThe main truck makers in the U.S. market are Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), Navistar International Corp ( NAV.N ), Paccar Inc ( PCAR.O ) and Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ).\nReporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T21:27:25.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
