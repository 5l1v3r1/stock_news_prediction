Recovery factors are still low, so right now (there is) no additional impact,” Perez said.\nEcuador’s 110,000-barrel-per-day Esmeraldas oil refinery is operating at top capacity, he said, and will undergo maintenance shutdowns this month for 15 days and again in May for 54 days. He did not specify the shutdown dates.\nPerez also said the country’s coming auction of oil and gas blocks will be launched on March 13, and about 40 companies have signed up to bid on minor fields recently included in the offer.\n“Expectations are high,” he said.\nReporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T11:04:53.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
