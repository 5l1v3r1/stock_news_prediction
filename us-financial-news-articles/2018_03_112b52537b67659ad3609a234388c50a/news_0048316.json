Under the new policy, ENSERVCO will announce approximate revenue results soon after the end of each quarter. That announcement will be followed several weeks later by the customary news release and conference call detailing final quarterly and/or year-end results.\n“ENSERVCO weathered the oil and gas industry downturn and delivered strong revenue growth in 2017 as activity levels picked up in all our major basins and revenue in all core service areas grew by double digits,” said Ian Dickinson, President and CEO. “That momentum has continued and we are off to a strong start in the first quarter of 2018, when we expect total revenue to exceed $20.0 million compared to $13.8 million in the first quarter last year and $14.1 million the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We continue to achieve growth in all core service areas, including frac water heating, hot oiling, acidizing and our new water transfer business, where growth is accelerating,” Dickinson added. “In the second quarter, we expect to significantly reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit as part of our longer-term strategy to de-lever our business and free up cash flows to pursue additional accretive business opportunities. We look forward to updating investors on final first quarter results in early May.”\nAbout ENSERVCO\nThrough its various operating subsidiaries, ENSERVCO provides a wide range of oilfield services, including hot oiling, acidizing, frac water heating, water transfer, and water hauling. The Company has a broad geographic footprint covering seven major domestic oil and gas basins and serves customers in Colorado, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Wyoming and West Virginia.
