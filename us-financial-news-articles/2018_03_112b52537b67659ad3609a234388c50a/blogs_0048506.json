REUTERS/Amir Cohen Netanyahu’s personal physician believes the 68-year-old leader has not fully recovered from an illness two weeks ago and therefore decided he should undergo further tests at the hospital, spokesman David Baker said. \nNetanyahu fell ill in mid-March and cancelled his public schedule for five consecutive days. \n\nSlideshow (3 Images) “The prime minister did not complete the time required in order to recover from the illness he had two weeks ago and therefore the symptoms have gotten worse,” Baker said in a text message. \nNetanyahu’s illness has come at a stressful time for the four-times right-wing prime minister, who is under police investigation for corruption in three different cases. \nOn Monday Netanyahu, his wife and son were questioned by police as part of an investigation into one of the corruption cases in which the prime minister is a suspect. \nReporting by Maayan Lubell; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T23:00:54.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
