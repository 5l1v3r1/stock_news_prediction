(\"MULE\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: MULE) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Salesforce.com, Inc. (\"CRM\") (NYSE: CRM). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will be entitled to receive $36.00 in cash and 0.0711 of a share of CRM for each share of MULE they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether MULE's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the Company recently announced positive financial results. In February, MULE reported a remarkable 60% year-over-year increase in total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. On that same day, MULE also announced total revenue of $296.5 million in fiscal year 2017, representing an impressive 58% annual increase when compared to the figures reported in the previous year. Moreover, Greg Schott, MULE's Chairman and CEO, further highlighted the Company's financial success when he stated that MULE anticipated reaching $1 billion total revenue as early as 2021.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether MULE's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own MULE shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.
