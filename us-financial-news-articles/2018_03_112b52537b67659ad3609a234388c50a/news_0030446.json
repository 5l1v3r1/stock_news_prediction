PETERSBURG, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today Jabil Inc. (NYSE: JBL), reported preliminary, unaudited financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2018, including second quarter net revenue of $5.3 billion. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, U.S. GAAP (as defined below) operating income was $129.5 million and U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.21.\nSecond Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 Highlights:\nDiversified Manufacturing Services (DMS) revenue growth: 38 percent Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) revenue growth: 7 percent Core operating income (Non-GAAP): $178.6 million Core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP): $0.66\n“I’m pleased with the results of our second quarter, which was characterized by strong revenue growth, core operating income expansion and healthy cash flow generation,” said CEO Mark Mondello. “Additionally, we invested in several key new programs, returned approximately $150 million to shareholders via our capital return program and successfully renewed 10-year senior notes at a more favorable rate. These activities, both operational and strategic, position us well as we remain focused on diversifying our earnings and cash flows,” he added.\nThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 Guidance:\n• Net revenue $4.75 billion to $5.05 billion • U.S. GAAP operating income $85 million to $135 million • U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.12 to $0.38 per diluted share • Core operating income (Non-GAAP) $125 million to $165 million • Core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) $0.35 to $0.55 per diluted share • Diversified Manufacturing Services Increase revenue 10 percent year-on-year • Electronics Manufacturing Services Increase revenue 8 percent year-on-year • Total company Increase revenue 9 percent year-on-year “Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal 2018, we expect the broad-based growth across both of our segments to continue as we approach $21 billion in revenue for the year. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering $1 billion in operating cash flows and core earnings per share of approximately $2.60 for the year,” added Mondello.\n(U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 are currently estimated to include $0.06 per share for amortization of intangibles, $0.08 per share for stock-based compensation expense and related charges and $0.09 to $0.03 per share for restructuring and related charges.)\n( Definitions: “U.S. GAAP” means U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Jabil defines core operating income as U.S. GAAP operating income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges and business interruption and impairment charges, net. Jabil defines core earnings as U.S. GAAP net income before amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition costs and certain purchase accounting adjustments, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, impairment on securities, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations and certain other expenses, net of tax and certain deferred tax valuation allowance charges. Jabil defines core diluted earnings per share as core earnings divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted shares as determined under U.S. GAAP. Jabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core diluted and basic earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and diluted earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. See the accompanying reconciliation of Jabil’s core operating income to its U.S. GAAP operating income, its calculation of core earnings and core diluted earnings per share to its U.S. GAAP net income and U.S. GAAP earnings per share and additional information in the supplemental information.)\nForward Looking Statements: This news release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding our anticipated financial results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2018; our guidance for future financial performance in our third quarter of fiscal year 2018 (including, net revenue, total company and segment revenue, U.S. GAAP operating income, U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share, core operating income (Non-GAAP), and core diluted earnings per share (Non-GAAP) results and the components thereof, in each case for our third quarter of fiscal year 2018) and full year 2018 (net revenue, operating cash flows and core earnings per share (Non-GAAP)). The statements in this press release are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to our current expectations. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our determination as we finalize our financial results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2018 that our financial results and conditions differ from our current preliminary unaudited numbers set forth herein; unexpected, adverse seasonal impacts on demand; performance in the markets in which we operate; changes in macroeconomic conditions; the occurrence of, success and expected financial results from, product ramps; our ability to maintain and improve costs, quality and delivery for our customers; whether our restructuring activities and the realignment of our capacity will adversely affect our cost structure, ability to service customers and labor relations; reliance on a limited number of suppliers for critical components; changes in technology; competition; anticipated growth for us and our industry that may not occur; managing rapid growth; managing rapid declines in customer demand and other related customer challenges that may occur; our ability to successfully consummate acquisitions and divestitures; managing the integration of businesses we acquire; risks associated with international sales and operations; retaining key personnel; our dependence on a limited number of large customers; and adverse changes in political conditions, in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, adverse changes in tax laws and rates and our ability to estimate and manage their impact. Additional factors that could cause such differences can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 and our other filings We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\nSupplemental Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures in this release to facilitate evaluation of Jabil’s core operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Management believes these “core” financial measures are useful measures that facilitate evaluation of the past and future performance of Jabil’s ongoing operations on a comparable basis.\nJabil reports core operating income, core earnings and core diluted and basic earnings per share to provide investors an additional method for assessing operating income, earnings and earnings per share from what it believes are its core manufacturing operations. Among other uses, management uses non-GAAP financial measures to make operating decisions, assess business performance and as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation. The Company determines the tax effect of the items excluded from core earnings and core basic and diluted earnings per share based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable tax rate of the jurisdiction in which the pre-tax items were incurred, and for which realization of the resulting tax benefit, if any, is expected. In certain jurisdictions where the Company does not expect to realize a tax benefit (due to existing tax incentives or a history of operating losses or other factors resulting in a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets), a reduced or 0% tax rate is applied. Detailed definitions of certain of the core financial measures are included above under “Definitions” and a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures is included in the Supplemental Data at the end of this release.\nCompany Conference Call Information: Jabil will hold a conference call to discuss its second quarter results today at 4:30 p.m. ET live on the Internet at www.jabil.com .
