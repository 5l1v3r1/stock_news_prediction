Moscow's apparent courting of anti-establishment and populist parties in Europe has not gone unnoticed. In December, an article by former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Michael Carpenter, former deputy assistant secretary of defense, claimed that Russia was actively assisting Lega and M5S in a bid to influence elections in Europe.\nIn an article in Foreign Affairs, Biden claimed that the U.S. had evidence of Russian involvement and support for M5S and Lega in a constitutional referendum in Italy, which led to the resignation of then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Biden also claimed that the parties would receive more support , in the form of Russia amplifying their political messages on social media, leading up to the March 4 election.\nM5S leader Luigi Di Maio rebuffed the claims, with Italian media reporting him as saying they were \"unacceptable\" and \"fake news without proof.\"\nLega leader Matteo Salvini also discounted Biden's claims. \"Renzi lost the referendum and will lose the election because Italians have good sense — not because Putin wants that,\" he said in December, ANSA news agency reported.\nshow chapters Be prepared for long and complex negotiations in Italy, academic says 9 Hours Ago | 04:36 Salvini added, however, that \"a good relationship with Russia is strategic for Italy and for Italian businesses\" and called sanctions against Moscow a \"madness\" that Lega would remove.\nIn December, the Kremlin denied any financial support for either party, with a deputy for the ruling United Russia saying Moscow was on the same wavelength as Lega and M5S in terms of viewpoint, but had not given either any money .\nSanctions On Monday, Lega's Fontana criticized ongoing sanctions that were imposed on Russia for its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, as well as its role in a pro-Russian uprising in the east of the country in 2014, saying they hurt trade between Russia and Italy.\n\"Due to geopolitical issues that have nothing to do with Italy, there have been sanctions imposed (on Russia) that have actually hurt the Italian economy and certainly brought poverty to our people. We want to abolish the sanctions on Russia and we want to collaborate with them in order to abolish radical Islam. Therefore, we are keen to have closer ties with Russia,\" he said.\nWhile M5S gained the largest share of the vote of any single party in Italy, with 32.6 percent, the center-right coalition to which Lega belongs, along with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, gained 37 percent.\nNeither party nor coalition gained enough of the vote that would enable them to govern alone and negotiations will have to take place in order to form a government.\nAs Lega was the most popular party of the center-right coalition, it is expected to have the most prominent role in negotiations and any potential center-right government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T15:07:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
