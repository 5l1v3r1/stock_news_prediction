For example, it imposes anti-money laundering requirements on intermediaries providing virtual currency services.\n“We are assessing if additional regulations are required in the area of investor protection,” Ong Chong Tee, deputy managing director (Financial Supervision), Monetary Authority of Singapore said.\nOther countries like South Korea, where trading in cryptocurrencies is more popular, are looking at ways to regulate that activity.\nReporting by Aradhana Aravindan and John Geddie Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T11:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:20:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
