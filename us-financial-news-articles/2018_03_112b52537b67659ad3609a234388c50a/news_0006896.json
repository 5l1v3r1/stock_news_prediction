Hirscher, who won gold in the giant slalom and combined events at the Olympics, secured the crystal globe with 620 points to Kristoffersen’s 495 and Pinturault’s 329 after seven of the season’s eight races. It was his fifth title in giant slalom, the 15th in total, and came the day after his 29th birthday. On the 10th anniversary of his first World Cup podium at the same venue, he was 1.66 seconds faster than Kristoffersen over the two runs and 2.51 better than Pinturault.

He is the best racer.” Slideshow (2 Images) The Austrian is set to win an unprecedented seventh straight overall World Cup crown. He has 1,394 points to Kristoffersen’s 1,125 and 716 for Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal. Pinturault is fourth on 687.
