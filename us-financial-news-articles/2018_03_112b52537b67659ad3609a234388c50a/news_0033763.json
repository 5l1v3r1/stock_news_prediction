Ltd. (NASDAQ: CWCO), a leading developer and operator of seawater desalination plants, reported financial and operating results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\nPresident and CEO Rick McTaggart commented: \"2017 was a year of continued progress for us. We extended several water supply contracts, benefitted from a considerable improvement in our manufacturing operations and made substantial headway on our Rosarito project.\"\n\"Gross profit increased for the year, thanks to improved results from our Bulk and Manufacturing operations, which more than offset slight year-on-year declines in our Retail and Services segments. We also continued to expend funds in 2017 to develop the Rosarito project. These expenses amounted to $3 million and will no longer be required once we close on the project and commence construction.\"\n\"We continued to generate healthy cash flows from operations and gained greater visibility on long-term cash flows over the course of the year. These factors, together with our expectation that development funding commitments for the Rosarito project will end in the near future, were contributing factors to our Board of Directors' decision to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.085 per share from $0.075 per share.\"\n2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenues for 2017 were $62.3 million, an increase of $4.4 million from the $57.9 million reported for the full year 2016. Gross profit amounted to $25.4 million, up 4.9% from $24.3 million last year. Inclusive of $3 million Rosarito-related expense, net income attributable to Consolidated Water stockholders was $6.1 million, or $0.41 per fully diluted share, an increase of 55.1% from the $4.0 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share, earned in 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $13.6 million, a 74% increase when compared to last year's $7.8 million. Capital expenditures were $4.6 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $47.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nSegment Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nRetail\nBulk\nServices\nManufacturing\nRevenues\n$23,225,066\n$31,621,756\n$469,347\n$6,990,496\nCost of revenues\n$10,372,199\n$21,066,207\n$469,797\n$4,963,962\nGross profit\n$12,852,867\n$10,555,549\n($450)\n$2,026,534\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nRetail\nBulk\nServices\nManufacturing\nRevenues\n$23,505,619\n$29,647,034\n$835,770\n$3,887,284\nCost of revenues\n$10,294,298\n$19,488,550\n$751,139\n$3,090,834\nGross profit\n$13,211,321\n$10,158,484\n$84,631\n$796,450\nSummary and Outlook\n\"We ended 2017 in a strong financial position, reflecting the steady operating performance of our core water operations and year-on-year improvement in our manufacturing segment. The equity partnership agreement that we completed in early March of this year with SUEZ, a global leader in water treatment, and Greenfield, an affiliate of a leading U.S. asset management firm, represents a critical milestone in the development of our Rosarito project. This enterprise will encompass one of the largest desalination plants in the Western Hemisphere, providing needed water to a water stressed region of North America. With capacity of up to 100 million gallons per day upon completion of Phase 2, Rosarito is a transformative project for our company as its capacity will be greater than that of our existing portfolio,\" Mr. McTaggart concluded.\nAnnual General Meeting of Shareholders\nThe Company announced that it has set Tuesday, May 22, 2018 as the date of its annual meeting of shareholders to be held at 10:00 am, local time, at The Westin Grand Cayman Seven Mile Beach Resort & Spa in Grand Cayman.
