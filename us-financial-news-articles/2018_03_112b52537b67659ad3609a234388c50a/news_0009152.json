Moore brings a strong track record of securing market adoption for new technologies and ramping up product certification. Moore will replace current Chair Geoff Mulligan, who has led the organization since its inception in 2015.\n“Donna was identified amongst a strong field of potential candidates to lead the Board and LoRa Alliance operations to fulfill our vision, and we look forward to working with her,” said Bertrand Waels, Board Member of the LoRa Alliance and Head of Radio Access Alternative Technologies at Orange. “We have achieved great success as an Alliance with rapid growth. Moving forward, the LoRa Alliance will be highly focused on wider technology adoption and increasing the volume of certified devices to make LoRaWAN one of the most globally-adopted low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) technologies. Donna’s expertise and experience in these areas will prove invaluable as we enter our next stage of development.”\n“The unique differentiators of LoRaWAN technology position the LoRa Alliance well in the LPWAN market,” said Donna Moore, incoming CEO & Chair of the LoRa Alliance. “Member enthusiasm for the LoRaWAN protocol is incredibly inspiring. There are already a wide variety of real-world LoRaWAN implementations across multiple industries in use today. These adoptions are a clear breakthrough for IoT connectivity and demonstrate that LoRaWAN can solve business intelligence requirements, deliver a strong ROI for implementers, and offer confidence and longevity to end-users. The LoRa Alliance has a fantastic opportunity now to cement its leadership position in the IoT space through increased certification, and rapidly increasing adoption. I look forward to leading the organization through this exciting growth phase that has global, market-changing implications.”\n“The Board of Directors sincerely thanks Geoff for the significant role he played in our success to date with phenomenal member growth and global adoption,” said Olivier Beaujard, Sr. Director LoRa Alliance for the Wireless and Sensing Products Group at Semtech and a Board Member of the LoRa Alliance. “The foundation he helped to create allows for Donna to focus on the future and the realization of LoRaWAN as the de facto LPWAN technology.”\nMoore has nearly two decades of experience in launching new companies and growing businesses across a variety of industries and competitive environments.
