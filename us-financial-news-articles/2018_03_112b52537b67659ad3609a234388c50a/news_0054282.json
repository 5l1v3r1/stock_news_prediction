They are excited about the business and the talented employees who will now become part of the Accenture team.\"\nFinancial terms of the transaction are not being disclosed. Meredith said the transaction will not have a material effect on its fiscal 2018 financial results. The acquisition is expected to close within 60 days, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\"We are thrilled to be joining the Accenture Interactive family,\" said Georgine Anton, President of MXM. \"The combination of Accenture Interactive and MXM will be powerful in the market. The depth of the Accenture offerings will deepen our capabilities, enabling us to better serve both existing and new clients. Accenture Interactive will provide MXM with a home where it can offer clients best-in-class, single sourced, integrated solutions, a clear competitive advantage for Accenture Interactive and MXM alike.\"\nMeredith has been committed to service journalism for more than 115 years.
