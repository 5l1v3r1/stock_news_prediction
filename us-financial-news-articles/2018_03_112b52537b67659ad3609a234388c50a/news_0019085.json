He earlier told Reuters the general reserve of the central bank and its assets in foreign currencies had increased by $1.5 billion in the first two months.\nSalameh also told Reuters that November’s around 2 percentage point increase in local currency interest rates had been sufficient to iron out market imbalances, “therefore we have an outlook of stable interest rates”.
