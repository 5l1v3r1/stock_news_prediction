Mining majors were also weaker on the day, with Rio Tinto falling 4.08 percent by the end of the session. \nOil producers closed lower as crude prices remained soft, with Oil Search down 4.5 percent. Australia's \"Big Four\" banks were also weaker, with ANZ down 0.86 percent while its peers recorded slighter losses. \nChina muscles higher Greater China markets shrugged off broader market sentiment to edge higher, outperforming markets elsewhere in the region. \nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index reversed early losses to edge up 0.22 percent by 3:03 p.m. HK/SIN. The financials sector inched higher by 0.09 percent after earlier trading in negative territory, with China Construction Bank advancing 0.12 percent while HSBC traded lower by 0.32 percent an hour before the market close. \nProperty developers were a mixed picture, although several large caps recorded significant gains: Country Garden tacked on 1.56 percent, Sino Land gained 3.18 percent and CK Asset rose 1.18 percent. Index heavyweight Tencent traded higher by 3.01 percent ahead of the close. \nMainland markets closed in positive territory after two straight days of losses on the benchmark Shanghai composite. Gains on Thursday also came on the back of expectation-topping private manufacturing activity data. The Shanghai composite tacked on 0.44 percent to close at 3,273.76 and the Shenzhen composite jumped 1.23 percent.\nMeanwhile, the CSI 300 index, which tracks blue chips listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, rose 0.63 percent on the day, with technology names and consumer stocks among the best-performers on the day. \nCaixin manufacturing PMI for February released on Thursday came in at 51.6, a touch above the 51.3 forecast in a Reuters poll.

The common currency was a touch firmer at $1.2203, after falling as low as $1.2186 in the last session. Meanwhile, sterling traded flat at $1.3766 after Wednesday's sharp fall which came about on Brexit worries . \nOn the energy front, prices were steady following the overnight drop in prices, after data reflected an increase in U.S. stockpiles . U.S. West Texas Intermediate were higher by 0.15 percent at $61.74 per barrel. Brent crude futures , meanwhile, were nearly flat at $64.75.\nâ€” CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T02:12:08.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
