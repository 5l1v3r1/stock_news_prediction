It had set a 16-month trough of 104.560 on Monday.\nThe dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was dipped 0.1 percent to 89.945 after reaching a one-week high of 90.147.\nGlobal markets were shaken this month when Trump moved to impose tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing threatened to retaliate.\nThe United States and South Korea agreed on Tuesday to revise their six-year-old trade pact with a side deal to deter competitive currency devaluation by Seoul and with concessions for U.S. autos and pharmaceutical companies.\nFocus was on whether the Trump administration would press China for currency reassurances as part of the trade negotiations, like those secured from South Korea.\nFears of a full-blown trade war have eased on hopes that negotiations can foster a compromise, but concerns remained.\n“Expansionary U.S. fiscal policy should support global trade, but markets will remain attentive to further tensions as the China-U.S. trade saga continues to unfold,” wrote economists at ANZ.\nThe euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.2332 after losing 0.75 percent on Wednesday.\nSterling was effectively flat at $1.4080 after shedding 0.5 percent overnight on news British retail sales fell in March for the first time in five months.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.773 percent after touching a near two-month low of 2.743 percent overnight on sagging Wall Street shares.\nIn commodities, U.S. crude futures rose 0.4 percent to $64.64 a barrel, partly recovering after dropping 1 percent the previous day when data showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose last week.\nBrent climbed 0.55 percent to $69.91 a barrel after losing 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Brent has risen more than 6 percent this month with OPEC and other suppliers expected to continue withholding output for the rest of the year and potentially into 2019.
