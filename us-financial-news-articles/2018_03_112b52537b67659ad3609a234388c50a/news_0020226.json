The same strategy, Glaser said, was employed by the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations.\n\"We can't let up pressure,\" he said. \"If we want any future talks to succeed, we may have to increase the pressure, even from what it's at now.\"\n\"I hope there's no one out there that is advocating for a reduction in pressure on North Korea simply for its willingness to engage in talks,\" Glaser said.\nHe added that talks need to include all countries that could possibly be affected, not just the U.S., \"until it comes to a resolution of this issue that satisfies the international community.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T00:57:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
