And we have not at the moment decided to call other tech companies, but we may well do,\" Collins told CNBC in a TV interview.\nLast week, Collins invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear in front of lawmakers to give evidence about the data fiasco. Facebook instead said it would send one other senior executive that directly reports to Zuckerberg instead.\nThe MP told CNBC Wednesday that he would again write to Zuckerberg to ask for clarification on whether he would speak to lawmakers on another occasion.\nThe MP is chairing a committee of lawmakers investigating fake news. The Facebook and Cambridge Analytica case however fell under its remit. Collins said that the Facebook case has made people aware of how much data is being collected about them.\n\"These issues are not just questions for Facebook but the spotlight has fallen on them. It's about how all companies gather and use data. I think there are two things that I think you can, consumers and users are really focused on in the last 10 days or so, which are, which is firstly just how much data is being gathered about them,\" Collins said.\n\"And then with the data security breach, the concern there is that data isn't necessarily safe.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T16:35:07.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
