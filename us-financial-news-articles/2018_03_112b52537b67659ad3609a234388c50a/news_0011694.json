Results for the full year 2017 are shown below.\nOverview\n\"Verso delivered a dramatic turnaround in results during the last six months of 2017, including a significant rebound to finish the year at $134 million of Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), a reduction in net debt of $113 million, an increase in liquidity to $216 million and a material reduction in overhead costs,\" said Verso Chief Executive Officer B. Christopher DiSantis. \"Our 2017 cash flow, bolstered by aggressive working capital management and growing price realization, was exceptional. We believe these solid run-rate results and positive momentum across the enterprise position the company well for continued financial performance improvement and value creation for our stockholders.\"\nResults of Operations â€“ Comparison of Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nSuccessor\nThree Months\nThree Months\nEnded\nEnded\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nThree Month\n(Dollars in millions)\n2016\n2017\n$ Change\nNet sales\n$ 646\n$ 639\n$ (7)\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation,\namortization and depletion)\n539\n554\n15\nDepreciation, amortization and depletion\n69\n28\n(41)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n26\n25\n(1)\nRestructuring charges\n9\n1\n(8)\nOther operating (income) expense\n6\n1\n(5)\nOperating income (loss)\n(3)\n30\n33\nInterest expense\n9\n9\n-\nOther (income) expense\n-\n(7)\n(7)\nIncome (loss) before reorganization items, net\n(12)\n28\n40\nReorganization items, net\n-\n-\n-\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(12)\n28\n40\nIncome tax benefit\n(20)\n(8)\n12\nNet income (loss)\n$ 8\n$ 36\n$ 28\nComments to Results of Operations - Comparison of Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The sales decline was primarily attributable to a decrease in total sales volume due to the general softening of demand for coated papers and our capacity reductions at our Androscoggin Mill. Gross margin, excluding depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses, decreased from 16.6% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin was favorably impacted in fourth quarter of 2016 by $22 million and the fourth quarter of 2017 by $4 million as a result of gains included in cost of products sold associated with the elimination of certain postretirement benefit costs. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by lower sales volume, increased freight costs and mill performance issues, partially offset by reductions in manufacturing overhead costs, lower maintenance costs, and increased average sales prices. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of $43 million in accelerated depreciation in 2016 attributable to the capacity reductions at the Androscoggin Mill. Restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2016 are related to the closure of the Wickliffe Mill in Kentucky and capacity reductions at the Androscoggin Mill in Maine. Other non-operating income of $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 was related to the extinguishment of an obligation in December 2017 in connection with the unwind of a New Market Tax Credit transaction entered in 2010.\nResults of Operations - Comparison of 12 Months Ended December 31, 2017 to 12 Months Ended December 31, 2016\nPredecessor\nSuccessor\nJanuary 1, 2016\nJuly 15, 2016\n12 Months\nThrough\nThrough\nEnded\nJuly 14,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n12 Month\n(Dollars in millions)\n2016\n2016\n2017\n$ Change\nNet sales\n$ 1,417\n$ 1,224\n$ 2,461\n$ (180)\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of products sold (exclusive of depreciation,\namortization and depletion)\n1,249\n1,098\n2,237\n(110)\nDepreciation, amortization and depletion\n100\n93\n115\n(78)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n95\n49\n106\n(38)\nRestructuring charges\n151\n11\n9\n(153)\nOther operating (income) expense\n(57)\n8\n1\n50\nOperating income (loss)\n(121)\n(35)\n(7)\n149\nInterest expense\n39\n17\n38\n(18)\nOther (income) expense\n-\n-\n(7)\n(7)\nIncome (loss) before reorganization items, net\n(160)\n(52)\n(38)\n174\nReorganization items, net\n(1,338)\n-\n-\n1,338\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n1,178\n(52)\n(38)\n(1,164)\nIncome tax benefit\n-\n(20)\n(8)\n12\nNet income (loss)\n$ 1,178\n$ (32)\n$ (30)\n$ (1,176)\nComments to Results of Operations - Comparison of 12 Months Ended December 31, 2017 to 12 Months Ended December 31, 2016\nNet sales for the 12 months of 2017 decreased by $180 million compared to the 12 months of 2016. The sales decline was attributable to a decrease in total sales volume and a decrease in pricing, partially offset by improvement in product mix. The decrease in volume and pricing were driven by general softening of demand for coated papers and our capacity reductions at the Androscoggin Mill. Gross margin, excluding depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses, decreased from 11.1% of net sales in the 12 months of 2016 to 9.1% in the 12 months of 2017. Gross margin was favorably impacted in 2016 by $22 million and in 2017 by $4 million as a result of gains included in cost of products sold, associated with the elimination of certain postretirement benefit costs. Gross margin was negatively impacted in the 12 months of 2017 by lower sales volume, lower average sales prices, inflation in chemicals and energy costs and inventory reduction initiatives, partially offset by lower wood costs, reductions in manufacturing overhead costs and inventory fair value adjustments associated with fresh-start accounting in 2016. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for the 12 months of 2017 were lower than the 12 months of 2016, which was attributable to the capacity reductions at the Androscoggin Mill, the closure of the Wickliffe Mill and the reduction in the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment as a result of the adoption of fresh-start accounting upon our emergence from Chapter 11 Cases on July 15, 2016. SG&A expense reduction was attributable to implementation of cost reduction initiatives across the Company, non-recurring pre-reorganization costs as well as a change in accounting policy adopted in connection with fresh-start accounting related to reclassification of certain centralized manufacturing overhead costs previously presented in SG&A of the Predecessor that are now presented in Cost of products sold of the Successor. Restructuring charges for the 12 months of 2017 are primarily associated with the closure and relocation of the Memphis office headquarters and closure of the Wickliffe Mill. Restructuring charges for the 12 months of 2016 consisted primarily of non-cash fixed asset write-down charges from the closure of the Wickliffe Mill. Other operating income for the 12 months of 2017 decreased $50 million, primarily attributable to the sale of hydroelectric facilities in January 2016, partially offset by costs incurred for professional fees paid for legal, consulting and other bankruptcy related costs and services. Reorganization items, net for the Predecessor period from January 1, 2016 to July 14, 2016 was a net gain of $1,338 million, primarily attributable to adjustments to reflect the non-cash gain associated with the elimination of debt, offset by the non-cash impact of fresh-start accounting and professional fees directly associated with our Chapter 11 Cases.\nGuidance\nThe Company is providing the following guidance:\n2018 First Quarter Net Sales of $610-625 million. Price increases are favorable. Capital Expenditures are expected to be approximately $10 million. Seasonal use of working capital is expected to rise by $20-30 million. Cash pension funding of $5-8 million. Excess cash flow payment pending as we continue to pay down Term Loan. Expectations for Full Year 2018 Net Sales to be greater than 2017 (primarily due to pricing and A3 volume). Significant increases in logistics/freight. Inflation in energy, raw material and other input costs headed up. Capital Expenditures to be $60-70 million, up from $40 million in 2017. Cash pension funding of $45-50 million. Cash taxes of $0-5 million, primarily state income and franchise taxes. Major maintenance costs up $14-18 million.\nPresentation of Predecessor and Successor Financial Results\nThe Company adopted fresh-start reporting as of July 15, 2016 (the \"Effective Date\"), the effective date of its First Modified Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code dated June 20, 2016, and the date that Verso emerged from its Chapter 11 Cases. As a result of the application of fresh-start reporting, the Company's financial statements for periods prior to the Effective Date are not comparable to those for periods subsequent to the Effective Date. References to \"Successor\" refer to the Company on or after the Effective Date. References to \"Predecessor\" refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date. Operating results for the Successor and Predecessor periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year. References such as the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to Verso Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, whether Predecessor and/or Successor, as appropriate.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA consists of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing performance. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a way of evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers and to assess compliance with our credit facilities. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP operating performance measure commonly used in our industry that provides investors and analysts with a measure of ongoing operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles, and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies.\nWe believe that the supplemental adjustments applied in calculating Adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and appropriate to provide additional information to investors.\nBecause EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and are susceptible to varying calculations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should consider our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, our operating or net income or cash flows from operating activities, which are determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the presented periods:\nPredecessor\nSuccessor\n12 Months\nJanuary 1, 2016\nJuly 15, 2016\nThree Months\nThree Months\n12 Months\nEnded\nThrough\nThrough\nEnded\nEnded\nEnded\nDecember 31,\nJuly 14,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2015\n2016\n2016\n2016\n2017\n2017\nNet income (loss)\n$ (422)\n$ 1,178\n$ (32)\n$ 8\n$ 36\n$ (30)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(3)\n-\n(20)\n(20)\n(8)\n(8)\nInterest expense, net\n270\n39\n17\n9\n9\n38\nDepreciation, amortization and depletion\n308\n100\n93\n69\n28\n115\nEBITDA\n$ 153\n$ 1,317\n$ 58\n$ 66\n$ 65\n$ 115\nAdjustments to EBITDA:\nReorganization items, net (1)\n-\n(1,338)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nRestructuring charges (2)\n59\n151\n11\n9\n1\n9\nFresh-start accounting adjustments (3)\n-\n3\n46\n2\n-\n-\n(Gain) loss on disposal of assets (4)\n6\n(57)\n2\n2\n2\n3\nPre- and post-reorganization costs (5)\n10\n6\n8\n6\n-\n1\nOther severance costs (6)\n2\n2\n3\n2\n1\n6\nNewPage acquisition and\nintegration-related costs/charges (7)\n36\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nStrategic initiatives costs (8)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3\n3\nExtinguishment of NMTC obligation (9)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(7)\n(7)\nOther items, net (10)\n3\n11\n5\n5\n-\n4\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 269\n$ 95\n$ 133\n$ 92\n$ 65\n$ 134\n(1)\nNet gains associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\n(2)\nFor 2015, charges represent severance and employee related costs and other restructuring charges associated with the NewPage acquisition, and the closure of the Bucksport Mill.
