It expects to welcome a record 37.55 million tourists this year.\nBut it is also known for sex. Although prostitution is illegal in Thailand, it is tolerated and brothels frequented by Thais and foreigners can be found in most major cities.\nThai police on Monday arrested a group of 10 Russians who were running a sex training class for their compatriots in the seaside town of Pattaya, and have charged them with working in Thailand without permission.\n“The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) ensures that its marketing strategy and policy to move Thailand forward as the ‘Quality Destination’ has stepped in the right direction ... and strongly opposes any form of sex tourism,” the TAT said in a statement late on Wednesday.\nSigns offering “soapy massages” - bubble baths given to brothel clients that usually end with sex - and go-go bars have helped to bolster Thailand’s reputation as a sex destination.\nThere are around 123,530 sex workers in Thailand, according to a 2014 UNAIDS report.\nThailand and sex tourism have become so synonymous that last month British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson alluded to the issue during a Brexit speech.\n“... more than a million people ... go to Thailand every year where our superb consular services deal with some of the things that they get up to there,” said Johnson.\nIn 2016, Thailand’s then-tourism minister said she was pushing to rid the country of its ubiquitous brothels and wanted Thailand to be about “quality tourism”. That pledge was followed by police raids on some of the biggest establishments providing sex services in the capital Bangkok.\nBut experts say ridding the country of an industry that is so entrenched will be extremely difficult.\nThe TAT statement this week follows tension between Thailand and Gambia after Gambia’s tourism minister was reported to have told tourists last month to go to Thailand for sex rather than visit the West African country.\nThat prompted Thailand’s foreign ministry to file a formal letter of protest with consular offices representing Gambia.\nLast year, Thailand’s tourism industry recorded its highest revenue in history, raking in $53.76 billion, a 12 percent increase from 2016.\nReporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T06:31:33.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
