REUTERS/Bobby Yip Shares in WH Group, owner of China’s biggest buyer of U.S. pork, have fallen nearly 12 percent since Thursday’s close, before Beijing said it may slap 25 percent tariffs on American pork. China said it would consider the move, along with other duties, to counter tough trade steps from Washington.\nBut China buys no more than 7 percent of Smithfield’s fresh pork output, Sullivan said in an analyst call after the company reported earnings late on Monday.\n“We’ll find markets, we ship to more than 40 countries,” said Sullivan. “We may very well ship to China even with an increased tariff,” he said.\nInvestors have over-reacted, he said. WH Group shares fell more than 3 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday following declines in excess of 4 percent in each of the previous two sessions.\nThe tariffs may even benefit the firm’s packaged meat business, which generates more than 70 percent of profits, by pressuring fresh pork prices in the U.S., Sullivan said.\nIndustry experts expect the tariffs could force exporters to sell at lower prices to offset the duties. China buys mainly fresh pork from abroad and processes it at home.\nWH Group’s profit rose 7.5 percent to $1.09 billion, driven by U.S. and Europe operations, but profits from the China business missed estimates, falling 1.9 percent to 4.3 billion yuan ($687 million).\nAnalysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note that the miss was partly due to lower sales of chilled processed meat.\nThe company has been trying to shift away from lower-margin, heat-treated products that make up the bulk of China’s packaged meat category but face stagnating growth.\nBut WH Group’s traditional distributors have not adapted well to selling the new products, said Ma Xiangjie, president of its China business, Henan Shuanghui Investment and Development.\nThe company will look for new distributors to specialize in different categories in different regions, he said.\nThe company is also trying to boost its sales on online platforms and to food-service clients. It has phased out some poor performing products and expects growth in packaged meat sales volumes in 2018 of at least 10 percent, according Wan Long, chairman of WH Group.\nReporting by Dominique Patton; Editing by Aaron Sheldrick\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T18:26:59.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
