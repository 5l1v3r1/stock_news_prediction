(NYSE: BPI), a provider of postsecondary education services. As a combined institution, Ashford University will return to an independent, non-profit university.\nThe proposed merging of Ashford University and University of the Rockies will create a comprehensive educational offering that will include undergraduate programs at Ashford, master's programs at both universities, and the doctoral programs of the University of the Rockies. The addition of University of the Rockies graduate-level social and behavioral sciences programs will enable Ashford University to reach a wider array of students and help close the skills gap faced by employers.\n\"Together, we believe the combined, independent non-profit university will be able to focus on its core competence of designing rich educational experiences that serve the personal and professional needs of a diverse student population,\" said Dr. Craig Swenson, president and CEO of Ashford University. \"We believe returning to non-profit status will allow us to better serve students and to be judged and measured as colleges and universities should be—on our ability to foster student learning.\"\n\"The missions and values of both of our institutions – including a strongly shared commitment to student success – are well aligned,\" said Dr. Dawn Iwamoto, president and CEO of University of the Rockies. \"Ashford University and University of the Rockies have always demonstrated a singular commitment to providing both access and excellence.\"\nAs a part of this transformation, Bridgepoint Education will become an Online Program Management (OPM) company, bringing years of technological and academic innovation, and intellectual property development to other colleges and universities desiring to serve their students through online postsecondary education programs. Pending necessary approvals, the merged institution of Ashford University and University of the Rockies intends to negotiate a services agreement to become Bridgepoint Education's first client as an OPM.\nThe completion of Ashford University's return to non-profit status, and University of the Rockies merging into Ashford University, are subject to customary closing conditions and the approval by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), the U.S. Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service, and state regulatory bodies.\nBoth universities will provide more information as it becomes available. We expect these transformations to be complete by the end of 2018.\nAbout Ashford University\nWhere heritage meets innovation – that's Ashford University.
