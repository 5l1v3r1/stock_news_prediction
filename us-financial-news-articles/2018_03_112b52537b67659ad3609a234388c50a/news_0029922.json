FILE PHOTO: Sergio Garcia of Spain celebrates winning the Masters with a putt on the 18th green during a playoff against Justin Rose of England in the final round of the 2017 Masters golf tournament at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 9, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo “Beautiful Azalea Adele Garcia was born on March 14 at 1:54am,” the Spaniard tweeted after the birth of his first child on Wednesday. Azalea shares her name with the par-five 13th hole at Augusta National where her father last year sunk a seven-foot putt in the final round to save par after landing in the bushes and taking a penalty drop. Garcia, who will defend his title next month, was trailing Justin Rose by two strokes at the time and a slip-up would have probably handed the Englishman victory. Garcia went on to force a playoff in which he beat Rose on the first hole to end nearly two decades of major heartbreak. “So proud and impressed with my wife @TheAngelaAkins and the way she handled the pregnancy and delivery! Love you both so much,” he added.
