REUTERS/Aly Song The Commission concluded that Chinese producers had significant spare capacity and that this was likely to lead to large-scale imports into the European Union at dumped prices if the measures were lifted.\nThe duties on seamless stainless steel pipes and tubes were first set in 2011, with a review begun after their expiry in 2016. The duties remained in place during the review.\nThe measures are among 17 put in place by the European Union against different grades of steel and steel products from China.\nEU producers include Sandvik ( SAND.ST ), Tubacex ( TUBA.MC ) and Salzgitter ( SZGG.DE ).\nChinese producers affected include Changshu Walsin Speciality Steel Co, Shanghai Jinchang Stainless Steel Tube Manufacturing Co and Wenzhou Jiangnan Steel Pipe Manufacturing Co.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:39:44.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
