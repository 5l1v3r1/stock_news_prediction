None of those businesses was generating revenue.\nIn total, the startup generated little more than $100,000 in revenue that year â€” and the SEC alleges Balwani must have known.\nIn October 2014, the same month he was selling potential investors revenue projections between $120 million and $140 million, Balwani told Theranos' potential insurers that the company was operating at an $8 million to $9 million monthly net loss, according to the SEC.\nCEO Elizabeth Holmes and Balwani were both charged with \"massive fraud.\" Theranos said Holmes agreed to settle and pay a $500,000 fine and will be barred from serving as a director or officer of a public company for 10 years. The SEC characterizes Balwani's financial dealings as \"reckless.\"\nHolmes created a culture of secrecy at Theranos that helped to disguise the company's struggles with innovation and drew the wool over potential investors' eyes.\nBut former ImClone Systems CEO Samuel Waksal, a veteran of biotech and himself notoriously convicted of insider trading in 2003, called the ruse years ago .\n\"In the world of science, we care about intellectual property,\" Waksal said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" \"But the one thing we don't do, when asked about a scientific breakthrough, we don't simply say it is a secret.\"\nshow chapters Theranos CEO Holmes settles with SEC fraud charges 3 Hours Ago | 06:52", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T22:03:02.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
