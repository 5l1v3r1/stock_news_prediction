REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - RC116619BE70 \nThe social media company said it would incur about $10 million of cash expenditure due to severance costs to be reflected in the current quarter ending March 31. \nAs a result of the layoffs, primarily in its engineering and sales teams, the company said it sees savings of about $25 million in 2018. \nThe company had said it had 3,069 employees as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to its annual filing bit.ly/2pScNbz . \nThe Snapchat parent has been under pressure from investors to reduce costs after revenue fell short of analyst expectations during Snap’s first year as a publicly traded company. \nEarlier this month, a company memo had shown that the company would cut just over 120 engineers and reorganize its engineering team, Reuters reported. \nThe Southern California-based company said the workforce reduction “is to align resources around our top strategic priorities and to reflect structural changes in our business.” Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T01:13:21.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
