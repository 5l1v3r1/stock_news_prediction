Cohen has said he used his personal funds to \"facilitate\" the payment and did not get reimbursed by the Trump Organization or campaign. He has aimed to distance Trump himself from the payment.\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing sources, has reported that Cohen complained to friends that he had not been reimbursed for the money he sent to Daniels , whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford.\nDaniels signed a nondisclosure agreement shortly before the 2016 election. Clifford has filed a lawsuit against Trump arguing the agreement is invalid . \nA lawyer for Cohen did not immediately respond to CNBC's request to comment. \nRead the full NBC report here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T19:54:27.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
