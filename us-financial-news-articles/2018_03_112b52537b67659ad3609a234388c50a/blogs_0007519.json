A blow to US allies \nWashington's tariffs are based on Trump's belief that the world's largest economy is a victim of predatory trade practices by countries such as China . \nThursday's news, however, \"ends up targeting America's close trading partners and allies rather than China, which only gets hurt indirectly,\" Prasad said. \nIndeed, Canada and Brazil are likely to bear the brunt of steel tariffs , according to a 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Commerce. \nBy jeopardizing long-standing trade alliances, \"the U.S. is really undercutting the multilateral rules of engagement and creating the sense, even among its traditional allies, that it no longer will be a reliable and trustworthy partner in terms of trade,\" Prasad warned.
