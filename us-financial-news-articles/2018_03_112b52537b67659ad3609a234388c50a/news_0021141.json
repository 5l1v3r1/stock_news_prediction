Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images General Motors CEO Mary Barra unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle during the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Barra said the scale of the production increase was yet to be determined, but the ramp-up would create new jobs at the plant.\nIn a speech, Barra called on the energy industry and other stakeholders to partner with GM to expand the U.S. network of charging stations. She said the infrastructure would boost customers' confidence that they can use their electric vehicles anywhere and anytime.\n\"You've got to have good consumer confidence that they're going to be able to drive their vehicles and it's going to support their daily lives and their hectic life,\" she said. \"We see a role in investing, in partnering and making sure that that customer need is fulfilled,\" Barra added. She noted that GM is working on some partnerships, but did not have anything to announce yet.\nThe GM CEO also implored the power sector to continue deploying renewable energy generation, saying it would entice environmentally conscious drivers off the sidelines by lowering the carbon footprint of electric vehicles.\nThe United States still draws roughly 30 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants, so many plug-ins still rely on a major contributor to global warming to charge up.\nBarra also said Congress should expand tax credits for electric vehicles.\nMore from CERAWeek: \nThe little industry that can take big bite out of oil demand \n\nFed's Kaplan says market doesn't appreciate risk of oil price spike \n\nSaudis are looking to Alphabet, Amazon to build a tech hub", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:31:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
