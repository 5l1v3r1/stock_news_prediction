Ruben Enaje, 58, who is portraying Jesus Christ for the 32nd time, grimaces in pain after being nailed on a wooden cross during a Good Friday crucifixion re-enactment in Cutud village, Pampanga province, north of Manila, Philippines March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco \nRuben Enaje, 58, again portrayed Christ on Friday in the traditional religious rite in Cutud village, about 76 km (47 miles) from the capital Manila. \n“In the past, I went home injured and limping, but this year I feel so great,” Enaje said after the ritual held under a sweltering sun. \nHe said he believed his strong Catholic faith helped him avoid pain.
