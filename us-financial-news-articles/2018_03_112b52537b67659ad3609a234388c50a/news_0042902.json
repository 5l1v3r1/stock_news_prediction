The tariffs were aimed at hitting Chinese over-production, but also hit key allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico, though the latter two have been granted an exemption.\n\"The near-term impact financially we don't like, but the more important one is the longer-term potential impact taking U.S. farmers out of the world market for corn and soybeans,\" Allen said.\nThe United States is the world's No. 2 exporter of soybeans and top exporter of corn, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAllen added that Deere would absorb the costs of higher steel prices and \"work aggressively\" to cut other costs to offset the impact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T04:02:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
