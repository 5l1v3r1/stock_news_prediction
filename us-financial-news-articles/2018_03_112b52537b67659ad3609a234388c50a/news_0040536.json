DJI, the worldâ€™s largest maker of civilian drones, plans to obtain the fresh capital in a combination of new equity and debt, and wants to finalize the deal in the coming months, said the people, declining to be identified as the information was private. A stock market listing is likely next year, they added. Proceeds for Shenzhen-based DJI, which is in talks with prospective investors, could be between $500 million and $800 million, one of the people said. A spokeswoman for DJI said in an emailed statement the company had no announcement to make on fundraising and that it was not planning an initial public offering at the moment. She did not elaborate.
