He said he had spent six months in solitary confinement. \n“It’s the journalistic profession, the father of a family and the freedom of the press that has been attacked today,” Karine Michelet-Traval, the mayor of Colomiers where the shooting occurred, said in a statement. \nIn separate comments to La Depeche newspaper, she said: “You can’t help but think this was a settling of scores.” \nNamazov’s wife was killed in the shooting. A police source said she had been shot in the head, apparently at close range. Witnesses spoke of hearing multiple gunshots, local media reported. \nThe local prosecutor is due to make a statement at 16h00 (1400 GMT). \nHuman Rights Watch said last year the Azeri government continued its crackdown on dissenting voices and that reports of torture persisted. It also said independent media outlets faced harassment and closure and critical journalists faced threats and intimidation aimed at silencing them.
