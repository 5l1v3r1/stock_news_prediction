Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nThe Weinstein Co could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe New York Times first reported in October that multiple women had accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.
