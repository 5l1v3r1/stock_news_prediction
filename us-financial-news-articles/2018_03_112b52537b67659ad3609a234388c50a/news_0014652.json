Oklahoma City fell into a 19-point hole midway through the fourth quarter before cutting the deficit to eight with a late flurry, a byproduct of aggressive forays to the rim.\nHarden chipped in 23 points and 11 assists and Houston overcame his 10 turnovers to extend its winning streak, the second-longest in franchise history. The Rockets did so again via their 3-point proficiency, connecting on 17 of 33 attempted treys while shooting a robust 53.5 percent overall.\nRussell Westbrook paced the Thunder with 32 points but needed 27 shots to reach that total while also committing nine turnovers. Carmelo Anthony added 23 points for the Thunder, who entered play fighting to remain in the postseason picture in the congested Western Conference.\nAnthony passed Jerry West for 20th on the all-time NBA scoring list in the loss.\nHouston, meanwhile, remained atop the West standings ahead of the Golden State Warriors.\nIn addition to Paul and Harden, five other Rockets scored in double figures. Trevor Ariza tallied 15 points on 3-of-5 3-point shooting and Eric Gordon made three 3s off the bench for 14 points.\nHarden salvaged a ragged first quarter for the Rockets, answering a 13-0 Thunder run by having a hand in 13 consecutive points for Houston. He mixed in a three-point play, a floater, two free throws and a 3-pointer plus two assists to help the Rockets erase a nine-point deficit.\nAfter the Thunder opened the second quarter with consecutive 3s, the Rockets responded with a 12-0 run to secure a 38-30 lead. Houston pushed its lead to 14 points before Anthony scored 11 of the final 15 points for the Thunder in the first half. However, the Rockets torched Anthony defensively, isolating him against Harden on the switch in running off a string of easy baskets.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T12:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:38:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
