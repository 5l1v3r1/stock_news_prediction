(TSXV:IGX) (OTCQX:IGXT) (the “ Company ” or “ IntelGenx ”) announces that further to its news release issued on March 19, 2018 in connection with the proposed acquisition by IntelGenx Corp., the Company’s operating subsidiary, of the pharmaceutical consulting firm Laboval Inc. (the “ Acquisition ”) and the Company’s intention to finance the Acquisition and related fees and costs by way of private placement, the Company has entered into an agreement with a placement agent (the “ Placement Agency Agreement ”) providing for the issuance of up to 15,873,016 units (the “ Units ”) at a subscription price of US$0.63 per Unit for gross proceeds of up to US$10 million (the “ Offering ”).\nEach Unit will consist of one common share of the Company (a “ Common Share ”) and one common share purchase warrant (a “ Warrant ”). Each Warrant will entitle its holder to acquire one Common Share at a price of US$0.90 per Common Share for a period of five years following closing of the Offering.\nEach purchaser of Units who participates in the Offering will have the right to elect to purchase the same number of additional units (the “ Additional Units ”) as the number of the Units in such purchaser’s original subscription within the period of eight months following the closing of the Offering (the “ Follow-on Right ”). Such Additional Units would be issued at a 10% discount to the last closing price of the Common Shares prior to the exercise of such right, subject to a minimum of the lesser of (i) US$0.63 (subject to adjustment for forward and reverse stock splits, recapitalizations and similar transactions) and (ii) the lowest of any purchase price per Common Share in any issuance by the Company of Common Shares in any financing transaction from the closing of the Offering until such exercise (the “ Follow-on Price ”). Each warrant granted on the exercise of a Follow-on Right will entitle its holder to acquire one Common Share at a price of 125% of the Follow-on Price. The closing of the exercise of any Follow-on Right is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nAs announced on March 19, 2018, the Company intends to use the proceeds of the Offering to fund the Acquisition and to cover related fees and costs. Proceeds raised in addition to those required for the Acquisition will be used to finance the Company’s Montelukast phase 2b clinical trial as well as working capital.\nPursuant to the terms of the Placement Agency Agreement, the placement agent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for sales of the Units in the United States and Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. will act as co-agent to arrange for the sale of Units in Canada on a reasonable best efforts basis.\nThe Offering is expected to close on or about March 26, 2018, subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, as well as satisfaction of customary closing conditions provided for in the Placement Agency Agreement.\nThe Company anticipates that certain “related parties” of the Company will participate in the Offering. The participation in the Offering of such “related parties” will constitute a “related party transaction” as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions ( Regulation 61-101 respecting Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions in Quebec) (“MI 61-101”). The Company expects that the Offering will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of securities being issued to the related parties nor the consideration being paid by related parties will exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where not permitted by law.
