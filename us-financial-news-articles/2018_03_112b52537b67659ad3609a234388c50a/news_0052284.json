And they're pretty good, but I'm passing. Cease and desist. Can't do it, sorry guys.\"\nA Carl's Jr employee also put a note on an Amblin executive's car reading: \"Hey Steven — let's talk SpielBurgers ASAP.\"\nWarner Bros., the studio that made \"Ready Player One,\" was also unimpressed, tweeting \"Appreciate the #ReadyPlayerOne love but this is not approved.\"\nCarl's Jr was obviously delighted, tweeting: \"OMG Spielberg likes our Charbroiled Sliders! (He's not down with #SpielBurgers but we're fine with that).\"\nTWEET\nA spokesperson for the restaurant chain told The Hollywood Reporter: \"SpielBurgers are not a menu item at Carl's Jr. locations. This was a social stunt from the brand to try and get the attention of Spielberg and his team to celebrate the launch of 'Ready Player One.'\"\nThere are more than 1,200 Carl's Jr outlets in the U.S. and the chain was founded in 1941 by Carl Karcher.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AmblinEnt/status/978732170788286464", "https://twitter.com/CarlsJr/status/978734480029466625"], "published": "2018-03-28T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T15:40:49.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
