The event drew 43,000 attendees last year.\nDiversity is \"something were all keenly aware of and trying to influence more positively,\" Toms said.\nBut OURSA organizers decided in recent days to launch anyway after deeming the assurance insufficient.\n\"We need to be at least taking these first initial steps toward greater inclusion,\" said Amie Stepanovich, an organizer who manages U.S. policy for digital rights advocacy group Access Now.\nOURSA's move underscores the growing pressure on technology conferences to show that they are not only accommodating to women and minorities, but also that they will feature traditionally underrepresented individuals more prominently.\nFueling the demands are a year of sexual harassment accusations in the industry and stories from the #MeToo social media movement about hardships women suffer in the workplace.\nRSA's keynote lineup had 22 speakers as of Monday including Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern under President Bill Clinton, as the lone female. This year's list so far also does not include a current U.S. government official.\nActivists have targeted RSA before. In 2014, several security experts boycotted and formed an alternative called TrustyCon to protest RSA Security's work for the National Security Agency.\nDell absorbed RSA and the yearly event through a 2016 acquisition.\nAlex Stamos, a TrustyCon organizer who now serves as Facebook's chief security officer, helped spur OURSA after directing a tweet last week at RSA with names of potential female speakers.\nRSA judges the 2,500 submissions it receives for 500 speaking roles based on proposed content, Toms said.\nHigh-profile slots mostly go to sponsors' top executives, who tend to be men, Toms said. Women fared well in other slots, she said, noting that 20 percent of accepted programming ideas this year came from women though women accounted for just 13 percent of submissions.\nLuta Security Chief Executive Katie Moussouris, who had two discussion ideas rejected this year, said she would try to attend both RSA and OURSA to maximize networking.\nShe said the onus should be on sponsors to \"put forward more well-qualified, diverse candidates.\"\nRSA plans to address broader cultural issues this year by using signage and a keynote video to emphasize that attendees who behave inappropriately toward anyone will be expelled.
