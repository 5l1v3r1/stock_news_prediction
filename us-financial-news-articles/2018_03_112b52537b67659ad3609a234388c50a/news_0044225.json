But many economists, including Roach, say trade imbalances are not a good metric for economic health since they are influenced by a variety of macroeconomic factors. Kate Rooney | CNBC Stephen Roach \n\"The bilateral trade deficit in the U.S. is really pretty meaningless,\" Roach said. \nAnd Trump's $1.5 trillion tax cut , which was signed into law in December, is unlikely to change the status-quo. \nThe fiscal stimulus package \"is going to take debt-to-GDP ratios up by 1 to 2 percentage points a year, relative to what they otherwise would have been,\" Roach said. \n\"For an economy like the United States, where the savings rate is already low, that's going to push our savings rate even lower. So, we're going to have to keep importing the surplus savings and running these balance of payments deficits to square the circle.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T06:53:23.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
