Isn’t it nice when hopes are justified? With “ Hello Hello” (Chronicle, 52 pages, $17.99) , Mr. Wenzel shows the same confident lightness of touch in creating effects that are surprisingly substantial.\nAt one level, the book introduces 2- to 5-year-olds to a cavalcade of wild creatures rendered in jolly collage, each animal linked to the next by a common trait. A striped tiger salamander is followed by a tiger, then a cheetah and then a spotted yellow boxfish as we read: “Hello Stripes / Hello Spots.” At another level, the book is a subtle exhortation to notice the beauty and variety of animals, especially rare and endangered ones. This is a demand that arises a lot in picture books and can easily shade into dreariness or didacticism, but Mr. Wenzel manages to avoid both with his ebullient artwork (see above) and optimistic tone.\nAll but one of the prehistoric creatures stalking through “In the Past” (Candlewick, 48 pages, $17.99) have long since gone extinct. Large and small, they spring to thrilling new life in Matthew Trueman’s dramatic mixed-media illustrations. In this terrific picture book for 3- to 7-year-olds, we see the coiled terror of the snaky Titanoboa , a mist of blood around his attacking jaws. And here is the nightmarish Yutyrannus , feathered like a chicken and built like a T. rex . David Elliott has written captivating odes, at turns jaunty and wise, for each animal. Of the tiny trilobite, ancient ancestor of the modern tick, Mr. Elliott writes: “So many of you. / So long ago. / So much above you. / Little below. / Now you lie hidden / deep in a clock, / uncountable ticks / silenced by rock.”\nThe South American predators in Sara Varon’s endearing graphic novel “New Shoes” (First Second Books, 208 pages, $17.99) don’t look remotely threatening. With her rounded body and googly eyes, for instance, the jaguar who walks on hind legs through Ms. Varon’s bright cartoon panels seems just as amiable as the story’s hero, a donkey (and shoemaker) named Francis. And she is.\nWhen Francis meets the jaguar, Harriet, deep in the Amazonian jungle, she points to the exotic plants around her little house and confesses, “I’m a bit of an amateur botanist.” She also turns out to have created a special hybrid grass. Francis has been using the grass to weave the uppers for the shoes he makes, little realizing that the middleman who brings him the stuff, a monkey named Nigel, has been stealing it. Ms. Varon smuggles neat little facts about the flora and fauna of Guyana into this good-natured tale of adventure and comity for readers ages 6 to 10.\n“In the middle of a puddle / in the middle of a road / on a teeter-totter twig / sat a teeny-tiny toad,” begins Peggy Archer in the lolloping picture book “A Hippy-Hoppy Toad” (Schwartz & Wade, 40 pages, $16.99) , illustrated by Anne Wilsdorf. Snap goes the twig, flinging the tiny toad onto the limb of a tree, where he’s startled by a bird. Down he jumps into a flower, only to be strafed by a passing bumblebee. Each change in location, and each new creature he meets, occasions another verse of what feels like a traveling song. “Chirp! went the cricket. / Tr ! went the toad. / And he chased the chirpy cricket to the gravel down the road.” Ms. Wilsdorf’s ink-and-watercolor pictures capture both the comedy and peril of the little toad’s adventures in this wonderful read-aloud for children ages 3-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T00:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T14:55:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
