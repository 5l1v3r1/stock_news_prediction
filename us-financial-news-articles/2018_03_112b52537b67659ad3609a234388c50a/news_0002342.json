Exxon said earlier on Wednesday it would exit the joint, citing U.S. and European Union sanctions first imposed in 2014. Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said Exxon had been forced to take what he called a predictable decision, but said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 joint venture in Russia’s Far East. “It (Exxon) will suffer serious losses as a result of this (decision),” said Leontyev.
