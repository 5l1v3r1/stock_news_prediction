The Absa purchasing manager’s index showing the private sector rising to its best in ten months, but year-on-year new vehicles fell for a third consecutive month.\nBonds were also softer, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 up 0.5 basis points to 8.13 percent.\nIn the equities market, the Johannesburg All-share index closed 0.69 percent down to 57,923 points, while the blue-chip Top 40 index fell 0.72 percent to 51,011 points.\nLeading the decliners, retailer Steinhoff International Holdings, hit a one-week low after reporting a 5 percent fall in quarterly revenue after market close on Wednesday and said working capital“dried up”.\nSteinhoff closed 12.07 percent down to 5.10 rand.\nGold stocks weakened as the bullion price fell to a two-month low on expectations for further increases in U.S. interest rates. The index declined 0.25 percent.\nTightening monetary policy tends to weigh on gold because it increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets while boosting the dollar, in which the metal is priced.
