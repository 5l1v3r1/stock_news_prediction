Few economists expect new Fed chair Jerome Powell to alter the trajectory of the bank's anticipated rate path, but as it is his first meeting at the helm, investors have been somewhat on edge as the meeting approaches.\nAside from the Fed, the Trump administration is creating a stir with plans for up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\"There's much more volatility in this marketplace and that's because there two main fears - monetary policy mistake and trade policy mistake and on backdrop is a lot of chaos that comes out of White House,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston.\nEquity index futures were little changed, offering no clear indication of whether stocks would rebound from Monday's steep losses, especially in the tech sector where concerns about Facebook's data privacy issues continued to swirl.\nBy 8:36 a.m. ET, Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 4.75 points, Dow e-minis fell 13 points, and S&P 500 e-minis were fractionally higher.\nOn Monday, the Nasdaq Composite index and the S&P 500 technology index both fell more than 2 percent in their steepest one-day declines since Feb. 8.\nShares of Facebook, which instigated the rout, were down 0.72 percent in premarket trading following a 6.8 percent drop on Monday on reports that its users' data was misused.\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced calls from both U.S. and European lawmakers demanding explanations and fears of increased regulation on how companies use data had sent shares of other internet stocks down as well.\n\"We're sort of trying to figure if the technology sector is still under pressure, Facebook can be a longer story as it ties to a larger issue of moral investigation,\" Hogan said.\nApple, Alphabet, Netflix, Microsoft and Amazon were up between 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent.\nSoftware stocks could come under pressure Tuesday after Oracle reported quarterly revenue that missed Wall Street estimates on disappointing sales from its cloud business. The stock was down more than 8 percent premarket.
