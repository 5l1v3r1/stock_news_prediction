Key also announced that Don Graves will succeed Murphy and assume responsibility for Key's Corporate Responsibility and Community Relations functions.\nBruce Murphy, who joined the company in 1990, has been Head of Corporate Responsibility since 2013 and has made significant contributions to the company by establishing KeyBank as a leader in responsible banking, operations and citizenship. \"Bruce's focus on balancing mission and margin has spanned across many areas of Key including the KeyBank Foundation, fair and responsible products and community development lending,\" said Beth Mooney, Chairman and CEO of KeyCorp. \"Key is a stronger bank and community partner thanks to Bruce's tireless work. He will leave a lasting legacy at KeyBank.\"\nAmong Murphy's many accomplishments include the development and execution of the $16.5 billion National Community Benefits Plan. The first of its kind, the National Community Benefits Plan set a new standard in the industry and includes commitments for community development lending and investing, mortgages to low-to-moderate income families, small business lending and transformative philanthropy.\nOften recognized for his broad circle of influence and civic footprint, Murphy is a member of Leadership Cleveland, board member of A.M. McGregor Foundation, and Bank Administration Institute. He also serves on the FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion.\nDon Graves joined Key in 2017 as Senior Director of Corporate Community Initiatives & Relations. In this role, Graves has worked to integrate Key's strategies between community outreach efforts and public officials, trade groups and agencies that support the opportunities and obligations of the National Community Benefits Plan. Prior to joining Key, Don served as Counselor and Domestic and Economic Policy Director for Vice President Biden, providing advice on a range of policy issues including ways to create jobs and opportunity for the American people. Don was previously appointed by President Obama as Executive Director of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness at the White House and was also appointed by the President to lead the federal government's efforts in the city of Detroit.\n\"Don's focus on community transformation and engagement has given him the depth and breadth of experience to effectively lead Key's Corporate Responsibility organization. I'm excited Don will be bringing his passion for both creating value and transforming communities to his new role. I look forward to Bruce and Don partnering closely over the next several months to ensure a smooth transition,\" said Mooney.\nAbout KeyCorp\nKeyCorp's roots trace back 190 years to Albany, New York.
