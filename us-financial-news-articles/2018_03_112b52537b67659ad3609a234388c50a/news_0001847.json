The currency rose against the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso while falling against the Japanese yen.\nThe Mexican and Canadian currencies have faced periodic pressure as the U.S. has sought to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some investors have been concerned that the U.S. could seek to cancel the three-nation trade pact, which could hurt those economies more than it would the U.S.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House will move forward with steel and aluminum tariffs despite strong pushback from congressional Republicans and business groups, one day after President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser resigned in the wake of the surprise policy decision.\nWhile restrictive trade policies would, on the surface, “incrementally contribute” to the theme of a weaker U.S. dollar, “it’s hard for markets to know how to react until they see the final announcement” of any tariffs, said Daniel Katzive, head of North American currency strategy with BNP Paribas .\nAs of Tuesday, the WSJ Dollar Index had fallen 2.5% for 2018 and had declined 9.4% from its 52-week high on March 9, 2017.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:20:53.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
