(NASDAQ: NCMI) (the Company), the managing member and owner of 49.5% of National CineMedia, LLC (NCM LLC), the operator of the largest in-theater digital media network in North America, today announced consolidated results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 28, 2017.\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2017 decreased 1.3% to $140.7 million from $142.5 million for the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted OIBDA decreased 4.4% to $82.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $86.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income decreased 2.9% to $70.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $72.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.4 million, or net loss of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income as corrected of $13.4 million, or net income as corrected of $0.22 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. As adjusted to exclude CEO transition-related costs, certain impacts related to revaluing tax assets and liabilities following recently enacted federal tax legislation and other non-recurring items set forth in the table at the end of this release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been $0.27 per diluted share and net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 as corrected would have remained $0.22 per diluted share.\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 28, 2017 decreased 4.8% to $426.1 million from $447.6 million for the comparable period last year. Adjusted OIBDA decreased 11.1% to $205.1 million for the full year of 2017 from $230.7 million for the full year of 2016. Operating income decreased 11.0% to $153.9 million for the full year of 2017 from $173.0 million for the full year of 2016. Included in Adjusted OIBDA and operating income were $3.1 million and $0.7 million of non-cash impairment charges during 2017 and 2016, respectively, on investments obtained in prior years in exchange for advertising services. Net income for the full year of 2017 was $1.6 million, or income of $0.02 per diluted share, compared to net income as corrected of $20.4 million, or income as corrected of $0.34 per diluted share for the full year of 2016. As adjusted to exclude the CEO transition-related costs, certain impacts related to revaluing tax assets and liabilities following recently enacted federal tax legislation and other non-recurring items set forth in the table at the end of this release, net income for the full year of 2017 would have been $0.40 per diluted share and net income for the full year of 2016 would have been $0.36 per diluted share, as corrected. Adjusted OIBDA and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. See the tables at the end of this release for the reconciliations to the closest GAAP basis measurement.\nThe Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on March 29, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 22, 2018. In line with the Company’s intent to pay a regular quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future at the discretion of the Board of Directors consistent with the Company’s intention to distribute over time a substantial portion of its free cash flow, this reduction in the quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share of common stock will allow for ongoing reinvestment in the Company’s network and its enhanced, integrated digital products while maintaining the Company’s history of financial flexibility. The declaration, payment, timing and amount of any future dividends payable will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors who will take into account general economic and advertising market business conditions, the Company’s financial condition, available cash, current and anticipated cash needs, and any other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. While it is the intention of the Company to continue its practice of distributing a substantial proportion of its free cash flow, the Board of Directors continues to review the factors listed above and others as deemed relevant to determine a sustainable distribution rate which balances the operating and strategic needs of the Company with those of its lenders and stockholders.\nCommenting on the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 operating results, Andy England, NCM’s CEO said, “While there is no question that 2017 was a challenging year for NCM, it was really a tale of two halves, with a tough first half of the year followed by a far better second half. Much progress was made this year in many key areas to better position us to deliver on our long-term strategy, including the expansion of our national network, the strengthening of our leadership team, and of course, the launch of our new Noovie pre-show and Noovie Digital ecosystem. Our expanded focus on Digital continued to be a bright spot throughout 2017, and I’m especially excited about our new integrated marketing capabilities that better connect brands with movie audiences.”\n2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects total revenue to be flat to up 4.5% and Adjusted OIBDA to be down 2.5% to up 4.8% from the full year 2017. The Company expects total revenue in the range of $425.0 million to $445.0 million for the full year 2018, compared to total revenue for the full year 2017 of $426.1 million and Adjusted OIBDA in the range of $200.0 million to $215.0 million for the full year 2018 compared to Adjusted OIBDA for the full year 2017 of $205.1 million. During 2018, the Company expects to record approximately $23.0 million in integration and other encumbered theater payments from Cinemark and AMC associated with the Rave Theatres and Carmike Theatres acquisitions, which are recorded as a reduction of an intangible asset.\nSupplemental Information\nIntegration and other encumbered theater payments due from Cinemark and AMC associated with Rave Theatres and Carmike Theatres for the quarter ended December 28, 2017 and December 29, 2016 and full year ended December 28, 2017 and December 29, 2016 were $9.3 million, $1.1 million, $20.9 million and $2.6 million, respectively. These payments were recorded as a reduction of an intangible asset.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and audio webcast with investors, analysts and other interested parties March 12, 2018 at 5:00 P.M.

(2)\nOIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA margin and adjusted income per share are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. See attached tables for the non-GAAP reconciliations. NATIONAL CINEMEDIA, INC.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nUnaudited\nOIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin\nOperating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (“OIBDA”), Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. OIBDA represents operating income before depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted OIBDA excludes from OIBDA non-cash share based compensation cost, Chief Executive Officer transition costs and early lease termination expense. Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share based compensation programs, CEO turnover, early lease termination expense, interest rates, debt levels or income tax rates. A limitation of these measures, however, is that they exclude depreciation and amortization, which represent a proxy for the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the Company’s business. In addition, Adjusted OIBDA has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company’s share based payment costs, costs associated with the resignation of the company’s former Chief Executive Officer and an early lease termination expense. OIBDA or Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to OIBDA. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in the Company’s debt agreement.\nThe following tables reconcile operating income to OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 28, 2017\nDecember 29, 2016\nDecember 28, 2017\nDecember 29, 2016\nOperating income $ 70.2 $ 72.3 $ 153.9 $ 173.0 Depreciation and amortization 9.4 9.3 37.6 35.8 OIBDA $ 79.6 $ 81.6 $ 191.5 $ 208.8 Share-based compensation costs (1) 2.9 4.6 11.2 18.3 CEO transition costs (2) 0.1 0.2 0.6 3.6 Early lease termination expense (3) — — 1.8 — Adjusted OIBDA $ 82.6 $ 86.4 $ 205.1 $ 230.7 Total revenue $ 140.7 $ 142.5 $ 426.1 $ 447.6 Adjusted OIBDA margin 58.7 % 60.6 % 48.1 % 51.5 % Adjusted OIBDA $ 82.6 $ 86.4 $ 205.1 $ 230.7 Carmike and Rave Theatres integration\nand other encumbered theater payments\n9.3 1.1 20.9 2.6 Adjusted OIBDA after integration and\nother encumbered theater payments\n$ 91.9 $ 87.5 $ 226.0 $ 233.3\n(1)\nShare-based compensation costs are included in network operations, selling and marketing and administrative expense in the accompanying financial statements as shown in the following table (dollars in millions).

Adjusted Net Income and Income per Share\nAdjusted net income and income per share are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. Adjusted net income and income per share are calculated using reported net income and income per share and exclude CEO transition-related costs, early lease termination costs, the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions, a loss on early retirement of debt, certain impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including a gain on re-measurement of the payable to founding members under the tax receivable agreement, income tax expense related to re-measurement of deferred tax balances and adjusting for the impact to the measurement of dilutive securities. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and so highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to a method used by the Company’s management and helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income should not be regarded as an alternative to net income and should not be regarded as an alternative to income per share or as indicators of operating performance, nor should they be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that net income and income per share are the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income as previously reported to net income as reported reflecting the impact of the correction of the error. In addition, as reported net income and income per share are reconciled to adjusted net income and income per share excluding the CEO transition-related costs, early lease termination expense, loss on early retirement of debt, the reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions and certain impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including a gain on re-measurement of the payable to founding members under the tax receivable agreement, income tax expense related to re-measurement of deferred tax balances and adjusting for the impact to the measurement of dilutive securities for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 28, 2017\nDecember 29, 2016\nDecember 28, 2017\nDecember 29, 2016\nNet income as previously reported $ 14.7 $ 25.4 Correction of prior period error (1.3 ) (5.0 ) Net (loss) income as reported $ (5.4 ) $ 13.4 $ 1.6 $ 20.4 CEO transition costs (1) 0.1 0.2 0.6 3.6 Stock-based compensation expense for modified\nequity awards (2)\n— — — 2.3 Early lease termination expense (3) — — 1.8 — Loss on early retirement of debt (4) — — — 10.4 Reversal of reserve for uncertain tax positions (5) — — (1.7 ) (2.9 ) Effect of noncontrolling interests (50.5%, 56.3%,\n55.8% and 56.3%, respectively)\n(0.1 ) (0.1 ) (1.3 ) (9.2 ) Effect of provision for income taxes (104.7%, 38%, 98.8%, 38% effective rate, respectively) — — (1.1 ) (2.7 ) Gain on re-measurement of the payable to founding\nmembers under the tax receivable agreement (6)\n(87.6 ) — (87.6 ) — Income tax expense related to re-measurement\nof deferred tax balances and TRA payable to\nfounding members (6)\n113.9 — 113.9 — Net effect of adjusting items 26.3 0.1 24.6 1.5 Diluted net income excluding adjusting items $ 20.9 $ 13.5 $ 26.2 $ 21.9 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding as reported\nand as adjusted (7)\nDiluted 75,994,932 61,071,680 65,719,768 60,605,570 Diluted (loss) income per share as reported (8) $ (0.07 ) $ 0.22 $ 0.02 $ 0.34 Net effect of adjusting items 0.34 — 0.38 0.02 Diluted income per share excluding adjusting\nItems\n$ 0.27 $ 0.22 $ 0.40 $ 0.36", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncm.com&esheet=51772030&newsitemid=20180312006126&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ncm.com&index=2&md5=f6227e4203c5177419352f69f964e547", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncm.com&esheet=51772030&newsitemid=20180312006126&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ncm.com&index=1&md5=34315339506a649cada7306fdb6b77fe"], "published": "2018-03-12T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T00:43:16.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
