(NASDAQ: HMTV) (“Hemisphere” or the “Company”), the only publicly traded pure-play U.S. media company targeting the high growth U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets with leading broadcast and cable television and digital content platforms, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of Hemisphere, Alan Sokol, said, “Our businesses outside of Puerto Rico continued their strong performance in the fourth quarter. However, our overall results were significantly impacted by the disruption to our Puerto Rico business caused by Hurricane Maria. As power and other services are being restored to the island, our business is improving and we expect continued recovery over the coming months and are optimistic that the market will to return to pre-storm levels.\nWAPA suffered significant declines in revenues in the fourth quarter due to the loss of power and services in Puerto Rico. Revenues did improve over the course of the fourth quarter reflecting the progress in restoring power. Notwithstanding the challenging business environment, we successfully executed a new multi-year retransmission agreement at the largest fee increase in our history--a testament to the power of WAPA's brand and its high-quality programming.\nWith respect to our U.S. cable channels, we continue to defy overall subscriber trends by delivering strong organic subscriber growth. WAPA America’s authoritative coverage of Hurricane Maria resulted in an expansion of distribution across multiple operators. In addition, the fourth quarter was the strongest advertising quarter in the history of both Cinelatino and WAPA America and we are excited about our advertising momentum for 2018.\nIn terms of our new investments, Canal 1, a national broadcast network in Colombia, has shown impressive ratings growth in just its first few months since re-launch, and Pantaya, our OTT joint venture with Lionsgate, is off to a terrific start, ranking among the highest grossing entertainment apps on both iOS and Android.\nOverall, although the situation in Puerto Rico has caused disruption to our business, we continue to attract subscribers and advertisers, and we are well-positioned as leaders driving the future of Hispanic content consumption.”\nFinancial Results for the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nNet revenues were $24.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net revenues of $39.4 million for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was due to an $11.6 million decline in advertising revenue driven by the negative impact of Hurricane Maria, particularly the widespread loss of power. Additionally, in 2016 the Company benefited from political advertising of $1.8 million, which did not occur in 2017. Subscriber and retransmission fees decreased $2.5 million due to the interruption resulting from Hurricane Maria to pay television subscriptions of multi-channel video distributors in Puerto Rico that distribute the Company’s networks, as well as the termination of carriage of Televisión Dominicana by AT&T in September 2017. Other revenues, which are primarily related to the licensing of the Company’s content to third parties, grew $0.4 million, due to the timing and availability of the content licensed. Excluding political advertising revenue in the prior year period, net revenues decreased $13.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenues were $124.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net revenues of $138.5 million for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in the twelve-month period was due to a $14.5 million decline in advertising revenue driven by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on the television advertising market in Puerto Rico. Additionally, in 2016, the Company benefited from political advertising of $2.6 million, which did not occur in 2017. Subscriber and retransmission fees increased $1.6 million, due to annual rate increases and subscriber growth, which was offset in part by the interruption resulting from Hurricanes Irma and Maria to pay television subscriptions of multi-channel video distributors in Puerto Rico that distribute the Company’s networks, and the termination of carriage of Televisión Dominicana by AT&T in September 2017. Other revenues increased $1.4 million, due to the timing and availability of content licensed to third parties. Excluding political advertising revenue in the prior year period, net revenue decreased by $11.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nOperating expenses were $24.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to operating expenses of $26.8 million for the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in the three months ended December 31, 2017 was due to lower programming and production costs, as WAPA implemented cost savings measures following Hurricane Maria, and lower stock-based compensation expense, offset in part by incremental Hurricane Maria related expenses of $0.8 million. Operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $99.1 million, as compared to $98.5 million for the comparable period in 2016. The increase for the twelve-month period was due to incremental costs related to Hurricane Maria, and higher transaction costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Company’s Term Loan in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense.\nNet loss was $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net income of $5.9 million in the comparable period in 2016. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $13.4 million, as compared to net income of $18.0 million in the comparable period in 2016. The declines in net income were due to lower revenues as a result of the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria and loss on equity investments. Additionally, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended the Internal Revenue Code and lowered the U.S. corporate federal tax rate. This had the effect of increasing the reported income tax expense by $13.6 million in the three and twelve month periods, primarily due to the reduction in the likelihood of the utilization of foreign tax credits created by income taxes paid in Puerto Rico and the revaluation of our deferred tax asset at the lower corporate tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $6.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.4 million for the comparable period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $51.2 million, as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $64.3 million for the comparable period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding political revenue, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $11.8 million and $10.5 million, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $211.2 million in debt and $124.3 million of cash. The Company’s leverage ratio was approximately 4.1 times, and net leverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times.\nAs previously announced, the Company implemented a share repurchase plan during the third quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $12.32, for an aggregate purchase price of $11.2 million. The Company will evaluate with its Board the share repurchase program in the context of its overall capital allocation plans\nDuring the year, the Company funded $40 million in investments, which is in line with the previously announced guidance range of $35-$40 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Company received $3.25 million in insurance proceeds related to property and casualty damage in Puerto Rico. The Company has prepared claims under its property and casualty policies totaling approximately $13 million. The Company is optimistic that it will receive the majority, if not all of the remaining funds during 2018. Additionally, the Company’s business interruption policies have combined limits of $10 million, per occurrence. The Company expects two occurrences under its policies. The Company is preparing business interruption claims to recover a significant portion of the income loss from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The Company believes it will receive proceeds under the business interruption policies over the next several quarters, although not all damages will be covered.\nDue to the effects of Hurricane Maria, the Company withdrew previously issued guidance for the year ending December 31, 2017. Given the uncertainty around the recovery in Puerto Rico, the Company is not in position to issue 2018 guidance at this time.\nThe following tables set forth the Company’s financial performance for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as well as select financial data as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nHEMISPHERE MEDIA GROUP, INC.\nComparison of Consolidated Operating Results\n(amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (Audited) Net revenues $ 23,952 $ 39,407 $ 124,464 $ 138,525 Operating expenses: Cost of revenues 9,539 10,646 39,965 41,293 Selling, general and administrative 10,592 10,558 39,437 38,333 Depreciation and amortization 4,005 4,108 16,228 16,608 Other expenses 445 1,492 3,501 2,262 (Gain) loss on disposition of assets (25 ) - (23 ) 6 Total operating expenses 24,556 26,804 99,108 98,502 Operating (loss) income (604 ) 12,603 25,356 40,023 Other (expense) income: Interest expense, net (2,816 ) (2,872 ) (10,905 ) (11,651 ) Loss on impairment of fixed assets (13 ) - (546 ) - Loss on equity investments (9,435 ) - (11,885 ) - Gain from insurance proceeds 3,250 - 3,250 - Total other expense (9,014 ) (2,872 ) (20,086 ) (11,651 ) (Loss) income before income taxes (9,618 ) 9,731 5,270 28,372 Income tax expense (12,426 ) (3,809 ) (18,706 ) (10,372 ) Net (loss) income $ (22,044 ) $ 5,922 $ (13,436 ) $ 18,000 Reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(22,044\n)\n$\n5,922\n$\n(13,436\n)\n$\n18,000\nAdd (Deduct):\nIncome tax expense\n12,426\n3,809\n18,706\n10,372\nOther expense\n9,014\n2,872\n20,086\n11,651\n(Gain) loss on disposition of assets\n(25\n)\n-\n(23\n)\n6\nTransaction and non-recurring expenses\n1,748\n1,558\n4,862\n2,993\nHurricane related expenses\n753\n-\n753\n-\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,005\n4,108\n16,228\n16,608\nStock based compensation\n964\n2,169\n4,068\n4,691\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n6,841\n$\n20,438\n$\n51,244\n$\n64,321\nSelected Financial Data :\n(amounts in thousands)\nAs of As of December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Audited) (Audited) Cash $124,299 $163,090 Debt (a) $211,214 $213,347 Leverage ratio (b): 4.1x 3.3x Net leverage ratio (c): 1.7x 0.8x (a) Represents the aggregate principal amount of the debt.\n(b) Represents gross debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months.
