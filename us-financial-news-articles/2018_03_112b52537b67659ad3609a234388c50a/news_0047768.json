In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030.\nThe Marine Conservation Society said about 70 percent of litter on beaches was made of plastic with items such as straws, cups and stirrers making up over 20 percent of the litter.\n“We really want to see all plastic straws being removed from all the fast food chains ... customers clearly do not choose to recycle convenience packaging,” Emma Cunningham, a campaign officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said in a statement.\nAs well as changes to packaging, the British government unveiled plans this week to introduce a deposit return scheme later this year by which people get a 10 pence refund for plastic and glass bottles and aluminum cans.\nReporting by Katherine Pennington, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
