The technology giant refused to help the FBI, citing issues of data privacy. Cook called the request \"chilling.\"\nThe debate sparked a wide discussion over government interference in a technology company's data. Law enforcement argued the data would help solve terrorist cases. Technology companies rebutted, stating that without encryption, iPhone users will become easier victims to hackers.\nThe case was dropped after the Department of Justice was able to access the iPhone. Reports suggested a third party unlocked it.\nCook also criticized the data privacy practices of Facebook in the same interview.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T21:13:33.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
