Investors have worried that the U.S. central bank will accelerate the pace of its interest rate increases this year. * Investors also weighed the potential introduction of U.S. trade protection measures after U.S.   tweeted that the U.S. steel and aluminum industries need   trade.” * At 11:00 a.m. EST (1600 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index fell 32.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 15,409.85. The index touched its lowest intraday since Feb. 15 at 15,356.07. * The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost nearly 1 percent. * Barrick Gold Corp fell 2.4 percent to C$ 14.42 and First Quantum Minerals Ltd declined 3.1 percent to C$20.26. * Gold futures fell 0.6 percent to $1,307.5 an ounce, pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar. U.S. crude prices were down 1.6 percent at $60.66 a barrel. * Still, the energy group rose 0.2 percent, helped by a 1.8 percent gain for the shares of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd to C$40.45 after the company reported Q4 profit that beat estimates. * Toronto-Dominion Bank also rallied after reporting quarterly earnings that beat market expectations. Its shares rose 1.4 percent to C$75.00. * The index was posting three new 52-week highs and 15 new lows, while seven of its 10 main groups fell.
