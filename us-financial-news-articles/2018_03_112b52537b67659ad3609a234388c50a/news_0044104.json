There was no immediate tsunami warning.\n“We are okay. No one is injured,” said Sylvia Ombul, night desk supervisor at the Kimbe Bay Hotel in the port town of Kimbe, about 140 km to the west of the quake.\n“Right now at the hotel all my guests are okay,” Ombul added. She described the quake as “not really big”.\nPapua New Guinea, one of the world’s poorest countries, is still reeling a month after a magnitude 7.5 quake hit some 900 km to the west in its rugged and remote highlands, killing at least 100 people as landslides buried villages.\nEditing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T13:42:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
