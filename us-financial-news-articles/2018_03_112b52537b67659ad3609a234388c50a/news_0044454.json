REUTERS/Staff/Remote “Our central scenario remains one in which retaliation will be contained and will leave little impact on growth, but the risk of it happening alone is enough for us to maintain a preference for defensive assets,” said UniCredit economists led by Chiara Silvestre in a note.\nAmong the few gainers on Friday were shares in precious metals miners Fresnillo ( FRES.L ), Randgold ( RRS.L ) and Polymetal ( POLYP.L ), all up between 0.8 and 4.2 percent, as the gold price rose on the back of growing demand for safe haven assets.\nStill on the tariff front, the previously announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will take effect on Friday but more countries, including the European Union, have obtained a temporary exemption.\n“In theory it would be a soothing news but in reality it risks making the confrontation between the U.S and China harsher,” said JCI Capital fund manager Alessandro Balsotti.\nAmong companies exposed to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, shares in carmakers Fiat Chrysler ( FCHA.MI ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) fell 2 and 1.4 percent respectively, while steel tube maker Tenaris ( TENR.MI ) dropped 4.1 percent and ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) declined 3 percent.\nElsewhere in corporate arena, Indivior ( INDV.L ) plunged 6.3 percent following an U.S. court ruling against the maker of opioid addiction treatment Suboxone. Indivior said it intended to appeal against the ruling in favor of generic competitor Alvogen.\nAmong the gainers, GSK ( GSK.L ) rose 3.3 percent after it pulled out of the bidding war for Pfizer’s consumer health business <PFE.N,> following in the footsteps of Reckitt Benckiser ( RB.L ) earlier this week.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni and Kit Rees; Editing by Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
