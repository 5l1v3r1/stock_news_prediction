It would also allow users to review and delete data they have shared, including posts and search queries.\nUsers would be able to download the data shared with Facebook, including uploaded photos, contacts added to their account, and posts on timelines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T15:15:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
