The deficit was met by imports, meaning Botswana will need to bring in significantly more imports of grain this year.\nRalotsia said Botswana was likely to experience a“severe food deficit as in some parts of the country crops planted are already showing signs of wilting.”\nBotswana’s grain stock levels can sustain the country up to the start of the new harvest in July 2018, he said.\nThe drought has hit much of the southern Africa region, including South Africa, the continent’s most advanced economy and the top producer of the staple grain, which has declared a national disaster over the drought.\nEditing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:30:08.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
