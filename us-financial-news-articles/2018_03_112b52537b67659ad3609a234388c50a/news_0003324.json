In a deeper offering, Carted also offers an online grocery shopping website solution, where customers can shop and pay online. In addition, Carted offers to all its customers the ability to perform a variety of digital marketing tactics including social media, email marketing, and advanced geo-fence targeting.\nScott Bell, CEO of Bell Media, states, \"We're very pleased about completing this acquisition and look forward to growing the vertical.
