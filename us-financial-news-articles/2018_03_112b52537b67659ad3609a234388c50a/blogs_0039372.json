The White House said it the event would be a \"press availability\" featuring the president.\nTrump tweet News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 1:00 P.M.\nTrump said he signed the bill, despite his unhappiness with it, because of national security concerns.\nTrump sent shockwaves through Congress when he made the threat to reject t $1.3 billion spending bill after it passed the Senate late last night with bipartisan support .\nTrump tweet I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\nIf the 2,000-plus-page omnibus spending package — which was rammed through the legislature less than two days after it was available to read — is not signed into law by 12:01 a.m. Saturday, it will trigger a government shutdown .\nThe briefing arrives amid an especially turbulent week for the administration, which involved multiple high-level resignations and the recrudescent threat of a government shutdown.\nOn Thursday, Trump confirmed the resignation of national security advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster in a tweet.\nTrump tweet I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @ AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.\nMcMaster, whose February 2017 appointment was lauded by politicians of both parties as well as many military officials, will be replaced by former UN ambassador John Bolton .\nKnown for his ardently hawkish military views, Bolton has not received the same warm welcome in establishment political and military circles.\nMcMaster's was the second resignation of the day among key players in Trump's orbit. Earlier on Thursday, Trump's lead lawyer in the special counsel's Russia probe, John Dowd, also announced his resignation.\nCNBC's Eamon Javers contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T20:07:33.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
