(NASDAQ:SHLO), a leading global supplier of lightweighting, noise, and vibration solutions to the automotive, commercial vehicle and other industrial markets, today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 first-quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Highlights (compared to First-Quarter 2017):\nRevenues were consistent at $247.7 million. Gross profit increased nearly 16% to $27.9 million. Gross margin increased 160 basis points to 11.3%. Net income increased 341% to $4.9 million or 21 cents per share. Adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 15% to $16.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points to 6.7%.\n“Shiloh generated favorable results during the first quarter of 2018 as margins expanded on stable revenue,” said Ramzi Hermiz, president and chief executive officer, of Shiloh Industries. “Our transformation to a lightweighting, product-focused company continues to deliver positive results. Additionally, the most recent acquisition accelerates this transformation by expanding aluminum product manufacturing and technical capabilities in Europe, while solidifying our leadership in structural magnesium products. We continue to position ourselves as the lightweighting partner of choice for our customers.”\nStrategic Acquisition Highlights\nOn March 1, Shiloh completed the strategic acquisition of Brabant Alucast Italy and Brabant Alucast Netherlands. The acquisition expands Shiloh’s technology portfolio as well as enhances its manufacturing capabilities. The acquisition complements Shiloh’s global footprint with the addition of aluminum casting and the expansion of magnesium casting capabilities in Europe, while providing necessary capacity for growth. Combined with existing market presence, Shiloh is now one of the leading automotive magnesium structural component manufacturers globally. Please refer to Shiloh’s Form 8-Ks filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2018 and March 7, 2018 for additional information on the transaction.\nU.S. Tax Reform - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nIn connection with the passage of U.S. Tax Reform in December 2017, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Shiloh recorded a provisionally estimated one-time net tax benefit of approximately $3.2 million, related to the remeasurement of net U.S. deferred taxes.\nRestructuring Actions\nDuring the first quarter, Shiloh incurred restructuring expense of $1.5 million related to a strategic action initiated in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2017. This action is designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness as the Company continues to proactively address the shift in consumer preferences to trucks and SUVs away from passenger cars and the desire to increase flexibility to manage cyclical changes.\nShiloh to Host Conference Call Today at 8:00 A.M.

The forward-looking statements are made on the basis of management's assumptions and expectations. As a result, there can be no guarantee or assurance that these assumptions and expectations will in fact occur.

See \"Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 and “Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2018 for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Any or all of these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect management's analysis only as of the date of this Press Release. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of filing this Press Release. In addition to the disclosures contained herein, readers should carefully review risks and uncertainties contained in other documents we file from time to time with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes the following non-GAAP financial measures: “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA ,\" \"adjusted EBITDA margin\" and \"adjusted earnings per share.\" We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other adjustments as described in the reconciliations accompanying this press release. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues as shown in the reconciliations accompanying this press release. Adjusted earnings per share excludes certain income and expense items as shown in the reconciliation accompanying this press release. We use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted earnings per share as supplements to information provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in evaluating our business and they are included in this press release because they are principal factors upon which our management assesses performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are set forth below. The non-GAAP measures presented in this release are not measures of performance under GAAP. These measures should not be considered as alternatives for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Other companies in our industry may define these non-GAAP measures differently than we do and, as a result, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies; and certain of our non-GAAP financial measures exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Given the inherent uncertainty regarding special items and other expenses in any future period, a reconciliation of forward-looking financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is not feasible. The magnitude of these items, however, may be significant.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share Reconciliation Three Months Ended\nJanuary 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) per common share (GAAP) Diluted $ 0.21 $ (0.11 ) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, impact (0.14 ) — Restructuring 0.05 — Amortization of intangibles 0.02 0.02 Legal and professional fees 0.01 0.06 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.15 $ (0.03 )\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Three Months Ended\nJanuary 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) (GAAP) $ 4,858 $ (2,018 ) Depreciation and amortization 10,117 9,718 Interest expense, net 2,335 4,810 Provision for income taxes (3,058 ) (76 ) EBITDA (non-GAAP) 14,252 12,434 Restructuring 1,514 — Legal and professional fees 284 1,543 Stock compensation expense 516 397 Asset impairment — 41 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 16,566 $ 14,415 Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) 6.7 % 5.8 %\nSHILOH INDUSTRIES, INC.
