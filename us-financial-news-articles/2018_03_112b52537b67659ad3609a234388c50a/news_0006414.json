Four times Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton says Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas will have no excuses this season.\nFormula One - Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - Yas Marina circuit, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates - November 26, 2017 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas after the race REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah Asked after testing in Spain whether he expected the 28-year-old Finn to be harder to beat now that he has settled in at the title-winning team he joined in January last year, the Briton paused to consider the question.\n“No,” replied world champion Hamilton, who has won three of his titles with Mercedes and is Britain’s most successful driver of all time.“But I would say that about anyone, it’s nothing about Valtteri.\n“It’s difficult coming to a new team and learning new ways, new controls and now he’s gone through the whole learning process and he’s going to hit the ground running.\n“So there’s no more excuses for sure.”\nBottas, who joined from Williams at short notice after 2016 champion Nico Rosberg retired, won three of the 20 races last season.\nBut he suffered something of a slump after the August break before again picking up strongly once Hamilton had won the championship in Mexico.\nThe Finn ended the year by winning from pole in Abu Dhabi, with the fastest lap also, and emerged from this week’s first pre-season test in Barcelona with more mileage under his belt than his team mate whose track time was limited by bad weather.\nFormula One -

I assume so. I’d have to assume he’s going to be in the best shape possible. But then again, so am I.”\nThe season starts in Australia on March 25.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T17:21:04.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
