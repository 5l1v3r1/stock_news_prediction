Zurbay has joined its board of directors.\nZurbay brings 28 years of executive leadership and financial experience primarily from the healthcare sector. He previously served as the vice president and chief financial officer of St. Jude Medical, Inc., a Fortune 500 medical device company. During his tenure at St. Jude Medical, Zurbay helped lead the company through significant growth and expansion to a revenue of more than $6 billion, including 19 acquisitions, and Abbott’s acquisition of St. Jude Medical for $25 billion. Prior to St. Jude Medical, Zurbay spent 10 years in public accounting at Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Zurbay holds a Bachelor of Science in business from the University of Minnesota and is a licensed certified public accountant.\n“Don is a respected cardiovascular device leader with substantial experience driving rapid commercial growth and financial direction,” said Erica Rogers, president and chief executive officer of Silk Road Medical. “His guidance will be invaluable as we continue to establish TCAR as the standard of care for people with carotid artery disease.”\n“Silk Road Medical has modernized the treatment of carotid artery disease and protection against stroke,” Zurbay said. “I look forward to being part of a rapidly growing company in a disease category with a multi-billion dollar market potential. Opportunities like these are rare, and I am excited to work with the outstanding team at Silk Road Medical and its board to make that a reality.”\nAbout Carotid Artery Disease and Stroke\nEvery year, 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, sometimes known as a “brain attack.” Nearly 6 million die and another 5 million are left permanently disabled. Stroke is the second leading cause of disability globally, yet up to 80 percent can be prevented through healthy lifestyle habits and management of other medical conditions, including carotid artery disease. Ischemic strokes account for 80-90 percent of strokes, and an estimated 20-30 percent of these are caused by plaque buildup in the carotid arteries that carry blood to the brain. If left untreated, these blockages can fragment, flow to the brain and lead to a stroke.\nAbout TCAR with the ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection and Stent System\nTCAR (TransCarotid Artery Revascularization) is a clinically proven procedure combining surgical principles of neuroprotection with minimally invasive endovascular techniques to treat blockages in the carotid artery at risk of causing a stroke. The ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent is intended to be used in conjunction with the ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System (NPS) during the TCAR procedure. The ENROUTE Transcarotid NPS is a first in class device used to directly access the common carotid artery and initiate high rate temporary blood flow reversal to protect the brain from stroke while delivering and implanting the ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent.\nAbout Silk Road Medical\nSilk Road Medical, Inc. is a private company located in Sunnyvale, California, that develops and manufactures less-invasive medical devices intended to improve the treatment of vascular disease through proprietary transcarotid therapies.
