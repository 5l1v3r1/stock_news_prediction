In December, creditors approved a plan giving them much of Oi’s equity, and a Brazilian judge approved it in January, despite objections of some shareholders. \nThe restructuring resulted in 21 billion reais in negative adjustments to the company’s net equity in 2017, although that is not expected to affect its cash position or “routine” EBITDA for 2016 or 2017, Oi said in its statement on Wednesday. \nThose adjustments will give Oi negative net equity as of December 2017, although the company expects to return to positive territory for 2018. $1 = 3.3206 reais Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T03:03:34.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
