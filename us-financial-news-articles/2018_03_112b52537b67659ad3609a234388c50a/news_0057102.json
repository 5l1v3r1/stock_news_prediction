(“Mustang”) (NASDAQ:MBIO), a Fortress Biotech (NASDAQ:FBIO) Company focused on the development of novel immunotherapies based on proprietary chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cell (CAR T) technology, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nManuel Litchman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mustang, said, “Mustang achieved significant corporate and clinical progress in 2017. Notably, we completed a $95 million private placement financing, expanded our CAR T pipeline with the in-licensing of four new therapies, and entered into a collaboration with Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for the development of CRISPR/Cas9-enhanced CAR T therapies. We ended the year with the presentation of data from an ongoing Phase 1 trial of our CD123-directed CAR MB-102 in an oral session at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December. These data demonstrated that MB-102 achieved the first complete response from a CAR T therapy in a BPDCN patient, and an additional complete response in AML.”\nDr. Litchman continued, “Mustang is already advancing on several key objectives in 2018, including building out our CAR T cell processing facility to be fully operational and ready to process cells by the end of the year. We are also transitioning two preclinical CAR T programs into the clinic at City of Hope and are preparing to file our first IND during the fourth quarter. In addition, we will continue to explore opportunities to strengthen and differentiate our CAR T pipeline with the in-licensing of new technologies and product candidates.”\nFinancial Results:\nAs of December 31, 2017, Mustang’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments (certificates of deposit), and restricted cash totaled $61.5 million, compared to $67.3 million as of September 30, 2017, and $27.5 million as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5.8 million for the fourth quarter and an increase of $34.0 million year-to-date. Research and development expenses were $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to $2.5 million for 2016. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses included in research and development were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.0 million for 2016. Research and development expenses from license acquisitions totaled $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6.1 million for 2016. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses included in research and development – licenses acquired were $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.4 million for 2016. General and administrative expenses were $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to $2.8 million for 2016. Non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses included in general and administrative expenses were $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.9 million for 2016. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $31.3 million, or $1.24 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $12.7 million, or $1.15 per share, for 2016.\n2017 and Recent Corporate Highlights:\nMustang completed a private placement financing that raised aggregate gross proceeds totaling $95.1 million, $56.0 million of which was raised in 2017. In June 2017, Mustang announced exclusive, worldwide licensing agreements with City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”) for the use of three CAR T therapies in the development of cancer treatments: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 CAR T technology (“HER2”) for initial application in glioblastoma multiforme; CS1‐specific CAR T technology (“CS1”) to be directed against multiple myeloma; and prostate stem cell antigen CAR T technology (“PSCA”) for the treatment of prostate, pancreatic, bladder and gastric cancers. In August 2017, Mustang’s common stock commenced trading on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “MBIO.” In September 2017, Mustang announced an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“Fred Hutch”) for CD20-specific CAR T technology (“CD20”). As part of the transaction, Mustang entered into an investigator-initiated clinical trial agreement to provide partial funding for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial at Fred Hutch evaluating the safety and efficacy of the CD20 technology in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The trial began recruiting participants in the fourth quarter of 2017. In October 2017, Mustang announced that COH received a $12.8 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to fund an ongoing Phase 1 study of Mustang’s MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐specific CAR T cells) for the treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory malignant glioma, including glioblastoma. Also, in October 2017, Mustang entered into a lease agreement with UMass Medicine Science Park in Worcester, Massachusetts, for a cell processing facility to support the clinical development and commercialization of Mustang’s CAR T product candidates. The facility is expected to be operational in late 2018. In December 2017, Mustang entered into a license agreement with Harvard University and a sponsored research agreement with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for the development of CRISPR/Cas9-enhanced CAR T therapies for the treatment of cancer. Also in December 2017, COH presented initial data from an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of MB-102 (CD123 CAR) in acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (“BPDCN”) during an oral session at the American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting. These data demonstrated that MB-102 achieved the first complete response from a CAR T therapy in BPDCN, and an additional complete response in AML.\nAbout Mustang Bio\nMustang Bio, Inc.
