That includes allegations of fraud by food producers to avoid safety checks.\n“We follow all rules of the World Trade Organization and do not practice dumping,” Francisco Turra, head of ABPA, said in a statement. “We will do everything in our power to maintain Brazil’s partnership with China, which resumed in 2009.”\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said last year that Brazil accounted for more than 50 percent of broiler product supplies to China, the world’s No. 2 poultry consumer, between 2013 and 2016.
