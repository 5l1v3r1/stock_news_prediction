The company previously expressed sympathy for Herzberg's family and said it would cooperate with investigators.\nThere was no indication that Herzberg's relatives had filed a lawsuit against Uber in connection with the crash, which Tempe police and federal agencies are investigating.\nOn March 21, Tempe police released a 22-second video showing Herzberg walking from a darkened area onto a street just before an Uber SUV strikes her. The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck Herzberg, police said.\nThe human backup driver appears to be looking down until just before impact.\nThe fatal crash in Tempe was the first pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving vehicle in the United States.\nUber suspended its autonomous vehicle testing program in Arizona, California, Pittsburgh and Toronto after the crash. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey suspended the company's testing privileges Monday.\nOn Thursday, he said he wants local and federal law enforcement to complete their investigation before commenting about the crash, though he reiterated his support for the development of self-driving vehicles.\n\"We are working with the organizations that are investigating this,\" Ducey said. \"We are also going to continue to work on making our roads and highways safer. We believe autonomous vehicles can help do that.\"\nDucey, a Republican, said in a letter to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi that video footage of the crash raised concerns about the company's ability to safely test its technology in Arizona. Ducey said he expects public safety to be the top priority for those who operate self-driving cars.\n\"The incident that took place on March 18 is an unquestionable failure to comply with this expectation,\" Ducey said.\nDucey previously welcomed Uber and other autonomous vehicle companies to use Arizona as a place for testing under few, if any, regulations.\nIn early March, he authorized self-driving vehicle companies to run tests without a person in the car to act as a safety operator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:59:59.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
