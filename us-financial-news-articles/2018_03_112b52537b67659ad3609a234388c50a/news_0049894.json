For the moment it is looking like both WTI and Brent are stalling,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\nWednesday’s price falls came despite top exporter Saudi Arabia saying it was working with top producer Russia on a historic long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years.\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering greatly extending a short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices.\n“We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10 to 20 year agreement,” the crown prince told Reuters in an interview in New York late on Monday.\nAxiTrader’s McKenna said such an agreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia “effectively means an expansion” of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader but in which Russia is not a member.\nIn Asia, Shanghai crude oil futures saw their third day of trading continuing with high volume but also volatility.\nSpot Shanghai crude futures were down by 4.4 percent on Wednesday, to 407.5 yuan ($64.93)per barrel by 0201 GMT.\nIn dollar-terms, that puts Chinese crude prices significantly below Brent and only slightly above U.S. WTI.\nMcKenna said he hoped Shanghai crude “gets a lot of traction and we end up with three established global benchmarks”, but he cautioned that “the first couple of days have been volatile.” ($1 = 6.2760 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin and Aaron Sheldrick\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:17:33.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
