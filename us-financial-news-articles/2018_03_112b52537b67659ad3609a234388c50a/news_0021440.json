Analysts had on average forecast 652 million euros.\nThe company said it expected to achieve percentage growth in adjusted EBITDA in the low double digits in 2018, while revenue would grow in the low to mid single-digit percentage range.\nDigital now accounts for more than three-quarters of Springerâ€™s profits, while a slowdown at print has triggered ructions that led to a recent editorial shakeout at its flagship tabloid daily Bild.
