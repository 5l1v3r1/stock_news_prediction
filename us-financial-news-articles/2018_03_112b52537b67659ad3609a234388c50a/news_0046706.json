It also says a split would raise the value for all shareholders because regulated assets are typically valued at higher multiples than power production.\nCEZ says such a split could raise its combined market capitalisation, now at $13.1 billion (10.56 billion euros), by about 2.6 billion euros. The committee said on Monday it would make a recommendation to cabinet by May for a decision in June.\n“The sequence should be following: investment and financing model and only after that let’s talk about movement of assets, and about the form of the company that the government would buy,” Huner told reporters.\n“We as the state are not opposing buying some CEZ assets, there are about seven options from nuclear plants, or possibly coal plants, the prime minister mentioned he would like to see distribution here as well.”\nThe country’s special envoy for nuclear energy, Jan Stuller, said alongside Huner experts advising the committee were leaning toward having the state invest in the new plant.\nThis could include the state taking over some CEZ assets.\nCEZ Chief Executive Daniel Benes told Reuters and Bloomberg last week that he would like a decision by mid-2018 on the company’s transformation plans.\n1 euro = $1.2405 Reporting by Jan Lopatka\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:38:45.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
