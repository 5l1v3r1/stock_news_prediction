And, initially, many of Trump's moves benefited them.\n\"The combination of corporate tax cuts and repatriation were huge boosts to all the bottom lines of companies, not just the domestic ones,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"You could sense how much confidence there was when Congress passed the tax bill.\"\nBut then came the tariffs , an anti-free-trade move that shocked much of the U.S. elite, even as Cramer thought some restrictions were justified.\nHe said that every year in China, millions of the country's 1.3 billion people become wealthy enough to buy iPhones or travel on Boeing airplanes.\n\"Sure, the Chinese may steal our trade secrets. Yes, they take our manufacturing jobs, but boy, oh boy, do our companies make money there. Starbucks is huge in China . FedEx is the shipping company of choice for their exports,\" Cramer said.\nCompanies like FedEx now feel threatened that the president, determined to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, has potentially thrown their China operations into jeopardy, Cramer explained.\n\"The idea of a $1 tariff on Starbucks coffee, something I asked CEO Kevin Johnson about, seemed fanciful 18 months ago. Now it seems plausible,\" he continued. \"FedEx planes may be made to sit on the tarmac while Chinese shippers roll on.\"\nSo now, after years of Washington and Wall Street favoring free trade, fears of a legitimate trade war are now trickling into the market narrative, the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"Of course the stock market gets crushed, because nearly everyone with money in this country thinks this policy is lunacy, so they're freaking out and turning seller,\" Cramer said. \"That's what today's breakdown was about.\"\nWATCH: Cramer explains how the 1 percent affected the sell-off show chapters Cramer: This decline isn't about the Fed.
