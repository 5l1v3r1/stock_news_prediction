(NASDAQ:FCSC), a gene therapy company focused on transformational autologous cell-based therapies for skin and connective tissue diseases, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and recent operational highlights. Fibrocell will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\n“We are pleased with the substantial progress of our gene therapy candidates that continues to advance and positions us to achieve important milestones in 2018,” said John Maslowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fibrocell. “In January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted us allowance to enroll pediatric patients in the Phase 2 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a key milestone for the program.”\n“In addition, we completed necessary pre-clinical studies for FCX-013, our product candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. We used the data to support our submission of an Investigational New Drug Application to the FDA in January 2018, and in March, the FDA allowed the IND for FCX-013 to progress to clinical trials,” said Mr. Maslowski.\nRecent program highlights and new updates are as follows:\nFCX-007\nFibrocell reported interim results from three adult patients in the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) in the third quarter of 2017. Data from three adult NC1+ patients showed FCX-007 was well-tolerated through 12 weeks post-administration. No serious adverse events and no product-related adverse events were reported. In addition to encouraging interim safety data, positive early trends were noted in wound healing and pharmacology signals. The Data Safety Monitoring Board for the trial reviewed the interim data and concluded that safety and potential benefit were established, and allowed continuation of enrollment and dosing.\nFibrocell completed dosing of the fourth adult patient and performed additional dosing of existing adult patients in the Phase 1 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fibrocell expects to report additional interim adult data and provide a trial update in the second quarter of 2018.\nIn January 2018, Fibrocell obtained allowance from the FDA to initiate enrollment of pediatric patients in the Phase 2 portion of its Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007, based on evidence of safety and potential benefit of FCX-007 in adult patients dosed in the Phase 1 portion of the clinical trial. Fibrocell plans to enroll six patients ages seven and older in the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. One RDEB adult patient has been enrolled in Phase 2, and dosing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018. Enrollment of Phase 2 patients is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. Another interim data report and trial update is expected in the first quarter of 2019.\nFibrocell’s existing, current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) cell therapy manufacturing facility in Exton, PA has been designated as the production site for FCX-007 after incorporation into the IND application. FCX-007 drug product dosed in the fourth quarter of 2017 was produced and distributed from this facility.\nFCX-013\nIn December 2017, Fibrocell completed the toxicology/biodistribution study of FCX-013. Data from this study showed no test article-related clinical observations, body weight changes, changes in clinical pathology parameters, gross observations or organ weight change. In addition, there was no significant vector biodistribution to target organs.\nIn March 2018, Fibrocell obtained FDA allowance of the IND for FCX-013 to progress to clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. Fibrocell expects to initiate enrollment in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-013 in the third quarter of 2018.\nCorporate\nOn December 11, 2017, Fibrocell closed an underwritten public offering for the sale of $10.5 million of the Company’s common stock and accompanying stock warrants. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of approximately $9.3 million from the financing for the continued clinical development of FCX-007 and FCX-013 and for other general corporate purposes.\nFinancial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Fibrocell reported a diluted net loss of $1.33 per share, compared to a diluted net loss of $1.18 per share for the same period in 2016.\nThe 2017 period included approximately $4.9 million of non-cash warrant revaluation income, as compared to approximately $11.9 million of non-cash warrant revaluation income for the same period in 2016. Additionally, the 2017 period included non-cash deemed dividends on Series A preferred stock of approximately $4.1 million increasing net loss attributable to common stockholders. No non-cash deemed dividends were recorded in the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses increased 1% to approximately $12.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $12.1 million for the same twelve-month period in 2016. This increase was due primarily to increased costs related to the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007 and increased pre-clinical development costs related to FCX-013. These increases were partially offset by reduced compensation and employee related expenses in the 2017 period as a result of our restructuring related initiatives implemented in June 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased 30.9% to approximately $6.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $9.8 million for the same twelve-month period in 2016. This decrease was due primarily to reduced compensation and employee related expenses, all due to reductions in management staffing made in the last half of 2016 and in early 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $17.4 million and working capital of approximately $13.5 million. Fibrocell used approximately $17.0 million in cash for operations during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $29.4 million used for the same twelve-month period in 2016.\nThe Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.\nConference Call and Webcast\nTo participate on the live call, please dial 800-239-9838 (domestic) or +1-323-794-2551 (international), and provide the conference code 6756079 five to ten minutes before the start of the call.
