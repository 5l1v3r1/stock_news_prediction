(NYSE: RNGR) (“Ranger” or the “Company”) announced today its results for its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe highlights for Q4 2017 were:\nThe Company began to raise high-spec rig hourly rates in response to higher demand and labor costs. The Company launched its completion wireline business in the Permian Basin. Four trucks were put into service during the quarter and another two have been delivered thus far in 2018. In January 2018, the Company purchased 15 well testing spreads to launch a new complementary service line. Well testing fits into the Company’s focus on delivering a solutions-based approach to best meet its customers’ completion needs. The Company made significant progress integrating assets acquired in the acquisition of ESCO Leasing, LLC, an affiliate of Energy Service Company of Bowie, Inc. (the “ESCO Acquisition”) via re-aligning the management structure and systems.\nFinancial highlights for Q4 2017 were:\nRevenues of $50.1 million for Q4 2017, a sequential increase of 22% from $41.1 million in Q3 2017. Net loss of $5.6 million for Q4 decreased from a net loss of $9.5 million in Q3 2017 largely due to the reduction of non-cash interest expense from related party debt in Q4 as compared to Q3. Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased to $3.8 million for Q4, from $3.0 million in Q3, principally due to revenue growth partially offset by startup costs for the wireline business, year-end adjustments related to insurance and the year-end seasonal slowdown. Rig hours for Q4 increased 18% to approximately 69,800 for Q4 from 59,000 in Q3. The rig hours for rigs not part of the ESCO Acquisition were approximately 52,900 in Q4 versus 49,200 in Q3. Rig utilization as measured by average monthly hours per rig decreased to 179 hours in Q4 from 199 hours in Q3 due to the seasonal slowdown and having a full quarter of activity from the rigs acquired in the ESCO Acquisition. The average hourly rates for high-spec rigs increased to approximately $454 in Q4 from $444 in Q3.\n1 “Adjusted EBITDA” is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Please see “Ranger Energy Services, Inc. Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)” at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Darron Anderson, Ranger’s CEO, commented:\n“We experienced another dynamic quarter despite normal, year-end customer budget constraints and seasonal weather impact. Since the beginning of the year, we are seeing demand strengthening broadly across all basins. We remain focused on our strategy to be the premier, solutions-focused, high-spec rig provider of choice for horizontal completions and producing wells. During the quarter, we took delivery of six new high-spec rigs and launched our completions-focused wireline business in the Permian Basin. Subsequent to the quarter we purchased 15 well testing spreads to support our horizontal drill-out solution and further our expansion into the completions space. The ESCO integration is progressing well and we are seeing continued rig hour growth from that portion of our fleet thus far in 2018. With demand improving, we continue to increase pricing and remain optimistic as the market is still significantly below 2014 levels.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenues\nDuring the quarter, revenues increased to $50.1 million from $41.1 million in Q3. The increase was primarily attributable to the increased number of rig hours in the Well Services segment, representing the first full quarter following the ESCO Acquisition, and the startup of our new Permian Basin wireline business. The results by segment were as follows:\nWell Services revenue increased 22% to $47.7 million in Q4 from $39.0 million in Q3. Rig utilization, as measured by average monthly hours per rig, decreased to 179 from 199. Total rig hours increased to approximately 69,800 hours in Q4 from 59,000. For the quarter, the average number of rigs in our fleet increased to 130 rigs from 99 in Q3. The Company ended the fourth quarter with 135 rigs in its fleet of which 130 were ready for service and 105 were active. During the quarter, the Company had six new rigs delivered of which one was ready for service by the end of the quarter. Additional increases to revenue were principally due to our Permian Basin wireline business. Processing Solutions revenue increased slightly to $2.4 million from $2.1 million in Q3 mainly due to increased mobilization revenue.\nOperating Loss and Net Loss\nDuring the quarter, the operating loss increased to $5.2 million from $4.8 million in Q3. The $0.4 million increase was mainly due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses which were driven by the additional capital expenditures and represents a full quarter of results for the assets acquired in the ESCO Acquisition.\nDuring the quarter, net loss decreased by $3.9 million to $5.6 million from $9.5 million in Q3. The decrease was principally due to lower interest expense from related party debt which was converted to equity in connection with the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”), partly offset by depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $3.8 million in Q4 from $3.0 million in Q3. The increase was mainly due to increased revenues offset by start-up costs for our new wireline activities, adjustments related to insurance and the seasonal slowdown.\nLiquidity and Balance Sheet\nOperating Activities: Net cash used in operating activities was $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nInvesting Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This includes $47.7 million used for the ESCO Acquisition. Not included in these numbers were assets worth $24.5 million for non-cash additions and $10.7 million in assets purchased via capital lease financing during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities was $89.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised of $80.8 million of net proceeds from the IPO, $21.0 million in borrowings from related parties that were converted to equity as described below and $4.0 million of contributions from the Company’s previous parent, partially offset by repayment of long-term debt of $12.0 million.\nNot included in the numbers above are the following non-cash transactions. In connection with the IPO, the Company settled its related party debt of $21.0 million with the issuance of shares of its Class A and Class B common stock and a $3.0 million long-term liability payable to a related party that can be settled with Class A common stock. In connection with the ESCO Acquisition, the Company issued $5.0 million in shares of its Class A common stock and entered into notes payable to the seller with a principal amount of $7.0 million.\nIn addition, the Company entered into a $50 million revolving credit facility in conjunction with the IPO. The current borrowing capacity, based on eligible accounts receivable, is approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2017.\nPresentation\nThis press release presents historical results, (i) for the period prior to August 16, 2017, of Ranger Energy Services, LLC, and Torrent Energy Services, LLC, the predecessor of Ranger Energy Services, Inc. for financial reporting purposes and (ii) for the period subsequent to August 16, 2017, of Ranger Energy Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, net, tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, acquisition-related and severance costs, impairment of goodwill, costs incurred for IPO-related services and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because it allows for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net loss in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net loss determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The following table presents reconciliations of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, in millions:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 Change $ Net income (loss) $ (5.6 ) $ (9.5 ) $ 3.9 Interest expense, net 0.4 4.3 (3.9 ) Tax expense — 0.4 (0.4 ) Depreciation and amortization 6.1 4.1 2.0 Equity based compensation 0.4 0.2 0.2 Acquisition related and severance costs 2.2 2.2 — Costs incurred for offering related services 0.3 1.3 (1.0 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 3.8 $ 3.0 $ 0.8\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006748/en/\nRanger Energy Services, Inc.\nRobert S.
