Traders also said that because the market fell in early trade, the Bank of Japan had likely bought exchange traded funds (ETFs) to support the market, which has been pushed lower by fears of a global trade war. The Nikkei ended 0.7 percent higher at 20,766.10 points, after hitting an early low of 20,347.49, the weakest since late September. With the business year-end looming on March 31 for a majority of listed companies, some stocks were bought before they go ex-dividend on Tuesday. Index heavyweight stocks gained ground, with Fanuc rising 2.2 percent, Fast Retailing adding 1.3 percent and Daikin Industries surging 2.2 percent. Drugmakers outperformed. Astellas Pharma and Eisai both gained 1.4 percent. The broader Topix advanced 0.4 percent to 1,671.32.
