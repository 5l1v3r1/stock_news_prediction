They have a stated desire to complete that by the end of the year,” Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, told Reuters in a telephone interview. “I’m actually fairly confident that it can get done.” \nKremer said a significant amount of preliminary work had already been done by teams from both countries on the scope and content of the follow-on agreement. He gave no details on the possible value of the second deal.
