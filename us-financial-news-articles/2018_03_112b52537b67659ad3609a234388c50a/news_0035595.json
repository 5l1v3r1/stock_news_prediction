The responsible entity of the Fund is One Managed Investment Funds Limited ( Responsible Entity ). The Responsible Entity, on behalf of the Fund, is seeking to raise a maximum of $350 million through the initial public offer. GCI will act as manager to the Fund.\nThe Fund has a current target return of 5% per annum, equivalent to the RBA cash rate plus 3.5%; distributions will be floating rate and paid monthly.\nGCIT provides a unique opportunity for investors to access a portfolio of secured wholesale bonds in an ASX listed vehicle managed by a specialist fund manager. The Fund fills a gap in the market for stable monthly income whilst preserving capital through a combination of portfolio diversification and more importantly secured debt securities. Specifically, investors will for the first time have direct access to Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Asset Backed Securities (ABS), markets that have been solely the preserve of institutional investors in Australia.\nThe Fund's strategy will combine the disciplines and processes of two of GCI's existing institutional funds. Secured Opportunities (commenced April 2015) and Investment Grade Securitised (commenced September 2016) strategies managed for wholesale investors that have returned 6.93% and 5.31% net of fees per annum respectively since inception.\nJoint Arrangers and Lead Managers to the transaction Morgans and NAB, believe that GCI’s strong track record and deep experience in this specialist fixed income sector, make this a compelling offer for investors looking to increase portfolio diversification. The long term support of their institutional clients is testament to GCI's expertise and track record of delivering capital stability as well as stable and predictable returns. We are pleased to now have the opportunity to provide retail investors with access to this specialist investment manager and strategy.\nAshley Burtenshaw, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of GCI, said “Australian investor portfolios are overweight cash having gravitated towards stable bank deposits that provide low returns as a result of the record low RBA cash rate. We are pleased to provide investors with a stable alternative, that provides both capital protection, through investment in a diversified portfolio of asset backed securities, along with a strong targeted monthly income.”\nDetails of the Offer\nThe Responsible Entity, on behalf of the Fund, is offering up to 175 million new units at $2.00 per unit, to raise $350 million ( Offer ). The minimum subscription is $100 million.\nGryphon Group will pay the costs of the offer such that the net asset value of each unit at listing is equivalent to the application price of $2.00 per unit.\nTo participate in the Offer\nThe Offer is being made under a product disclosure statement lodged with ASIC on 6 March 2018 ( PDS ) and is available on the Fund’s website www.gcapinvest.com/GCI .
