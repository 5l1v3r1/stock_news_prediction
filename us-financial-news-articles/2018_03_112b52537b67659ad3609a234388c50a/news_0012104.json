REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo The cash and shares deal to combine Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, with Booker, the country’s largest wholesaler, received court approval on Friday and is now in effect. The deal received regulatory approval in December and both sets of shareholders backed the plan last Wednesday. Booker shares have now been de-listed from the London Stock Exchange. For each Booker share Tesco offered 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash. Tesco shares closed Friday at 202 pence.
