The victims claimed the state had knowledge of unsafe conditions at the mine for decades and failed to protect workers. \nNational Indemnity BRK.A, -0.08% BRK.B, -0.12% provided general liability insurance to the state between 1973 and 1975. It argued those insurance policies didn’t cover the asbestos-related claims. \nJudge Holly Brown said in a state district court ruling on March 1 that National Indemnity breached its duty to defend the state from lawsuits related to the Libby mine. \nBerkshire, a conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, has taken on growing responsibility for asbestos-related insurance claims in recent years. Insurers including Liberty Mutual and American International Group Inc. AIG, -1.24% have paid Berkshire billions of dollars to take responsibility for future asbestos claims tied to past policies, in an arrangement known as retroactive reinsurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T15:32:12.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
