It got worse when she moved into information technology, she said.\n“I was used to being one of just a handful of women but I wasn’t used to being the only woman in the room, which is actually what it looked like on the computer science side,” she said.\n“Having less women in the field had an impact on women aspiring to go into computer science because they didn’t see other women there.”\nSilicon Valley tech companies started releasing workforce diversity figures in 2014. But progress has been slow, underscoring the challenge of transforming cultures that critics say are too homogenous, white and male-dominated.\nGoogle’s percentage of African American employees in the United States did not move at all in 2015 from 2014, remaining at 2 percent, despite initiatives such as using work time to teach at historically black colleges and universities.\nWomen made up 31 percent of Google’s overall workforce in 2015, up 1 percent from 2014. Figures for the number of black female employees were not available.\nFacebook reported in mid-2017 that its black U.S. workforce had increased to 3 percent from 2 percent in one year, after it held its first Black Leadership Day and set up the TechPrep website to promote computer science careers among minorities.\n“We’re not interested in diversity for diversity’s sake,” Facebook’s diversity director Maxine Williams said in a phone interview.\n“We are interested in it because we understand how it helps us make better decisions, build better products.”\nCOMPLETELY CHANGED Black Girls Code classes engage pupils by letting them loose on whatever excites them - building a fashion website, solving a robotics problem or addressing a community issue.\nThousands of girls have attended, either paying $35 per day or attending for free if they are eligible.\nThree-quarters of Bryant’s funding comes from recognized corporates, such as the delivery service FedEx and car maker GM, which is investing in tech jobs to develop self-driving cars.\nBryant sees a clear business case for diversity.\n“If companies want to survive and stay relevant they must have a diverse staff that is connected in a cultural way to the communities they are trying to reach and are trying to sell to as customers,” she said.\nFive years after taking part in Black Girls Code, 18-year-old Taylor is in her first year of a computer science degree at California State University and is focused on a career programming computer games.\n“Before that first session, I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I grew up. It completely changed who I was,” she said.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Katy Migiro.
