REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes Asked in an interview on France’s BFM Business whether mergers could happen to reinforce the alliance, Ghosn said:“Why not”, before adding that that this was not“an objective in itself.”\nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said on Thursday it would speed up the convergence between the three companies on how they work in key areas, as part of a broader plan to deliver cost savings and boost profits.\nAsked about automaker Geely’s purchase of a $9 billion stake in Mercedes maker Daimler, which emerged earlier this week, Ghosn said the Chinese’s group’s“strategy was a little difficult to understand.”\nReporting by Gwenaelle Barzic, Writing by Sarah White, Editing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T09:44:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
