The work stoppage ended when the union agreed to extend the previous contract for 18 months.\nThe possible early talks were confirmed by Tapia in a telephone interview with Reuters. The union has “been given the mandate to explore an anticipated negotiation,” he said.\nIn the middle of the month, Escondida invited the union to begin early negotiations. Labor leaders held an assembly of workers which resulted in the decision to accept the offer.\nThe current labor deal expires on July 31.
