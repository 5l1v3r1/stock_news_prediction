The minority party needs to gain 24 seats to take a majority in the House.\nBiden, a native of northeast Pennsylvania, heads to the western part of the state Tuesday to campaign for the 33-year-old Lamb. Democrats hope the plain-spoken Biden can appeal to blue-collar voters in the district.\nThe former vice president will speak at a Lamb rally with union members, followed by another public rally with campaign supporters.\nMeanwhile, Trump will hold a campaign-style rally in the district Saturday night.

Trump hopes his protectionist move will appeal to voters in the 18th District.

Trump's tariff decision has highlighted divisions on trade within both the Republican and Democratic parties .\nTwo separate polls for the special election last month showed Saccone with a 6 and 3 percentage point lead, respectively.\nLamb raised more than $3.3 million in the first seven weeks of the year, five times what Saccone raised . Saccone has received a major boost from outside organizations linked to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump.\nOutside groups have spent $6.9 million opposing Lamb and $2.4 million supporting Saccone so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, while putting only a little over a million toward both supporting Lamb and opposing Saccone.\nThe pro-House GOP Congressional Leadership Fund has largely attacked Lamb by highlighting his opposition to the GOP tax plan and tying him to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Pete Sessions, as \"lean Republican\" districts.\nThe 7th District primary has exposed fault lines in the Democratic Party. House Democrats' campaign arm published an opposition memo about progressive candidate Laura Moser, who had drawn support from allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nLast week, the pro-Republican Congressional Leadership Fund released a poll showing Moser in second place in the primary , garnering 17 percent of support and in position to make a runoff in no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote. Republicans appear to hope a progressive Democratic candidate would have a tougher time winning in the Texas district.\n\"Despite the DCCC's attacks, progressive champion Laura Moser is surging, proving that their party is run by progressive liberals, not the D.C. Democrats intent on making their candidates Republican-lite,\" the Congressional Leadership Fund's executive director, Corry Bliss, said in a statement, referring to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nMeanwhile, Cruz and Democratic Rep.
