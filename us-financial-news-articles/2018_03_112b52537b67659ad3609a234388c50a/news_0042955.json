It shouldn't have happened anywhere, and we feel like it's time to make change and get gun reform.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Banning military-style weapons and more protections for our schools.\"\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"At first nobody really knew what it was because the fire drill had went off. So most people were going out for the fire drill, and then people heard the code red, but some people heard it too late. So it was just a lot of confusion. And then after, it was just mostly shock hearing how many people died and how quickly it happened.\"\nBEN STEWART, 17\nSCHOOL: Shiloh Hills Christian School in Kennesaw, Georgia\nMARCHED IN: Atlanta\nWHY ATTEND? \"People have been dying since 1999 in Columbine, and nothing has changed. People are still dying. Columbine isn't even on the top 10 list of mass shootings in America. Something needs to change.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I'd like to see commonsense gun laws introduced. It would be preferable if there was a semi-automatic rifle ban. ... If you look at ... school shootings, the majority of them are with legally purchased weapons. So yeah, criminals will get weapons, but you could still do something. It's better than doing nothing.\"\nCECILIA MCCOY, 17\nSCHOOL: Assumption High School in Louisville, Kentucky\nMARCHED IN: Washington, D.C.\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here for the students, for gun control — honestly just for everyone. This is not just for students. Everywhere you go, there is a threat of guns.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Stricter gun laws and to get rid of assault rifles.\"\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"In Kentucky, there have been multiple school threats. In Marshall County, there was one. I wasn't there, but I knew people that go there, so it did affect home.\"\nBRAXTON SHEWALTER, 17\nSCHOOL: Columbia Falls High School in Columbia Falls, Montana\nRALLIEDIN: Helena, Montana, at a pro-gun event\nWHY ATTEND? \"We are here to advocate for the Second Amendment. We are here for the millions of responsible gun owners in the United States and around the world. ... I've been an NRA member since I was little. ... That's just kind of our way of life down here, to own a gun. Almost everyone has one. ... Our voices deserve to be heard too.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Anyone can have their own opinion. I believe that everybody has their own right to go out for what they believe in. But all we're trying to do is advocate and show there are, you know, responsible gun owner in the United States. There's 320 million people in the United States. One mass shooting happens, and they think that everyone in the U.S. in some way has to be held accountable for it.\"\nBROOKE SOLOMON, 15\nSCHOOL: Cass Technical High School in Detroit\nMARCHED IN: Detroit\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here today marching for the thousands of under-represented black and brown kids, especially in Detroit. I just want to see change.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I'm looking for tougher gun laws and legislation that includes banning semi-automatic and assault weapons, that includes background checks for all gun sales and gun restraining orders.\"\nCHARLIE SHEBS, 16\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\nMARCHED IN: Washington, D.C.\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because previous generations couldn't do what we're doing right now. And we want to make this time the last time. So if that means marching all over the world, then I want to be a part of it.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I want to see safer schools. I don't want to hear that kids don't feel safe at schools. ... I want to see change in gun laws, and I want to see control. We're giving it to people who, it's just not safe. There's no other way to put it, really.\"\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"The shots just kept coming and coming. And I thought it was still a drill because they said we were going to have a drill, and then everyone started screaming along with the shots. And I was locked in the classroom on top of a printer for a good hour and a half. (When we were able to leave), I saw bodies everywhere, and there were just splatters on the wall. They actually told us to put our heads down and hands on the people's shoulders in front of us, and it was very hard not to look around at the bullet holes in the wall. The only way to get out of the building was to step in blood and over bodies.\"\nMAYA MCENTYRE, 15\nSCHOOL: Northville High School in Northville, Michigan\nMARCHED IN: Detroit\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm really tired of being afraid at school. When I come to school, I don't want to have to look for the nearest exit.\"\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"My school hasn't had any threats that I know of. ... I don't want to have a problem like that. I want to get to the problem before it gets to me.\"\nGRACE BENDER, 17\nSCHOOL: Capital High School in Helena, Montana\nMARCHED IN: Helena, Montana\nWHY ATTEND? \"My family are all gun owners, and I've been around guns my whole life. And I think that it's absolutely necessary for people who own guns who are responsible gun owners to also be advocating for this because I don't think there are two sides. I think that if you want to find solutions, you can do that really easily.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I don't want to wake up to another headline that says 20 kids died in a school shooting. I don't want people like the Parkland shooter to be able to get access to guns like he did. I just want to feel safe in schools. I don't want to have to keep doing shooter drills. That's what I want to see change, really.\"\nCESAR ALVARADO, 18\nSCHOOL: Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California\nMARCHED IN: Los Angeles\nWHY ATTEND? \"I am marching for those whose voices have been silenced.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"More gun control in areas that don't have it and banning of assault rifles.\"\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"I have not, but I can sympathize for those who have, and it's just sad to see people's hearts have been broken (because of) gun violence.\"\nTALIA RUMSKY, 16\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\nMARCHED IN: Washington, D.C.\nWHY ATTEND? \"Because we keep chanting, 'Never again,' 'Enough is enough,' 'Never again.' But it's already happened again. It happened in Maryland. There was a shooting in (Napa County, California). So I'm really here to make sure we can make our voices heard; so people are empowered to make sure we vote in legislators so this doesn't happen again; so we can avenge those who were stolen from us because someone thought it was OK to own weapons of mass destruction.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I definitely want people to vote in new legislators that will help us pass bills that will include banning high-capacity magazines, banning certain semi and automatic assault rifles — and not just focusing on school safety but focusing in on gun violence as a whole.\"\nADRIAN MAYAN, 13\nSCHOOL: Sacred Heart Academy in Redlands, California\nMARCHED IN: Los Angeles\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here to represent the people who died in the several shootings that happened recently, and I'm here to represent those who can't be here and to make changes in the government.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I hope many government officials are able to open their eyes to change gun laws in this country.\"\nKAYLA RENERT, 15\nSCHOOL: Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\nMARCHING IN: Washington, D.C.\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because I look at the younger kids and I look at the future generations, and I just never want them to have to go through what we went through and to experience what we saw and what we heard.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"Better gun laws and legislators voted into office that will actually do something about it and not just tell us, 'What you guys are doing is not going to do anything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm not going for (re-election).' We want people that actually care.\"\nWHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE DURING THE FEB. 14 SHOOTING AT YOUR SCHOOL? \"I remember getting a phone call from one of my best friends. She was in a closet. ... And I just remember her crying hysterically to me, and at that moment, I was heartbroken. I got a picture of one of my good friends. She was shot in the leg. Just seeing it, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It didn't feel real.\"\nZOE LOPEZ, 15\nSCHOOL: Pacifica High School in Garden Grove, California\nMARCHED IN: Los Angeles\nWHY ATTEND? \"I'm here because the people who died are the same age as me, and it's really important also because of my school, because we were supposed to have a walkout last Wednesday, and someone threatened our school so nobody showed up. And this Friday we had another one, and it was a big turnout. It was really great. And basically, my mom is a teacher, and I'm just always scared for her. ... I'm here to just spread awareness.\"\nWHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE CHANGE AS A RESULT? \"I hope to have more regulations on guns so that people like (Florida school shooting suspect) Nikolas Cruz aren't able to acquire them.\"\nHAVE YOU BEEN AT SCHOOL WHEN THERE WAS A SHOOTING OR OTHER TYPE OF GUN THREAT? \"We did get a threat, and there were arrests made, and it was really scary. All my friends were freaking out. It was a horrible, horrible experience, and nothing even happened. Just the fear itself was, like, awful.\"\nFauria reported from Los Angeles.
