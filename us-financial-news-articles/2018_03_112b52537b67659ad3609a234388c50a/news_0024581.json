The virus killed 36 out of 60 free-ranging birds reared within a temple complex in Samdrup Jongkhar. The remaining birds were slaughtered, the report said. “The birds were brought from unknown sources illegally and kept within the temple complex. The disease is so far confined within the temple complex owing to strict enforcement of control measures,” the report said.
