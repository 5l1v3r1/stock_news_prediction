REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo The move from the e-commerce giant comes nine months after it said it would offer a discount on its popular Prime subscription service for shoppers who receive U.S. government aid.\nTo qualify for the discounted $5.99 monthly Prime membership, customers must have a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer or Medicaid card and can renew it annually for up to four years, the company said.\nThe $12.99-per month or $99-per-year prime service offers users added perks like low prices and faster delivery for certain purchases and shipped over 5 billion items worldwide last year.\nAny push by Amazon into poorer demographics comes at a time when traditional brick-and-mortar suppliers like Walmart Inc have been fighting the online shopping giant’s arrival by seeking to attract more high-spending shoppers.\nThe Medicaid connection may also stir more nerves among healthcare companies worried about tentative moves by Amazon to sell and distribute some medical supplies and drugs.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T16:36:30.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
