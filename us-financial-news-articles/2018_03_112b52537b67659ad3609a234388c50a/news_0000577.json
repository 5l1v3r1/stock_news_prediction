Jimmy Vesey and Mika Zibanejad also scored for the visitors.\nRyan Spooner, acquired by the Rangers from the Boston Bruins in the Rick Nash trade, earned three assists. Defenseman Neal Pionk also had two helpers for New York. Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist posted 50 saves as the Canucks outshot the Rangers 55-27.\nBrock Boeser led the Canucks with two goals, while Daniel Sedin, Bo Horvat and Nikolay Goldobin also tallied for the Canucks. Horvat had two assists and Daniel Sedin had one. Brendan Leipsic, acquired Monday in a trade from Vegas, contributed two assists.\nSpooner and Namestnikov impressed early as they assisted on New York’s first two goals just 2:05 into the game.\nAfter Spooner dumped the puck into Vancouver’s zone, Hayes opened the scoring on a weak wraparound at 1:22. Namestnikov drew the second assist as Vesey deflected home a Pionk slap shot 43 seconds later.\nHayes scored his second goal by tipping in a Pionk wrist shot at 12:29. Spooner also assisted on that tally as he fed the puck to Pionk before the shot.\nWith New York on top 3-0, Vancouver starting goaltender Jacob Markstrom was replaced by Anders Nilsson. Markstrom finished with just two saves on five shots. Less than two minutes after the switch, Boeser converted a cross-ice pass from Horvat, reducing Vancouver’s deficit to 3-1.\nHorvat brought the Canucks within a goal with 48 seconds left in the first period as he put in Daniel Sedin’s rebound during a power play.\nDaniel Sedin created a 3-3 deadlock at 11:01 of the middle frame as he one-timed a pass from Henrik. However, Namestnikov restored the Rangers’ lead with a breakaway goal about four minutes later.\nGoldobin forged a 4-4 tie on a power play at 12:17 of the third period on a pass from Leipsic. However, a Goldobin giveaway enabled the Rangers to go ahead 5-4 on Zibanejad’s goal 2 1/2 minutes later.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:44:29.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
