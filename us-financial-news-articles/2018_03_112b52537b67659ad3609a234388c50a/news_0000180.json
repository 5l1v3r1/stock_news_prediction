Dozens of passengers were stranded on trains overnight in southern England.\nThe army was called in to help rescue hundreds of drivers stuck in the snow and to transport National Health Service workers. Roads were closed, schools shut and flights cancelled across Britain.\n“The Armed Forces are assisting emergency services in ensuring essential NHS staff are able to get to work and carry out their work in local communities,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said.\nThe army is“standing by to help the Police and civil authorities across the UK following heavy snowfall. We are also aware of Armed Forces personnel volunteering in their own time with their own vehicles to help those in need.” (Reporting by Conor Humphries and Guy Faulconbridge, Editing by William Maclean)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:34:00.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
