The decision means the 36-year-old will follow the same path as last year, when he also took two months off after the Miami Open, before returning to win Wimbledon. Federer’s loss to Kokkinakis was his second in six days, after falling to Juan Martin del Potro at Indian Wells. Kokkinakis is the lowest-ranked player to defeat a men's world number one since 178th-ranked Francisco Clavet beat Lleyton Hewitt in Miami 2003, the ATP Tour here said on its website.
