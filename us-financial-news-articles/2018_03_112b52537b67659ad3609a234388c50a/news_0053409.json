That’s obviously taking some pressure off the stock at the moment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director of New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\n“It’s enough to get some short covering, but as far as pouring in, most investors will wait until the dust settles.”\nThe sell-off in the sector has pushed S&P 500 technology index down 5.17 percent for the month, on track for its worst performance in nearly two years.\nThe broader markets have also suffered this month on a back-and-forth between the United States and China on tariffs and fears of rising interest rates. The main indexes are on track for their worst month since January 2016.\nComments from top officials in the United States and China had given a sense that both the countries would negotiate over President Donald Trump’s move to impose tariffs on Chinese goods.\nChina is expected to soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on US exports, its state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday.\nAt 8:43 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 71 points, S&P 500 e-minis rose 4.25 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis fell 17 points.\nTesla dropped about 3 percent after the U.S. government said it would investigate a fatal crash and vehicle fire of a Model X in California.\nApple fell 0.5 percent after a Goldman Sachs analyst cut sales estimate for iPhone for March- and June-quarter, citing weak demand.\nNetflix, Alphabet and Amazon were also down.\nBlackberry’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 5 percent after the company reported a smaller quarterly loss, helped by higher margins from software and services sales.\nLululemon Athletica surged about 8 percent after the Canadian athletic apparel maker posted a surprisingly strong fourth-quarter profit and forecast further growth in the first quarter.
