China has a massive excess production of steel and aluminum that is hurting not only the U.S. but global markets.\" \n\"But what we've done in firing this volley, firing this rocket of these new trade taxes is essentially ... turned our allies away from us. And caused them to be allies of China,\" said Holleyman. \"The country that's going to be hit the hardest by this is Canada,\" which could complicate talks among the U.S., Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA. \nThe big question is whether the Trump administration will give favored trade partners like Canada an exemption from the tariffs. show chapters 7 Hours Ago | 04:37 \n\"The way these things work is they'll carve out some exemptions,\" said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR, adding he does not believe the worst-case trade war scenario that slammed the stock market Thursday and early Friday will come to pass. \nStocks plunged strongly Thursday on trade war concerns because they're still in a fragile, \"corrective phase,\" Grant, a 40-year veteran of finance, told CNBC on Friday. \nBut with the tariffs not being implemented until what's expected to be next week, Grant said, \"I think they're going to back this down\" either through exemptions or modifications. \nAfter Thursday's Trump tariff announcement, stocks suffered a third straight session of sharp declines. However, ahead of Friday trading, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were each still about 5 percent above the early February lows, which briefly marked a correction in excess of 10 percent from the Jan. 26 all-time closing highs. \nThe Dow and S&P 500 were about flat for the year, as of Thursday's close, after a roaring start to 2018 following incredible gains last year. \nAdding to market fears, there are multiple media reports casting doubt on top Trump economic advisor Gary Cohn 's future after he was unable to convince the president not to impose steel and aluminium tariffs. \nThere's been speculation for months about whether or not Cohn may leave his post as director of the National Economic Council. Cohn, who was the No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs before joining the White House, is seen by Wall Street as a moderating voice in the administration.
