Trump said on Monday he would not back down.\nTrump was expected to finalise the planned tariffs later in the week, although some observers familiar with the process said it could occur next week.\nThe spectre of a trade war was not the only source of concern for the stock market.\nAs the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up.\nWhile moderate inflation generally supports equity investors, rapid inflation, or fear of it, could prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates faster, undermining the attraction of equities.\n“Given the importance of bond yields to equity valuation, equity investors are affected by potential changes in bond yields just as much as fixed-income investors,” said Colin Moore, Global Chief Investment Officer at Boston-based Columbia Threadneedle Investments.\n“In the current environment, although inflation appears to be increasing, it’s still not likely to cause 10-year yields to rise to levels that would be problematic for equities. I estimate that problematic level to be a 4 percent yield.”\nU.S. bond yields rose as Wall Street shares rallied. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose back to 2.888 percent from last week’s low of 2.793 percent. A break of last month’s peak of 2.957 percent could trigger fresh selling in Treasuries, traders say.\nIn the currency market, the euro traded at $1.2343, extending its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit on Thursday.\nThe euro managed to recover losses made on Monday after two anti-establishment leaders made early plays to govern Italy following an inconclusive election where voters shunted mainstream parties to the sidelines.\nAs none of the three main factions had enough seats to govern alone, President Sergio Mattarella is expected to open formal coalition talks in April, with early elections possible if no accord is found.\n“With any coalition that can be formed likely to have a right of centre bias, this ought to be bad for the euro but the German election result appears to have counterbalanced any detrimental effects. We are holding to our pre-election stance that this is not the time to be adding Italian risk,” said Paul Hatfield, Global Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alcentra, part of BNY Mellon Investment Management.\nThe dollar fetched 106.41 yen, up 0.2 percent for the day, crawling back from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday on improved risk appetite.\nThe Canadian dollar hit an eight-month low of C$1.3002 per U.S. dollar as U.S. President Donald Trump used proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium as a bargaining chip in talks to revamp NAFTA.\nThe Australian dollar was almost flat at $0.7773 after the Reserve bank of Australia kept its policy on hold as expected.\nCrude prices held firm, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at a key industry meeting in Houston this week.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $62.69 per barrel, up 0.2 percent on Tuesday following 2.2 percent gain on Monday.\nAdditional reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:34:21.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
