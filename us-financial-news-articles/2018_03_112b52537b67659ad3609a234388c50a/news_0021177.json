Soccer Football - Scottish Premiership - Rangers vs Celtic - Ibrox, Glasgow, Britain - March 11, 2018 Celtic’s Scott Brown celebrates after the match REUTERS/Russell Cheyne Brendan Rodgers’ side moved nine points clear with a game in hand. Their fierce rivals are in second place. Rangers have now failed to beat Celtic in nine meetings. They appeared well on their way to ending that run after taking a third-minute lead through Josh Windass, and then retaking it through Daniel Candeias after Tom Rogic equalised. They were then left facing 10 men when Jozo Simunovic was sent off for a stray elbow on 57 minutes after Moussa Dembele had levelled just before halftime. But Celtic made light of his dismissal and grabbed a winner through a 69th-minute piece of individual excellence from Frenchman Odsonne Edouard two minutes after coming on as substitute.

It was an incredible football match to be involved in. We were the better footballing side.” The game had been billed as an opportunity for Rangers, buoyed by a fine run of victories, to prove they were capable of preventing Celtic securing their seventh successive title. But they failed to match the visitors’ composure, with Rangers manager Graeme Murty admitting his side came up short. “We were punished for not doing the basics very well,” he said. “We did not show enough quality or composure or tempo with the ball. At the top level there are fine margins. You have to be clinical. They managed it, we didn’t.” Reporting by Neil Robinson,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T17:47:50.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
