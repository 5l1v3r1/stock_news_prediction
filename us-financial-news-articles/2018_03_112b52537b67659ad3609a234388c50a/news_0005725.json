The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe privately held Chinese firm, focused on energy and other investments abroad, has emerged from a role as niche fuel trader to become a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China’s energy giants. It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft for $9.1 billion.\nCEFC China Energy did not respond to requests for comment on the probe into Ye, reported earlier on Thursday by Chinese magazine Caixin without citing sources.\nShares in the firm’s listed subsidiary CEFC Anhui International Holding slumped as much as 10 pct, the maximum allowed, to their lowest since Sept. 2014, on the report.\nReporting by Benjamin Kang Lim; additional reporting by Aizhu Chen; Writing by Josephine Mason; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T06:20:08.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
