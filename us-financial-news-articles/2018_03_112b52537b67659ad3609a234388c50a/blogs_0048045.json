Hogg’s tweet listed Ingraham’s top 12 advertisers, asking followers to contact the companies and encourage them to cease advertising during the Fox show.\nPick a number 1-12 contact the company next to that #\nTop Laura Ingraham Advertisers\n1. @sleepnumber\n2. @ATT\n3.

She shared a Daily Wire story about Hogg’s rejection from a number of colleges, writing, “David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it.”\nHogg’s targeting of Ingraham’s advertisers mimics earlier campaigns that sought to pressure advertising boycotts of other Fox news hosts Sean Hannity and Bill O’Reilly. After Hannity reportedly propagated a conspiracy theory about a murdered DNC staffer, the host lost at least five advertisers .\nAnd following allegations of sexual harassment, as many as 44 companies pulled their ads from O’Reilly’s show in the lead-up to Fox’s decision to force him off the network.\nIt is not immediately clear whether Hogg’s campaign has successfully led companies to pull their advertising from Ingraham’s show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T12:37:43.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
