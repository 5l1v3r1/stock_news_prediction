We have to rediscover these things in whatever country after the imports are cut off,\" Shiller told CNBC. \"It's just chaos: It will slow down development in the future if people think that this kind of thing is likely.\"\nStiglitz, for his part, warned that China's leaders are likely prepared to initiate tariffs based on \"a very good economic map with which they will target certain places in the United States where the pain will be maximized.\"\nAn escalating trade war, the Nobel laureate said, could have political ramifications for Trump — especially if trade partners' retaliations hit the president's base.\n\"If there is a broad range increase in tariffs, it would affect their cost of living, the inflation would lead the Fed to raise interest rates at a higher rate, it would certainly impose a risk to the return to the U.S. to robust economic growth,\" Stiglitz said. \"This may be the one thing that actually does change this group of people who seem to have stuck with him even as he demonstrated bigotry, misogyny, support of people who [have a] Nazi background.\"\n\"They stood with him so far. The question is: When their pocketbook gets hit, will they still?\"\nBusiness leaders at the Beijing meeting also addressed the escalating trade tensions, with Johnson & Johnson's CEO and chairman, Alex Gorsky , emphasizing that open trade is the best policy for businesses to succeed.\n\"At the end of the day, we think that having, first of all, fair, equitable trade around the world is in everyone's best interest — Johnson & Johnson's, but I think for all companies and all countries,\" he said.\nRio Tinto CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques, meanwhile, predicted that \"common sense would prevail\" between the U.S. and China. Either way, he added, he'll be focusing on making the best of whatever business situation he's faced with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T14:01:27.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
