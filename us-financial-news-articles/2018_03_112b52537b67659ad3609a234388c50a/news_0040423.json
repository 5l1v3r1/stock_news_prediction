Xiangchen Zhang, Chinese Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) attends an interview with Reuters in Geneva, Switzerland March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Ambassador Zhang Xiangchen said China was considering a WTO complaint against the package of tariffs that Trump is expected to announce later on Thursday, but that was only one option. “This is a legitimate right for China to do that. But I would not exclude other options, because if the flood approaches you have to bank up to keep it out,” he told Reuters. “Appeasement of protectionism will not work. If you surrender to protectionism you will lose your credibility and leadership in this organization.” Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Gareth Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T17:24:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
