Having raised $250 million in gross proceeds in 2017 to strengthen our capital position, we have now turned our team’s attention more fully to the successful launch of XHANCE. Following FDA approval, we began commercial manufacturing, launching programs to build customer awareness of XHANCE, engaging payers to achieve broad market access and building a sales force. I am pleased to report that initial launch supply has now been manufactured with availability in retail pharmacies anticipated in early April 2018, contracting efforts with major insurers are underway and a sales force has now been deployed. Our company is built on two foundational values: “One Mission,” meaning we win or lose as a team, and “Friendship.” As a result, Optinose has assembled an experienced team of exceptional leaders that are united to make 2018 another successful year for the Company and the community we serve.”\nFourth Quarter and Recent Highlights\nCommercialization of XHANCE TM (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray 93mcg\nManufacturing Readiness\nThe initial launch supply of XHANCE has been manufactured and the Company is in the process of filling the retail channel. Retail pharmacy availability is expected in early April.\nProduct Awareness\nThe Company believes that a high level of product awareness will facilitate adoption. Therefore, multiple product awareness initiatives were undertaken in the months following product approval with multi-channel efforts directed at the ENT and allergy specialty audience. To date, the awareness campaign has reached over 10,000 ENT and allergy specialists with both disease state and XHANCE branded messaging. Product and disease awareness have also been pursued through temporary deployment of a field team of approximately 80 nurse educators, who have reached approximately 5,000 ENT and allergy prescribers and delivered over 10,000 presentations. Based on recent market research, aided product awareness of XHANCE among the company's ENT and allergy target audience (approximately 10,000 physicians) is 73 percent, with 86 percent awareness amongst allergists. Initial reaction to core brand messages among target physicians has been positive.\nPayer Coverage\nRecognizing that insurance coverage is important to product acceptance and uptake, the Company has engaged with key pharmacy benefit managers and health plans estimated to represent over 80 percent of adult commercial lives. Based on current progress, the Company expects to achieve approximately 65 percent coverage of commercial lives during launch. Where permissible, the Company will be implementing co-pay assistance and other patient affordability programs to further support patient access.\nSales Force\nThe Company has engaged approximately 80 regional sales personnel who have been trained on XHANCE and have begun interactions with targeted ENT and allergy specialists. These territory managers are deployed primarily in regions where commercial market access is expected to meet or exceed the Company’s launch target of approximately 65 percent. The Company anticipates its launch efforts will benefit from active transitions between previously deployed clinical nurse educators and new territory managers. The Company is prepared to flexibly expand the number of territory managers based on experience in the marketplace.\nXHANCE Xperience\nIn March 2018, Optinose introduced a limited product availability program, the XHANCE Xperience program, offering select physicians and their patients an opportunity to gain initial experience with XHANCE. Physicians can enroll a limited number of eligible patients in this program, and patients will receive up to two XHANCE prescriptions at no cost to them ($0 co-pay) while physicians will receive feedback on early patient responses to treatment. The Company believes this program will accelerate the ability of physicians to acquire positive patient treatment experiences and therefore improve demand for XHANCE during the early phases of product launch. The program officially launched on March 5th, and as of March 12th, more than 130 unique physicians have written a total of more than 250 prescriptions.\nAdditional Highlights\nDebt Financing\nIn December 2017, Optinose entered into a $100 million note purchase agreement with funds managed by Athyrium Capital Management, LP, a leading global healthcare-focused investment firm. Concurrent with signing the agreement, the Company issued $75 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes. An additional $25 million may be available to Optinose in 2019 subject to the achievement of a sales milestone and certain other conditions.\nAddition to Leadership Team - Karen E. Brophy, Vice President, Human Resources\nWith more than 30 years of diverse experience in human resources across several industries including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and information management, Ms. Brophy has assumed responsibility for the strategic implementation and management of human resources programs and practices at Optinose. Ms. Brophy has previously held senior human resources roles in both large established organizations and emerging growth organizations, including Aventis, Celgene, Dendreon, and others.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017, were $1.2 million.
