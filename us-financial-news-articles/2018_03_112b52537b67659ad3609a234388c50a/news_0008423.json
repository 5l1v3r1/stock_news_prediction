Russian officials had already worked on a special Russian segment of the Internet that was behind a firewall, and Russia has its own search engines, social networks and advertising.\n“Yes you can just push a button and turn a country into an outcast,” Klimenko told NTV.“(But) technically we are ready for any action.”\nSuch a cut-off might cause some initial difficulties because some Russian firms probably stored information abroad despite a law obliging them to keep data in Russia, but otherwise Russia should be fine.\n“Even if they declare such a war on us, there is no evidence we wouldn’t be able to live well and normally,” said Klimenko.\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:18:57.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
