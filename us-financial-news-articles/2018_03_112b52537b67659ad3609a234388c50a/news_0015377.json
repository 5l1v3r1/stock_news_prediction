(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:SHIP) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated net revenues of $24.3 million, a 123% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, net revenues were $74.8 million, up 116% compared to the same period of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, stockholders’ equity was $41.3 million and cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was $11.0 million.\nStamatis Tsantanis, the Company’s Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, stated:\n“We are pleased to announce our financial results of the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. During this period we achieved a strong financial performance through increased charter rates. In addition, we improved our balance sheet by reducing our leverage. This performance was largely made possible by the benefits we are starting to realize from the well-timed positioning of Seanergy in the Capesize sector.\n“During the fourth quarter of 2017, our fleet benefited significantly from the stronger Capesize market rates affirming our commercial strategy. In particular, the daily TCE rate 1 of our Capesize fleet was $18,505, an increase of 152% as compared to the same period last year. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the daily TCE rate of our Capesize fleet was $13,047, an increase of 152% as compared to the same period last year.\n“Better market fundamentals resulted in a substantial enhancement of our financial performance, as EBITDA amounted to $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to negative EBITDA of $1.4 million in the same quarter of 2016. Furthermore in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a marginal net loss of $116 thousand, as compared to a net loss of $6.9 million in the same period of 2016.\n“During 2017, we further improved our capital structure by reducing our total bank debt by $13.8 million and by increasing our shareholders equity by $10.5 million, an increase of 34% compared to 2016.\n“In addition, among the accretive transactions that we concluded in 2017, an additional Capesize vessel was acquired, which increased our fleet’s DWT to 1.7 million and boosted our revenue by $3.1 million through the vessel’s 214 ownership days for the year in question.\n“Based on the appreciation in vessels’ value of our recent Capesize acquisitions, along with the material gain by the refinancing of one of our Capesize vessels, we estimate that the total unrealized capital gains and equity accretion created for our shareholders exceeds $29 million, which is 119% greater than the net proceeds we raised from the capital markets since August 2016. We have a proven ability to execute well-timed accretive acquisitions and I strongly believe that we have created a solid foundation that will allow us to capitalize on the rising market conditions.\n“Turning to market fundamentals, in 2017 dry bulk charter rates stabilized at higher levels than in previous years, as the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI) averaged about 2,108 points, which is 105% higher than the average level recorded in 2016. Furthermore, as the orderbook for standard size Capesize vessels is currently at historical low levels, we are cautiously optimistic that the limited growth in vessel supply will reflect positively on day-rates and vessel values through 2018 and 2019. Demand is expected to outpace the limited vessel supply in 2018, on the back of a 2.7% projected growth rate for dry bulk trade volumes with growth in seaborne transportation of Capesize commodities expected at 2.4%, while growth in iron ore ton-miles exceeding 4.3%. 2\n“As of the date of this release, in the first quarter of 2018, approximately 78% of our Capesize available days are fixed at an average daily rate of approximately $15,920. For comparison purposes, our current Capesize rate is 42% higher than the average Baltic Capesize rate of Q1 2017 and 489% higher than the average Baltic Capesize rate of Q1 2016.”\n2 Clarkson Research Services Ltd.\nCompany Fleet:\nVessel Name Vessel Class Capacity\n(in dwt) Year Built Yard Championship Capesize 179,238 2011 Sungdong Partnership (1) Capesize 179,213 2012 Hyundai Knightship Capesize 178,978 2010 Hyundai Lordship (2) Capesize 178,838 2010 Hyundai Gloriuship Capesize 171,314 2004 Hyundai Leadership Capesize 171,199 2001 Koyo – Imabari Geniuship Capesize 170,057 2010 Sungdong Premiership Capesize 170,024 2010 Sungdong Squireship Capesize 170,018 2010 Sungdong Guardianship Supramax 56,884 2011 CSC Jinling Gladiatorship Supramax 56,819 2010 CSC Jinling Total / Average 1,682,582 8.9 years (1) This vessel is being chartered by a major European utility and energy company and was delivered to the charterer on June 13, 2017 for a period of employment of about 12 months to about 18 months at a gross daily rate of $16,200.\n(2) This vessel is being chartered by a major European charterer and was delivered to the charterer on June 28, 2017 for a period of about 18 months to about 22 months. The net daily charter hire is calculated at an index linked rate based on the five time charter routes rate of the Baltic Capesize Index. In addition, the time charter provides us an option for any period of time during the hire to be converted into a fixed rate time charter, between three months and 12 months, with a rate corresponding to the prevailing value of the respective Capesize forward freight agreement.\nFleet Data:\n(U.S. Dollars in thousands)\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Ownership days (1) 1,012 786 3,864 2,978 Available days (2) 1,012 722 3,851 2,741 Operating days (3) 907 649 3,339 2,444 Fleet utilization (4) 89.6% 82.6% 86.4% 82.1% TCE rate (5) $17,006 $7,539 $11,945 $5,587 Daily Vessel Operating Expenses (6) $5,488 $4,613 $4,985 $4,618 (1) Ownership days are the total number of calendar days in a period during which the vessels in a fleet have been owned. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of the Company’s fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that the Company recorded during a period.\n(2) Available days are the number of ownership days less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to drydockings, special and intermediate surveys, or days when the vessels are in lay-up. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of ownership days in a period during which the vessels should be capable of generating revenues. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred 13 off-hire days for one vessel drydocking.\n(3) Operating days are the number of available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire for any reason, including off-hire days between successive voyages, as well as other unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which the vessels actually generate revenues. In the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred 97 off-hire days between voyages and 8 off-hire days due to other unforeseen circumstances. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred 499 off-hire days between voyages and 13 off-hire days due to other unforeseen circumstances.\n(4) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that the vessels are generating revenue, and is determined by dividing operating days by ownership days for the relevant period.\n(5) Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rate is defined as the Company’s net revenue less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of the Company’s operating days during the period. Voyage expenses include port charges, bunker (fuel oil and diesel oil) expenses, canal charges and other commissions. The Company includes the TCE rate, a non-GAAP measure, as it believes it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with net revenues from vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, and because it assists the Company’s management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of the Company’s vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. The Company’s calculation of TCE rate may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. The following table reconciles the Company’s net revenues from vessels to the TCE rate.\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except operating days and TCE rate)\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 FY 2017 FY 2016 Net revenues from vessels 24,289 10,871 74,834 34,662 Less: Voyage expenses 8,865 5,978 34,949 21,008 Net operating revenues 15,424 4,893 39,885 13,654 Operating days 907 649 3,339 2,444 TCE rate 17,006 7,539 11,945 5,587 (6) Vessel operating expenses include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricants, insurance, maintenance and repairs. Vessel operating expenses before pre-delivery expenses exclude one-time pre-delivery and pre-joining expenses associated with initial crew manning and supply of stores of Company’s vessels upon delivery. Daily Vessel Operating Expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses before pre-delivery expenses by ownership days for the relevant time periods.
