(Nasdaq: SCPH), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to optimize delivery of infused therapies, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Business Highlights\nInitial Public Offering in November 2017 . scPharmaceuticals Inc. completed its initial public offering of its common stock raising net proceeds of approximately $92.7 million. The Company expects the proceeds to fund its operations through the commercial introduction of FUROSCIX, if approved, and to allow the Company to continue to develop its pipeline.\nFUROSCIX PDUFA date June 23, 2018. In November 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) for FUROSCIX and under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), set an action date of June 23, 2018. The FUROSCIX NDA included data from two pivotal and four exploratory clinical studies as well as eight formative and four summative human factor studies.\nContinuing FUROSCIX clinical initiatives with multiple investigator- and Company-sponsored studies. scPharmaceuticals will continue to build upon the FUROSCIX clinical data through conducting and supporting additional studies to evaluate the efficacy, safety, patient acceptance, and economic value of FUROSCIX.\nscPharmaceuticals-sponsored studies. The Company expects to begin enrollment in the second quarter of 2018 for its FREEDOM-HF ( FUROSCIX Re al-World E valuation for D ecreasing H o spital Ad m issions in H eart F ailure) study, which will evaluate the economic impact of FUROSCIX administered in an outpatient setting, as compared to intravenous furosemide administered in the hospital. Investigator-sponsored studies. A study sponsored by Steward Healthcare is targeted to begin enrollment in the first quarter of 2018 and is designed to evaluate the number of FUROSCIX doses necessary to achieve a patient’s target weight. Data from this trial is expected by the end of 2018. A second investigator-sponsored clinical study for FUROSCIX, SUB-Q-HF (Subcutaneous Furosemide in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure), by the NHLBI (National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) is currently ongoing. “We are very proud of our 2017 achievements – including our NDA submission and successful IPO, which is part of our ongoing transition from research and development to a commercial organization,” said John Tucker, President and Chief Executive Officer. “This year is off to a strong start, as we look forward to our June 2018 PDUFA date for our lead product candidate, FUROSCIX, and other milestones. With FUROSCIX, we are committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving the lives of 6.5 million heart failure patients in the United States.\"\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results and Financial Guidance\nscPharmaceuticals reported a net loss of $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.3 million and $24.4 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was largely due to a decrease in interest expense associated with convertible notes which converted in 2016, offset by costs associated with increased headcount, regulatory consulting associated with the NDA for FUROSCIX and the expansion of the Company’s commercial organization.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.0 million and $11.9 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was largely due to increased headcount and regulatory consulting associated with the NDA for FUROSCIX, offset by a decrease in outsourced clinical and medical affairs activity.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.9 million and $6.1 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year was primarily due to increased headcount and the expansion of the Company’s commercial organization.\nscPharmaceuticals ended 2017 with $118.5 million in cash compared to $39.3 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in cash was primarily due to net borrowings under a loan agreement of $9.3 million and the completion of the Company’s IPO in November 2017, which resulted in net proceeds of $92.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nBased on its current operating plan, scPharmaceuticals expects that its existing cash resources will enable it to fund operating expenses through 2019.\nAbout scPharmaceuticals\nscPharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products that have the potential to transform infused therapies, advance patient care and reduce healthcare costs.

For more information about scPharmaceuticals, please visit www.scpharmaceuticals.com .\nAbout FUROSCIX\nFUROSCIX is a drug-device combination product consisting of a proprietary furosemide solution formulated to a neutral pH to allow for subcutaneous infusion via our patented Infusor, a wearable, pre-programed drug delivery system that is applied to the abdomen for subcutaneous drug administration. FUROSCIX is under review at the FDA for treatment of edema, or fluid overload, in patients with heart failure.

FUROSCIX potentially will provide an alternative to intravenous (IV) and oral furosemide for the treatment of worsening heart failure due to edema that would typically require hospitalization.\nForward-Looking Statement\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
