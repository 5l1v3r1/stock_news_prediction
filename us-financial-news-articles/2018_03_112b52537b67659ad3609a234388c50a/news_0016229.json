Since Wednesday, Bosniak and Croat war veterans have been blocking the main junctions connecting cities in Bosnia’s autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, including the capital Sarajevo, demanding benefits for unemployed former soldiers and a unified register of all veterans. The protesters, who spent several nights outdoors in freezing temperatures blocking traffic, want government to cut funding for about 1,600 veterans’ associations. They say they do not trust the associations to hand out benefits equitably and they want the government to make payments directly to individuals.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Government officials say they cannot give in to their demands because of budget restraints. They have invited the veterans’ representatives to come and talk about their requests but the protesters refused. During the dawn police action in Tuzla, eight protesters were briefly detained and two slightly injured.

The regional government has been coping with the problem of veterans’ payments for years, after ruling parties had pushed through parliament a generous law on benefits as a pre-election sweetener which was later withdrawn. Nobody knows how many former soldiers are eligible for benefits, after many people falsely declared themselves to be veterans. That is why protesters insist on a unified register.
