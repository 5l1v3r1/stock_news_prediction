(“Dyadic”) (OTCQX:DYAI), a global biotechnology company focused on further improving and applying our proprietary C1 gene expression platform to help speed up the development and production of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, and recent company developments.\n“We are pleased to report a strong finish for 2017, with the successful execution of two funded research collaborations with big pharmaceutical companies and three new research collaboration agreements already signed in 2018, including the Israel Institute for Biological Research and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma which we recently announced. These results demonstrate that our business development efforts are bearing fruit. After we sold our industrial enzyme business to DuPont for $75 million two years ago, we developed a strategy to focus on applying our C1 gene expression platform for use in the biopharmaceutical industry. Our 2017 accomplishments confirm that we are making good progress in our transformational journey, delivering more promising scientific data and ultimately driving shareholder value,” said Mark Emalfarb, Chief Executive Officer.\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS OF 2017 AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nSuccessfully executed two funded confidential research collaborations with two top tier pharmaceutical companies, and we are in discussions with them about the next phases of research. Early data generated from our research programs are showing encouraging results for C1 technology. Fulfilled transitional services required under the DuPont Transaction and received the escrowed funds of $7.4 million in July 2017. Continued our R&D efforts to engineer the C1 gene expression platform for biopharmaceutical application. In this regard, we: developed a new C1 base strain and expanded our molecular tool box established an initial data set to demonstrate C1’s potential to express monoclonal antibodies that are secreted, folded and bind in similar manner as other commonly used cell host technologies improved yields of biologically active antibodies and further enhanced protein stability began glycoengineering of the C1 cell line to produce non-immunogenic human-like glycoforms In June 2017, the Company entered into a multi-year strategic research and development arrangement, including a potential commercialization agreement, with Biotechnology Development for Industry (“BDI”), a Spanish biotech company, to further advance Dyadic’s proprietary C1 technology in the development of next generation biological vaccines and drugs. Presented and hosted one-on-one meetings at numerous industry conferences, including PEGS, BIO, Bioprocess International, and many others. In early 2018, the Company entered into three research collaborations, including Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. and the Israel Institute for Biological Research. Added Barry Buckland, Ph.D. a recognized industry thought leader to our board in January 2018. Thomas Dubinski, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, will not be returning from his previously announced medical leave of absence.

The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large scale manufacture of low cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, production and performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars and/or biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of these technologies in developing and manufacturing biopharmaceuticals which these technologies help produce. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic drugs to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers and, hopefully, improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly saving lives.\nPlease visit Dyadic’s website at www.dyadic.com for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic’s plans for its biopharmaceutical business.\nDyadic trades on the OTCQX tier of the OTC marketplace.
