The broader Topix was down 1.02 percent, with all but three of its 33 subindexes ending in negative territory. The mining and oil and coal sectors were particularly downbeat.\nTechnology stocks also contributed to the broader decline, with Tokyo Electron sinking 4.44 percent on the back of U.S. tech losses overnight.\nOver in Seoul, the benchmark Kospi slid 1.34 percent to finish at 2,419.29 as technology stocks followed the lead from U.S. tech.

But, for us, the underlying economy is still fine. We've seen some weakness in some of the survey data, but they're coming from very high levels,\" Graham told CNBC's \"Capital Connection.\"\nStocks in Asia and Europe had bounced in the last session after U.S. and Chinese officials made conciliatory comments on Monday that suggested there could be some positive developments on trade.\nIn individual stocks, shares of Hong Kong-listed BYD Company sank 10.96 percent by 3:06 p.m. HK/SIN after the company reported Tuesday that its full-year profit declined 19.5 percent.
