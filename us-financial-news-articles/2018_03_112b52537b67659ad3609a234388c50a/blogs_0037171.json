I know it yields 6 [percent] and change, I know people are worried about it, I know the real estate investment trust health care portion is very, very weak, but I'm not going to run away from Deb Cafaro's work. I think it's OK.\" \nOclaro : \"They had a very good quarter and the optical space is very hot. Do I buy a stock like this, all the way up there after getting hit in technology? Let's wait a little bit. I bet you can get that stock under $9.\" \nShip Finance International : \"It has a very large yield, which I've got to tell you, when I've gotten involved with those particular ship companies you know it's been a big mistake, so I am staying away. And let me just add: it's a $300 million stock now.\" \nThe Carlyle Group : \"You know what, [since] you bought at $23, it is a buy. It's got a 6 percent yield. Some very smart guys. I like that idea.\" \nParker-Hannifin Corp. : \"I'm not walking away from Parker-Hannifin, either. I've got a lot I'm not walking away from.

I think that's a mistake.\" \nSynaptics : \"I think a lot of people thought that they should've been hurt far more about the idea that Apple's going to bring glass screens in house . It didn't because they've got very good technology. We had the CEO on. I bless it.\" \nAmerican International Group : \"It does go down every day. When I was doing the charts this weekend I saw that they were really the only insurance company that's not doing well. May I suggest you go with Travelers or Chubb ?\" \nCamping World Holdings : \"I like the thesis of outdoors. I think it's been kind of caught up in some of these issues involving firearms and Gander Mountain . And by the way, Marcus Lemonis is always welcome on 'Mad Money.'\" \nLam Research : \"Look, let's understand: Lam Research hit $234 last week. There's a lot of stocks that hit a new high last week that are coming down. If you want to take some profits, I totally get it, but this is an inexpensive stock based on 2019 earnings.\" Watch the full lightning round here: show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T03:08:07.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
