(NYSE:AGR) today announced that AVANGRID will be delayed in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the “Form 10-K”), beyond the extended deadline of March 16, 2018. AVANGRID is working diligently to file the Form 10-K as soon as possible.\nAs previously disclosed by AVANGRID in its Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 2, 2018, AVANGRID has delayed filing its Form 10-K because AVANGRID requires additional time to prepare its accounting records, schedules, internal controls over financial reporting, and management’s evaluation thereof due to a combination of factors relating to certain income tax matters, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted by the U.S. federal government on December 22, 2017.\nAVANGRID reaffirms the preliminary 2017 results announced in AVANGRID’s press release issued on February 20, 2018, and filed with the SEC on February 20, 2018, as amended by Amendment No 1. on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on February 22, 2018. AVANGRID does not expect that the 2017 results presented in its Form 10-K will differ in any material respect from such preliminary results.\nAVANGRID is working diligently with its current and former independent registered public accounting firms to complete the review and analysis of certain income tax matters, including deferred income tax liabilities for which immaterial corrections have been made to prior periods, and to obtain the related attestation and audit opinions from its independent auditors. As stated above, AVANGRID intends to file its Form 10-K as soon as possible.\nOn March 16, 2018, AVANGRID also notified the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) indicating that AVANGRID is not in compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria established in Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual as a result of its failure to timely file its Form 10-K within the extended time period. The noncompliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of AVANGRID’s common stock on the NYSE under the symbol “AGR.”\nUnder the NYSE rules, AVANGRID will have six months from March 16, 2018 to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. AVANGRID can regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards prior to such date by filing the Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. If AVANGRID fails to file the Annual Report on Form 10-K prior to such date, then the NYSE may grant, at its discretion, a further extension of up to six additional months, depending on the specific circumstances. In addition, the NYSE may commence delisting proceedings at any time if the circumstances warrant.\nAs stated above, AVANGRID reaffirms its preliminary 2017 results and intends to file its Form 10-K as soon as possible.\nForward Looking Statements: This press release contains a number of forward-looking statements.
