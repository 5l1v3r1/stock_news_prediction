The “Fearless Girl” quickly gained a large fan base, with more than 38,000 people signing a Change.org petition to make her permanent. \nRead: State Street Takes On Wall Street’s Gender Gap \nThe statue seems to have maintained its popularity, despite the controversy that State Street itself faced last year when it agreed to pay $5 million to settle claims that it paid female employees less than their male counterparts. \nWhen it moves, “Fearless Girl” might not be going alone. There’s speculation that because the girl and the bull have become “inseparable,” the two might be relocated together.
