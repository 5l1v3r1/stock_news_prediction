When President Trump signed an executive order approving the Keystone Pipeline last year, he made headlines by also mandating that steel for future pipelines will need to be \"made in the USA.\"\nAt the time U.S. steelmakers said they had the capability to produce the steel, they just needed time to increase their output. They argued that foreign competition and anti-competitive trade practices have put them at a disadvantage for years.\n\"The real question is whether the U.S. steel industry has the capacity to supply every pipeline project in the United States,\" said Libby Toudouze, portfolio manager at Cushing Asset Management. \"Let's say in 2017, 2018 we need 300 miles of pipeline, and the U.S. steel companies' maximum capacity could crank out 100 miles of pipe. It's not reasonable for us to hold up the 200 miles of pipeline because the U.S. guys can't scale to get there,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T01:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T00:26:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
