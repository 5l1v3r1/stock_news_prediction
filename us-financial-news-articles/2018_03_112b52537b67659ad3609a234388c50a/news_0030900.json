(OTC Pink:HOLL) today provided updated timing for the record date, pay date and ex-dividend date for its previously announced special $0.45 per share cash distribution to shareholders. The distribution is expected to be classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. The updated distribution details, which were revised in light of the market holiday on March 30, 2018, are as follows:\nSpecial Distribution: $0.45 per common share Record Date: Friday, March 23, 2018 Pay Date: Thursday, March 29, 2018 Ex-Dividend Date: Monday, April 2, 2018 Shares outstanding: 16,131,477 Total Special Distribution: $7.26 million About Hollywood Media ( www.hollywoodmedia.com )\nHollywood Media Corp. owns a 50% interest in Netco Partners, a joint venture that owns the Net Force publishing franchise, which delves into the thrilling and fast-paced worlds of digital crimes, espionage and crypto-currencies. Hollywood Media plans to relaunch Net Force with new books starting in early 2019.\nA story-arc outline for an additional five Net Force books has been completed and the manuscripts for the first two books in the franchise reboot have already been written. A literary agent has been retained to seek publishers to publish these books in four formats – hardcover, eBooks, streaming audio books and podcast editions -- at an anticipated rate of one book launch every 9-12 months.\nThe initial series of ten Net Force books was published in paperback between 1999 and 2006. Each was a New York Times Bestseller, millions of copies were sold worldwide, and Net Force was also the subject of a TV miniseries on ABC. Cash distributions to Hollywood Media of licensing fees from the Net Force franchise have totaled approximately $11.3 million.\nThe new Net Force is vastly expanded from its original status as a branch of the FBI. The series is now set in the near future where Net Force is a Cabinet-level department, integrating elite members of the Nation’s intelligence, law enforcement and scientific agencies with dedicated SpecialOps units from the armed services, to investigate digital crimes involving espionage and crypto-currencies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release and its hyperlinks may be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of federal securities laws.
