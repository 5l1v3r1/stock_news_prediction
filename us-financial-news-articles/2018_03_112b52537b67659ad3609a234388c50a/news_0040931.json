Noble has stood by its accounting.\nHong Kong-headquartered Noble has been negotiating a debt-for-equity swap for months after selling billions of dollars of assets, reporting big losses due to a severe commodities downturn, and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years.\nNoble said on Thursday a group of senior creditors, who support its restructuring plan, now holds 50 percent of its debt, and expected more lenders to back the package.\nUnder the deal, Noble is seeking to halve its senior debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to creditors.\nNoble's market value has fallen to just $114 million, from $6 billion in February 2015, as the company reported record losses and shrunk its business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T09:10:43.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
