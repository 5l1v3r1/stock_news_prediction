SoftBank, of course, and Masa in particular, was highly supportive of the acquisition,” Grab President Ming Maa told Reuters, referring to SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.\nThe deal was in the “best interest of both of the companies”, he added.\nThe deal marks Uber’s second retreat from an Asian market and will see the firm take a 27.5 percent stake in Grab.\nMaa said the deal had closed and the firm was in touch with regulators to address any concerns.\nExpectations of consolidation in Asia’s fiercely competitive ride-hailing industry were stoked earlier this year when SoftBank’s Vision Fund made a multi-billion dollar investment in Uber.
