That compared with 22.4 percent a year ago, when the Oscars audience fell to a nine-year low of 32.9 million viewers.\nTelevision viewership has been declining as audiences migrate to streaming options. The Nielsen data does not include viewing of the Oscars on digital and mobile platforms. Updated numbers will be released later on Monday.
