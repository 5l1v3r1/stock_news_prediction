Brazil farmers may benefit in the short term,” he said.\nAlready, Chinese importers are paying record harvest-time premiums for Brazilian soybeans as they look to secure supplies amid concern that shipments from the United States may be disrupted.\nGeller said interest rates on the subsidized loans will fall after Brazil last week cut the benchmark Selic rate to 6.5 percent, an all-time low.\nLast year, interest rates on farm loans were between 6.5 percent and 8.5 percent annually.\nGeller declined to provide details on the expected drop in interest rates, but said the plan is aligned with the Finance Ministry.\n“The farm sector is demanding more credit,” Geller said, adding it is in the government’s interest to support the sector. “Agribusiness investments help the economy, which in turn can generate additional tax revenues for the government.”\n($1 = 3.3414 Brazilian reais)\nReporting by José Roberto Gomes; writing by Ana Mano; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T03:27:40.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
