The exclusion included most U.S. allies, but not Japan.\n“We are also worried that aluminium products that are shut out by the United States may flood the Asian market,” Mitsuru Okada, chairman of the Japan Aluminium Association told a news conference.\n“We will ask the Japanese government to continue seeking a country exemption from the new U.S. tariffs,” Okada said, adding that Japanese aluminium makers will separately seek product exemptions.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:19:29.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
