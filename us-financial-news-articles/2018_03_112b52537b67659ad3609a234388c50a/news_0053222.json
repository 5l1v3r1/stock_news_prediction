He was scheduled to appear in federal court in Seattle on Tuesday afternoon.\nSuspicious packages were received on Monday at mail processing sites at Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, which is a Navy-Air Force facility in the District of Columbia; and Fort Lesley J. McNair in the U.S. capital, the agency said.\nThe packages also turned up at mail facilities at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Virginia, and the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia.\n“It is possible that further packages were mailed to additional mail processing facilities in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan area,” the FBI said. The packages were being analyzed at the FBI laboratory at Quantico, Virginia.\nFBI spokeswoman Nicole Schwab said none of the packages blew up.\nOfficials at Fort McNair evacuated a building after one of the packages was delivered, a spokesman said. An Army bomb squad confirmed that the package tested positive for explosive residue and determined a fuse was attached, he said.\nEarlier in March in a separate incident at a U.S. military base, a man died after driving a minivan through the gate of Travis Air Force Base in California and igniting propane tanks and gasoline cans.\nSeveral package bombs left on doorsteps and some sent from a Federal Express office were detonated in Austin, Texas, leaving two people dead and others injured. The suspected bomber blew himself up as police closed in on him.
