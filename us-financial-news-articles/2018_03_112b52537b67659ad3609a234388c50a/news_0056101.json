Slideshow (3 Images) \nParker, 24-0, took it as a compliment ahead of what will be the biggest fight of his career, with an 80,000-strong crowd expected through the doors on Saturday. \n“It makes me think that he’s taking this fight really seriously, he’s trained very hard,” he said after standing face to face and staring into the eyes of his opponent for the last time before they meet in the ring. \n“He’s in good shape, I’m in good shape. There’s not much of a weight difference, which is good. We’re both going to be fast for tomorrow night, we’re both going to move well and throw some big bombs.” \nParker said he saw confidence in Joshua’s eyes, and was ready for anything. \n“I’m here for a good fight, I’m here for war,” he declared. “You’re going to have to give me everything to beat me...he’s got a bigger crowd but that doesn’t matter, that doesn’t faze us.” \nSaturday’s fight will bring the heavyweight title a step closer to undisputed status and put the focus even more on American Deontay Wilder, who holds the WBC crown and is undefeated in 40.
