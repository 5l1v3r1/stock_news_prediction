He had already been released on bail in July.\nEzz, the former owner of Ezz Steel Co, was charged after Egypt’s 2011 popular uprising with using his position as a leading official in former president Hosni Mubarak’s dissolved National Democratic Party (NDP) to make illegitimate gains of about five billion Egyptian pounds.\nThe sources gave no further details about why the case was dropped.\nEzz is one of many close associates of Mubarak to have faced embezzlement charges, several of whom have also had charges or trials dropped. A court in January quashed the conviction and prison sentence of ex-interior minister Habib al-Adly and ordered a retrial.\nMubarak, a former air force commander, was last year cleared of all charges brought against him after the uprising, including the killing of protesters and corruption.\nSenior military officers have dominated Egypt’s politics and large chunks of its economy for decades. A year after Mubarak’s overthrow in 2011, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Mursi won a presidential election. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then military commander, led the overthrow of Mursi in 2013 after popular protests, and took office a year later.\nSisi is running for re-election later this month in a vote he is virtually guaranteed to win.\nReporting by Haitham Borai and Mohamed Abdellah, writing by John Davison, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:27:16.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
