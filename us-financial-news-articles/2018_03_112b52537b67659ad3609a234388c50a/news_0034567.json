The FERC announced, on March 15, 2018, that it plans to revise its 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs so that it no longer will allow interstate pipelines owned by Master Limited Partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in the cost of service.\nAfter consideration of the proposed policy changes by the FERC, American Midstream has determined, that based on the current rate structure on the Partnership's FERC regulated pipelines, the proposed changes are expected to have a negligible impact on the earnings and cash flow of the Partnership. Further, any proposed FERC policy revisions will have limited application to American Midstream, as a substantial majority of the Partnership's operations are not FERC regulated.\nAbout American Midstream Partners, LP\nAmerican Midstream Partners, LP is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed to provide critical midstream infrastructure that links producers of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, condensate and specialty chemicals to end-use markets. American Midstream's assets are strategically located in some of the most prolific offshore and onshore basins in the Permian, Eagle Ford, East Texas, Bakken and Gulf Coast.
