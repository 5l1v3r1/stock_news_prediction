The distribution will be payable on April 20, 2018 to common stockholders of record on April 13, 2018, with an ex-dividend date of April 12, 2018.\nThe Company estimates that 100% of this distribution will be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. This estimate is based on the Company’s anticipated earnings and profits for fiscal 2018 and its accumulated earnings and profits as of November 30, 2017. The Company’s estimate does not include a projection of gains and losses on the sale of securities for the remainder of fiscal 2018. The final determination of the tax character of the distribution will be made in early 2019 when the Company can determine its actual earnings and profits for the full year (including gains and losses on sales of securities during fiscal 2018) and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.\nKayne Anderson MLP Investment Company is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, whose common stock is traded on the NYSE. The Company's investment objective is to obtain a high after-tax total return by investing at least 85% of its total assets in energy-related partnerships and their affiliates (collectively, “MLPs”), and in other companies that, as their principal business, operate assets used in the gathering, transporting, processing, storing, refining, distributing, mining or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains \"forward- looking statements\" as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws.
