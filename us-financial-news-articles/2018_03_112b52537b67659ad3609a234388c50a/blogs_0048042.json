Last month he and 18 other attorneys general and one governor wrote to Commerce Department Secretary \nWilbur Ross, \nwho oversees the Census Bureau, urging him not to proceed with the plan. \n“This move directly targets states like New York that have large, thriving immigrant populations, threatening billions of dollars in federal funding for New York as well as fair representation in Congress and the Electoral College,” Mr. Schneiderman said Tuesday. \nCalifornia Attorney General \nXavier Becerra \nfiled suit over the move hours after it was announced Monday night, and New Jersey Attorney General \nGurbir Grewal \nsaid his state would join the coalition. \nThe new question would mirror one that is already on the bureau’s annual American Community Survey. It asks whether a person is a citizen by birth or by naturalization or isn’t a citizen. It doesn’t ask about the legality of an immigrant’s presence. \nCivil rights groups and minority advocates said the question will dissuade immigrants from answering the census altogether, resulting in an undercount of noncitizens. Mr. Schneiderman and others say this could adversely affect states with large immigrant populations. \nThe 10-year census seeks to count every American. The federal government relies on the tallies to allocate congressional seats, craft poverty guidelines and distribute billions of dollars in funding for programs like Medicaid. The move also poses practical concerns because test forms for the 2020 count have already been sent without the new query. \n“There’s a big risk,” said \nJohn Thompson, \nwho was Census Bureau director until last year. “I don’t think it’s an acceptable risk.” \nMr. Ross said obtaining citizenship information would help enforce the Voting Rights Act, which outweighed the limited potential adverse impacts of the move. \nThe Justice Department asked in December that the question be added to the Census. It said in its request that it needs “a reliable calculation of the citizen voting-age population in localities where voting rights violations are alleged or suspected.” It said that existing ACS citizenship data can’t be used for that purpose because it isn’t calculated on the same schedule or to the same geographical precision as census data. \nA spokesperson for the Commerce Department said litigation to block the question is without merit. The spokesperson added that the department looks forward to prevailing in court, and continuing to work with the census to conduct a complete and accurate 2020 count. \nOpponents of the citizenship question are looking to Congress, where House and Senate Democrats have already introduced legislation to prevent such a question from being added to the decennial count. While lawmakers aren’t required to approve the addition of the question, they do have the chance to respond to the Commerce Department’s report outlining the move, and advocates see that as an opening for impeding the Trump administration effort. \nCongressional committees that oversee the census have in the past held hearings to review its questions, and Congress has passed legislation to change the proposed topics and question wording as recently the late 1980s. \nThe Trump administration noted that the decennial census queried Americans about their citizenship from 1820 to 1950 in addition to the question being part of current annual census queries. In 2016, 6% of ACS respondents left the question blank. This broke down to 5.8% among native-born and 7.6% among immigrants. This has been rising steadily and has tripled since 2009, when it was 2%: 1.8% for native-born, 3.8% for immigrants. \nThe Trump administration has sought to animate its voter base with the citizenship question. Earlier this month, a Trump-Pence fundraising arm sent supporters an email that read, “The President wants the 2020 United States Census to ask people whether or not they are citizens. \n“In another era, this would be COMMON SENSE… but 19 attorneys general said they will fight the President if he dares to ask people if they are citizens. The President wants to know if you’re on his side.” \nWrite to Janet Adamy at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:57:57.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
