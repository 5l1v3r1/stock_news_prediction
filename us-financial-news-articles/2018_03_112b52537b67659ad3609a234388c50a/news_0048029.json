We are fully committed to developing a risk mitigation plan that is acceptable to all parties.\"\nIn addition to clearance by CFIUS, the closing of the proposed transaction remains subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals in the U.S., China and other international jurisdictions in which Genworth does business and other closing conditions.\nIn the event the transaction with Oceanwide does not close by the maturity of its 6.515% senior unsecured notes due May 22, 2018, Genworth will use a combination of the recently completed term loan proceeds plus some level of holding company cash to fully retire such senior unsecured notes.
