They're essentially ads, and publishers receive money from companies when users click on them. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that content makers identify when they're being paid to post something, but despite that, influencers continue to skirt around disclosures . The FTC has previously sent out letters to influencers reminding them of the requirement to communicate paid relationships with brands to their followers.\nThe paper from Princeton analyzed over 500,000 YouTube videos and 2.1 million unique pins on Pinterest. Of those, 0.67 percent, or 3,472 videos on YouTube, and 0.85 percent, or 18,237 pins, contained affiliate links.\nMore from The Verge:\nApple's new, cheaper iPad is very, very familiar\nNASA delays the launch of its flagship space telescope again — this time until May 2020\nNvidia suspends self-driving car tests in wake of Uber crash\nSponsored content posted by influencers aren't always identified as such, making it harder for consumers to tell the difference between original content and advertisements. The paper, written by Arunesh Mathur, Arvind Narayanan, and Marshini Chetty, collected data between August and September 2017 and outlines three main findings:\nPrevalence of disclosures is low, with only about 10 percent of affiliate content on YouTube and Pinterest tagged as such On both Youtube and Pinterest, user engagement was higher on posts that contained affiliate links Marketing affiliate disclosures were formatted in three different ways: affiliate link disclosures like the phrase \"#affiliatelink\"; explanation disclosures like \"This video contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I'll receive a small commission\"; and support channel disclosures that state, \"AMAZON LINK: (Bookmark this link to support the show for free!!!\") The FTC says just stating that a link is sponsored isn't enough, and publishers should use a short phrase that clearly says they're being paid when a link is clicked. Having disclosures is important, the Princeton paper notes, because posts with affiliate links usually get more engagement from users. This means they're more likely to be picked up by algorithms and shown to users through search or in their feeds. The paper states:\nConcerningly, our results show that the overall prevalence of affiliate disclosures is low, and that the disclosures are largely of the variety the FTC specifically advocates against: the Affiliate Link disclosures. In fact, Explanation disclosures—which the FTC recommends—only appear in 1.82% and 2.43% of affiliate content on YouTube and Pinterest respectively.\nAffiliate links were mostly found on YouTube in videos about science and technology, style, travel and events, and film and animation. On Pinterest, posts with affiliate links were mostly included in pins related to women's fashion, products, hair and beauty, and sports.\nTweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:50:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
