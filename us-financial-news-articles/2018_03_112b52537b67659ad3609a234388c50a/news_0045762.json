Subsidiary Drillisch fell 10.8 percent.\nAlso in tech, Ingenico suffered a 3 percent loss after Kepler Cheuvreux downgraded it, saying full-year guidance now looked “challenging”.\nTech and engineering consultancy Altran fell 3.1 percent after launching a share capital increase of 750 million euros.\nThe world’s no.2 cement maker Heidelberg Cement fell 1.7 percent, one of the worst declines on the DAX, after it announced a dividend slightly short of analysts’ average expectations.\nDeutsche Bank declined 2 percent, still weak after sharp losses in the previous session when the bank’s finance chief said a strong euro and higher funding costs would have a 450 million euro impact on revenues.\nCommerzbank tumbled 3.3 percent after a downgrade from Kepler Cheuvreux.\n“We expect the bank to need a full +100 basis point rates increase in 2019 to reach its >6% return on total equity target as the revenue picture of the corporate client business is sorely disappointing,” wrote Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Tobias Lukesch.\nShares in Svenska Handelsbanken fell 9.4 percent as it traded ex-dividend.\nBayer fell 1.5 percent after Australian and EU regulators approved the firm’s takeover of Monsanto. “Halfway there,” wrote UBS analysts, adding all eyes were now on the U.S. Department of Justice, yet to approve the deal.\nOverall, with results season drawing to a close, analysts were becoming more negative on the earnings outlook for European stocks.\nReporting by Helen Reid, Editing by Kit Rees and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-22T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:30:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
