Four (rate hikes) this year is now the consensus I think,\" Tuz said. \nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York, said tariffs have not worked historically and they cause retaliation. \n\"This is sort of working your way into a trade war which is a drag on the economy. It is also inflationary so if you are worried about inflation it is going to pump that up,\" Hogan said. \nMSCI's gauge of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.88 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.26 percent to close at 1,468.47. \nEuropean markets had already closed by the time Trump's comments about tariffs was reported. \nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265.07 points, or 1.06 percent, to 24,764.13. The S&P 500 lost 21.52 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,692.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.12 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,213.89. \nThe dollar index rose 0.07 percent, with the euro up 0.11 percent to $1.2206. The Japanese yen weakened 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 106.75 per dollar. \nThe Mexican peso lost 0.29 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.89, while the Canadian dollar fell 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 1.29 per dollar. \nThe gap between short-dated U.S. borrowing costs and those in Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks by the Fed and European Central Bank for the two regions diverged. \nU.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to push yields lower to 2.8351 percent. \nU.S. consumer prices increased in January as a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, but a survey showed the euro zone's factory boom slowed a little further in February, pressuring euro zone yields lower. \n\"In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,\" said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. \nOil fell more than 1 percent, hitting two-week lows on pressure from a strong dollar and worries that surging U.S. crude output might thwart efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain global supply. \nU.S. crude fell 51 cents to $61.13 per barrel and Brent was last at $63.95, down 78 cents on the day. \n(Editing by Bernadette Baum and Chizu Nomiyama)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T08:53:15.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
