Today, we are focusing on that untapped potential and investing in Jøtul’s future with our integrated value creation strategy. We’re very excited with the acquisition of Jøtul and welcome the business and its employees into our portfolio.”\nJulien Lagreze, a Partner in OpenGate Capital’s Paris office, stated, “Jøtul’s leading position in the global, home comfort heating market presents significant opportunities for growth. We have been exploring add-on acquisitions of businesses that could be tucked into the Jøtul portfolio and possibly create synergies, deepen the product portfolio, and expand markets. And, working with Jøtul’s management team, our operations efforts are well underway as we transition the business and roll out our full potential plan. This is an exciting investment for OpenGate and we’re looking forward to working with the Jøtul team in the months and years ahead.”\nHeadquartered in Fredrikstad, Norway, Jøtul was founded in 1853 and is one of the most well-known and respected brands globally in the home comfort heating industry.
