While German bond yields recovered in European trading, they were still on track for their biggest two-week drop since November.\nFLIGHT TO YEN Many investors also turned to the yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war.\nThe Japanese currency gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to 104.635 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. Investors later booked profits to leave the yen up 0.1 percent at 105.19 yen per dollar.\nThe Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it fell against the euro.\nThe dollar dropped 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies.\n“The FX market itself isn’t sure, and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to buy the yen and the Swiss franc,” Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a daily note.\nIn commodity markets, oil prices recouped overnight losses after Saudi Arabia said that OPEC and Russian-led production curbs introduced in 2017 will need to be extended into 2019 .\nU.S. crude futures were up 0.5 percent at $64.68 per barrel after losing 1.3 percent on Thursday, and Brent rose 0.68 percent to $69.38 before giving up most of those gains.\nSafe-haven spot gold rose 1.3 percent to $1,342 an ounce, its highest since Feb. 20. The precious metal is up 2.5 percent this week.\nCopper and iron prices both fell, as investors bet demand for the metals would suffer in a trade war. MET/L.\nDaniel Lockyer, senior fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said financial markets had failed to price in the risk of a sell-off.\n“It’s not that we thought trade wars would cause the market to fall, it’s that there was too much optimism priced into stock markets,” he said.\nEmerging markets also sold off heavily as investors dumped riskier assets on fears of a trade war. MSCI’s benchmark emerging equity index lost 1.7 percent.\nSouth Africa’s rand climbed 0.8 percent ahead of a decision by Moody’s on the fate of the country’s last remaining investment grade credit rating.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar.\nAdditional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, Helen Reid and Marc Jones in London, editing by Jane Merriman and Hugh Lawson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
