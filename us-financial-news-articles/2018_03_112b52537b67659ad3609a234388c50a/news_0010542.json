(“Ply Gem” or the “Company”) (NYSE: PGEM), a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nTotal net sales for the fourth quarter increased 11.8% to $516.9 million. Operating earnings increased $5.7 million to $34.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter increased $7.9 million to $14.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased $6.1 million to $51.0 million compared to $44.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Basic earnings per share was $0.21 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.10 for the 2016 period. Adjusted basic earnings per share was $0.16 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.14 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nYear End 2017 Highlights:\nTotal net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 7.6% to $2,056.3 million. Operating earnings increased $5.8 million to $174.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income decreased $7.2 million to $68.3 million for 2017 from $75.5 million for 2016 due to higher income tax expense partially offset by a lower tax receivable agreement adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $236.3 million or 3.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic earnings per share was $1.00 for 2017 compared to $1.11 for 2016. Adjusted basic earnings per share was $0.99 for 2017 compared to $1.31 for 2016.\n“On January 31, 2018, Ply Gem entered into a definitive agreement under which Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”) will acquire Ply Gem for $21.64 per share in cash, representing a go-private transaction valued at approximately $2.4 billion,” said Gary E. Robinette, Ply Gem’s Chairman and CEO. “CD&R also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Atrium Windows & Doors (Atrium) with the intent of combining Atrium with Ply Gem. The expectation is these two acquisitions will close during the second quarter of 2018, and we believe the new Ply Gem will continue to provide our customers with exceptional value and service while generating long-term growth and value creation for the shareholders of the new combined company.” Robinette continued, “In light of the CD&R transaction, Ply Gem will not be holding a quarterly earnings call in conjunction with today’s release.”\nCommenting on the Company’s results, Shawn K. Poe, Ply Gem’s Chief Financial Officer stated, “In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive financial improvements within our business segments despite the product demand and input cost headwinds related to the residual impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. We achieved incremental year-over-year quarterly adjusted EBITDA growth of 13.7% and a record fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $51.0 million.” Poe, continued, “As a result of our strong performance during 2017, we strengthened our balance sheet by generating in excess of $100 million in operating cash flow and achieving an adjusted EBITDA of $236.3 million. We continue to focus on our debt leverage, and on November 3, 2017 made a $40 million voluntary payment on our long-term debt under our Term Loan Facility, which when combined with our previous 2016 payments total a cumulative $200 million voluntary reduction in our long-term debt which demonstrates Ply Gem’s ability to generate meaningful cash flow.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales increased $54.6 million or 11.8% to $516.9 million compared to $462.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The net sales increase was primarily driven by improved U.S. market demand, higher Canadian net sales, new business wins and higher average selling prices.\nGross profit margin was 21.3%, which represented a decrease of 110 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin resulted from higher freight and raw material input costs for aluminum, PVC resin, and glass that were not fully offset with higher selling prices.\nOperating earnings were $34.4 million, an increase of $5.7 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting higher net sales partially offset by higher material costs and SG&A expense.\nSiding, Fencing and Stone\nSiding, Fencing and Stone’s net sales totaled $237.6 million, an increase of $30.4 million, or 14.7%, compared to $207.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The net sales increase resulted primarily from improved U.S. market conditions, new business wins, increased market share in the U.S. and Canada, and higher average selling prices. Gross profit margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was 24.2%, a decrease of 220 basis points from 26.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in gross margin percentage resulted from higher raw material input costs, specifically PVC resin and aluminum and higher freight costs that fully offset the 14.7% net sales increase. The unfavorable commodity and freight costs were primarily attributed to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\nWindows and Doors\nWindows and Doors’ net sales totaled $279.3 million, an increase of $24.1 million, or 9.5%, compared to $255.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The net sales increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 can be attributed to improved U.S. and Canadian market demand conditions which favorably impacted our new construction and repair and remodeling business and higher average selling prices.\nGross profit margin was 18.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 decreasing from 19.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit decrease of 20 basis points resulted from increased commodity costs, mainly PVC resin, aluminum and glass, partially offset by higher average selling prices from the continued improvement in our new construction business.\nAbout Ply Gem\nPly Gem is a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations of Ply Gem Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.\nThe selected balance sheet data for the periods presented in Note 5 has been derived from the December 31, 2017 and 2016 audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.\nThe Company’s fiscal quarters are based on periods ending on the Saturday of the last week in the quarter. Therefore, the financial results of certain fiscal quarters will not be exactly comparable to the prior and subsequent fiscal quarters.\n2. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense (net of interest income), provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash foreign currency loss (gain), non-cash loss on modification or extinguishment of debt, restructuring and integration expenses, customer inventory buybacks, litigation class action charges, and tax receivable liability adjustments. Other companies may define adjusted EBITDA differently and, as a result, our measure of adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA of other companies. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA included in this press release provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. The Company has included adjusted EBITDA because it is a key financial measure used by management to (i) internally measure our operating performance and (ii) determine our incentive compensation programs. In addition, the Company’s senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility has certain covenants that apply ratios utilizing this measure of adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EPS represents basic and diluted net income per share attributed to common shareholders adjusted to exclude the estimated per share impact of the specifically identified items used to calculate adjusted EBITDA described above, adjusted at the statutory tax rate of 35%.\nAlthough we use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS is limited because it does not include certain material costs, such as interest and taxes, necessary to operate our business. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS included in this press release should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net earnings and earnings per share in accordance with GAAP as a performance measure. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS.\nCertain amounts in this release have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, amounts shown as totals may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the individual amounts that comprise or precede them.\nPly Gem Holdings, Inc.
