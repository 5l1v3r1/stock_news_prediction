The published figures are those of the legal entity Theraclion SA that do not consolidate the contributions of the companies Theraclion APAC Ltd (Hong Kong) and Theraclion China Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen). Sales to these subsidiaries are therefore recorded as sales to third parties. Adjusted for intercompany transactions, the Group's sales amounted to € 1.8 million, down 6% from € 1.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nSimilarly, the losses of these subsidiaries are not recognized. Theraclion China Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen) did not close its accounts as of December 31, 2017 due to its creation in December 2017 and Theraclion APAC Ltd (Hong Kong) recorded a loss of € 0.3 million in line with 2016.\na) Further sales growth\nTheraclion SA recorded 11 sales in 2017, including 8 systems sold in new countries: Poland, Russia and China. In addition, 5 commercial agreements were signed in 2017 allowing access to echotherapy in clinical routine in the university hospitals of La Salpêtrière in Paris, of Frankfurt in Germany and three private sites in Hong Kong (including Baptiste and Sanotorium Hospital). These time-limited agreements generate rental and consumable revenues and represent potential future system sales.\nb) Disciplined cost control\nTheraclion focuses on commercial and R&D effort and reduces other expenses: when revenues are up 41% from 2016, the increase in expenses is limited to 5%.\nMerchandise purchases amounted to € 1.4 million, up 43% due to 31% growth in sales and the growing use of Epacks in ongoing clinical trials to obtain marketing authorization for Echopulse in the United States and the development of new indications (cancer and veins). Other purchases and external expenses of € 3.8 million increased by 3% compared to 2016, mainly due to clinical trials. Staff costs are stable compared to 2016 in line with the workforce. The company maintains its sustained investment policy with total R & D costs of € 3.8 million (versus € 3.2 million in 2016); more than 50% of the workforce is dedicated to it.\nAfter taking into account the financial result at loss of € 256,000 over the year, mainly related to the interest on the repayable advance TUCE and a research tax credit of € 1,148,000, diminishing of 5% due to non-eligible clinical trials abroad, the consolidated result for the year 2017 shows a loss of € 6,224,000, a reduction of 4% compared to a loss of € 6,454,000 in the 2016 financial year.\nc) Major events in 2017 and early 2018\n4 patients treated in combined immunotherapy trial and first encouraging results presented at ASCO-SITC meeting in San Francisco\nDr. Patrick M. Dillon, MD, UVA Medical Center, Charlottesville, USA, Principal Investigator of the Echotherapy / Immunotherapy Combination Trial, presented his data to the Clinical Immuno-Oncology Symposium at the ASCO Congress American Oncology Clinic) - STIC (Society for Cancer Immunotherapy) ( https://immunosym.org ), Jan. 25 in San Francisco, USA.\nWith only 22% survival at 5 years, there is no cure today for women diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer. Immunotherapy, which has brought new hope to other types of cancer, has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of breast cancer, as the immune system does not recognize most breast cancer tumor cells as \"foreign\". The majority of breast cancers do not activate white blood cells. This is what echotherapy can change by triggering a rapid and localized immune response to cell damage, leading to the recruitment of white blood cells that will infiltrate the tumor. Immunotherapy can then suppress the chemical signal of tumor self-protection, allowing the lymphocytes to attack. \"I am delighted to have designed this pilot study that combines pembrolizumab and focused ultrasound therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer. It has the potential to enrich the therapeutic knowledge of cancer on local and systemic immune responses. \" Dr. Dillon explains. \"I am confident that we will see some of the clinical benefits and immune effects of these therapies, and we hope to be able to draw conclusions about the safety and immune activity of this combination of focused ultrasound with pembrolizumab.\"\nPhase I of the clinical trial is actively recruiting patients:\n• 4 patients are recruited to date,\n• no concern to date regarding partial ablations of ultrasound tumors in combination with pembrolizumab,\n• the most common side effects are limited to pain in the ablation area, fatigue, nausea, and Dyspnea\nTheraclion Launches the World's First Study of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Superficial and Perforating Vein Incontinence of the Lower Limbs.\nThe trial involves 35 patients (23 of whom have already been treated) who will be followed for 3 months after the procedure. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility, abolition of blood reflux, ease of use, patient preference, tolerance and safety of echotherapy.\nFor all patients treated in the study, the procedure could be performed, and no procedure was interrupted or canceled for treatment-related technical or medical reasons. Most cases were predominantly 50-year-old patients with chronic venous disease with a long history of treatment (including surgeries and endovenous treatments), active or healed ulcers, severe skin disorders, significant venous symptoms and a high BMI. Unlike other thermal endovenous methods, no analgesia has been administered to patients before, during or after treatment. No significant side effects were reported during treatment and the follow-up period (no skin burns, skin discoloration, bruising, erythema, or edema were present during and after the procedure). All patients were satisfied with the procedure.\nThe treatment market for the incompetence of superficial veins is estimated at around 9 billion euros, including 500 Million €uros for medical devices. The arrival of a completely non-invasive technology should lead to a transformation of the market: the share of value captured by medical devices enhances at the expense of facility and anesthesia-related costs.\nLaunch of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study of 100 breast fibroadenoma patients started in January 2017 for access to the US market.\nFifty-two out of the planned 100 patients have already been treated in the pivotal clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Echopulse® echototherapy as a non-invasive treatment for breast fibroadenoma (FA). Recruitment is conducted in four centers in the United States, the University of Virginia Medical School (UVA), NYU Langone Bellevue, the Montefiore Medical Center (NY) and the University Medical Center. New York Presbyterian / Columbia, and two centers in Europe at Tübingen University Hospital in Germany and Sofia Hospital. Patients receive a single high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment with Echopulse®. The primary endpoint is a reduction in fibroadenoma volume, pain, and anxiety.\nTheraclion China CO., LTD, acquires 5 Echopulse Systems to Enter the Chinese Market and Thereby Broadens the Overall Echotherapy Market\nTheraclion China is a joint venture between Inner Mongolia Furui Medical Science Co., Ltd.
