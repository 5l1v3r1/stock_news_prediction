REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo The vegan was due to go before a judge on a charge of condoning terrorism on Thursday, two days after a left-wing activist received a one-year suspended sentence for hailing the death of another victim of the same attack, gendarme Arnaud Beltrame.\nCondoning terrorism carries a maximum jail sentence of five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($92,000).\nFrance’s butchers federation said it had filed the legal complaint against the author of the Facebook post, which has been removed.\nThe vegan lives in Saint Gaudens, a village not far from the Pyrenees mountains and the town of Trebes, hit by last week’s attack.\nMoroccan-born Radouane Lakdim killed four people during his rampage, including three people in a supermarket in Trebes. Among the victims there were Beltrame and butcher Christian Medves.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday led a national tribute to Beltrame, who swapped places with a woman Lakdim had been holding hostage. A ceremony for the three civilians killed was held on Thursday morning.\nLakdim was shot dead by police.\nReporting By Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry; Editing by Richard Lough and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T14:27:54.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
