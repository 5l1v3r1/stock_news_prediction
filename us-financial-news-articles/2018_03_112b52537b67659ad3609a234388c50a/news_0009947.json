The table below summarizes the distribution schedule for each closed-end fund (collectively, the “Funds” and each, a “Fund”).\nThe following dates apply to the distributions:\nRecord Date March 15, 2018\nEx-Dividend Date March 14, 2018\nPayable Date March 29, 2018\nDistribution Schedule NYSE Ticker Closed-End Fund Name Distribution\nPer Share Change from Previous\nDistribution Frequency AGC Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund II $ 0.047 1 Monthly AVK Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund $ 0.1172 1 $0.0002 Monthly GBAB Guggenheim Taxable Municipal Managed Duration Trust $ 0.12573 Monthly GGM Guggenheim Credit Allocation Fund $ 0.1813 Monthly GOF Guggenheim Strategic Opportunities Fund $ 0.1821 Monthly GPM Guggenheim Enhanced Equity Income Fund $ 0.24 1,2 Quarterly WIA Western Asset/Claymore Inflation-Linked Securities & Income Fund $ 0.0345 Monthly WIW Western Asset/Claymore Inflation-Linked Opportunities & Income Fund $ 0.0360 Monthly 1 A portion of this distribution is estimated to be a return of capital rather than income. Final determination of the character of distributions will be made at year-end. The Section 19(a) notice referenced below provides more information and can be found at www.guggenheiminvestments.com .\n2 Guggenheim Enhanced Equity Income Fund (“GPM”) adopted a managed distribution policy (the “Distribution Policy”) effective with the June 30, 2017 distribution. Under the terms of the Distribution Policy, GPM will pay a quarterly distribution in a fixed amount until such amount is modified by the Board of Trustees. If sufficient net investment income is not available, the distribution will be supplemented by capital gains and, to the extent necessary, return of capital.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated amounts of GPM’s current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital. All amounts are expressed per common share.\nEstimated\nAmounts of the\nCurrent\nQuarterly\nDistribution ($)\nEstimated\n% Breakdown of\nthe Current\nQuarterly\nDistribution Estimated\nAmounts of the\nTotal Cumulative\nDistributions for\nthe Fiscal Year to\nDate ($) Estimated\n% Breakdown of\nthe Total\nCumulative\nDistributions for the\nFiscal Year to Date Net Investment Income - 0% - 0% Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains - 0% - 0% Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains - 0% - 0% Return of Capital $0.2400 100.00% $0.2400 100.00% Total Distribution $0.2400 100.00% $0.2400 100.00% If the Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe following table provides GPM’s total return performance based on net asset value (NAV) over various time periods compared to GPM’s annualized and cumulative distribution rates.\nAverage annual total return (in relation to NAV) for the period since inception (August 25, 2005) to February 28, 2018 4.16% Annualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of February 28, 2018 10.86% Cumulative total return (in relation to NAV) for the fiscal year through February 28, 2018 -1.89 Cumulative fiscal year distributions as a percentage of NAV as of February 28, 2018 2.71% Performance data Quote: d represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Total returns in relation to NAV reflect the Fund's total annual expenses.\nYou should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Distribution Policy.\nPast performance is not indicative of future performance. As of this announcement, the sources of each fund distribution are estimates. Distributions may be paid from sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short-term capital gains, long-term capital gains or return of capital. Unless otherwise noted, the distributions above are not anticipated to include a return of capital. If a distribution consists of something other than ordinary income, a Section 19(a) notice detailing the anticipated source(s) of the distribution will be made available. The Section 19(a) notice will be posted to a Fund’s website and to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation so that brokers can distribute such notices to Shareholders of the Fund. Section 19(a) notices are provided for informational purposes only and not for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions in 2018 will be made after the end of the year. This information is not legal or tax advice.
