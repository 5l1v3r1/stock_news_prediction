For this project, the Google spokesperson said that the military would only use the technology to recognize images “on unclassified data.”\nIn July, the Defense Department described Project Maven as an initiative to explore how cutting-edge AI technologies could eventually be used in warfare.\n“People and computers will work symbiotically to increase the ability of weapon systems to detect objects,” Marine Corps Col. Drew Cukor said in a statement. “Eventually we hope that one analyst will be able to do twice as much work, potentially three times as much, as they’re doing now. That’s our goal.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nThe Defense Department had said that it would be undergoing “a competitive selection process to find vendors that can provide algorithms against DoD data.”\n“You don’t buy AI like you buy ammunition,” Cukor said. “There’s a deliberate workflow process and what the department has given us with its rapid acquisition authorities is an opportunity for about 36 months to explore what is governmental and [how] best to engage industry [to] advantage the taxpayer and the warfighter, who wants the best algorithms that exist to augment and complement the work he does.”", "external_links": ["https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1254719/project-maven-to-deploy-computer-algorithms-to-war-zone-by-years-end/", "https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533"], "published": "2018-03-07T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T02:21:15.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
