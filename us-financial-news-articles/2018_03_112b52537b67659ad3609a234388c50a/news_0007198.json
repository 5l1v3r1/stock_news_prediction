In his remarks, he did not directly address the ongoing investigation or President Donald Trump's ridicule of Sessions this week, but sought to allay concerns about the department's current state.\n\"You will not always agree with our policy decisions, and you definitely wont hear this on cable TV, but the department leadership team appointed by President Trump is very strong on ethics and professionalism,\" he said.\nRosenstein also worked to reassure corporations, saying he intends to publish fewer guidance memos than his predecessors and wants \"to avoid imposing penalties that disproportionately punish innocent employees, shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders.\"\nStill, he said the private sector must monitor its own behavior, explaining that he expects companies to go beyond simply having policies to comply with the law, and make compliance part of their corporate cultures.\n\"If you want us to treat a corporate entity as a victim, you should act like a victim who wants to see the perpetrators held accountable,\" he said.\nThe department's emphasis on self-reporting and cooperation \"has to be looked at in conjunction with the recent Supreme Court decision requiring whistleblowers to report directly to the Securities and Exchange Commission,\" said John Carney, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney who is currently co-leader of law firm BakerHostetlers white-collar team.\n\"If the new normal is employees going to the government without you then corporations need to decide early on whether to fight or to embrace the DOJs new policies proactively,\" said Carney, who attended the speech.\n(Reporting by Lisa Lambert in Washington; editing by Grant McCool and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T08:11:35.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
