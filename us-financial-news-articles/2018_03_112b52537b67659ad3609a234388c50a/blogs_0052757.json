Tenor had more than 300 million users as of last year and topped 12 billion monthly search requests in February. The company also has a growing advertising business, creating sponsored GIFs for companies like Dunkin' Donuts , Nissan and AT&T.\nTenor previously raised over $30 million in venture funding. Google said it plans to keep Tenor as a separate unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T22:28:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
