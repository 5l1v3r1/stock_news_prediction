Pursuant to the Arrangement, Entrée transferred to Mason the Ann Mason copper-molybdenum project in Nevada and the Lordsburg copper-gold property in New Mexico, and $8.84 million in cash.\nAs part of the Arrangement, each existing share of Entrée was exchanged for 0.45 of a Mason common share and one \"new\" common share of Entrée. Optionholders and warrantholders of Entrée received replacement options and warrants of Entrée and options and warrants of Mason which are proportionate to, and reflective of the terms of, their existing options and warrants of Entrée.\nOn May 9, 2017, the Company entered into an Administrative Services Agreement with Entrée, pursuant to which Entrée provides office space, furnishings and equipment, communications facilities and personnel necessary for Mason to fulfill its basic day-to-day head office and executive responsibilities on a pro-rata cost-recovery basis.\nOn May 10, 2017, Mason filed its National Instrument 43-101 technical report titled \"2017 Updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Ann Mason Project, Nevada, U.S.A.\" (the \"2017 PEA\") for its flagship Ann Mason Project in Nevada on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . The 2017 PEA indicates the Ann Mason Project has positive project economics and has the potential to be a large, long life copper-molybdenum mining operation.\nOn May 12, 2017, the Company's common shares commenced trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"MNR\".\nOn July 19, 2017, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (the \"Rights Plan\") to ensure, to the extent possible, that all shareholders of the Company are treated fairly and equally in connection with any take-over bid or other acquisition of control of the Company. The Rights Plan was not adopted in response to any specific take-over bid or other proposal to acquire control of Mason and Mason was not aware of any such pending or contemplated proposals.\nIn August 2017, the Company welcomed two new significant shareholders in Mason replacing disinterested shareholders following the spinout of Mason from Entrée:\nMantos Copper (Bermuda) Limited (\"Mantos\") purchased an aggregate of 13,664,757 common shares of Mason at a price of C$0.20 per share for an aggregate purchase price of C$2,732,952 from Rio Tinto International Holdings Limited and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., which represents approximately 17.5% of the outstanding common shares of Mason.\nHudbay Minerals Inc.

The Company's cash balance at December 31, 2017 was $7.5 million with no debt.\n*The consolidated financial operating results have been prepared on a continuity of interest basis of accounting following the\nArrangement, which requires that prior to the May 9, 2017 effective date thereof, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and\ncash flows of the Company be on a 'carve-out' basis from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Entrée.\nOUTLOOK AND STRATEGY\nCorporate\nThe Company's corporate focus going forward will be to maximize market value through assessing and executing on options to move Ann Mason forward, possibly including introducing one or more strategic partners. In addition, Mason is undertaking a process to prioritize and progress other growth strategies involving its Lordsburg property and additional new exploration acquisitions.

The Company's key asset is its 100% owned Ann Mason Project – an extensive, prospective land package located in the Yerington District of Nevada. The Ann Mason Project hosts two copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits, Ann Mason and Blue Hill, as well as numerous earlier-stage or untested priority targets. The Ann Mason deposit is currently at a PEA level and is among the largest undeveloped copper porphyry resources in Canada/U.S.A. The excellent infrastructure, year-round access, strong community support and clear permitting process are all factors that contribute to making Yerington, Nevada one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world. Mason also holds a 100% interest in the Lordsburg property, an exciting earlier-stage copper-gold porphyry project, located within an historic mining district in New Mexico.\nMason's strong financial position and high-quality asset portfolio provide it with a solid foundation and flexibility for growth, by advancing development of Ann Mason towards Pre-Feasibility, introducing one or more strategic development partners, exploring high priority targets or considering strategic acquisitions.
