But last year, the agency reported that a range of student loan industry practices \"delay, defer or deny access\" to that consumer protection. \nMany students believe they're paying their way toward forgiveness, only to find they hold a loan or are enrolled in a repayment plan that disqualifies them from the program. \nSince the DOE first began accepting PSLF requests in October 2017, some 13,000 people have applied but just 1,000 are expected to be eligible, a DOE spokesman told CNBC. \nNancy Conneely, director of policy at AccessLex Institute, which provides financial education to students and schools, applauded the funding. \n\"This is a great first step in ensuring the program is doing what it was intended to do — incentive people to work in public service,\" she said. \nBut Jonathan Fansmith, director of government relations at the American Council on Education, said the $350 million is not enough to cover all the borrowers who would be eligible if they were simply enrolled in a different repayment plan. \nLast month, Senate Democrats tried to secure $4 billion to mend the program. \nThe \"first-come, first-served\" stipulation, he added, was surprising. \n\"You usually don't see that in federal policy,\" he said. \"Loans work like an entitlement.\" \nMore from Personal Finance:\nStrong economy could be your ticket to a new job \nIf you're tired of Medicare Advantage, now is the time to ditch \nRetire in paradise: 5 countries where you can live the dream", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T21:20:53.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
