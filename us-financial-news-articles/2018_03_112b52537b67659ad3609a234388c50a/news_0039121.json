The 25-year veteran of software product strategy, product management, design, and development will spearhead the high growth company’s product strategy to meet the evolving needs of its clients and market as treasury departments shift from being operational to strategic.\nTyagi launched his career as a developer and architect of software platforms in India. After relocating to America in 1997, he advanced into Product Management, Strategy, Development, and Platform Business Innovation in enterprise software.\nEarlier, Alok has filled Product & Technology Executive roles at industry-leading companies such as Oracle, Peoplesoft, JD Edwards, Sage and CA Technologies. While at CA Technologies, he was Senior Vice President of Business & Product Strategy, responsible for a $2.5B Product Portfolio. Before that, he was Senior Vice President of Product & Technology at Sage where he was responsible for $900M Product Portfolio in North America serving 3 million small and medium size customers.\nMost recently, Tyagi was a Partner at Fortium Partners, in Dallas, TX, where he provided Board and C-suite level Product/Technology leadership to companies that operate their business either in a Cloud/SaaS environment or going through a digital business transformation. While in Dallas, he also advised start-ups and entrepreneurs in affiliation with Southern Methodist University’s Digital Accelerator and REVTECH Accelerator, a startup accelerator focused on Retail-Tech.\nAlok is a champion of Digital Business Transformation in every industry and is a respected thought-leader in the Enterprise Software space. In his recent article “The Business of Software – why we need Strong Product Managers,” Tyagi explains the unique nature of the product manager position. Because their responsibilities encompass both the business space and the technology space, product managers must be big thinkers who can “see what’s around the corner.” They must also focus on discerning and meeting customers’ needs on every aspect of the solution – including discovery, trial, purchase, consumption, maintenance, and renewal.\n“I am delighted to join GTreasury at a time when Digital Technologies such as Machine Learning and APIs are starting to play a significant role in the life of Treasurers” said Tyagi. “GTreasury’s SaaS Solution and technology talent is truly impressive, operating in an Agile environment with Continuous Delivery to accelerate our pace of innovative solutions delivered to our clients.”\nTyagi holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering from Regional Engineering College of India and a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the University of Colorado.\n“We are excited to welcome Alok to our Senior Management team,” said GTreasury founder and CEO Orazio Manzi-Fe Pater. “We’ve been growing and expanding, both into new geographic territories and into new industry segments. Having a Chief Product & Technology officer with his depth and breadth of experience will help ensure that we manage and drive that growth smoothly and professionally, as well as ensure that we continue to design and deliver the solutions that our customers want and need.”\nAbout GTreasury\nGTreasury is the leading innovator of integrated SaaS treasury and risk management solutions for the digital treasurer.
