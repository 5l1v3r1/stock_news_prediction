(And Apple has long been an advocate of strict privacy guidelines, with Steve Jobs even talking about it in front of Mark Zuckerberg .) \nThe new iOS update also lets users turn off processor throttling for iPhones with aging batteries, which will prevent some unexpected shutdowns—and a new battery health screen that will recommend if a battery needs to be serviced.
