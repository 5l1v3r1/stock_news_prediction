The recall doesn’t affect Model X SUVs or its new Model 3 electric vehicles. The retrofit will typically take around an hour, the company said.\nTesla issued the recall after it discovered excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts in very cold climates, particularly area where they is frequent use calcium or magnesium road salts rather than sodium chloride, or table salt, the company said in a letter sent to affected owners.\nTesla plans to replace all early Model S power steering bolts in all climates worldwide to account for the possibility that the vehicle may later be used in a highly corrosive environment, the company wrote.\nTesla says even if the bolts fail, the driver would be able to steer the car. However, it would require that the driver use extra force because the power assist feature are either reduced or fail altogether. Under such conditions, the car becomes more difficult to drive at low speeds and to parallel park, But it does not materially affect control at high speed, for which only limited steering wheel force is needed, Tesla wrote to customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T07:13:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
