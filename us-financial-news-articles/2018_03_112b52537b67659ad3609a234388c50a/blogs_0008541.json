The news sparked a deep stock sell-off. For the week ending Friday, the Dow fell 3 percent and the S&P 500 dropped 2 percent.\n\"We'll have to see what happens in the next couple of weeks because I think it's going to take that long to sort it out,\" he added. \"If you're going to see a retaliatory move, you're going to see it in the next couple of weeks.\"\nThe move would anger the global community and potentially create shock waves through the market, according to Saut.\nBut Saut, who acknowledges the tariff announcement surprised him, isn't abandoning his secular bull market view.\nHe contends the strength of economic and earnings growth could keep stocks fundamentally sound for as long as a decade. Saut also cites under-investment as a long-term bullish signal.\n\"I do think it's noise in the short run. I think it's going to present a buying opportunity in the long run,\" he said. \nIn the meantime, Saut isn't willing to recommend buying stocks. He says it's not unreasonable for the stock market to retest the February correction lows.\n\"I am not going to step in here and buy a falling knife,\" Saut said.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
