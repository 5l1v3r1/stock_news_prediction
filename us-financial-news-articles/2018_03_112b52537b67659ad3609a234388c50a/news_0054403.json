About 20 percent of dealers reported the same for clients at mutual funds, ETFs, pension plans and endowments. \n“The most cited reason for the increase was greater willingness on clients’ parts to take risk due to either lower expected future volatility or higher risk appetite,” the survey release stated. \nHalf of survey respondents listed the technology sector and half listed the financial sector as having the highest or second highest amount of leverage extended to them. A third of survey respondents listed energy investments as receiving the highest or second highest amounts of credit among sectors. \nApart from a greater risk appetite, many investors increased leverage because they expected lower volatility or higher future returns, survey respondents said. \nThe S&P 500 index climbed 19.4 percent in 2017. The CBOE Volatility Index stayed below its 20-year average through the end of that year but spiked in February amid a broad selloff in U.S. stocks. \nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 is on track to post a loss in the first quarter of 2018.
