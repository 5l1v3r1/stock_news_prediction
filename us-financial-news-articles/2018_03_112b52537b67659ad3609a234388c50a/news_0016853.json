The company also swung into a net profit of 1.4 billion euros, reversing a 400 million euro 2016 loss.\n$1 = 0.8066 euros Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:23:37.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
