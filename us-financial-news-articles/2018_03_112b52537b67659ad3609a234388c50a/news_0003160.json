So we are assessing what our particular situation is.”\nA source with knowledge of case indicated that the“A” sample from the test carried out on Jan. 13 in Switzerland showed traces of the banned steroid, Clenbuterol.\nThe“B” sample has yet to be tested, the source added.\nThe bobsleigh team received a lot of attention in Pyeongchang as they were the first female athletes from the Caribbean island nation to compete at a Winter Olympics.\nTheir breakthrough appearance came 30 years after a Jamaican men’s team competed at the Calgary Olympics, inspiring the highly successful movie“Cool Runnings”.\nEditing by Nick Mulvenney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:33:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
