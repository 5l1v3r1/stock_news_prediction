Frumkes, head of Content Development for Rosetta Stone Inc. (NYSE: RST), to its Board of Directors, it was announced today. Dr. Frumkes will serve as an at-large member for a term of two years.\n“I cannot think of a greater honor than to serve on the Board of an organization that has done so much in propelling world language learning into the national conversation,” said Dr. Frumkes. “I’ve represented Rosetta Stone at JNCL-NCLIS Advocacy Days for the past four years and have witnessed first-hand the organization’s dedication to its mission. The group pursues extraordinary and important work, initiatives that virtually no one else is tackling, and achieves outstanding results. I am extremely proud to play a part in it and look forward to making greater contributions in the future.”\nThe mission of JNCL-NCLIS, along with its member organizations, is to ensure all Americans have the opportunity to learn and use English and at least one other language. The organization represents more than 130 national, regional and state organizations encompassing virtually all areas of the language field: the major and less-commonly taught languages, including English and English as a second language, bilingual education, the classics, linguistics, exchanges, research, technology, and translation.\n\"JNCL-NCLIS are honored to welcome Dr. Frumkes to our Board of Directors,” said William P. Rivers, the organization’s Executive Director. “Lisa is a thoughtful colleague and a national leader in blended learning for languages, and we look forward to working with her on our Board.”\nDr. Frumkes has worked at the intersection of languages, technology, and education for more than 25 years. She holds a PhD in Slavic Linguistics from the University of Washington in Seattle, where she wrote her dissertation envisioning the creation of an e-textbook for elementary Russian.\nAfter receiving her doctorate, she worked with faculty at small liberal-arts colleges to integrate technology into their language teaching. Then, after several years as a linguistic architect and localization manager at the stock-imagery company Getty Images, she spent nearly 10 years at Apex Learning overseeing the creation of content for the high school market, including courses in World Languages, Advanced Placement, electives, high-stakes test prep, and English Language Arts.\nAs the leader of Content Development at Rosetta Stone, her team includes linguists, assessment experts, and researchers responsible for the creation of language-learning content. Since her arrival, her team has constructed courses on business English and Spanish for healthcare. One of their current projects focuses on preserving the language and culture of the Chickasaw Nation. The team has also constructed placement, progress, and proficiency tests in a number of languages, while conducting research on improving the use of technology in the teaching and learning of language.\nLisa’s professional interests are most closely aligned to organizations such as the Computer-Assisted Language Instruction Consortium (CALICO) and the International Organization for Language Learning Technology (IALLT). She has studied over a dozen languages, but finds herself most at home in English, French, German, and Russian.\nAbout JNCL-NCLIS\nIn 1976, the Joint National Committee for Languages began as an informal coalition of eight national language teaching associations, and now has grown to over 100 members, including national, regional, and state organizations.

NCLIS is a nonprofit trade association that serves as an “action arm” for the language and international education community by translating professional priorities into national policy.\nAbout Rosetta Stone\nRosetta Stone Inc.
