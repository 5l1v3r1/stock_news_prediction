REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo The warning came despite a 12 percent rise in annual pretax profit on the back of higher online sales. The retailer, which operates 532 stores and concessions worldwide, said it expects capital expenditure of 30 million pounds in the new financial year, down from 36.6 million pounds in the prior year. “The recent unseasonal weather across Europe and the East Coast of America has had an impact on the early part of trading for Spring/Summer,” the company said. Ted Baker, unlike it peers, has been going slow on new store openings and has re-modelled existing outlets to compliment its online offering in the face of a decline in the overall British clothing market. Full-year online sales jumped 39.8 percent to 101.1 million pounds, accounting for 22.8 percent of retail sales. The company, which trades from outlets, standalone showrooms and concessions, said group pretax profit rose to 68.8 million pounds for the year ended Jan. 27, from 61.3 million pounds a year earlier. Retail sales in its UK and Europe business rose 7.7 percent to 301.1 million pounds. The company also raised its full-year dividend by 12.1 percent to 60.1 pence.
