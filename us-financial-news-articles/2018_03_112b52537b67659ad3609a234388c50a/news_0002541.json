All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\nHighlights\nBeaufor Mine\nProduction and sale of 5,444 ounces of gold in the second quarter, a 62% increase over the 3,380 ounces produced in the prior quarter by the previous owner and a 16% increase over the quarterly average of 4,715 ounces produced during the prior nine-month period.

We also managed to generate a positive EBITDA for the quarter.\"\n\"In addition, 2018 will be a very active year for Monarques on the exploration side. We have allocated significant amounts to increasing the reserve at the Beaufor Mine and extending the mine's life, as well as increasing the resource at the Croinor Gold deposit, which continues to develop in line with our expectations. The results of the latest drilling programs on Beaufor and Croinor Gold show that those deposits have excellent exploration potential. We have also undertaken 43‑101 resource estimates for the McKenzie Break and Swanson properties and are currently planning our development strategy for the Wasamac gold deposit,\" Mr. Lacoste concluded.\nFinancial results summary\n(in dollars, except per share data)\nQuarter ended\nDecember 31\nSix months ended\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenue\n10,297,924\n–\n10,297,924\n–\nGross margin\n1,456,487\n–\n1,456,487\n–\nNet income (loss)\n665,591\n(540,413)\n166,837\n(1,013,822)\nNet income (loss) per share, basic and diluted\n0.003\n(0.004)\n0.001\n(0.008)\nCash flows from operating activities\n2,507,554\n(649,884)\n1,594,751\n(980,163)\nEBITDA 1\n461,875\n(395,385)\n131,470\n(794,625)\n1\nNon-IFRS measure.

On October 26, 2017, the Corporation announced the results of an updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for its wholly owned Wasamac gold project establishing a measured and indicated resource of 2,587,900 ounces of gold and an inferred resource of 293,900 ounces (see press release ). On December 14, 2017, Monarques announced strong results from its drilling program on the Croinor Gold deposit, including 7.84 g/t Au over 9.0 metres (29.5 feet) (see press release ). The Corporation noted that the new results continued to demonstrate the predictability of the geological model used, and that the Croinor Gold deposit remains open laterally and at depth. On December 21, 2017, Monarques announced the acquisition of the McKenzie Break and Swanson gold properties from Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM, TSX:AEM) (see press release ). The transaction enabled the Corporation to consolidate its portfolio of properties in the Abitibi region with the addition of two high quality gold projects that, with the Wasamac and Croinor Gold properties, bring Monarques' total number of advanced projects to four. On January 11, 2018, the Corporation reported excellent results from its drilling program at the Beaufor Mine, including 61.48 g/t Au over 3.9 metres (see press release ), confirming the strong exploration potential in the area to the east of Zone Q. On February 8, 2018, Monarques announced a positive updated prefeasibility study for the Croinor Gold deposit (see press release ).\nNext steps\nMonarques' goal for the coming quarters is to increase the profitability of the Beaufor mine, mainly by cutting production costs and increasing the grade through more selective mining. Production costs will be reduced through higher productivity at the Camflo Mill, among other things, with the increase in custom milling activities. Monarques has announced drilling programs of 30,000 metres at the Beaufor Mine and 20,000 metres at the Croinor Gold deposit. The Corporation has also started 43-101 resource estimates for its McKenzie Break and Swanson gold projects. The Corporation will also assess the possibility of restarting the Beacon Mill in the second half of the year to accommodate an anticipated increase in demand for custom milling services. Finally, the Corporation is exploring a number of options for the development of the Wasamac gold deposit, including custom milling and the use of a railway system (located less than 500 metres from the Wasamac site).\nThe technical and scientific content of this press release has been reviewed and approved by Marc-André Lavergne, Eng., the Corporation's qualified person under National Instrument 43‑101.\nABOUT MONARQUES GOLD CORPORATION\nMonarques Gold Corp (TSX.V:MQR) is an emerging gold producer focused on pursuing growth through its large portfolio of high-quality projects in the Abitibi mining camp in Quebec, Canada.
