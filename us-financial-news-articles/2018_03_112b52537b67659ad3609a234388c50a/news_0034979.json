(NASDAQ:HAIR), the global leader in robotic hair restoration, announced today that the Company has received US FDA 510(k) clearance to expand the ARTAS® technology to include implantation. The Company plans to begin offering this additional functionality before the end of 2018.\nRyan Rhodes, President and Chief Executive Officer of Restoration Robotics said, “510(k) clearance of the implantation technology enables an important addition to our already-robust hair restoration solution. We plan to complete the necessary design and engineering work to launch the implantation functionality by year-end. This enhancement will further extend ARTAS’ leadership position in the field of robotic hair restoration.”\nAbout Restoration Robotics\nRestoration Robotics, Inc., is a medical device company developing and commercializing the ARTAS Robotic Hair Restoration System. We believe the ARTAS System is the first and only physician-assisted system to dissect, and assist in the harvesting of, follicular units directly from the scalp and create recipient implant sites using proprietary algorithms. The Company has unique expertise in machine vision, image guidance, visual servoing and robotics, as well as developing intuitive interfaces to manage these technologies.\nForward-looking Statements\nStatements made in this press release that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as “would,” “may,” “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “intends,” “projects” and other terms with similar meaning. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this document are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this document and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Such statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control, that could cause actual results and other future events to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: whether there is growth in demand for our ARTAS System for use in harvesting hair follicles for transplant; the progress of our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; the continuing productivity and effectiveness of our commercial infrastructure and salesforce; our financial performance; our ability to establish collaborations and/or partnerships; expanding the approved use of ARTAS for use in dissecting hair follicles to include women and individuals without straight brown or black hair; our expectations regarding the potential market size and the size of the patient populations for ARTAS being accurate; whether we are effective in the pricing of ARTAS; whether we are successful in the implementation of our business model and strategic plans for our business and technology; the scope of protection we are able to establish and maintain for intellectual property rights covering ARTAS, along with any product enhancements; our ability to accurately estimate our expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, our needs for additional financing and our ability to obtain additional capital; and developments relating to our competitors and our industry, including competing therapies and procedures. These factors, together with those that are described in greater detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2018, as well as any reports that we may file with the SEC in the future, may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied by our forward-looking statements.
