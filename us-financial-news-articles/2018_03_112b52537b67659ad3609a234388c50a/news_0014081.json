United States Steel Corp. X -2.93% says it will fire up a blast furnace in Granite City, Ill., and call back 500 workers, while Century Aluminum Co. CENX -7.48% is preparing to restart lines at a smelter in Kentucky that have been curtailed since 2015 . The WSJ’s Bob Tita and Andrew Tangel write steel and aluminum makers are ramping up capacity to make up for imports that may become too expensive for American manufacturers. President Donald Trump is expected to sign his proclamation outlining the new tariffs today, even as many congressional Republicans continue to object to the plan and exporters are raising concerns over retaliation. The impact on metal markets is already forming, with American producers firing up more furnaces so they don’t lose out to foreign competitors if they can’t make enough metal to meet demand, even at higher prices.\nAmazon.com Inc. is stepping up its bid for low-income shoppers as it tries to build more volume in its burgeoning logistics network. The online giant is extending its discounted Prime program to the roughly 20% of the U.S. population that is signed up for Medicaid , the WSJ’s Laura Stevens reports, launching a new salvo in a battle for customers with Walmart Inc. as Amazon looks to build a bigger audience for its marketplace. Analysts say low-income households haven’t moved online as forcefully as wealthier shoppers, but consumer habits are shifting and driving more household staples through Amazon’s system. Most low-income shoppers now have mobile phones, and companies including United Parcel Service Inc. and Amazon have been adding lockers and other pickup locations for safe, more convenient delivery. Amazon is betting that cutting the cost of membership and shipping will push more goods through its distribution centers—and more revenue to the company’s digital services.\nThe rebound in global metals markets is starting to show some cracks. A rally that had helped boost troubled the commodities business has partly reversed this year, signaling that investor conviction in a rosy economic outlook is giving way to concern over slowing demand and unease that metals have turned into risky assets. The WSJ’s Amrith Ramkumar reports that copper futures have slipped 4.3% this year after reaching a near four-year high in December and that prices for zinc and lead are falling. Global steel and aluminum prices are down, even as U.S. prices for the metals have risen on the back of President Donald Trump’s pledge for new tariffs on imports. The unease could undermine a fragile recovery for bulk carriers that began last year. Bulk shipping prices have been recovering recently from a December-January swoon but research group Alphabulk says freight rates for vessel operators remain below the levels of 2013, however.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES The U.S. Steel Corp. Granite City Works facility. Photo: Bloomberg News A highly private European holding company is quietly building a caffeine-fueled global powerhouse. Little-known JAB, a one-time industrial chemicals manufacturer, is emerging from the shadows with a series of acquisitions of big brand consumer names to give the business a sprawling national network to distribute cold-brewed coffees . The WSJ’s Zeke Turner and Julie Jargon report that JAB started its growth push buying Keurig Green Mountain in 2016 for $13.9 billion, and capped a stream of acquisitions this January with the $26 billion buy of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. The driving strategy is to build ever-larger scale to sell coffee in nearly every form and venue, including distribution of brands such as Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks that it doesn’t own. JAB is betting the U.S. beverage industry is on the cusp of a reorganization that will favor more disciplined supply-chain management that can come from owning both the brands and the distribution network.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ They come for shipping.
