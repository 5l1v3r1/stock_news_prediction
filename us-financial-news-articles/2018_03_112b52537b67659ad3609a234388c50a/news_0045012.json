Roughing up one side of a ball can help it to swing through the air, making it more difficult for the batsman to hit.\nThe position of Australian cricket captain is even locally referred to as the second most important position behind the Prime Minister.\nIndeed, Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull intervened on Sunday to demand quick action from Cricket Australia.\nBRUISING PAY DISPUTE The sport’s past heroes, including the late Sir Donald Bradman, are revered for their conduct as much as their victories, helping create a clean, attractive brand to attract corporate sponsors.\nThat’s now tarnished.\n“This is deeply disappointing and certainly not what anyone expects from our national cricket team,” Qantas said in a statement. “We are in discussions with Cricket Australia as this issue unfolds.”\nCricket Australia earned A$338.4 million ($261 million) in media, sponsorship and spectator fees in the financial year ended June 30, 2017, according to its most recent annual report. The value of its individual sponsorships are not disclosed.\nCricket Australia did not immediately respond to Reuters’ questions on Monday.\nThe ball-tampering incident has struck at the climax of talks about a five-year broadcast rights deal with Australian television networks.\nLong-term cricket broadcaster Nine Entertainment did not immediately respond to questions on Monday.\nCricket players and the governing body have also recently come out of a bruising pay dispute.\nIndependent media analyst Peter Cox said the ball-tampering scandal could prove disastrous for cricket’s reputation and negotiating clout in Australia.\n“It could not have possibly come at a worse time,” Cox told Reuters in a phone interview.\n“The individual incident will eventually blow over but they will lose a segment of the viewing market because of this.” ($1 = 1.2945 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY Editing by Martin Howell)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T08:31:48.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
