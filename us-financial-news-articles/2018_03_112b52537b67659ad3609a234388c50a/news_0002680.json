REUTERS/David Gray /File Photo The breach of covenants arose primarily from provisions made for expected losses in the company’s building and interiors division, Fletcher had said last month. It had received a waiver from its bank syndicate.\nThe company said it is now discussing with both its bank syndicate and USPP noteholders the terms of its funding arrangements, and will continue to target the end of March 2018 to complete the amendment process.\nHowever, if it does not agree on the amendments by March 31, it will need to seek an extension of the waiver from the bank syndicate and the USPP noteholders.\nThe company had said it would wind down its commercial construction business due to mounting losses, and flagged losses of NZ$660 million ($474.87 million) for building and interiors in fiscal 2018.\nFletcher posted a net loss of NZ$273 million for the six months to Dec. 31, compared with a net profit of NZ$176 million for the same period the previous year.\nReporting by Nicole Pinto in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T13:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:23:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
