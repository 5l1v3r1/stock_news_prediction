But I think the reality is it's not that,\" psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University, told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.\nKogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook, also said that he was being made a scapegoat by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Both companies have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse.\nOnly 300,000 Facebook users responded to Kogan's quiz, but that gave the researcher access to those peoples Facebook friends as well, who had not agreed to share information, producing details on 50 million users.\nFacebook has said it subsequently made changes that prevent people from sharing data about friends, and maintains that no data breach occurred because the original users gave permission. Critics say that it essentially was a breach because data of unsuspecting friends was taken.\nZuckerberg said on Wednesday the company \"will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse\". Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from using any of Facebook's services on Friday.\nMany analysts have now raised concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on user engagement with Facebook, potentially reducing its clout with advertisers.\nDZ Bank was the third Wall Street brokerage this week to make a rare cut in price targets for Facebook on Wednesday.\n\"Investors now have to consider whether or not the company will conclude that it has grown in a manner that has proven to be untenable or whether it needs to significantly improve how it is managed,\" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.\nFacebook shares closed up 0.7 percent on Wednesday, but are still down more than 8 percent since Friday. The company has risen more than 550 percent in value in the past five years.\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington and Kate Holton in London Writing by Susan Thomas Editing by Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T07:00:11.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
