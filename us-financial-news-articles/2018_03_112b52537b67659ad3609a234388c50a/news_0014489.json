REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration “The clock is ticking,” Christoph Debus, head of the travel group’s airline business, told Reuters in an interview at the ITB travel trade fair. “Brexit is coming in March 2019 and we are already selling tickets for summer 2019.”\nBritish airlines currently have unlimited flying rights to, from and within the European Union as part of an EU’s single aviation market. Carriers must be majority EU-owned to exercise those rights.\nAfter Brexit, it is not clear what agreements will govern flying rights between Britain and the remaining EU countries or what Britain’s status within the bloc’s aviation safety regulator, EASA, will be.\n“I believe that there will be a solution, but the question is how quickly,” Debus said, saying a two-year transition period in which everything remains according to current rules while details are cleared up would be desirable.\nEarlier this week, the boss of British Airways parent IAG ( ICAG.L ) , Willie Walsh said he was convinced a solution would be found, although Ryanair’s ( RYA.I ) CEO predicted disruption in April 2019.\nReporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T17:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:35:40.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
