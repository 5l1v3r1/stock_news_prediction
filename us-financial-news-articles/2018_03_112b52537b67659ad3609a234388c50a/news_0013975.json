OpCapita did not say how much it paid for Sebeto. * OpCapita acquired the restaurant operator from London-based private equity firm Change Capital. * The buyer said it saw significant potential to grow the Rossopomodoro brand in Italy and abroad, exploiting its Neapolitan heritage. * The fund has picked new managers to strengthen the Sebeto team, including former CEO of Benetton group Marco Airoldi and COO of travel caterer Autogrill Roberto Colombo. * Change Capital was advised on the deal by Rothschild with Legance as legal adviser, while Lazard and legal firm Chiomenti advised OpCapita on the deal. * Studio Legale Ambrosino-Pecora advised Sebeto founders and other shareholders.
