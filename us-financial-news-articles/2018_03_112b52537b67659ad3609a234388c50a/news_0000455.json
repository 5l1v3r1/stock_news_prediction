CloudBees also dramatically expanded its user base, adding 69 percent more new customers than it did in 2016.\n“I am very pleased with our 2017 business results. We never took our eyes off the ball, but remained focused on our growth and product innovation goals throughout the year,” said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder of CloudBees. “The industry is converging at the intersection of cloud, containers and DevOps. We will continue to lead the way for our customers as they adopt and accelerate their DevOps initiatives.”\nStarting with the appointment of Anthony Palladino as SVP of worldwide sales and field operations in December 2016, CloudBees strengthened its executive team. Palladino was instrumental in building out the sales and field organizations, providing expanded sales coverage throughout North America and EMEA. CloudBees also appointed Charles E. Peters, Jr. , former EVP and CFO of Red Hat, to the board of directors. With growth of 67 percent in employees during the year, another key addition to the executive team was Evangelina Vallez , VP of global human resources. The hiring momentum continued into early 2018, with the appointment of Matt Parson , former treasurer at Red Hat, as CFO. Additionally, the February acquisition of Codeship , a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous delivery service provider, brought Moritz Plassnig to the team as VP, cloud.\nCloudBees brought on James Strachan, James Rawlings and Rob Davies, the engineers behind fabric8, an open source, integrated development platform for Kubernetes. This move demonstrates CloudBees’ commitment to Kubernetes as the container platform of choice and the foundation of its enterprise DevOps offerings.\nCloudBees maintained a steady pace throughout 2017 in delivering innovation for DevOps teams. The company released CloudBees DevOptics to help organizations increase collaboration, identify ROI from DevOps and optimize DevOps investments. Earlier in the year, CloudBees also worked closely with the Jenkins community to develop Blue Ocean , the new intuitive user experience for Jenkins and CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise, aimed at making continuous delivery adoption easier for all organizations. Almost 20,000 downloads of the Blue Ocean plugin have occurred, to date.\nThere were also several strategic partnerships CloudBees focused on throughout the year. CloudBees partnered with VMware to integrate with VMware Cloud™ on AWS and also launched DevOps Managed Services , a solution delivered by select Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and powered by CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise.\nCloudBees’ success in the DevOps industry did not go unnoticed. The company was recognized with a Gold award for DevOps Tools from the DevInsider 2017 IT Awards , Best in Show in the SD Times 100 , and the Best DevOps Executives award went to Sacha Labourey and Kohsuke Kawaguchi, in DevOps.com’s DevOps Dozen Awards . CloudBees was also recognized for being a premier employer, being named one of the 10 best tech startups in San Jose by The Tech Tribune, and also listed in Wealthfront’s 2018 Career Launching Companies List .\nFinally, CloudBees was ranked a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Continuous Integration Tools, Q3 2017 1 .\nFind out more about how CloudBees helps DevOps teams accelerate software delivery:\nTry CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/get-started/cloudbees-jenkins-enterprise Try Codeship by CloudBees\nhttps://codeship.com Try CloudBees DevOptics\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-devoptics Learn more about the Codeship acquisition\nhttps://www.cloudbees.com/press/cloudbees-acquires-saas-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-leader-codeship\n1 The Forrester Wave™: Continuous Integration Tools, Q3 2017 , September 27, 2017.\nAbout CloudBees\nCloudBees is the hub of enterprise Jenkins and DevOps, providing companies with smarter solutions for accelerating software development and the fastest path from great ideas to impactful software.
