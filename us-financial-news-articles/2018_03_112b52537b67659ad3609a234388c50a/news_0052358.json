Data showing fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth slowed less than estimated also supported the greenback.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 90.099.\nAnalysts said this week’s jump for the dollar looked overdone, however, and that many of the structural reasons for the U.S. currency’s decline - trade and budget deficits and monetary tightening in other parts of the world - remained.\n“Is U.S. protectionism good or bad? The market is very undecided about this, but the dollar’s bounce was a little bit too bold from the market’s perspective,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank.\nGerman inflation data due out later on Thursday could move the euro but only marginally, said Leuchtmann.\nThe euro has been weighed down recently by comments from some European Central Bank officials suggesting the ECB is in no hurry to wind back its stimulus, given the spectre of low inflation.\nSo traders will be looking at German consumer price data for March, due at 1200 GMT.\n“Frankly, the data would have to surprise to have a meaningful impact, the market basically has made up its mind about hikes, even if the data comes higher, it doesn’t mean the ECB would get more excited or hike any sooner,” he said.\nElsewhere, the dollar eased against the yen, losing some momentum after hopes of detente in East Asia provided the spark for its largest daily gain in six months the previous session.\nThe dollar fell 0.2 percent to 106.63 yen, giving back some gains after surging 1.43 percent on Wednesday, its biggest rise since Sept. 11 of last year.\nChina said on Wednesday North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearisation, while U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that Kim looked forward to meeting with him.\nThis has prompted some speculation among traders that a diplomatic breakthrough over North Korea’s nuclear programme might be closer at hand than ever before, although the hurdles to a solution remain stiff.\nBecause of Japan’s status as a net creditor nation, the yen tends to be bought on rising geopolitical tensions and vice versa.\nSome traders also noted, however, that currency trading so far this week has been driven by flows related to quarter-end, and for many Japanese firms, the financial year end, on March 31.\n“There are a lot of noises this week. We feel quarter-end, and financial-year end flows are somehow larger this year than usual,” said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street.
