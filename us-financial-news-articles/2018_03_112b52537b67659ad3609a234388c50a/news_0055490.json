In particular, any statements that do not relate to historical or current facts constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the proposed tender offer and the proposed merger. Forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"target,\" similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the failure to consummate the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger. The inclusion of such statements should not be regarded as a representation that any plans, estimates or expectations will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such plans, estimates or expectations include, among others, that: (1) the Company may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the proposed merger; (2) conditions to the closing of the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger may not be satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; (3) the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; (4) the business of the Company may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger or the potential adverse changes to business relationships resulting from the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger; (5) legal proceedings may be initiated related to the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger and the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger may be adverse to the Company; (6) there may be unforeseen events, changes or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (7) risks that the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger may disrupt current plans and operations and present potential difficulties in employee retention; (8) uncertainties as to how many of the Company's stockholders will tender their shares in the proposed tender offer and other risks to consummation of the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger, including the risk that the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all; and (9) the risks described in its periodic reports filed with the SEC, including, but not limited to, \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information\" under Part I and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 and subsequent periodic reports containing updated disclosures of such risks. Such risks include, without limitation: the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and obtain sufficient financing to continue its operations and pay its obligations, conditions in the industry sectors that the Company serves, including the slowing of client decisions on proposals and project opportunities along with scope reduction of existing projects, the Company's ability to retain the limited number of large clients that constitute a major portion of its revenues, the Company's ability to protect client or Company data or information systems from security breaches and cyber-attacks, technological advances and competitive factors in the markets in which the Company competes, and volatility in foreign exchange rates. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger, will be more fully discussed in the Company's Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 and in the proxy statement that may be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed tender offer or the proposed merger, respectively. There can be no assurance that the proposed merger will be completed, or if it is completed, that it will close within the anticipated time period.
