It has issued $39 billion in bonds, including a $9 billion sukuk.\nDomestically, the government has raised a total of over 70 billion riyals ($18.67 billion) through monthly local currency sukuk issues since last July.\nThe sovereign has recently agreed the refinancing, extension and upsizing of a $10 billion loan it had raised in 2016. The loan has now been increased to $16 billion.\nThe DMO said in January it had also issued requests for proposals to banks to arrange further dollar debt issuance and financing supported by other countries’ export credit agencies.\nA new dollar bond sale could be marketed over the coming weeks, sources told Reuters last month.
