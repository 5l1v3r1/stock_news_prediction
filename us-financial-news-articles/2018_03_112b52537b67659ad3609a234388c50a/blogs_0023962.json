But as we have seen with other categories, that doesn't mean Amazon won't try again, and they should,\" analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"Amazon's focus on selection/service, pricing, and frictionless payment that drive conversion and stronger user economics also translate directly to travel.\"\nThe analyst said Amazon has more than 300 million consumers who could spend money on a potential travel offering. He estimated online travel companies such as Booking and Expedia spend about $620 million a year each to acquire their global hotel room inventory, which is not a large investment size for Amazon.\n\"Our rough ad efficiency analysis (ad spend/transaction) speaks to Amazon's ability to drive repeat/direct trafficâ€¦as its estimated $0.75 ad spend/transaction is a fraction of what Booking/Expedia spend,\" he wrote.\nNowak said travel represents an annual market of $480 billion in the U.S. alone. He estimates Amazon could make $600 million of profits a year if it builds an online hotel business roughly half of Expedia's size.\nThe analyst reiterated his $1,500 price target for Amazon shares, representing slight downside to Thursday's close. The company's shares have surged 33 percent so far this year through Thursday, which may be a factor in why the analyst hasn't updated his forecast yet.\nAmazon shares rose 0.9 percent Friday.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T21:01:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
