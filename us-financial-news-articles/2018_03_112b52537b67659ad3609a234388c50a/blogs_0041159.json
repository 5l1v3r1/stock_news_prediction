But the changes that do get made can offer critical clues, subtle or not, about the outlook for policy. \nIn January, officials rewrote the first paragraph (which describes recent economic developments), removed a sentence about hurricane-related disruptions, added the word “further” in several references to planned gradual interest-rate increases, and updated a line about inflation to say that it was expected to “move up this year” rather than “remain somewhat below 2% in the near term.” \nWill Jerome Powell look to overhaul the statement at his first meeting as chairman?
