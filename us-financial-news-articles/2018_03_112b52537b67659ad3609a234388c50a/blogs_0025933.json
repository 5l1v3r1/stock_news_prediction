Kudlow, a former Wall Street economist and free trade advocate, would take the job if Trump offered it, Cramer also reported.\nKudlow criticized Trump's decision to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and lamented that Cohn left the White House, However, Kudlow applauded the administration's decision to give tariff exemptions to Canada and Mexico.\nIn his remarks Tuesday, Trump said he would welcome disagreement from Kudlow.\n\"We don't agree on everything, but in this case I think that's good,\" Trump said. \"I want to have different opinions. We agree on most. He now has come around to believing in tariffs as a negotiating point.\"\nTrump has tied the exemptions for Mexico and Canada to ongoing negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president has threatened to scrap unless the U.S. can secure what he sees as a better deal.\nKudlow declined to comment on Monday's report from Cramer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T15:49:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
