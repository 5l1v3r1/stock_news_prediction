Milk intake fell 30 percent in the half-year to end-December, the company said last month.\n“Further losses of milk flow may trigger an impairment to Murray Goulburn’s assets that could breach banking covenants and result in potential withdrawal of creditors’ support,” it warned in its half-year results.\nOther suitors for Murray Goulburn had included Australia’s Bega Cheese Ltd ( BGA.AX ), Italy’s Parmalat ( PLT.MI ) and China’s Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd ( 600887.SS ).\nReporting by Colin Packham in Sydney; additional reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T02:23:59.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
