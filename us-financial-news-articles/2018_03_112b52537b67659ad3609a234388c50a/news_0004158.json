That’s why Melissa Toth suspects she will never win an Academy Award.\nThe New York-based designer came up with the costumes for several Oscar-nominated films, including Casey Affleck’s Carhartt couture in “Manchester by the Sea,” Kate Winslet’s frocks in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and Frances McDormand’s bandanna and jumpsuit in this year’s best picture contender “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” But these are contemporary films, where the designer aims not for a statement but for subtlety—which seldom gets much Oscar love.\nCostume designer Melissa Toth worked on films including ‘Manchester by the Sea’ and ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.’ Photo: Zarouhi Kuhn “You put my kind of costumes on a mannequin and they look ridiculous,” Ms. Toth says. “You’d say, ‘Why is this worthy of anything?’ And maybe it’s not worthy of anything, when it’s disassociated from the performance of the actor.”\nIt’s the same story with makeup. “We ask ourselves, ‘Is it real? Do you absolutely believe it?’ ” said Leonard Engelman, one of the three governors of the hair and makeup branch of the Academy. His fellow governor Kathryn Blondell says the makeup or hair artist works with the cinematographer to create believable illusions. Veteran cinematographer Richard Crudo describes these artists’ work as “something that feels all of a piece, where nothing stands out, nothing calls attention to itself. It should it support the story in the most invisible ways.”\nTherein lies a contradiction: Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony inevitably will include paeans to the collaborative nature of filmmaking. But the artists who help give audiences a believable contemporary experience at the cinema seldom end up with statuettes. \n“It’s Pavlovian,” says Jeffrey Kurland, a Hollywood costume designer (“Dunkirk”), and an Academy governor for 12 years. “You go toward the biggest, the shiniest. The bigger the hoop on the skirt, the more attention it’s going to get. It’s just a fact.”\nWill it change? “It should,” Mr. Kurland says.\nUntil the mid-’60s there were separate Oscars for color films and black and white ones. Edith Head, who holds the record with eight awards for costume design, was honored for “All About Eve” in 1951, “A Place in the Sun” in 1952 and “Roman Holiday” in 1954, all black and white films that were contemporary for their time. “Black and white was where contemporary design would be recognized,” Mr. Kurland says. “Then wiser minds than mine decided to eliminate it.” \nLike many designers, Mr. Kurland emphasized that in contemporary films, rather than period pieces, costumes are more crucial to the storytelling process precisely because they are so familiar.\nNew York-based designer Melissa Toth came up with the costumes for ‘Manchester by the Sea,’ with Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck.

They’ll tell you if it’s sexy enough or masculine enough. When it’s a period movie, people are out of their depth. They’re more in awe of it. They don’t say, ‘That’s from 1842, not 1872.’ With contemporary, it’s a gut reaction.”\nMs. George expressed some dissatisfaction with Oscar’s treatment of her craft but acknowledged the caprices inherent in awards season. “Isn’t it the same with the best picture?” she asked. “It’s not always the best picture.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T16:56:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
