AUGUSTINE, Fla., March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Creative Learning Corporation (OTCPK: CLCN)\nThe Company reported revenues of $597,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $738,886 in the same quarter last year. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $547,000 compared to $609,000 for the same quarter last year. Initial franchise sales were $48,900 for the quarter compared to $130,000 for the same quarter last year.\nThe Company experienced a reduction in new franchise sales revenue primarily due to fewer initial franchise sales in 2017. There was 1 domestic and no international sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to no domestic and two international sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2016. In addition, royalty fees decreased approximately $61,000 due to the reduction in active US franchisees in prior periods. There were 651 active franchise territories during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 746 during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses decreased to approximately $702,670 in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from approximately $778,095 in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, or $75,000, due to decreases in professional fees of $121,000 and in franchise consulting and commissions of $69,000 slightly offset by higher other general and administrative expenses. The decrease in professional fees was due to reduced legal activity and a more streamlined approach to handling legal issues while the increase in general and administrative expenses related to higher travel and conference related costs. The Company reported a net loss of $105,654 or $.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $20,538, or $.00 per share, in the same quarter last year.\nChristian Miller Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer stated, \"While the period's results weren't where we wanted them to be, we are optimistic for our future growth. We have continued to cut costs associated with professional fees and we've made significant progress in developing our sales pipeline. In addition, we have made progress in the development of two more revenue streams which we anticipate will be on line in 2018.\"\nConference Call\nThe shareholder call will be on Monday March 12 th at 2pm.
