People typically activate their Echo speakers by saying the word “Alexa,” which triggers the device to listen and respond to commands like changing the volume. \nThe latest laughing is causing some customers to feel unsettled and confused. Other say it’s spooky, like something out of a horror film. \nAlthough third-party devices like some HP Inc. personal computers and certain modems work with Alexa, the problem appears to be limited to the Amazon Echo and the smaller Echo Dot. I live alone and have lights controlled by Amazon Echo. Tonight, while sleeping, i closed my eyes and said “Alexa, lamp off.”I heard a woman laugh, and lights were still on. \nNow, I know that stupid device heard “laugh” instead of “lamp off”, but I can’t sleep anymore….. #fml \n— Vedant Naik (@vedantNAIK) March 4, 2018 Lying in bed about to fall asleep when Alexa on my Amazon Echo Dot lets out a very loud and creepy laugh… there’s a good chance I get murdered tonight. \n— Gavin Hightower (@GavinHightower) February 26, 2018 my amazon alexa thing just started laughing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:32:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
