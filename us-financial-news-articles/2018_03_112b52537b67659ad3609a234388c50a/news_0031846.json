The planning for a potential meeting is happening as the State Department, which is already riddled with vacancies , is transitioning to a new secretary of State. The department also lacks a permanent ambassador to South Korea.\nExperts have expressed skepticism that the meeting would take place, or that it would yield any results , and the White House has insisted that North Korea will have to meet specific conditions first.\nAccording to the White House, Moon and Trump \"expressed cautious optimism over recent developments and emphasized that a brighter future is available for North Korea, if it chooses the correct path.\"\nTrump's decision to agree to a meeting with Kim came March 8, while Tillerson was in Africa tending to other diplomatic business. It was a dramatic reversal for the president, who had made threats against North Korea after the rogue nation's numerous missile launches . He also called Kim \"Little Rocket Man.\"\nTillerson, who did not see eye-to-eye with the president on numerous issues, had pressed for diplomacy on North Korea, which Trump publicly mocked.\nTrump fired Tillerson on Tuesday, and picked CIA Director Mike Pompeo as his replacement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T19:29:44.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
