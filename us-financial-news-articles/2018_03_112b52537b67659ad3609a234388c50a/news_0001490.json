It said Barnes will take up his new role on April 15, overseeing the UK, Ireland and the United States markets. He will be replaced as UK & Ireland CEO by Giles Hurley, a 20-year veteran of the retailer, on May 1. Barnes has been UK & Ireland CEO since April 2015 and for the five years prior to that was joint managing director. He has presided over a period of phenomenal growth for Aldi as the firm has won market share from Britain’s big four grocers - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons. Aldi is now Britain’s fifth biggest grocer, with a market share of 6.9 percent, according to researcher Kantar Worldpanel.
