The prime contractor will be a joint venture of Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, it added.\nReporting by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Eric Beech and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:42:53.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
