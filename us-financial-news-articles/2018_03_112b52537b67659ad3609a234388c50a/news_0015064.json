In addition, Atlanta's more central location and access to major transportation hubs makes it an attractive location to base much of the team needed to support the company's next phase of growth into new markets and product categories.\nEdible is currently reviewing real estate options in Atlanta with plans to add 50 jobs in the coming year and another 150 positions over time. In addition, the selection of Nahas to oversee Edible operations brings the brand an immediate and important presence in the Atlanta franchise and business communities.\nNahas has nearly two decades of experience leading teams at several companies in the greater Atlanta area. He most recently served as Senior Vice President of Paris-based Capgemini in their Atlanta office.\n\"This is a historic moment for the Edible brand,\" said Nahas. \"Having spent most of my career in Atlanta, I see it as the perfect location for Edible to expand the team needed to support its worldwide system of almost 1,300 locations.\"\nFarid, who was recently inducted into the International Franchise Association's Hall of Fame, already has a business presence in Atlanta with his technology company Naranga, a leading provider of franchise sales and software solutions, which is based in the city. He said the expansion in Atlanta and the selection of Nahas as president is just the first step in the next phase of dramatic growth for the brand.\n\"Christian has been a major figure in the Atlanta business community and his experience and expertise will be critical as we ramp up our operations in the market,\" Farid said. \"He joins Edible at a pinnacle moment for our global business as we prepare our next phase of growth and development that will include the addition of exciting new revenue streams for our brand and our franchisees.\"\nABOUT EDIBLE\nWith more than 1,300 franchise locations open or under development worldwide, Edible International, LLC is the world's largest franchisor of shops offering creatively designed fresh cut fruit arrangements.
