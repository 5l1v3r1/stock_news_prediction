Statscan revised December’s gain to 2.5 percent from an initial 4.8 percent, partly to reflect changes in how the seasonally adjusted data is compiled.\nThe value of permits for multi-family dwellings in Ontario soared 71 percent on strength in Toronto, Canada’s largest city. This more than offset a 39.7 percent decline seen in December.\nThe Ontario government implemented a number of measures last year to rein in rampant price increases in Toronto and the surrounding areas.\nThe total value of permits reported by municipalities in Toronto increased by 25.5 percent, thanks largely to increased building intentions for multi-family dwellings, a category that includes condominiums and town houses.\nPermits for non-residential buildings across Canada rose by 8.9 percent, thanks mainly to strength in Ontario.\nReporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Bernadette Baum\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T21:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:27:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
