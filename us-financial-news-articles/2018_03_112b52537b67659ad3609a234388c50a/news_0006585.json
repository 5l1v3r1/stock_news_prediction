Net operating income from the Canadian operations improved by $1.1 million, and represented 11.9% of revenue this quarter compared to 11.7% in the same 2016 quarter. The 2016 results were impacted by favourable accrual adjustments of $1.6 million. Prior to these items, net operating income from the Canadian operations improved by $2.7 million or 8.8%, reflecting long-term care funding enhancements, growth of our retirement living, management and group purchasing operations, and an increased contribution from our home health care operations. Net operating income from our U.S. operations reflected higher investment income from our captive insurance subsidiary (the “Captive”) of $0.8 million.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $3.3 million or 13.6% to $27.5 million this quarter from $24.2 million in the same 2016 quarter, representing 9.8% and 8.8% of revenue, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA from the Canadian operations contributed $2.4 million to the improvement, reflecting the increase in net operating income noted above, and lower administrative costs. Prior to the favourable accrual adjustments of $1.6 million recorded in the 2016 fourth quarter, Adjusted EBITDA from the Canadian operations improved by $4.0 million or 19.2%, and as a percentage of revenue was 9.0% this quarter compared to 7.7% in the same 2016 quarter. Adjusted EBITDA from the U.S. operations improved by $0.9 million reflecting higher investment income and a reduction in administrative costs.\nEarnings from continuing operations declined by $2.9 million in the 2017 fourth quarter to $10.3 million, reflecting the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, previously discussed, a decline in other expenses in respect of a goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2016, offset by unfavourable changes in the valuation of interest rate swaps and loss (gain) on foreign exchange, a reduction in interest revenue, primarily due to the elimination of interest received in 2016 in connection with the US Sale, and increased interest expense and income taxes.\n2017 Year End Summary\nConsolidated net operating income from continuing operations improved by $5.7 million or 4.4% to $135.8 million in 2017, and as a percentage of revenue was 12.4% in 2017 compared to 12.3% in 2016. Net operating income from the Canadian operations improved by $4.1 million, and represented 12.0% of revenue in each of 2017 and 2016. Prior to the impact of favourable prior year revenue settlements and operating expense accrual adjustments recorded in 2016, aggregating $2.2 million, net operating income from the Canadian operations improved by $6.3 million or 5.1%, reflecting growth in our home health care business volumes and retirement living operations, partially offset by increased costs of resident care, and one less day this year. Net operating income from our U.S. operations reflected higher investment income from the Captive of $1.6 million.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by $4.7 million or 5.0% to $97.6 million in 2017, and represented 8.9% of revenue compared to 8.8% in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from the Canadian operations improved by $2.3 million to $93.5 million this year, reflecting growth from net operating income offset by higher administrative and lease costs, and as a percentage of revenue was unchanged at 8.6%. Prior to a one-time executive compensation charge of $2.0 million recorded in the 2017 third quarter and the $2.2 million of favourable prior year adjustments recorded in 2016, Adjusted EBITDA from the Canadian operations improved by $6.5 million or 7.4% and as a percentage of revenue would have been 8.7% this year compared to 8.4% in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from the U.S. operations improved by $2.4 million due to the increase in investment income and reduction in administrative costs.\nEarnings from continuing operations increased by $0.3 million in 2017 to $31.7 million, reflecting the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA previously discussed, a decline in other expenses in respect of proxy contest, integration and acquisition costs, and goodwill impairment incurred during 2016, favourable changes in the valuation of interest rate swaps and loss (gain) on foreign exchange, partially offset by lower interest revenue, primarily due to the elimination of interest income received in connection with the sale of the U.S. operations, and increased interest expense and income taxes.\n2017 AFFO Fourth Quarter and Year End Summary\nAFFO from continuing operations improved by $2.2 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, reflecting the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, net of a reduction in income support on acquired retirement communities, lower current income taxes, and a reduction in maintenance capex, partially offset by higher net interest expense of $2.3 million.\nThe decline in AFFO from continuing operations by $8.2 million to $58.5 million in 2017, was primarily attributable to higher net interest expense of $7.8 million, of which $7.4 million was interest income related to the sale of the U.S. operations, a reduction in the contribution of Adjusted EBITDA net of income support on acquired retirement communities, and lower government capital funding, partially offset by lower maintenance capex.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $3.3 million recorded in the 2017 fourth quarter related to a $3.1 million release of the Captive’s reserves and a net reduction in indemnification provisions and other items in respect of our previously disposed U.S. operations.\nThe loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $29.6 million recorded in 2017 related to the previously disposed U.S. operations, and included the previously disclosed write-off of deferred consideration of $37.5 million ($32.2 million after tax), and a net increase in indemnification provisions and other items of $4.8 million ($3.1 million after tax), partially offset by a $5.7 million release of the Captive’s reserves.\nFinancial Position\nExtendicare’s consolidated cash and short-term investments on hand was $128.2 million as at December 31, 2017, and excluded the investments held by our Captive of $86.3 million to support the accrual for U.S. self-insured liabilities of $61.1 million. In addition, the Company has $65.0 million of available liquidity under a demand credit facility that it arranged for in November 2017, which is secured by the assets of our home health care business, and is available for the Company’s general corporate purposes.\nOur long-term debt totalled $536.1 million as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 – $503.6 million), representing approximately 47% of our gross book value, including convertible debentures.\nOur consolidated net interest coverage ratio for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was 3.8 times. Net interest coverage is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net interest, which represents interest expense, with capitalized interest added back, net of interest revenue. Excluding interest revenue, our interest coverage ratio was 3.3 times.\nExtendicare’s financial reports, including its Management’s Discussion and Analysis are available on our website at www.extendicare.com under the “Investors/Financial Reports” section.

In addition, the Company assesses its return on investment in development activities using the non-GAAP financial measure “NOI Yield”. These are not measures recognized under GAAP and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are presented in this document because either: (i) management believes that they are a relevant measure of the ability of Extendicare to make cash distributions; or (ii) certain ongoing rights and obligations of Extendicare may be calculated using these measures. Such non-GAAP measures may differ from similar computations as reported by other issuers and, accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by such issuers. They are not intended to replace earnings (loss) from continuing operations, net earnings (loss), cash flow, or other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP.
