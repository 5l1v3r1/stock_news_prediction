Walsh, who led women’s to the inaugural Olympic sevens title at the Rio Summer Games in 2016, will replace Andy Friend after the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast next month. Friend was told last week that his contract would not be renewed, while 38-year-old Walsh had already indicated he would be stepping down from his role with the women’s team. “I had no expectation of remaining in Australia and had very seriously considered taking up an option elsewhere,” Walsh said in a media release.”But as I have always said, I am passionate about Australia, as much now as a coach as I was when I played, so naturally it was an opportunity I wanted to pursue”I certainly don’t see this move as a promotion, but it brings a number of new challenges and I am incredibly honoured to be given the opportunity to coach the Australian men’s team, especially having represented the team in the past as a player.” Australia’s men’s team are currently fourth in the sevens World Series standings behind South Africa, Fiji and New Zealand, who will all be competing with the hosts for Commonwealth Games medals next month. Rugby Australia are hoping Friend, the former coach of the ACT Brumbies Super Rugby team and English club Harlequins, will stay on with the organisation in another capacity.
