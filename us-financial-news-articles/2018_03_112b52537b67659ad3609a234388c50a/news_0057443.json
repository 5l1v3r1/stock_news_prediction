This listing could be delayed until Aramco starts trading on the Tadawul, as the Saudi stock exchange is known.\nThe Capital Market Authority (CMA) issued updated rules in the last couple of months covering how securities are sold in the kingdom and how the offer price of an IPO is calculated using the bookbuild method, Mohammed El Kuwaiz, chairman of the market regulator, told a media event in New York late Wednesday.\n\"Once (the price stabilization guideline) is issued, we can then say that the Saudi market will be fully amenable to accommodate an offering of the size of Saudi Aramco, or indeed of any size,\" he said.\nSpeaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the event, El Kuwaiz said drafting of the regulation was at \"an advanced stage,\" and it will be issued before the end of the first half of the year.\nThe CMA was also expecting to start work by the end of the year on rules governing dual-listings on the Saudi stock market that would be sent out for market feedback early in 2019, El Kuwaiz said.\nThe timetable could be brought forward if a company approached it wanting to list on another market, he added.\n(Reporting by David French; editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T02:31:13.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
