I trained so hard for this.\n“It was a difficult competition and it has given me great inspiration for the summer.”\nWilliams was equally delighted with her best championship performance.“My heart is going crazy and I’m trying to calm down but it’s exciting,” she said.\nReporting by Neil Robinson; editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T22:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:56:57.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
