They argued it would take away a key market and cause fuel price spikes in western Pennsylvania.\n“We commend the judge’s well-reasoned decision. The only winners of a Laurel reversal would be Buckeye and out-of-state refineries,” a coalition of groups, including Philadelphia-area refiners, said in a statement.\nVero said Buckeye failed to prove that the pipeline was underutilized and that consumers would be uninjured, among other issues.\n“Laurel has overstated the overall impact of the decrease on the use of the pipeline section in question,” the judge wrote.\nThe judge also rejected Buckeye’s argument that the company did not need state approval to reverse the line.\nMidwest refiners such as Marathon and Husky Energy have invested billions of dollars in recent years to take advantage of cheaper Canadian crude. These refiners were hoping to extend their ability to deliver products deeper into Pennsylvania, opening the door for a full reversal all the way to Philadelphia.\nReporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:46:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
