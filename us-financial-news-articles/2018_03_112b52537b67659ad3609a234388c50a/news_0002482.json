We have already asked for a flag meeting,” said Rahman, the force’s additional director general in charge of operations, referring to a meeting of border guards of both countries.\n“They have removed heavy weapons, such as machineguns and mortars, from the area after our verbal protests.”\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka said Acting Foreign Secretary Khurshed Alam asked envoy Lwin Oo for Myanmar’s security forces to pull back from the border, warning “such military build up will create confusion within Bangladesh and escalate tensions on the border”.\nThe action could also hamper the agreed repatriation of refugees, the ministry said in a statement, adding a diplomatic note was handed to the ambassador.\nMyanmar military spokesman Myat Min Oo said he could not confirm there was any troop activity and declined to comment further, citing a public holiday in Myanmar.\nA spokesman for the country’s Home Affairs Ministry, Myo Thu Soe, said he was unaware of the troop movements.\nMyanmar’s main government spokesman, Zaw Htay, declined to comment on Thursday’s activity.\nOn Wednesday, he told Reuters that “terrorists” with links to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which had attacked 30 Myanmar police posts and an army base in August, were sheltering in the border area.\nZaw Htay said he believed people were staying there to put political pressure on Myanmar’s government and “create a situation where Myanmar security forces and government officials will remove them”.\nAdditional reporting by Thu Thu Aung and Simon Lewis in YANGON; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:00:14.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
