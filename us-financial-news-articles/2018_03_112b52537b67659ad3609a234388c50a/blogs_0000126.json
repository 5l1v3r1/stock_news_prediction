Douglas Elliman \nGet an exclusive glimpse inside on an upcoming episode of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich .\" \nHere's a sneak peek. \nThe backyard is a dream, and includes a pool, a fire pit, cascading waterfalls and a giant Buddha statue. \n\"[The owners] were so inspired by their trip to the Four Seasons in Bali, that they wanted to recreate the Balinese serenity and tranquility right here at home,\" says Douglas Elliman broker Senada Adzem, who represents the property. \n\"They even hired a Feng Shui expert to ensure the perfect flow of energy. And obviously, they made it just right.\" Douglas Elliman \nInside, the mansion's grand entrance leads to a 30-foot-tall marble fireplace. Douglas Elliman \nOn the other side of the fireplace is an office, which features a hidden door that leads to a secret cigar room. \n\"The owner has a secret thing for cigars and a secret place to smoke them,\" says Adzem. Douglas Elliman \nThe mansion's dining room is decorated with a wall made of backlit onyx and a chain chandelier. Douglas Elliman \nUpstairs, the mega-home has a master suite fit for royalty, which includes a white mother of pearl inlay on the floor — the owners' version of a red carpet. \nBut the mansion's real showstoppers are the couple's massive walk-in closets. \nFor her, there's a room modeled after a Chanel boutique, complete with sliding ladders and a chandelier designed to look like a ball gown. \n\"You know you got it made when you have a ladder in your own closet,\" says Adzem. Douglas Elliman \nFor him—a room that houses the owner's over $100,000 collection of Air Jordan sneakers, not one of which have ever been worn, according to Adzem. \n\"He felt like he truly made it when he could have all of his 300 pairs of immaculate collectible Air Jordans on display,\" says Adzem. \"He actually is so proud that he's got a completely different closet for the shoes he wears every day.\" CNBC \nNow Adzem is hoping to find a buyer willing to write a $20 million check for the property's ultra-luxe touches — the owners' personal items, however, are not included. \n\"It's going to be a super wealthy buyer who wants to entertain their friends and family in a very grand and glamourous way,\" says Adzem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:31:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
