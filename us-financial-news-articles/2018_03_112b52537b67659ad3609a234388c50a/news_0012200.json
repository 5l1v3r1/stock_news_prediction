Discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continue to be positive and productive regarding market clearance of the T2Bacteria Panel.

Presented data at the Association for Molecular Pathology Conference highlighting the clinical value of the T2Bacteria Panel by comparing the improved specificity and sensitivity of T2Bacteria to commonly used blood culture. Concluded pre-clinical work on the proprietary T2Lyme Panel and remain on track to commence the FDA clinical trial in the first half of 2018.\nFull-Year Operational and Financial Performance Highlights:\nGrew 2017 product revenue 100% to $3.4 million and total revenue 15% to $4.7 million.

Announced a number of new partnerships including a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to use the T2Dx Instrument for detecting the superbug Candida auris and a second partnership with Cidara to use the T2Dx Instrument with the T2Candida Panel as a means of facilitating patient enrollment in Cidara’s Phase 3 clinical trial. Successfully closed an equity financing raising $20.1 million in gross proceeds that will fund commercial expansion and continued research and development of T2 Biosystems’ pipeline.\n“2017 was a productive year for T2, and we achieved a number of significant milestones that set the table for what we believe will be an exciting year for the Company,” said John McDonough, president and chief executive officer of T2 Biosystems. “We completed the T2Bacteria Panel FDA filing for market clearance in the United States, grew product revenue over 100%, expanded and reshaped our commercial infrastructure, closed two exciting new partnerships – including one with the CDC for the detection of the Candida auris superbug and closed a $20.1 million gross equity financing. Perhaps most importantly, we continued to see real world presentations, publications and stories from our customers that support the significant value our products can bring to patients and the healthcare system.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Results:\nRevenues were $1.7 million, a 55% increase over last quarter’s revenues of $1.1 million and an 87% increase over last year’s fourth quarter revenues of $910,000 and 42% over the high range of guidance.\nProduct revenues, primarily T2Candida Panel and T2Dx Instrument sales, were $1.3 million, a 76% increase over last quarter’s product revenues of $739,000 and a 125% increase over last year’s fourth quarter product revenues of $579,000.\nResearch revenues were $325,000 compared to $369,000 last quarter and $331,000 in last year’s fourth quarter.\nCosts and expenses, excluding cost of product revenue, were $9.8 million, a decrease of 14% over last quarter’s costs and expenses of $11.4 million and a 16% decrease over last year’s fourth quarter costs and expenses of $11.7 million. Costs and expenses were 14% less than the low range of guidance. The company is seeking to reduce research and development spending as it increases commercial sales activities.\nOperating margins were a loss of $14.5 million, a 17% increase over last quarter’s $12.4 million operating margin loss and a 12% increase over last year’s fourth quarter operating margin loss of $12.9 million.
