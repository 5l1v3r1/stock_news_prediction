When expectations are diminished, stocks suffer because investors think their future earnings will be lower.\"\nCME and Cboe trading volumes hit record highs of 1.35 million contracts and 10.47 million contracts, respectively, on Feb. 6 when Wall Street's fear gauge - the CBOE VIX index surged to its highest since April 2015.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average index also recorded its highest trading volumes ever on the same day and CME said on Friday that February was its biggest ever month of trading with volumes reaching 27.3 million contracts - up from 19 million in January.\nThe comparison with 2008 is striking. At that time, volumes of equities trades doubled as the collapse of Lehman Brothers blew the starting whistle on a global market meltdown.\nVolumes stayed high in October in that year, but thereafter fell back steadily and by August 2009 were lower than they had been a year earlier. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2F7jXlZ)\n\"For exchange operators, the higher volatility and trading volume in 2008 was beneficial for their current revenue stream,\" Granski said.\n\"But investors are forward looking and thought that the market would not recover and that trading volumes would decline for good, therefore, lowering the future earnings expectations of exchange operators.\"\n(Reporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T08:12:23.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
