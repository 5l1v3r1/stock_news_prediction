Republicans have been imploring the president not to go through with them.\nLate Tuesday, top White House economic advisor Gary Cohn announced his resignation after clashing with protectionist forces within the administration over the tariffs. \nIn a last ditch effort to change Trump's mind , 107 Republican members of Congress signed a letter \"urging\" him to scale back the tariffs and focus his attention on the real unfair trade culprit, China.\nThe White House has evolved its position somewhat, signally possible exemptions for Canada and Mexico . Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday told reporters that \"carve outs\" would be made on \"case by case\" and \"country by country\" bases. Trump's announcement last week had seemed to provide little daylight for exemptions.\nAsked whether the headwinds from the tariffs would change Exxon's investment plans, Woods said, \"At this point I don't see us doing that.\"\nshow chapters Exxon Mobil CEO: We plan to more than double earnings by 2025      1 Hour Ago | 04:11 At Wednesday's analyst day , Exxon laid out a goal to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments: $24 billion in capital expenditures this year, $28 billion next year and an average of $30 billion from 2023 to 2025.\nHowever, Exxon shares fell to their lowest level in more than two years on Wednesday after the company said the spending would not boost near-term production. Investors who had expected large share buybacks were disappointed that executives did not announce any.\nWoods told CNBC he expects dividend hikes in the near term to be \"somewhere between\" last year's increase of about 3 percent and historical increases of 7 percent to 8 percent.\n\nâ€” Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this report. \nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
