REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \nFacebook has for months faced an uproar among users whose complaints range from the spread of fake news to the use of the network to manipulate elections and the harvesting of 50 million people’s Facebook data by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. \nManipulated photos and videos are another growing problem on social media. \nThe fact-checking began on Wednesday in France with assistance from the news organization AFP and will soon expand to more countries and partners, Tessa Lyons, a product manager at Facebook, said in a briefing with reporters. \nLyons did not say what criteria Facebook or AFP would use to evaluate photos and videos, or how much a photo could be edited or doctored before it is ruled fake. \nThe project is part of “efforts to fight false news around elections,” she said. \nA representative for AFP could not immediately be reached for comment. \nFacebook has tried other ways to stem the spread of fake news. It has used third-party fact-checkers to identify them, and then given such stories less prominence in the Facebook News Feed when people share links to them. \nIn January, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would prioritize “trustworthy” news by using member surveys to identify high-quality outlets. \nAlex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, said in the briefing that the company was concerned not only about false facts but also other kinds of fakery. \nHe said Facebook wanted to reduce “fake audiences,” which he described as using “tricks” to artificially expand the perception of support for a particular message, as well as “false narratives,” such as headlines and language that “exploit disagreements.” Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Richard Chang", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T23:09:40.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
