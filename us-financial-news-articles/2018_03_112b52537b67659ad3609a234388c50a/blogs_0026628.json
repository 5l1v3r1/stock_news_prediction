Rand Paul to Oppose Trump’s Nominations for State and CIA \nMarch 14, 2018 11:46 a.m. ET \nSen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said Wednesday he would oppose the nominations of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state and Gina Haspel to lead the Central Intelligence Agency . \nThe announcement by Mr. Paul, the first Republican to oppose either nominee, makes it likely that Democratic support will be needed for both Mr. Pompeo and Ms. Haspel to be confirmed in the Senate. \nPresident \nDonald Trump \non Tuesday fired Rex Tillerson , the current secretary of state, and said he planned to replace Mr. Tillerson with Mr. Pompeo, who is currently the CIA director. Ms. Haspel, currently the agency’s deputy director, would be the first woman to lead the CIA, if she is confirmed. \nMr. Paul told reporters Wednesday that he worried Mr. Pompeo hadn’t drawn the same lessons from the Iraq war as he had: that “regime change has unintended consequences” that could be repeated in Iran. Mr. Pompeo has been one of the most vocal critics of the 2015 nuclear agreement that former President \nBarack Obama \nand five other nations struck with Iran. \nMs. Haspel has drawn scrutiny from both parties for her role on a team that oversaw the CIA’s detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists, using techniques that many experts and lawmakers since have described as torture, current and former officials have said. \nMr. Paul said that while he still supported the president, he couldn’t endorse “the head cheerleader for waterboarding,” saying that would send a terrible message about what could be done to U.S. soldiers captured by adversaries. \nWhen asked whether Ms. Haspel was simply following orders, Mr. Paul said that would not justify such actions. \n“There is a point at which if someone asks you to torture someone, you should say no,” he said. \nFormer officials who worked with Ms. Haspel have defended her role in the program, saying it was deemed legal and appropriate at the time by senior administration officials. \nNominees need a majority vote to clear the Senate, where the GOP has a 51-49 advantage. Vice President \nMike Pence \nwould break any ties. With the margin so close, Ms. Haspel’s nomination could be derailed by just a single GOP defector if \nSen. John McCain \n(R., Ariz.), who is fighting brain cancer at home, remains in Arizona and all Democrats oppose her. \n“It depends on the solidarity of Democrats,” Mr. Paul said. \nIt isn’t yet clear how much Democratic opposition Ms. Haspel will face. \nMr. Pompeo is likely to have more bipartisan support. He was confirmed to his current post in January 2017 in a 66-32 vote three days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Mr. Paul voted against confirmation. \nWrite to Kristina Peterson at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T22:42:52.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
