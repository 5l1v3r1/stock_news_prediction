The acquisition transforms the North American sheet industry by combining the leader in acrylic manufacturing and the leader in polycarbonate manufacturing.\nAs a part of the transaction, Plaskolite is acquiring sheet headquarters, production sites and warehouse facilities in Sheffield, Massachusetts and will maintain the existing third-party distribution warehouse facility in Hebron, Ohio. With this acquisition, Plaskolite will employ 950 people.\nThe closing is expected to be completed August 1, 2018.\nFounded in 1950 in Columbus, Ohio, by Donald G.
