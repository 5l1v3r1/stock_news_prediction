A Chevron representative was not immediately available to comment.\nMoyo, who tweets under the handle @dambisamoyo, is also a board member of Barclays Plc and Barrick Gold Corp .\nJohn Watson, who retired as Chevron’s chairman and chief executive earlier this month, told Reuters last fall that he did not see demand for oil peaking in the foreseeable future.\nThe view is widely shared in the oil industry and leaders of the world’s biggest oil companies are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat from climate change policies or renewable technologies.\nThe International Energy Agency said earlier this month it expects global oil demand to rise 1.4 million barrels per day this year.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:40:18.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
