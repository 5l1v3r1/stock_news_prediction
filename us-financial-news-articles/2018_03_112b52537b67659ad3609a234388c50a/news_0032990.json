It is likely the first pedestrian fatality caused by an autonomous vehicle.\n\"Our hearts go out to the victim's family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident,\" Uber said in a statement. The ride-hailing company is temporarily halting self-driving car tests in all locations after the accident.\nOn Tuesday, Toyota followed Uber's decision to pause all autonomous testing on public roads .\nOver the last several years, several major tech firms as well as legacy automakers and suppliers have begun investing in autonomous driving technology, including Waymo , GM , Ford , Tesla , Aptiv , Uber and Lyft. An entire web of smaller start-ups and companies has grown around them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T00:09:29.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
