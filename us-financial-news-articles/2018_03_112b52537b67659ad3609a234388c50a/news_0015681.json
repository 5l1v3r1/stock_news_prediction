It joins advisory firm Glass Lewis in recommending against the proposal.\nTesla shareholders are due to vote on March 21, and the company needs majority approval for the proposal to go through. The company declined to comment.\nThe award \"locks in unprecedented high pay opportunities for the next decade, and seemingly limits the board's ability to meaningfully adjust future pay levels in the event of unforeseen events or changes in either performance or strategic focus,\" ISS said on Thursday.\nThe advisory firm also flagged that a big part of the award could be earned even if Tesla, which reported its worst ever loss in the fourth quarter, does not sustainably make profits in the future.\n\"Musk's financial interests are already strongly aligned with Tesla; it is questionable whether an additional $2.6 billion grant is necessary or appropriate to further align his interests when he already owns a 22 percent stake in the company,\" ISS added.\nSome analysts have questioned whether billionaire Musk's other interests, from space exploration to tunnel boring technology, are a distraction at what is seen as a critical time for Tesla.\nMusk took to Twitter on Thursday to call on U.S. President Donald Trump to challenge Chinese auto trade rules.\nTesla shares were down half a percent at $327.25 after markets closed on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Arjun Panchadar and Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson, Shounak Dasgupta and Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T09:50:22.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
