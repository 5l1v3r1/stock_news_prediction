Catalan police had established the identity of the man who was originally from Mali, a police spokeswoman said. Neither the embassy of Mali in Madrid nor its consulate in Barcelona was immediately available to comment. Spain’s leading newspaper El Pais said the woman being held was the wife of the honorary consul of Mali. The spokeswoman said the police had surrounded the building and cordoned off an area in central Barcelona. She could not provide further details on the incident. Special forces of the national police had also been deployed to the area, the regional police said in a tweet.
