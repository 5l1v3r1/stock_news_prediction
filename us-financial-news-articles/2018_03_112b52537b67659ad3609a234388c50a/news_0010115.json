A reconciliation of all non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the accompanying financial tables. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Review\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.5 million, down 27.8% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in Company-owned net restaurant sales revenue was primarily driven by the closure of thirteen restaurants in fiscal 2017. This decrease was partially offset by an 8.0% increase in same-store sales. The declines in franchise royalty and fee revenue were driven by the net closure of five franchise restaurants, which included the refranchising of eight Company-owned restaurants in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nRestaurant-level operating margin for Company-owned restaurants was 1.3%, an increase from (3.8%) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily driven by lower occupancy costs, advertising spend, and improved actual versus theoretical food cost, partially offset by increased fixed labor and other operating costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $2.8 million from $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year over year decline was primarily a result of the continued optimization of our general and administrative expense structure, partially offset by severance expense recognized for executive departures as well as incentive compensation expense recognized in accordance with current executive employment agreements.\nWe recognized net loss from continuing operations of approximately $1.5 million, or ($0.21) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $982,000, or ($0.14) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Although our pretax income was positive, the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in late 2017 caused us to revalue our net deferred tax assets and resulted in a significant tax charge. We recognized a net loss from discontinued operations of $2.3 million, or ($0.32) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income of approximately $40,000, or $0.01 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted net loss from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was approximately $103,000, or ($0.01) per share, compared to a loss of approximately $500,000, or ($0.07) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. A reconciliation between adjusted net loss and its most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the accompanying financial tables.\nFiscal 2017 Review\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year 2017 was $64.6 million, down 15.7% from fiscal 2016. The decrease in Company-owned net restaurant sales revenue was primarily driven by the closure of thirteen restaurants in fiscal 2017, partially offset by a 2.4% increase in same-store sales. The declines in franchise royalty and fee revenue was primarily a result of the net closure of five franchise restaurants, which included the refranchising of eight Company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2017, a 2.3% decrease in same-store sales and less franchise fees recognized on the restaurants that opened in 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.\nRestaurant-level operating margin was 3.6%, an increase from 1.6% during fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily a result of improved actual versus theoretical food cost and reduced operating expenses, partially offset by increased fixed labor.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased to $14.6 million, from $16.6 million in fiscal 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the continued optimization of our general and administrative expense structure, reduced costs incurred for the corporate office, third party consulting services and professional fees. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses increased due to sales deleverage.\nWe recognized net loss from continuing operations of approximately $6.7 million, or ($0.95) per share, in fiscal 2017 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.1 million, or ($0.59) per share, in fiscal 2016. We recognized a net loss from discontinued operations of $1.5 million, or ($0.21) per share, in fiscal 2017, compared to income of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.24 per share, in fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted net income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was approximately $410,000, or $0.06 per share, compared to a loss of approximately $633,000, or ($0.09) per share, in fiscal 2016. A reconciliation between adjusted net income (loss) and its most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the accompanying financial tables.\nExecutive Comments\nJeff Crivello, CEO, commented, “I am extremely proud of the work that the team achieved in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2017, particularly the refranchising of our Mid-Atlantic market to our largest franchisee, the implementation of third party delivery at company-owned restaurants, and the finalization of the restructure of the company’s general and administrative expenses. We continue to work on the revitalization of the totality of the guest experience in our core restaurants and remain engaged on the development of the new concept for the future. We look forward to building on these achievements into fiscal 2018. Finally, the board and I express sincere thanks and appreciation to Dexter Newman, our Chief Financial Officer who is departing today, for his leadership and stewardship of the restructuring of our organization over the past two years.”\nAbout Famous Dave’s\nFamous Dave’s develops, owns, operates and franchises barbeque restaurants.

These non-GAAP measures exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations. By providing non-GAAP measures, together with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, the Company believes that it is enhancing investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and results of operations. These measures are not intended to be considered in isolation of, as substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures presented may be different from the measures used by other companies. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, included in the accompanying financial tables.\nAdjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations is net (loss) income from continuing operations, plus asset impairment, estimated lease termination and other closing costs, settlement agreements, net (loss) gain on disposal of equipment, stock-based compensation, severance, and the related tax impact. This number is divided by the weighted-average number of basic shares of common stock outstanding during each period presented to arrive at adjusted net (loss) income from continuing operations, per share. Adjusted EBITDA is net (loss) income, including discontinued operations, plus asset impairment, estimated lease termination and other closing costs, settlement agreements, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, net (loss) gain on disposal of equipment, stock-based compensation, severance and provision (benefit) for income taxes.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not strictly historical, including but not limited to statements regarding the timing of the Company’s restaurant openings and the timing or success of refranchising plans, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from expected results. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectation will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Famous Dave’s expectation include financial performance, restaurant industry conditions, execution of restaurant development and construction programs, franchisee performance, changes in local or national economic conditions, availability of financing, governmental approvals and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s SEC reports.\nContact: Jeff Crivello – Chief Executive Officer 952-294-1300\nFAMOUS DAVE’S OF AMERICA, INC.
