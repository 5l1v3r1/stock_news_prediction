Where the liability cannot be reasonably estimated, the fact is usually noted but no provision is made.\nRydon said in its accounts that “given the limited nature of the work commissioned, the approvals received in relation to it and the interrelationship with work undertaken by other parties, no provision has been made in the accounts for any matters arising from these tragic events”.\nLawyers told Reuters in December that social landlords which have been forced to remove dangerous cladding from housing blocks could sue the companies responsible if they could prove the work did not comply with regulations.\nHowever, only one of dozens contacted by Reuters said they were considering doing so.
