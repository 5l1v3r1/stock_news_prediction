Andrew Cuomo said he was “very dissatisfied” with how utility companies managed a storm earlier this month and called the delays in getting power back on “inexcusable.” He warned utility companies to respond rapidly this time and suggested he would support revoking their authority to deliver power if they don’t.\n“Utility companies were not granted a license by God,” he added. “It’s not in the Old Testament that these utility companies have to have their licenses. If they’re not performing for New Yorkers, they can lose their licenses, and we’re fully prepared to do that.”\nEarlier this month, thousands of homes remained without power in New York and New Jersey for days after a powerful nor’easter hit the region.\nThe governor also cautioned New Yorkers to avoid travel, saying the weather will get worse throughout the day and that the predicted wind gusts could cause accidents.\nAs of Wednesday morning, about 3,500 flights had been canceled nationally. Most of them were at New York’s three hubs, John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International airports, where about 70% of flights were canceled.\nAmtrak operated a reduced schedule on many lines, including its busy Northeast Corridor line between Washington, D.C., and Boston.\nIn New York City, the subway and buses ran with minor delays and disruptions Wednesday morning. The Long Island Rail Road operated a regular weekday schedule, but officials asked riders to leave the city as early as possible this afternoon because worsening weather could cause services to be suspended.\nMore in the Region\nAs Nuclear Plant Closes, Fears Shift From Contamination to Financial Pain March 21, 2018 New York Region Prepares for ‘Four’Easter’ March 20, 2018 A New Role For Hospitals: Boosting the Local Economy March 20, 2018 Metro-North Railroad operated a reduced schedule and warned that it could be forced to cancel trains later in the day.\nIn New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency and ordered state offices to close. NJ Transit operated a reduced rail schedule Wednesday morning and warned that bus service into the Port Authority Bus Terminal, in Manhattan could be suspended in the afternoon.\nMany schools across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were closed Wednesday. Shutting New York City schools Wednesday meant the district’s administration of free SAT tests in high schools was postponed a month.
