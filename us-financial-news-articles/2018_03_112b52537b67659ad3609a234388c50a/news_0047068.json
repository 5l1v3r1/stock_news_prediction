This is about the integrity of the democratic process.\"\n\"If this country is on the path of an irreversible decision, we really should be confident that the basis of that decision came from a free and fair vote - and what this evidence does is it calls into question whether it was free and fair.\"\nReuters was unable to verify the allegations made against Vote Leave. Matthew Elliott, its former CEO, said the allegations were wrong.\n\"Vote Leave did not break the law,\" Elliott told Reuters. \"Voters can be confident this was a free and fair referendum.\"\nElliott said the Electoral Commission had twice looked into Vote Leave's relationship with BeLeave and had given it a clean bill of health both times. He said he was confident that the third investigation would produce the same result.\n\"The basis of all this is an attempt by people on the 'Remain' campaign to call into doubt the result of the EU referendum,\" Elliott said.
