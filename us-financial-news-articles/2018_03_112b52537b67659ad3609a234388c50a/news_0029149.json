(\"OCLR\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: OCLR) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Lumentum Holdings Inc. (\"LITE\") (NASDAQ: LITE). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will be entitled to receive $5.60 in cash and 0.636 of a share of LITE for each share of OCLR they own, representing consideration of $9.99 per OCLR share.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether OCLR's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, OCLR shares traded for $10.93, or nearly $1.00 above the per-share consideration, as recently as June of 2017. Additionally, according to the acquisition agreement, there are several strategic and financial benefits for LITE in this deal, including:\nA strong and balanced portfolio with a broad revenue mix; Faster innovations and accelerated product development which will allow LITE to better address customers' needs; and Improved market positioning.\nMoreover, LITE anticipates the transaction to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share, and $60 million in annual run-rate synergies within the first 12 to 24 months of closing. Finally, upon closing, OCLR shareholders will own a meagre 16% of the combined company.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether OCLR's shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects.
