They say the rules will cost the industry billions of dollars and raise vehicle prices.\nBut environmentalists say the right technology is available to increase a car's gas mileage and building it into the car saves money at the pump.\nAny change is likely to set up a lengthy legal showdown with California, which currently has the power to set its own pollution and gas mileage standards and doesn't want them to change.\nEPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said in an email Friday that the standards are still being reviewed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T08:52:50.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
