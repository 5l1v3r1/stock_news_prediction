The distribution primarily represents oil production during the month of December 2017 and natural gas production during November 2017.\nThe following table displays underlying oil and natural gas sales volumes and average received wellhead prices attributable to the current and prior month net profits interest calculations.\nUnderlying Sales Volumes Average Price Oil Natural Gas Oil Natural Gas Bbls Bbls/D Mcf Mcf/D (per Bbl) (per Mcf) Current Month 58,843 1,898 480,736 16,025 $ 55.79 $ 2.73 Prior Month 62,006 2,067 410,091 13,229 $ 53.29 $ 2.87 Oil cash receipts for the properties underlying the Trust remained consistent with the prior month at $3.3 million. An increase in oil cash receipts as a result of a $2.50 per Bbl increase in the realized wellhead price was offset by reduced sales volumes during the period. Sales volumes declined due to payment timing differences, while the realized wellhead price increased as a result of a 2.3% increase in the NYMEX price to $58.10.\nNatural gas cash receipts increased from $1.2 million in the prior distribution period to $1.3 million in the current month due to an increase in natural gas volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the realized natural gas price. Natural gas volumes increased primarily due to production volumes from four gross (0.4 net) wells in the Haynesville, which began production in September 2017. Enduro did not receive revenues for one of these wells until the current month and, as a result, prior month distribution calculations did not include the associated natural gas receipts or sales volumes with respect to this well. As a result, the current period includes all sales volumes from this well from the time it came online in September 2017 through November 2017. Sales volumes related to these 4 gross wells included in the current month distribution calculation were 6,065 Mcf/D. Excluding the additional months of production from the well described above, sales volumes associated with these 4 gross wells for November 2017 would have been 4,735 Mcf/D.\nTotal direct operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, and gathering and transportation expenses, were $2.8 million, an increase of $0.1 million from the prior month. Capital expenditures for the current month distribution calculation were $33,000, or $0.1 million less than the prior month. Total direct operating expenses and capital expenditures relate to expenses incurred in January 2018.\nAbout Enduro Royalty Trust\nEnduro Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed by Enduro Resource Partners to own a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain of Enduro Resource Partners’ properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the amount of the periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis.
