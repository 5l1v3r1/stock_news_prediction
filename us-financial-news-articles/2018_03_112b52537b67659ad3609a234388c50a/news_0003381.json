It said on Friday that all banks participating in the refinancing had accepted terms, including a 30 percent cut in the loan’s cost compared to 2016.\nThe cost of insuring Saudi sovereign debt against default has roughly halved since 2016, a sign of growing confidence in the kingdom’s finances after oil prices partially rebounded and the government took steps to boost its revenues.\nIn its January statement, the DMO said it had also issued requests for proposals to banks to arrange further dollar debt issuance and financing supported by other countries’ export credit agencies.\nBanking sources told Reuters last month that a new dollar-denominated bond deal could be marketed over the next few weeks.
