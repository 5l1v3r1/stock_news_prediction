The dollar had risen to 106.470 on Tuesday amid speculation that Trump could be coaxed away from imposing tariffs.\nAgainst the Swiss franc, the dollar also shed 0.3 percent to 0.9375 franc, while the euro edged up 0.05 percent to $1.2412.\n“The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,” said analysts at ANZ.\nThe Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso tumbled as Cohn’s departure was seen as raising risks Washington could walk out of NAFTA.\nThe Canadian dollar fell 0.5 percent to C$1.2936 per dollar while the Mexican peso dropped 0.5 percent to 18.83 to the dollar.\nCrude oil prices fell as investor risk appetite in the broader markets cooled, with Brent futures surrendering the previous day’s gains to drop 0.85 percent to $65.24 per barrel.\nSpot gold stretched the previous day’s rally and touched $1,340.42 an ounce, highest since Feb. 26.\nOther safe havens like government bonds also fared well. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose and as a result the 10-year benchmark note yield declined 2 basis points to 2.858 percent.\nReporting by Hideyuki Sano and Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo; additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and the New York markets team; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:24:18.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
