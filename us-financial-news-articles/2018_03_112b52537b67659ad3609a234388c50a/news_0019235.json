(Nasdaq:CHRS), today reviewed corporate events and reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results:\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $31.5 million compared to $59.0 million for the same period in 2016. R&D expenses for the fiscal year 2017 were $162.4 million, as compared to $254.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in R&D expenses in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2016 was mainly due to the reduction in manufacturing, analytical and clinical costs associated with the CHS-0214 (etanercept (Enbrel®) biosimilar candidate) and CHS-1420 (adalimumab (Humira®) biosimilar candidate) programs. The decrease in R&D expenses in the fiscal year ended 2017 over the same period in 2016 was mainly attributable to a decrease in clinical development costs associated with the CHS-0214 and CHS-1420 programs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $15.0 million, compared to $15.3 million for the same period in 2016. G&A expenses for the fiscal year 2017 were $71.3 million, as compared to $51.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses in 2017 were mainly attributable to salary and stock compensation costs associated with the hiring of personnel in the first half of 2017 to support the CHS-1701 (pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) biosimilar candidate) pre-commercial activities and costs related to legal and other professional services. Net loss attributable to Coherus for the fourth quarter of 2017 was ($49.1) million, or ($0.84) per share, compared to a net loss of ($75.9) million, or ($1.71) per share, for the same period in 2016. Net loss attributable to Coherus for 2017 was ($238.2) million, or ($4.48) per share, compared to a net loss of ($127.3) million, or ($3.04) per share, for 2016.
