REUTERS/Bobby Yip The South Koreans, numbering about 160, will visit North Korea until April 3, the South’s Ministry of Unification said in a statement, for the first such performances in more than a decade. The group will include K-pop girl group Red Velvet and music industry veterans Cho Yong-pil and Lee Sun-hee, the ministry said, after talks on the performances between the neighbours’ delegations at the truce border village of Panmunjom. Cho was the last South Korean singer to perform in the North, at a concert in Pyongyang in 2005. “While we’re on the stage, I believe it will be difficult to portray personal feelings towards denuclearisation,” said singer and record producer Yoon Sang, who led the South’s delegation at Tuesday’s talks. “Our first task will be to instill the same awe in North Korean audiences as we do our South Korean ones and make sure nothing is awkward,” he told a media briefing. South Korea's pop singer Cho Yong-pil speaks at a news conference in Seoul, August 3, 2005. Cho said on Wednesday he would hold a solo concert in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang on August 23, 2005, which will be broadcasted live from Pyongyang to Seoul by the South Korean television network SBS. REUTERS/You Sung-Ho LJW/JK Further negotiations, such as deciding the songs to be performed, would be done in written form, he added. The visitors will hold two shows in Pyongyang, one at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, which was the backdrop to a landmark performance by the New York Philharmonic in 2008. The other show will be held at the Ryukyung Chung Ju Yung Gymnasium, which was a joint project between North and South, named after Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung. Officials will visit the North from March 22 to 24 to inspect the sites and ensure they can accommodate the singers, the ministry added. The deal is the latest step in the detente that began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said at the beginning of the year that he intended to improve ties. North Korea has since agreed to hold summits with the South and the United States, apart from participating last month in the Olympics in South Korea.
