If a private key is hacked the account cryptocurrencies are stolen.\nWith increasing incidence of private keys, exchanges and ICOs being hacked and the continued growth in the cryptocurrency market sector, private key security, privacy, and trust are critical.\nWhile the CryptoSecure ‘SafeWindow’ product is claimed to be hackproof, it is acknowledged that technically nothing is hackproof, however ‘SafeWindow’ is as hackproof as it gets, as its invisible to cyber criminals if used as directed and responsibly.\nThe CryptoSecure SaaS product ‘SafeWindow’ cryptocurrency security solution is exclusively licensed, through BankVault (GoPC Pty Ltd), for specific application in the cryptocurrency and blockchain market sectors. (See: www.bankvaultonline.com ). Through further license agreement with Key Capital Corporation ( OTC Pink: KCPC ), Trusted Systems Computing and One Time Pad (OTP) applications will be additionally developed and integrated as CryptoSecure security products. Completion of this development, will provide for a hybrid Trusted blockchain CryptoSecure transactional platform, as well as providing additional security and authority layers to the CryptoSecure ‘SafeWindow’ product. (See: www.keycapitalgroup.com )\nUsing CryptoSecure ‘SafeWindow’ makes you, your IP and geolocation invisible to everyone including hackers. Your cryptocurrency security, as well as your privacy, is assured.\n‘SafeWindow’ creates a virtual computer on the user computer screen, and also on the user’s tablet or smart device. These virtual existences are only there for the duration of the cryptocurrency activity or transaction. They cannot be seen by any hacker, authority, or spyware as the interaction is conducted in invisible virtuality. As soon as the activity or transaction is finished, the user closes the virtual windows, and everything vanishes leaving no residual trace of anything on any of the devices used. See how it works at Youtube-CryptoSecure .\n“Very simply, if you cannot see it, then you cannot hack it, monitor, or record it”.\nAs the CryptoSecure platform products commercialize, market and user confidence in the security and integrity of cryptocurrencies will grow, as will trust and peace of mind.\nAbout KICKICO\nKICKICO is an online blockchain technology-based platform for fundraising in cryptocurrencies. It collected more than 84,000 ETH during its ICO, and was named \"ICO of the Year\" by BTC CIS AWARDS. Today, KICKICO has a community of 55,000 people, and the KICK Coin is traded on eight exchanges.
