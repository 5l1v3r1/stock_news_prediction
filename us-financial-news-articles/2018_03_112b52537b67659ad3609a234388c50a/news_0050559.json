Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS In his first trip outside of Lima since taking office on Friday, Vizcarra said that in the past year, the government has only spent 10 percent of the 25 billion soles ($7.8 billion) needed for the overall reconstruction effort.\n“If we continue like this, we’re going to finish rebuilding in 10 years,” Vizcarra told residents of a small town in the coastal desert region of Piura, where flooding destroyed scores of homes. “We can’t wait that long.”\nHundreds of people continue to live in tents in Piura and other regions along Peru’s northern coast since a surprise warming of Pacific waters unleashed deadly downpours in early 2017.\nVizcarra has sought to distance himself from the unpopular government of former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former banker who resigned last week in the face of near-certain impeachment on graft allegations.\nPeruvian President Martin Vizcarra visits flood victims in the northern city of Piura, Peru March 27, 2018.
