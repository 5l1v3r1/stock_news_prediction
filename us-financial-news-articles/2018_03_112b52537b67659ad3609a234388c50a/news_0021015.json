Energize the board by steering it away from the traditional definition of TSR (total shareholder return) to a new one: talent, strategy, risk. Design and redesign work by incorporating cross-functional teams that come together, disband, and reform as it suits the nature of their work. Reinvent HR as a result of the CEO and CHRO working together to make tough decisions about what administrative tasks in HR can be automated, outsourced, or offshored. Scale up individual talent by freeing them from bureaucratic structures designed for a different era and offering opportunities to continually expand their skills. Create an M&A strategy that can find, attract, and successfully integrate talented people from the outside in response to trends. Drive the talent playbook by learning the changes CEOs and CHROs will need to make.\nWith this playbook, the authors aim to help executives deploy human capital as effectively as they deploy financial capital.\nThe book includes examples of companies that are well along the path of reinventing their approaches to talent, such as ADP , Amgen , Aon , Apple , BlackRock , Blackstone , Google , Haier , Johnson & Johnson , Marsh , PepsiCo , Telenor , as well as the start-ups of Silicon Valley. To get inside their experiences of linking talent to value creation, the authors interviewed hundreds of executives—CEOs, CHROs, chief transformation officers, and CFOs.\nAccording to Carey, who works daily with members of the nation’s most influential boards, the focus on talent needs to start at the top of the organization.\n“Today, board discussions on talent are largely limited to CEO succession – and even then, recent research by the National Association of Corporate Directors and Korn Ferry suggest that only one in nine companies have a formal CEO succession plan that its leaders are satisfied with,” said Carey. “To gain the board’s help in driving the talent strategy, CEOs need to put the talent issue more squarely on the board agenda.”\nAbout Korn Ferry\nKorn Ferry is a global organizational consulting firm.
