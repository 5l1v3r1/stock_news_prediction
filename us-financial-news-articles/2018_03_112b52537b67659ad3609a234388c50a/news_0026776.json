The Nasdaq Composite fell for a third straight day.\nThe elimination of a key tax benefit for some pipeline companies sent shares of energy companies reeling and sapped indexes of their upward momentum. Stocks fell further on reports that special counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization to turn over documents.\nA trader working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Despite trade fears, money managers say the rosy economic outlook for the U.S. and abroad has largely kept stocks from tumbling further.

Baird & Co. “It had been weak all day, and this unsettled it further.”\nThe Dow industrials rose 115.54 points, or 0.5%, to 24873.66. The S&P 500 declined 2.15 points, or less than 0.1%, to 2747.33, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 15.07 points, or 0.2%, to 7481.74.\nEnergy companies, which had been trading higher earlier in the day, fell after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission eliminated certain master limited partnerships’ income-tax allowance on cost of service rates. Williams shed $1.45, or 5.2%, to $26.69, while EQT fell 2.72, or 5.2%, to 49.73.\nThe NYSE Alerian MLP Index, a widely tracked barometer for the sector, fell 4.6%, its biggest drop this year.\nMaterials companies were also among the S&P 500’s biggest decliners, extending the sector’s losses for the week to 3.3%. Chemical companies, a sector that would face higher costs by constructing new facilities under the tariffs, were hit particularly hard, with Monsanto declining 5.95, or 4.8%, to 117.20 and Mosaic falling 71 cents, or 2.6%, to 26.39.\nDeclines among packaging and metals companies also dragged the sector down.\nIndustrial companies were one of the S&P 500’s few gainers, supported by fresh data showing solid growth in manufacturing activity in New York state. Caterpillar, a Dow component, added 2.03, or 1.3%, to 154.57.\nThe bull market is struggling to regain some of its momentum at a time when many investors are already worried that more trade tariffs, along with aggressive responses from key U.S. allies such as the European Union, could crimp growth around the world and put a damper on earnings among U.S. conglomerates, manufacturers and other businesses—which had been crucial components to the rally’s upswing last year.\nPresident Donald Trump is now considering a package of anti-China measures , including tariffs on some imports, to pressure Beijing to end requirements that U.S. companies transfer technology to Chinese firms.\n“Protectionist policies, at the end of the day, are bad for the market,” said Tom Manning, chief executive of F.L. Putnam Investment Management Co., a $1.7 billion advisory firm. “They can be inflationary and there’s not a lot of good that can come from those types of policies.”\nThe S&P 500 continues to trade about halfway between its January record and its early February lows more than a month after fears about inflation rising faster than expected caused a sharp selloff.\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.5% to break a two-day losing run. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed up 0.1%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was 0.3% higher. South Korea’s Kospi also rose 0.3%.\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com and Mike Bird at Mike.Bird@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T07:49:06.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
