(NYSE:HLX) announced today it has priced an offering of $125 million principal amount of 4.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). Helix intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase all of its currently outstanding $60.115 million principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the “2032 Notes”) in its previously announced offer to repurchase the 2032 Notes and to repay borrowings under its outstanding term loan. To the extent that any of the 2032 Notes are not purchased in its repurchase offer, Helix may use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase or redeem the remaining 2032 Notes. Helix expects to close the offering of the 2023 Notes on or about March 20, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering.\nThe 2023 Notes are to be issued via an underwritten public offering, resulting in expected net proceeds of approximately $121.2 million, after deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering expenses. Interest on the 2023 Notes will be paid semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year beginning on September 15, 2018. During certain periods and subject to certain conditions, the 2023 Notes will be convertible by holders based on an initial conversion rate of 105.6133 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2023 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $9.47 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at Helix’s discretion, cash, shares of Helix’s common stock or a combination thereof.\nIn addition, the holders of the 2023 Notes may require Helix to repurchase the 2023 Notes under certain circumstances, and Helix may redeem all or any portion of the 2023 Notes, at its option, on or after March 15, 2021, subject to certain conditions, at a redemption price payable in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make-whole premium” with a value equal to the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of interest on the notes to be redeemed through September 15, 2023.\nThe 2023 Notes are being offered pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
