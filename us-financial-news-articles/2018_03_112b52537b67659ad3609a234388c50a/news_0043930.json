CVP’s hospitals have the benefit of accessing a variety of business tools, such as marketing, leadership development, HR support and finance, while keeping local control of clinical practices.\n“What makes us different is that we provide support to our vet partners, but at the same time we allow them to maintain their brand and vision,” Ruffe said. “This means the customers at each of our partner hospitals see even greater levels of service since our partner vets have more time to focus on pet care and worry less about the challenges of running the day-to-day business…”\nPrior to joining CVP, Ruffe was the Chief Growth Officer at MedExpress, where he was instrumental in building MedExpress into a national leader of urgent care services with nearly 250 locations caring for almost 4 million patients per year. Ruffe earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Rutgers University and a master’s degree in business management from Rider University. He will be relocating to Philadelphia from Pittsburgh.\nCVP is controlled by an affiliate of Cortec Group, a private equity firm based in New York, that invests in middle market health care, specialty service, consumer and distribution businesses.\nAbout Community Veterinary Partners\nCommunity Veterinary Partners owns and operates veterinary hospitals and is committed to providing world-class treatment and health services to animals.
