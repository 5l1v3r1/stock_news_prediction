Cash and equivalents were $21.4 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $21.0 million at December 31, 2016.\n\"The past year has been transformational for Juniper as we made significant progress toward the achievement of each of our corporate goals. Notably, we took the necessary steps to streamline our organization to focus on accelerating growth across our core businesses, JPS and CRINONE ® , and we successfully secured an extension of the CRINONE ® supply agreement with Merck, KGaA,\" said Alicia Secor, Chief Executive Officer.\nMs. Secor added, \"Our continued investment in JPS and solid performance in the CRINONE ® business resulted in significant annual revenue growth and allowed us to exceed our financial guidance for 2017. We ended the year cash flow positive, and we anticipate this trend will continue and expect to end 2018 cash flow positive as well. As our process to explore strategic alternatives continues, we are committed to building shareholder value while maintaining the momentum in these businesses.\"\nFourth Quarter and Recent Corporate Highlights\nEngaged Rothschild as independent financial advisor to assist in the exploration of strategic alternatives as part of an ongoing effort to enhance shareholder value. This process remains ongoing. Announced a 4.5-year extension through 2024 of the CRINONE ® supply agreement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Focusing on expansion of its JPS pharmaceutical development and manufacturing services to new and existing customers seeking solutions for difficult-to-formulate products. Announced positive top-line pharmacokinetic data from in vivo studies evaluating each of the Company's three IVR formulations which support advancement of the IVR technology platform. Exploring partnering opportunities for each of the IVR pipeline candidates.\nFull Year Financial Results\n\"We exceeded our top-line growth guidance for 2017, reporting a 24% increase in revenues from our core business year-over-year, outpacing the growth levels we observed in 2016,\" said Jeff Young, Chief Financial Officer at Juniper. \"We are well-positioned to continue to deliver double-digit growth in these core businesses in 2018.\"\nProduct revenues from Merck KGaA increased 20.1% to $32.7 million in 2017, compared with $27.2 million in the prior year. The $5.5 million increase primarily reflects continued expansion of existing key markets as well as new markets.\nService revenues from Juniper Pharma Services were $17.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.2 million, or 32.3%, as compared with $13.1 million in the prior year. The service revenue increase primarily reflects the continued uptake of our specialized service offering for challenging-to-develop molecules as well as follow-on later stage contracts from existing clients.\nTotal revenues decreased 8.4% year-over-year to $50.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.6 million in the previous year. Excluding royalties, which were monetized in the fourth quarter of 2016, combined product and service revenue increased 24% year-over-year.\nGross profit decreased to $21.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $30.3 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of the reduction of royalty revenue for the year ended 2017. Excluding royalties from the prior period, gross profit would have increased by $5.0 million, or 31%, to $21.0 million from $16.0 million in 2016.\nTotal operating expenses were down slightly to $24.9 million, as compared $25 million in the previous year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower R&D spend of $2.8 million predominantly due to the COL-1077 Phase 2b clinical trial, which was completed in August 2016, partially offset by $1.3 million increase in G&A spend as a result of costs incurred in the first half of 2017 related to the restatement of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2013 through 2015, $0.8 million restructuring charge related to the Company's September 2017 reprioritization recorded in the third quarter of 2017 and a $0.6 million increase in sales and marketing that resulted from the continued growth of Juniper Pharma Services.\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared with net income of $6.0 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $21.4 million as of December 31, 2017, versus $21.0 million at December 31, 2016. The Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents, as well as cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, Juniper's management team will hold a conference call to discuss financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, as follows:\nDate:\nMarch 8, 2018\nTime:\n8:30 a.m. ET\nDial-in numbers:\nToll free: (866) 374-4635 (U.S.), (855) 669-9657 (Canada),\nor International: (412) 902-4218\nWebcast (live and archive): www.juniperpharma.com , under \"Investors\" or click here .\nThe teleconference replay will be available approximately one hour after completion through Thursday, March 15, 2018, at (877) 344-7529 (U.S.), (855) 669-9658 (Canada) or (412) 317-0088 (International).
