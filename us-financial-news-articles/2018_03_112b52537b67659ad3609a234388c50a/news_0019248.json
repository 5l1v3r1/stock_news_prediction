Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018 We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2018 \nBut according to the Trade Partnership, although these industries might see a boost, the costs for industries that use these metals for their products would increase. Therefore, while the number of American workers in the metals industry could increase by an estimated 33,464 jobs, the decrease in other industries would be more significant: an estimated 179,334 jobs. This means that the net loss could total 146,000 jobs. \nRead: The U.S. Oil and Gas Industry Is Howling About Donald Trump’s Steel Import Tariffs \nThe researchers found that in addition to lost manufacturing jobs, the tariffs would have repercussions for related industries that support manufacturers. The increased cost of steel and aluminum would also increase the cost of the goods in which they’re used. This in turn may negatively affect spending, thereby causing an additional fallout for industries sensitive to consumers’ purchasing habits.
