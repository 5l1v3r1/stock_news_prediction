Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion vs Leicester City - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - March 10, 2018 West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Pardew REUTERS/Hannah McKay West Brom are in desperate need of a win ahead of Saturday’s league trip to Bournemouth as the Baggies lie eight points adrift of safety with as many matches left to play. “I’m frustrated. I’m angry. We have to keep fighting until the last moment. When we play Bournemouth we will have to run further than we have all season... ,” Pardew told reporters. “It’s about players performing. The senior players need to deliver otherwise we won’t be in with a shout of staying up. “If we’re not in with a shout of staying up then I need to start looking at the future... This weekend and the next couple of weekends, senior players need to deliver. We need a win, whichever way it comes.” West Brom have won just one league match since Pardew took charge in November, leading to increased media speculation about the Englishman’s future at the Hawthorns. Pardew said that he had held talks with the club’s board to clear the air and decide on the team’s course of action going forward. The former Newcastle United boss also said that midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak had been fined after the Polish international reacted poorly to being substituted before the hour mark in last weekend’s defeat by Leicester City in the league. “Grzegorz came and apologised to me and my staff on Tuesday, which is unusual. I said sometimes an apology isn’t quite enough so I fined him and also said I don’t ever want to see (that kind of reaction) again,” Pardew added. “The selection of the player won’t be influenced after that. “...I actually really like him as a person and a footballer. I was surprised at his action. I said to him, ‘you need to watch the start of the second half - you might have subbed yourself’.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T20:01:45.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
