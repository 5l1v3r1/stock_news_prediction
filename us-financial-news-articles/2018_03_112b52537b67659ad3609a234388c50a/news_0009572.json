He also drew a charge against Wake Forest’s Bryant Crawford, who was driving for the tying basket with 23 seconds left. Okogie also had six rebounds and three assists.\nGeorgia Tech (13-18, 6-12 ACC) also got 12 points apiece from Tadric Jackson and Brandon Alston. Freshman Evan Cole had his first career double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\nIt was the second straight win for Georgia Tech, which broke a seven-game losing streak on Thursday.\nWake Forest (11-18, 4-13) got 22 points from Bryant Crawford, but he turned the ball over eight times. The Demon Deacons also got 12 points and 13 rebounds from center Doral Moore.\nThe win means Georgia Tech will be the 13th seed and Wake Forest will be the 14th seed at the ACC tournament, which begins Tuesday at the Barclay Center in New York.\nOkogie surpassed the 1,000-point career mark on his third point of the game and became only the fifth Georgia Tech player to reach the mark before the end of their sophomore season. He joined Ben Lammers and Jackson, who reached the 1,000-point milestone earlier this season.\nGeorgia Tech had troubles early, suffering five turnovers and seeing center Ben Lammers whistled for two fouls within the first two minutes. Despite that poor start, the Yellow Jackets forced 13 first-half turnovers and led 26-25 at the break.\nThe game was tied six times, including at 46-46, when the Yellow Jackets went on a 6-0 run to take a 52-46 lead with 4:14 remaining. Tech led by eight points with 2:34 left when Wake’s Brandon Childress drained a 3-pointer.\nWake Forest was hurt by 22 turnovers, which led to 19 points for Georgia Tech. Wake shot just 29.6 percent in the second half and had only a pair of two-point baskets.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:58:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
