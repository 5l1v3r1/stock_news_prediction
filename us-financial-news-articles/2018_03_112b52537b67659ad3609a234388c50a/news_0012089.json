We’re not here to ban mining, but it must follow best practices,” he said at a press conference outside parliament.\nWan Junaidi said an estimated stockpile of 10 million tonnes of bauxite had yet to be cleared.\nLocal residents complained last year about ongoing mining activity, and the government noted in July last year that stockpiles had actually increased in size despite millions of tonnes of exports to top buyer China.\nMalaysia was briefly the largest bauxite supplier to China, with shipments peaking at nearly 3.5 million tonnes a month at the end of 2015 as miners rushed to fill a supply gap after neighboring Indonesia banned ore exports.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T08:17:25.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
