Mahoney said in a statement. “We have and will continue to work with Rwanda to resolve this situation.”\nReporting by Eric Beech; Editing by David Alexander and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:50:26.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
