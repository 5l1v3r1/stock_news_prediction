Canada and Mexico are exempt from the tariffs, which will take effect in 15 days. The U.S. will also give other nations the opportunity to justify why they shouldn't be included. \n\"We are deadly serious about solving the problem in steel, aluminum and, as the weeks and months go by, other industries,\" Ross said.
