Other banks arranging the deal are Nomura and Standard Chartered, the document showed.\nMeetings with investors will take place in Europe and Asia starting from April 4, according to the document.\nMannai, which is 66 percent owned by entities representing the Qatar government and royal family, has international businesses in the IT, retail and automotive sectors.\nEarlier this month the company, which is listed on the Qatari stock exchange, announced it had approved the issue of bonds of up to $600 million which would be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of existing debt.\nQatari corporates, as well as banks and the sovereign itself, have been active borrowers in the international debt markets since a slump in oil prices in 2014 hit the Gulf’s economies.\nBut since the diplomatic crisis started last year, Qatari borrowers have not issued international public bonds to avoid paying a price premium.\nQatari banks have over the past few months issued hundreds of millions of dollars in private placements outside the mainstream bond markets to refill their coffers.\nBanks and corporates have been waiting for the government to issue a dollar bond – a move it has been considering for months – in order to price their own debt against the benchmark set by a sovereign sale.\nReporting by Sudip Roy; writing by Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:21:22.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
