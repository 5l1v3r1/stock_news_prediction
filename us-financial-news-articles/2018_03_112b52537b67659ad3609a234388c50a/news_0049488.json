SLOWDOWN \nThe ONS confirmed gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent on the quarter - slowing from 0.5 percent in the third quarter - and 1.4 percent compared with the last three months of 2016.

REUTERS/Paul Hackett/File Photo \nFor 2017, the ONS edged up its economic growth estimate to 1.8 percent but that was still the slowest since 2012. \nThe ONS said disposable household incomes, adjusted for inflation, only inched up 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter and household spending in 2017 grew at the weakest pace since 2011. \nLast year’s savings ratio was the lowest on record at 4.9 percent of gross disposable income. The ONS said households were net borrowers for the first time since records began in 1987. \nBut there are signs the squeeze on households is easing. Inflation appears to have peaked and wage growth has picked up, helping a consumer confidence survey by opinion poll firm GfK to hit a 10-month high in March. \n“The GfK survey suggests that consumers see some light appearing at the end of the tunnel in the form of a revival in spending power,” Andrew Goodwin, an economist at Oxford Economics, said. \nThe BoE has signaled it intends to raise interest rates again soon, having increased them for the first time in a decade in November. It believes Britain’s economy, with its weak productivity growth record, will generate excessive inflation pressure with only modest growth. \nSeparate data showed Britain’s housing market remained soft, reflecting the financial squeeze on many households. \nThe BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell more than expected in February. \nMortgage lender Nationwide said house prices in Britain rose at the slowest pace in seven months in March. \n($1 = 0.7115 pounds) Additional reporting by Andy Bruce and Elizabeth Burden; graphic by Andy Bruce; Editing by Richard Balmforth; Writing by William Schomberg; editing by John Stonestreet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:32:41.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
