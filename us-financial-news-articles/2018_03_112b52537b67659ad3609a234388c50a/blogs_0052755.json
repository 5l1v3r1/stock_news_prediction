The region's flat fields allow for a fully mechanized harvest, reducing producing costs. \nThese farmers cultivating coffee along with other crops such as soy and cotton are finding the arabica beans more profitable, even in the current scenario of reasonably high international prices for soy and low values for coffee. \n\"Coffee is what provides the largest return,\" said Glauber de Castro, one of the owners at Fazenda Café do Rio Branco, a family-owned agricultural company managing 500 hectares of arabica coffee and 200 hectares of soybeans in Luís Eduardo Magalhães, Bahia state. \nHe said both coffee and soy should have good yields this year, due to favorable weather, after a couple of years of poor climate that was never fully offset by irrigation. \nCastro estimates coffee yields to jump to 47 60-kg bags this year from 33 bags in 2017, as soy productivity also reaches high levels. \nFazenda Café do Rio Branco produces high-quality, washed arabicas that it sells directly to Italian processor Illy. \nHe said that to achieve higher profitability with soybeans, he would have to put more land under cultivation, to gain scale. \nCaetano de Carvalho Berlatto, a coffee producer in the neighboring town of São Desidério, has reported a peak yield of 60 bags per hectare, double the national average. He works with two large irrigation systems in the 200 hectares where arabica coffee plantations were set up. \nHe says production could be even higher if not for pests such as the \"mineiro bug\", a tiny worm that eats through plant leaves, reducing production potential. \nWarmer weather in Bahia, compared to traditional coffee cultivation areas such as Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, leads to increased infestations at times.
