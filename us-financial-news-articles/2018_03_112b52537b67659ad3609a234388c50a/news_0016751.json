Of those, the company owns only four.\nThomas Cook formed a strategic partnership with Switzerland-based hotel development company LMEY Investments in September and said on Wednesday that it was transferring two of the hotels it owns into the fund while its partner is transferring three hotels.\nThe fund, named Thomas Cook Hotel Investments, said its first project is the development of a new “Casa Cook” hotel in Ibiza, and it will then look to add further properties, said Thomas Cook’s Chief Hotels Officer Ingo Burmester.\n“We are now able to accelerate our plan to acquire established properties in popular destinations for us to transform into own-brand hotels,” he said.\n“We are in discussions with several hoteliers across the Mediterranean and envisage announcing further projects over the coming months.”\nThomas Cook said in February that it was on course to meet annual profit forecasts, with recovering demand for holidays to Turkey helping to offset the impact of rising costs in Spain.
