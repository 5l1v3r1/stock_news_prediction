REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni “Hamilton” musical creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt, the Tony-winning star of teen musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” recorded a mashup of two songs from the respective shows called “Found/Tonight.” A portion of the proceeds from the song will support the March for Our Lives initiative aimed at pressuring U.S. lawmakers to tighten laws on gun ownership. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are organizing marches in Washington D.C. and elsewhere in the United States on March 24 after 17 students and teachers at their school in Parkland, Florida, were killed in a mass shooting last month.

March for Our Lives has also received support and hefty financial donations from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, director Steven Spielberg and singers Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Demi Lovato.
