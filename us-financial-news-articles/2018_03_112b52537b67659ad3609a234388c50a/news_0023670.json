He stepped on DeJounte Murray’s foot after getting fouled on a layup attempt, twisting his troublesome right ankle.\nCurry was able to shoot the two free throws, but immediately left the court at the 9:38 mark of the first period and never returned.\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr said Curry will not play Friday at Portland on the second night of a back-to-back.\nThe Spurs led 101-93 before Durant scored the Warriors’ next 12 points, including a 3-point basket and three free throws when fouled on another 3-point attempt, during a 12-4 run that drew the Warriors even at 105-105 with 2:02 to play.\nGreen’s hoop happened after he appeared to attempt a lob pass that hit off the backboard and caromed right back to him. He then floated in a six-footer for a lead the Warriors never relinquished.\nGreen’s hoop capped an 11-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist triple-double. His rebound and assist totals were team highs.\nDurant, who hit 14 of his 26 shots, added 11 rebounds for Golden State, which remained unbeaten (7-0) since the All-Star break.\nKlay Thompson and JaVale McGee chipped in with 13 points apiece for the Warriors, who shot just 8-for-30 on 3-pointers.\nAldridge complemented his 30 points with a game-high 17 rebounds for the Spurs, who had won 110-94 at Cleveland in their most recent road game.\nKyle Anderson had a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double for San Antonio, while Murray had 14 points, Davis Bertans 13, Tony Parker 11 and Rudy Gay 10.\nMurray also collected a team-high six assists.\nThe Spurs connected on just six of their 22 3-point attempts.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T19:50:44.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
