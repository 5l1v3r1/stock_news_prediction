Revenue rose 51% over 2016 to $180.5 million. This increase results from the acquisition of Span and Premier Lifts, as well as from our organic growth of approximately 10% in units sold of residential elevators and commercial and residential vertical platform lifts. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 49% over 2016, at $31.1 million or 17% of revenue. Our four 2017 acquisitions, which cost some $120 million, are contributing to Savaria's growth by adding a new distribution network for our ceiling lift products, new products (pressure management products, medical beds and octagonal glass elevators), a new sales territory (Australia) and an enhanced direct sales network for our residential elevators (Baltimore-Washington),” declared Marcel Bourassa, President and Chief Executive Officer of Savaria.\n“These acquisitions are expected to have a strong positive impact on Savaria in 2018, both in terms of revenue and EBITDA. Savaria’s healthy balance sheet will continue to support organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions in the upcoming year, ” concluded Mr. Bourassa.\nOutlook 2018\nFactoring in the benefits of the acquisition of Master Lifts that was completed in December 2017, the Corporation forecasts an increase of 48% of revenue to some $268 million and an adjusted EBITDA to a range of $42.5-$44.5 million for fiscal 2018, excluding any new acquisitions.\nSavaria Corporation ( savaria.com ) is one of North America’s leaders in the accessibility industry.
