REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol The report said the lack of a networked computer system required entry of data such as fuel usage into multiple systems, which meant it could take up to 50 man-hours to plan a mission. This, it said, “is not acceptable from an operational view and must be shortened significantly.”\nIn addition, the report cited a “significant risk” that the aircraft would not meet all tactical requirements by the time the German military retires its current fleet of aging C-160 Transall transport planes after 2021.\nAirbus, which last month took a new 1.3 billion euro charge on the troubled A400M programme, declined to comment on the German report.\nReporting by Sabine Siebold; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Madeline Chambers\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T14:12:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
