R2-D2 and several stormtroopers also stood by during the presentation but declined to make any remarks.\nIn recognition of Hamill being awarded a star, Star Wars’ Twitter account dubbed the day #JediDay .\nHappy #JediDay !

Ford noted the absence of “the other member of our trio” in his speech, followed by saying, “I feel her presence.” Carrie’s daughter, Billie Lourde, attended the event in the place of her mother.\nBoth Hamill and Fisher starred in the latest Star Wars film.\nHamill recently made headlines based on a fight with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai over net neutrality. On Twitter, Hamill said the FCC chief was “profoundly unworthy” of wielding a lightsaber, and that “A Jedi acts selflessly for the common man-NOT lie 2 enrich giant corporations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T00:23:38.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
