With a maximum altitude of 11,000 feet, the air range is estimated to top out at around 350 miles.\nTransforming from road to air isn't quite as simple as pushing a button, requiring manual intervention, but Pal-V claims this can be done in less than 10 minutes.\nThe first limited edition model will retail at an expected 499,000 euros ($621,500) with only 90 available for sale. Thereafter a \"Liberty Sport Edition\" will be available for an expected price of 299,000 euros.\nFlying lessons are included in the price and the company's website is taking orders tied to hefty non-refundable reservation fees.\nThe flying car is certified to fly under the rules of U.S. and European safety agencies but owners will need a pilot's licence. Pilots will also need access to a small airstrip to take off and land.\nDavid Reid Digital Correspondent, CNBC.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T13:43:58.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
