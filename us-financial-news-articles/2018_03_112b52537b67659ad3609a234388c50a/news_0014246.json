The U.S. already passed top exporter Saudi Arabia late last year.\nFor 2019, the EIA forecast a crude production increase of 570,000 bpd to 11.27 million bpd.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:41:42.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
