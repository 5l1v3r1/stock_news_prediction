(“Spotify,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is releasing its financial outlook for its first quarter and full year 2018. These forward-looking statements reflect Spotify’s expectations as of March 26, 2018 and are subject to substantial uncertainty. In the future, we will update our financial outlook on each quarterly earnings call.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Outlook\nTotal Monthly Active Users (“MAU”) 1 : 168-171 million, up 28-31% Y/Y Total Premium Subscribers 2 : 73-76 million, up 41-46% Y/Y Total Revenue: €1.10-1.15 billion, up 22-27% Y/Y. We anticipate changes in foreign exchange rates will have a negative impact of approximately €95-105 million in the quarter 3 Gross Margin: 23-24%. This includes a 60 bp benefit from a one-time estimated accrual adjustment associated with prior periods Operating loss: €50-€80 million\nFull Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nTotal MAUs 1 : 198-208 million, up 26-32% Y/Y Total Premium Subscribers 2 : 92-96 million, up 30-36% Y/Y Total Revenue: €4.9-5.3 billion, up 20-30% Y/Y. We anticipate changes in foreign exchange rates will have a negative impact of approximately €260-300 million for the full year 3 Gross Margin: 23-25% Operating loss: €230-330 million. This includes an estimated total cost for the direct listing of roughly €35-40 million which we expect to expense in Q2\nThis financial outlook assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\n1 We define MAUs as the total count of Ad-Supported Users and Premium Subscribers that have consumed content for greater than zero milliseconds in the last thirty days from the period-end indicated. Reported MAUs may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our service within a thirty-day period as one individual may register for, and use, multiple accounts. Additionally, fraud and unauthorized access to our Service may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of MAUs, if undetected. We define Ad-Supported Users as users of our ad supported service.\n2 We define Premium Subscribers as users that have completed registration with Spotify and have activated a payment method for a premium service. Our Premium Subscribers include all registered accounts in our Family Plan. Our Family Plan consists of one primary subscriber and up to five additional sub-accounts, allowing up to six Premium Subscribers per Family Plan subscription. Premium Subscribers include subscribers who are within a grace period of up to 30 days after failing to pay their subscription fee.\n3 Our reporting currency is the Euro. For revenue expected to be reported in local currency in the current period, we translated these amounts to Euros based on the prior period’s foreign exchange rates to calculate the expected impact on revenue from the change in the exchange rates.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nWe would like to caution you that the foregoing statements are “forward-looking statements” as defined in Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
