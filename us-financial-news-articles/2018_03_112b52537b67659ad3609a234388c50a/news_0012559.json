Legislation prevents candidates and supporters from organising rallies. Independent media have been silenced, with over 400 media and NGO websites completely blocked.” (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Tom Miles)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:26:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
