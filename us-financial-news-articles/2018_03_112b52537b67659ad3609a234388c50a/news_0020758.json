These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm-based strains integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy, and are designed to access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T cell immunity, activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T cells to eliminate tumors. Advaxis has four franchises in various stages of clinical and near-clinical development: HPV-associated cancers, individualized neoantigen immunotherapy, cancer-specific hotspot mutation immunotherapies and prostate cancer.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005131/en/\nCompany:\nAdvaxis, Inc.\nNoelle Heber, 609-250-7575\nSr. Director Corporate Communications and Government Affairs\nHeber@advaxis.com\nor\nMedia:\nStern Strategy Group\nBrian Hyland, 908-325-3891\nBhyland@sternstrategy.com\nor\nRachel Auerbach, 908-325-3898\nRauerbach@sternstrategy.com\nor\nInvestors:\nLHA Investor Relations\nAnne Marie Fields, 212-838-3777\nafields@lhai.com\nSource: Advaxis, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3DudUtTmvJ2sGrUKwqo34IUbVyJX5sNSdJtvHs1_K_ChTy0h3DBiGKfQVwfM-SR0iMSvFYuf_yd2iWOwNou7fiHg%3D%3D&esheet=51770796&newsitemid=20180309005131&lan=en-US&anchor=Advaxis%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=9c87c1eb41f170eba2aa04a926aa5faf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.advaxis.com%2F&esheet=51770796&lan=en-US&anchor=Advaxis%2C+Inc.&index=4&md5=5f3f15dd51975d91ce2c7b4cb10d5a9f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsternstrategy.com%2F&esheet=51770796&lan=en-US&anchor=Stern+Strategy+Group&index=5&md5=c8bbc4579d7c8a88c4f2aea8bfc6abac", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005131/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.advaxis.com%2Fevents-presentations%2Fevents-calendar&esheet=51770796&newsitemid=20180309005131&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.advaxis.com%2Fevents-presentations%2Fevents-calendar&index=3&md5=2352a75f8baea1d62d00e0882aa7befd", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.advaxis.com%2Fevents-presentations&esheet=51770796&newsitemid=20180309005131&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.advaxis.com%2Fevents-presentations&index=2&md5=b17827e2438f747f65df1fd9f3487456", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lhai.com%2F&esheet=51770796&lan=en-US&anchor=LHA+Investor+Relations&index=6&md5=35361bf12c87df1d0ebe28c6ef004355"], "published": "2018-03-09T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T15:42:55.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
