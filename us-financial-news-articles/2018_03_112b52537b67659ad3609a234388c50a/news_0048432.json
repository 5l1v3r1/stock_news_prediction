Prices for Ixelles’ single-family homes, which make up the bulk of the district’s luxury-housing stock, rose more than 15% since 2015, says Mr. van Opstal. With one in 20 residential sales exceeding €850,000, or about $1 million, Ixelles is the Brussels region’s most expensive inner district, he adds.\nFrench expatriates are frequent customers at Restaurant Voltaire, a restaurant and deli on Ixelles’s Place Georges Brugmann. Photo: Bea Uhart for The Wall Street Journal Ixelles comprises several distinct neighborhoods. East of Avenue Louise, the leading upscale shopping thoroughfare in Brussels, are Matonge and the formerly scruffy Flagey. Both diverse neighborhoods are seeing a wave of gentrification. Near Matonge, a new 3,100-square-foot, two-bedroom eighth-floor penthouse is on the market for $2.27 million. The unit has a 1,500-square-foot terrace.\n“Flagey is ‘bobo,’ ” says Arnaud Pitz, a longtime Ixelles resident, using the French expression for “bourgeois bohemian” to describe Flagey’s thriving nightlife, popular produce markets and rising prices.\nMr. Pitz, a photographer and lighting designer, and his wife, Diane Maters, a psychotherapist, are selling their five-story Ixelles townhouse for $2.89 million. The 6,600-square-foot 1905 home is on the western side of Avenue Louise, near Place Georges Brugmann.\nMr. Pitz and Ms. Maters, with their two younger children, Lazlo, 15, left, and Vadim, 13, right, and dog, Sherlock.They are selling their 6,600-square-foot Ixelles townhouse for an asking price of $2.89 million. Photo: Bea Uhart for The Wall Street Journal Brugmann, as locals call it, has been transformed by new arrivals from France. In search of lower taxes and a higher quality of life, they are drawn to the Belle-Époque townhouses, which can rival those in prime areas of Paris, plus a bounty of small shops, fine restaurants and green spaces. Frequent high-speed trains put Brussels less than a 90-minute commute from Paris, where some work. Mr. Pitz says his yoga class is now 80% French.\nHe and his wife, 47, spent about $614,000 in 2006 to transform a rundown, three-bedroom, two-bathroom, 6,600-square-foot townhouse into a six-bedroom, five-bathroom home for the couple and their four children. ( Abraham de Bettencourt, director of Lecobel Vaneau, a real-estate agency, with offices in Ixelles, says similar properties were selling for about $1.1 million at the time of their original purchase.)\nTheir update includes a new, open-plan kitchen on the second floor, and getting rid of a servants’ back staircase for extra room. The former basement kitchen is now a party/play room. The couple also created a split-level master suite on the third floor. The top floors hold the children’s bedrooms.\nNow that their two eldest children are grown, the couple and their two teenagers plan to relocate to Uccle, the villa district south of Ixelles. Their new home will be half as big, but have a lot nearly five times the size of the current one.\nThe alcove off the dining room in the home of Karin de Ceuninck and Dominique Boniver.

Photo: Jasmine Van Hevel for The Wall Street Journal Karin de Ceuninck, an Ixelles native, has long had her eye on the Brugmann neighborhood’s Avenue Louis Lepoutre, a bucolic boulevard lined with chestnut trees and some of the Brussels region’s most imposing townhouses. “I would love to live on Louis Lepoutre but parking is a nightmare,” she says.\nMs. de Ceuninck and Ms. Boniver plan to divide their time between a country home in Provence and a new Ixelles apartment.\nMs. de Ceuninck has listed her home, an urban mansion, for $6 million. The 7,500-square-foot townhouse fronts a 1/8th-acre yard with a new garden house. It also has a luxurious indoor pool. She bought the early-20th-century home in 2012 and oversaw a gut renovation. She expanded the first-floor kitchen and added a floor on top. The property, surrounded by embassies, is in the Ixelles neighborhood named after the Bois de la Cambre, a 19th-century public park at the base of Avenue Louise.\nA short walk away, Ixelles Ponds is noted for its elegant apartment buildings. A two-bedroom Ponds duplex, in a 1930s building, is on the market for $4.9 million. The 4,200-square-foot apartment has a 1,500-square-foot terrace.\nMore From Mansion\nLondon Home Buyers Look to the Countryside February 1, 2018 Luxury Real Estate Runs Hot and Cold in Europe January 18, 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T02:25:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
