It was one of the deadliest U.S. school shootings in United States, where dozens of such massacres have occurred in recent years.\nAt Utica College, a private school about 45 miles east of Syracuse, law enforcement officers were evacuating buildings and taking people on campus to a safe location, the college said.\nThe Tangerine, a student newspaper, posted a photograph online of people hiding under desks.\nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T21:01:55.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
