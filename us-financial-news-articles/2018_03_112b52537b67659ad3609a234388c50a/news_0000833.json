Ms. Hanrahan will maintain her seat on the Company’s Board of Directors which she joined in November 2017, and her deep experience and immediate contributions within the law enforcement and military channels make her the perfect fit for the Company’s new position.\nMs. Hanrahan has vast experience in both the public sector as well as in the law enforcement markets. For nearly 15 years, she held a number of key executive positions at TASER International, Inc., now Axon Enterprise, Inc. (Nasdaq:AAXN). She was Chief Financial Officer during the company’s IPO in 2001 and became Chief Operations Officer in 2003, and then President and Chief Operating Officer from 2006 until 2008. Her last position at TASER was as Chief Executive Officer and co-Chairperson for the TASER Foundation for Fallen Officers, a non-profit subsidiary dedicated to serving the families of officers killed in the line of duty. Over the course of her career, Ms. Hanrahan has also held several director positions for a number of corporations in both the profit and non-profit sectors, and currently serves on Shared Performance Systems and SentrySix Defense Group Board of Advisors in addition to serving on the Board of Directors for AMMO, Inc.\nMs. Hanrahan is the founder and private management consultant for New Horizons Management Consulting which specializes in assisting small- to medium-sized companies in strategy, financial planning, personnel and infrastructure for growth phases.

Her expertise in the space is incredibly deep and will be a key component to our success in growing this segment of the business.”\nMs. Hanrahan commented, “I am excited to join the Team at AMMO Inc., and to be back working in an industry I love. Not since leaving TASER have I been this excited about a new technology, or the possibility to change how the law enforcement and military communities think about defense. The Company’s Streak and OPS lines are defining a new era of ammunition, and offering these markets a cost effective alternative for their training and deployment needs.
