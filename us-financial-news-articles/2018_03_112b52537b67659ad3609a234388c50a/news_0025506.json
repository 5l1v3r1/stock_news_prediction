REUTERS/Ciro De Luca 5-Star emerged as Italy’s biggest party from a national election on March 4, behind a center-right coalition, but neither group got enough seats to form a working majority. “We need to adopt expansive economic policy, but with a view to reducing the debt,” the movement’s leader and aspiring prime minister Luigi Di Maio told foreign reporters. Italy has the second-highest debt in the euro zone as a proportion of output, after Greece. Di Maio said he thought there was flexibility to change the parameters of the European Union’s economic rules, an aim it shares with the far-right League, which leads the center-right. Di Maio added that 5-Star“wants nothing to do with extremist parties in Europe.” Reporting by Gavin Jones, writing by Isla Binnie", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T16:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T17:03:54.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
