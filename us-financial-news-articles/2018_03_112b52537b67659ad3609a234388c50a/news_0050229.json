FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - DFB Cup Third Round - Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund - Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany - December 20, 2017 Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Weigl, Omer Toprak and Sokratis Papastathopoulos look dejected after the match REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nDortmund are battling for a Champions League spot for next season, lying in third place on 48 points. They are one point behind Schalke 04, who host Freiburg with seven games left in the campaign. \nBayern are 17 points clear at the top and had to put their title celebrations on ice after losing 2-1 to RB Leipzig in the previous matchday. \nBut victory over visiting Dortmund in combination with a draw or defeat for Schalke would be enough for Bayern to wrap up a record-extending 28th league title. \n“Obviously this is in the back of our minds,” said Bayern winger Arjen Robben, who has recovered from injury and has returned to training this week. He is expected to be fit for the match. \n“If we had to chose a timing to win it then we would want it to be this Saturday. But obviously we still depend on others as well to win it and cannot secure it ourselves yet.” \nThe only other time Bayern won the title in March was under Pep Guardiola in 2014. \nBayern, chasing a treble, would be boosted by picking up their first silverware of the season ahead of their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Sevilla next week and a German Cup semi-final to follow. \nBut despite an inconsistent season, Dortmund have recovered under coach Peter Stoeger and remain undefeated in the 12 league games since he took over in December. \n“They are playing better and now also under the new coach,” Robben warned. “Dortmund remain a very good team even if this season they were not as consistent.” \nDortmund will likely be without winger Marco Reus, with the Germany international having missed the friendlies against Spain and Brazil in the past days as well as their previous league game with adductor muscle problems. \n“I don’t think there is enough time until the weekend,” said Stoeger of Reus’ chances of making the big game. \nDefender Omer Toprak is also looking doubtful but with the Ruhr valley club having won five of their last seven league games and a Champions League spot the only goal left in their season, motivation should not be an issue.
