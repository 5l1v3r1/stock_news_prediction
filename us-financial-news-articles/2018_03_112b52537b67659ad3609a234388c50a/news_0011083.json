But at no time did Mr. Broidy or Ms. Rosenzweig, or anyone acting on their behalf, discuss Mr. Low's case with President Trump, any member of his staff, or anyone at the U.S. Department of Justice.\" \nLow has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. \nBroidy, a venture capitalist, helped the Trump campaign raise more than $108 million, and he personally gave $160,000 to the Republican National Committee last year. \nThe Justice Department declined to comment further on the matter. The White House did not respond to queries from CNBC on whether Broidy and his wife had communicated with the president on the issue. Seizing 'The Equanimity' \nIn a 291-page lawsuit last year, the U.S. Department of Justice detailed how Low allegedly spent 1MDB funds, including purchasing a $250 million luxury yacht called The Equanimity. \nIndonesian police seized the yacht off the island of Bali last Wednesday and questioned the captain and crew. \nThe Justice Department did not comment on the yacht seizure, but sent CNBC an arrest warrant for the yacht issued by U.S. District Court Judge Dale Fisher for the district of California, which was filed in June last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T08:53:14.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
