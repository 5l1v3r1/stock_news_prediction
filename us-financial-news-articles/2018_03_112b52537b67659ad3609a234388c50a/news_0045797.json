So far, the remaining six whales appear to have survived although incident controller Jeremy Chick said they could attempt to beach themselves at another location.\nSlideshow (7 Images) Pilot whales, which are part of the dolphin family, weigh between one and four tons each, providing a logistical challenge to local authorities, who are now working on disposing of the carcasses.\nWhile whales regularly get stranded on the coastal strip migrating between Antarctic feeding grounds in the south and warmer northern waters where they raise their young, the large number this time is unusual.\nThere was a previously recorded mass stranding in 1996, when 320 long-finned pilot whales stranded themselves just north of Hamelin Bay and died.\nLocals and tourists have been warned to stay out of the water due to a likely increase in sharks attracted by the dead whales. The beach has been temporarily closed while authorities dispose of the deceased whales.\nReporting by Alana Schetzer; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T03:39:49.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
