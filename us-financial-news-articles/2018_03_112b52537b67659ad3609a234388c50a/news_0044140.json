This annual list honors an exclusive group of North American IT solution providers that have earned the highest number of advanced technical certifications from leading technology suppliers, scaled to their company size.\n“Investing in technical certifications prepares Quest to best serve our clients in an ever-evolving industry,” stated Tim Burke, Quest President and CEO. “We seek to continually improve our offering and grow the expertise of our Professional and Managed Services teams.”\nTo compile the annual list, The Channel Company’s research group and CRN editors work together to identify the most customer-beneficial technical certifications in the North American IT channel. Companies who have obtained these elite designations— which enable solution providers to deliver premium products, services and customer support—are then selected from a pool of online applicants.\n“Being named to CRN’s Tech Elite 250 list is no small feat,” said Bob Skelley, CEO of The Channel Company. “These companies have distinguished themselves with multiple, top-level IT certifications, specializations and partner program designations from the industry’s most prestigious technology providers. Their pursuit of deep expertise and broader skill sets in a wide range of technologies and IT practices demonstrates an impressive commitment to elevating their businesses—and to providing the best possible customer experience.”\nCRN recognized Quest three years in a row as a Triple Crown Award Winner. CRN assembles lists and rankings each year to recognize solution providers that are setting the bar in the IT industry, including the Solution Provider 500, which lists the largest solution providers in North America by revenue; the Fast Growth 150, which ranks the fastest-growing solution providers; and the Tech Elite 250, which recognizes solution providers that have received the highest-level certifications from leading vendors. Quest maintains partner relationships and certifications with industry-leading manufacturers.\nCoverage of the Tech Elite 250 will be featured in the April issue of CRN, and online at www.crn.com/techelite250 .\nFollow The Channel Company: Twitter , LinkedIn and Facebook\n@TheChannelCo names @QuesTechUSA to @CRN 2018 Tech Elite 250 list #CRNTechElite250 www.crn.com/techelite250\nAbout Quest\nQuest is a worldwide leader in technology management offering a portfolio of professional, Cloud, and Managed Services.
