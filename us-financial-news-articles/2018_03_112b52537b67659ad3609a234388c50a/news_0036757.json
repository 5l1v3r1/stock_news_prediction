Top picks included Micron , Netflix and Amazon .\n\"Steady economic activity and a gradually tightening Fed create an environment conducive to further growth stock outperformance,\" Kostin wrote Friday. \"Long term, we believe value represents an attractive factor tilt and investment strategy, but we expect growth will provide superior short- and medium-term returns.\"\nGoldman highlighted a number of growth stocks across its coverage with the fastest growth in their sectors based on earnings and sales.\n\nInformation technology has easily outperformed its rival sectors, up nearly 33 percent over the past 12 months versus gains of 19.7 percent for consumer discretionary and 17.8 percent for financials. Still, many investors have grown concerned that tech's ascent could give way to a rally in value names as the historic bull market celebrates its ninth birthday.\nCiting projections for continued economic growth, Kostin warned against this view. The strategist contended that 2.6 percent gross domestic product growth in 2018 and 2.2 percent GDP expansion in 2019 should egg growth stocks higher.\n\"In environments of healthy but modest economic growth, investors typically allocate a scarcity premium to firms able to generate superior growth,\" Kostin added. \"Contrary to popular intuition, growth outperformance has not historically signaled subsequent value outperformance. In fact, more often than not growth stock outperformance leads to more growth stock outperformance.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T17:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T17:19:55.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
