It also allows customers to choose other policies to include, ranging from property insurance for cellphones or jewelry to travel insurance for canceled flights or car breakdowns. The policies are only available in New York and include no deductibles.\nUnlike with traditional renters insurance, customers don’t have to get new policies if they move apartments. But Traverse policies still meet some landlords’ requirements that tenants be insured, said Beth Maerz, Travelers’ vice president of customer experience and innovation for personal insurance.\n“The goal is to offer a product that speaks more to the need of millennials, where a traditional renters policy might not make the most sense for them,” she said.\nRenters insurance has typically been a small business line for insurers compared with their large homeowners and car-insurance businesses. But many startups have started offering renters insurance and insurance for high-value possessions in recent years, aimed at younger clients.\nThose new entrants have set off a race among established carriers in renters insurance to lower prices and improve customer experience.\nRelated How to Rent a New York City Apartment Without a Deposit (Feb. 28) Startup Trov Finds New Funding for Insurance On Demand (April 6) Startups that sell renters insurance, such as Lemonade and Jetty, have marketed their insurance products as cheaper and easier to buy and manage online than traditional policies.\n“There are so many different companies that are getting into the space,” said Christopher Martin, insurtech research lead for the U.S. for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. “All the insurers know they need to try to figure out a different way to either brand themselves or brand what they’re doing.”\nTravelers will continue to sell renters insurance in New York. It expects Traverse policies will appeal to different customers, Ms. Maerz said. New York-based Travelers doesn’t disclose the size of its renters insurance business. It was the No. 6 provider of U.S. homeowners insurance in 2017, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\nTraverse insurance ranges from $8 a month to more than $30 a month, with no deductibles, Ms. Maerz said.\nLemonade and Jetty both advertise renters insurance as low as $5 a month, with deductibles.\nBillions of dollars have been invested in “insurance tech” in recent years, as startups aim to make the industry more consumer-friendly and tech-savvy. But in a heavily regulated and capital-intensive industry where the biggest companies are household names, those legacy brands are hard to displace, experts say.\nMany startups have focused on attracting younger consumers with new types of insurance, including smaller fees to replace security deposits, property insurance that turns on and off with a swipe on a smartphone and pay-by-the-mile car insurance.\nMajor insurance carriers have announced large investments in in-house innovation and venture funding of insurance-related startups.\nTraditional insurance companies that have launched new brands include State Farm, which sells car insurance in Rhode Island through an affiliate HiRoad, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which sells small business insurance through its biBERK brand.\nWrite to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T19:37:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
