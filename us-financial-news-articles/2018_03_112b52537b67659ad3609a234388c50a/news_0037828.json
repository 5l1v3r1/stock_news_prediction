The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato Yoshimitsu Goto, a senior corporate officer at SoftBank, suggested to investors that an initial public offering could be a potential exit strategy for an investment fund that SoftBank launched last year, the FT reported. The $93 billion Vision Fund, backed by Saudi Arabia’s main sovereign wealth fund and companies including Apple and Qualcomm, is set to acquire a 25 percent stake in ARM, the report added. SoftBank did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. SoftBank is looking to optimise its investment in ARM, which it acquired for $32 billion in 2016, and take some cash out, Reuters Loan Pricing Corp (LPC) reported earlier this month.
