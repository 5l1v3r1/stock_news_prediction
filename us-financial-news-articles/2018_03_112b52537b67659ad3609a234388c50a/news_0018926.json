It is offered at 98.5-99 OID and 101 soft-call for six months, the sources said.\nCorporate and facility ratings are B3/B, with a recovery rating of 3. The loan is also offered with a leveraged covenant.\nA bank meeting is set to take place on March 12 to show the deal to investors, which have been asked to commit to the financing by March 26.\nThere is also a £55m revolving credit facility.\nElysium was formed in October 2016 when BC Partners acquired a portfolio of 22 mental health facilities from Acadia Healthcare. The facilities were former Priory clinics.\nElysium closed a £155m term loan B in March 2017 backing its buyout by BC Partners, after a syndication process that took just over three months.\nAIB, ING and RBS joined BNP Paribas and Jefferies as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners on that term loan, which was increased to £155m prior to close following the tack-on acquisition of two additional facilities, bringing the total number of facilities up to 24.\nThat loan allocated at 97.5 OID.\nThat loan was originally launched at £200m in November 2016, but was reduced to £133m in December, after agreeing a sale-and-leaseback transaction on its property portfolio.\nSyndication to the group of banks and some funds was delayed to accommodate the sale and leaseback in December and the tack-on acquisitions in January.\nEditing by Christopher Mangham\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:15:51.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
