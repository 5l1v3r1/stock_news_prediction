Inquiries were ongoing at a second facility run by Enterprise Foods to establish if it too had contributed.\nListeriosis, the infection caused by the bacteria, causes flu-like symptoms, nausea, diarrhoea and infection of the blood and brain. It poses a higher risk for newborns, the elderly, pregnant women and people with weak immunity.\nThe outbreak has caused 180 fatalities and 948 reported cases since January 2017.\nTiger Brands spokeswoman Nevashnee Naicker said:“We are all extremely concerned by listeriosis – we all want to find the source or sources of listeriosis, together with the government.”\nRCL Foods chief legal officer Stephen Heath said the company was recalling its polony products even though test results were still pending.\n“RCL Foods is sharing all results from its testing, both internally and externally, with the relevant authorities,” Heath said.“We will continue to take every precaution to safeguard our products as well as our consumers.\nSouth African supermarket operator Pick n Pay said it had withdrawn the products from its shelves.\n“All fridges and food preparation areas in our stores will now be re-cleaned to prevent any cross-contamination. Recalled meat is being isolated and will be safely destroyed,” spokeswoman Tamra Capstick-Dale said in a statement.
