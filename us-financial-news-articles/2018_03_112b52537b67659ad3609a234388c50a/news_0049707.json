This is a train wreck.\n“This was pre-planned cheating. It may have been implemented by a junior player in Cameron Bancroft but it came with the backing and knowledge of ‘the leadership group’, a core of senior guys in the Australian set-up.”\nDISTANCING THEMSELVES The identity of the leadership group that Smith admitted was responsible for Bancroft attempting to scuff up one side of the ball with a piece of tape was the subject of some conjecture, with Warner the only name definitely in the frame.\nSeveral of the Australian correspondents in Cape Town report that some of the other supposed members of the group, pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, have moved swiftly to distance themselves from the incident.\nCoach Darren Lehmann will also have questions to answer after clearly trying to cover up the incident once he realized the TV pictures had exposed Bancroft’s cheating, even if Smith insisted the coach had not been part of the conspiracy.\nCricket Australia, coming off a highly damaging labor dispute last year, have also come under fire for the temerity of their initial response.\nRelated Coverage Cricket: MCC says change in attitude and culture needed Sponsors put Australian cricket on notice as ball-tampering scandal engulfs a nation “Frankly, we believe that Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft should have been on the first plane home yesterday,” Australian Sports Commission chairman John Wylie told ABC Radio on Monday.\n“If an athlete had been representing Australia in an Olympic Games and they had brought the country and the team into disrepute, that’s what would have happened to them.”\nThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the sole authority on the laws of cricket since it was founded in 1787, called for better leadership across the global game.\n“The time has come for a major shift in attitude and culture of all those with responsibility for leadership within the game, to give young players the kind of role models who will uphold standards, preserve cricket and, vitally, the Spirit of Cricket for future generations,” John Stephenson, MCC Assistant Secretary (Cricket), said in a statement.\nEditing by John O'Brien and Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T01:54:44.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
