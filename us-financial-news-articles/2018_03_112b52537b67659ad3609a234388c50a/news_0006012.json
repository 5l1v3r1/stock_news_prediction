That is not the case,” Chief Executive Ed Bastian wrote in the memo to employees.\n“We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.”\nSince announcing its decision to cease its relationship with the NRA, Delta has faced calls for a boycott from members of the powerful gun rights group.\nRepublican state officials in Georgia on Thursday punitively struck down a proposed jet fuel tax exemption that would have saved Delta, the state’s largest private employer, some $40 million per year, despite public support for the proposal from the state’s Republican governor, Nathan Deal.\n“While Delta’s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,” Bastian said in the memo.“Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale.”\nThe state’s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, who is running to succeed Deal in the 2018 gubernatorial race, has threatened to“kill any tax legislation” that benefits Delta, prompting offers from several states to re-house the carrier’s headquarters.\nBastian said in the memo that the carrier is proud to be headquartered in Georgia, where the airline employs 33,000 people statewide.
