Lawmakers of both parties had criticized President Donald Trump for not acting swiftly enough to enact sanctions passed by Congress last summer . Trump's critics have accused him of going soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin .\nThe fresh round of sanctions also includes Russian intelligence services, such as the Federal Security Service, or FSB, and Intelligence Directorate, or GRU.\nThe actions Thursday mean that \"property and interests in property of the designated persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,\" Treasury said.\nRussia's deputy foreign minister said Thursday that Moscow was preparing retaliatory measures against the U.S. over the sanctions.\nThe sanctions came at an especially fraught time for relations between Russia and western democracies. Wednesday, British Prime Minister Theresa May ordered the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in England. Russia denies it was involved in the March attack, which left former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in critical condition. Trump said Thursday that \"it looks like\" Russia was involved in the poisoning.\nThe most prominent person named in the Treasury Department sanctions is Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, also known as \"Putin's chef,\" who is closely linked to the Russian president. Also named is Internet Research Agency, a so-called \"troll farm\" based in St. Petersburg, Russia, which Progozhin allegedly controlled.\nPrigozhin is among the 13 individuals mentioned in the sanctions who were also indicted in special counsel Robert Mueller 's probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nA grand jury accused them of engaging in an information warfare campaign aimed at tipping the election to Trump. U.S. intelligence agencies, as well, have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign using hacking and propaganda, an effort that eventually included efforts to help Trump win.\nMikhail Svetlov | Getty Images Yevgeny Prigozhin Trump has repeatedly denied allegations of collusion with the Kremlin.\n\"Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors have also targeted U.S. government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,\" the Treasury Department said in announcing the sanctions.\nThe administration's action also relate to the NotPetya cyberattack, which U.S. and British authorities attributed to the Russian military last month.\nA senior national security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNBC that the NotPetya attack was the \"most destructive cyberattack in our history.\"\nThe fresh round of U.S. sanctions comes three days before Russia's presidential vote in which Putin is widely expected to win another six-year stint.\nSeeking a strategy to deal with Russia Military and intelligence officials have said that they have yet to receive directives from Trump to combat the online onslaught from Russia .\n\"I don't believe there is an effective unification across the interagency, with the energy and the focus that we could attain,\" Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is also NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week.\n\"Because of today's capabilities and information, where they can use multiple platforms and generate great volume, it can really undermine a nation,\" added Scaparrotti, who oversees an area of responsibility that includes Russia.\nOne week prior to Scaparrotti's testimony, U.S. Cyber Command chief Navy Admiral Mike Rogers also said he was not directed by the president to counter Russian cyberoperators.\nRogers, who is also the director of the National Security Agency, added that the U.S. has \"not opted to engage\" with Moscow's continued interference.\nHere is how the Treasury described the individuals and entities who were sanctioned:\nE.O. 13694 Sanctions\nToday's action includes the designation of three entities and 13 individuals pursuant to E.O. 13694, as amended, which targets malicious cyber actors, including those involved in interfering with election processes or institutions.\nThe Internet Research Agency LLC (IRA) tampered with, altered, or caused a misappropriation of information with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes and institutions.
