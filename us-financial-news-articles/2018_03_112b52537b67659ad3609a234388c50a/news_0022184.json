(“ LOGiQ ”) (TSX:LGQ) and Grenville Strategic Royalty Corp. (“ Grenville ”) (TSX-V:GRC) are pleased to announce that they have entered into an arrangement agreement (the “ Arrangement Agreement ”) pursuant to which LOGiQ has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Grenville (the “ Grenville Shares ”) on the basis of 6.25 common shares of LOGiQ (the “ LOGiQ Shares ”) for each outstanding Grenville Share (the “ Transaction ”).\nThe consideration to be received by Grenville shareholders reflects the relative values of each of LOGiQ and Grenville. Upon completion of the Transaction, existing holders of LOGiQ Shares and Grenville Shares will collectively own approximately 33% and 67% of the combined company, respectively.\nLOGiQ and Grenville believe that on a combined basis, the companies together will offer a more effective and viable platform for enhancing shareholder value. “As we explored various options for LOGiQ shareholders, we believe Grenville and its business model, combined with LOGiQ’s institutional Global Advisory Sales platform, offers exciting growth opportunities and the potential to rebuild shareholder value,” said Dr. Eldon Smith, LOGiQ’s Chairman. “Grenville’s renewed investment process, strong deal flow pipeline and investment structure are designed to return significant cash on cash yields to investors while participating in the growth of its portfolio companies. This model has been built to provide a win for Grenville’s shareholders and portfolio companies alike. Grenville's recent success with companies such as Boardwalktech, an emerging enterprise Blockchain company based in California, and its significant equity position in cannabis franchisor Inner Spirit, are indicative of the quality of its deal flow and the upside potential of Grenville's business model.”\nVernon Lobo, Chair of Grenville’s investment committee added: “We are delighted to be partnering with LOGiQ as we add scale to our business to allow us to take advantage of the compelling investment opportunities ahead of us. Both companies have worked very hard over the past year to address their challenges, and the combination of these businesses will provide us with a solid financial platform from which to build a value-creating business focused on providing alternative sources of financing to high growth companies throughout North America. We are encouraged by recent events in our portfolio, including the contract buyout concluded last week with phone repair company FIXT, and the going public transaction announced by Clear Blue Technologies, one of our earliest investees. We are also looking forward to partnering with Steve Mantle and his team at LOGiQ Global Partners as they continue to grow their business, which generates a consistent and growing revenue stream for the benefit of shareholders. We will be working on board and management configuration over the coming weeks.”\nThe board of directors of LOGiQ (the “ LOGiQ Board ”), based on the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the LOGiQ Board, has unanimously approved the Transaction and recommends that holders of LOGiQ Shares vote in favour of the special resolution approving the continuance of LOGiQ from Alberta into British Columbia (the “ Continuance ”), which is required to complete the Transaction, and the ordinary resolution approving the issuance of LOGiQ Shares pursuant to the Transaction (the “ Share Issuance ”).\nThe board of directors of Grenville (the “ Grenville Board ”), based on the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the Grenville Board, has unanimously approved the Transaction and recommends that holders of Grenville Shares vote in favour of the special resolution approving the Transaction.\nTransaction Terms\nUnder the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, the Transaction will be effected by way of a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “ BCBCA ”).\nThe Transaction is subject to shareholder, TSX and Supreme Court of British Columbia approval, and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.
