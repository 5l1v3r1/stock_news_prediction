A day later, the White House said no immediate policy change was coming despite Trump’s comments.\nU.S. steel stocks were broadly higher in premarket trading, with AK Steel up 7 percent, U.S. Steel up more than 4 percent and Nucor gaining 3.5 percent. Aluminum company Alcoa advanced 1.8 percent before the opening bell.
