IRE stood at 150.8 million pounds last year.\nThe company said its regulatory capital value (RCV), a measure of the value of its capital base, is expected to rise by 400 million pounds ($569.4 million) as retail price inflation has increased this year.\nThe group also expects a small increase in net debt at March 31 compared with its position of 6.71 billion pounds as at Sept. 30, 2017.\nUnited Utilities said it was track to submit its 2019 price review (PR19) business plan in September and it was confident of delivering against Ofwat’s themes.\nThe PR19 methodology controls the prices companies can charge their customers, with the decisions affecting bills from 2020.\nThe water industry currently operates within five-year planning cycles and companies submit their business plans prior to the start of each five-year period.\nUntied Utilities shares were up over 1 percent in early trading.
