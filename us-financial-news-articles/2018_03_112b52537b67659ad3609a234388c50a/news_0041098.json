(“ Ethereum Capital ” or the “ Company ”) is pleased to provide an update on its proposed reverse takeover transaction with Movit Media Corp. (“ Movit ”). As previously announced, the Company and Movit entered into a binding agreement pursuant to which the Company will amalgamate with a wholly owned subsidiary of Movit and continue as one corporation (“ Amalco ”). Holders of common shares in the Company (“ Ethereum Shares ”) will receive one common share of Movit for each Ethereum Share and Amalco will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Movit (the “ Transaction ”). Immediately prior to the completion of the Transaction, the net proceeds of the Company’s $45 million subscription receipt offering will be released from escrow, and each holder of subscription receipts will receive one Ethereum Share for each subscription receipt held.\nEthereum Capital and Movit continue to work towards the completion of the Transaction. On March 22, 2018, Movit mailed to its shareholders a management information circular dated March 16, 2018 (the “ Circular ”) and related meeting materials in connection with an annual and special meeting of Movit shareholders scheduled to be held on Friday, April 13th, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time) (the “ Movit Meeting ”). At the Movit Meeting, Movit shareholders will be asked to consider, among other things, the matters required to effect the Transaction with Ethereum Capital, including a change of name to “Ether Capital Corporation” and a reconstitution of the Movit board of directors with nominees of Ethereum Capital effective on the completion of the Transaction. Holders of approximately 76% of the outstanding common shares of Movit entitled to vote at the Movit Meeting have entered into voting agreements pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their common shares of Movit in favor of the resolutions required to effect the Transaction.\nThe Circular and related meeting materials will be posted under Movit’s corporate profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Full details regarding the Transaction will be disclosed by Movit in a filing statement (the “ Filing Statement ”) to be prepared and filed under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (“ TSXV ”) and the Aequitas NEO Exchange (“ NEO ”), as applicable. The Filing Statement will be posted under Movit’s corporate profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com prior to completion of the Transaction.\nThe closing of the Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions customary for this type of transaction, including the receipt of requisite approvals from Movit shareholders and approval of the TSXV or NEO, as applicable. Subject to receipt of all approvals, the Transaction is currently scheduled to close shortly after the date of the Movit Meeting.\nAbout Ethereum Capital\nEthereum Capital is a technology company whose objective is to become the central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem.
