For those Stewart stockholders who elect to receive all FNF stock, the exchange ratio will be equal to 1.2850, subject to potential adjustment as described below and proration to the extent the stock option is oversubscribed.\nFNF intends to achieve at least $135 million in operational cost synergies and expects the acquisition to be at least 15% accretive to pro forma 2017 adjusted net earnings per share at that operational cost synergy target.\nStewart is one of the leading title insurance companies in the country, providing residential and commercial title insurance, closing and settlement services, appraisal and valuation services and other offerings to the real estate industry.\n\"We are excited to welcome Stewart, its employees and its customers to the FNF family,\" said FNF Chairman William P.
