Triferic ESA sparing patent covering composition and use issued in China. Signed exclusive license agreements for Triferic commercialization in Chile and Peru.\nMr. Robert L. Chioini, Chief Executive Officer of Rockwell stated, “We are pleased and excited with the substantial progress we have made working with policy makers in Washington D.C. to ensure hemodialysis patients across the U.S. will have access to our new, innovative anemia therapy Triferic. There is a timely emphasis on spurring innovation in the U.S. renal market to provide new therapies, like Triferic, that can improve patients’ lives and lower healthcare costs. Based on our progress to date, we remain optimistic that Triferic will receive the proper reimbursement soon. Our marketing and education efforts for Triferic continue, and have been well received by the dialysis community. Data reported via our drug sample program has shown positive patient outcomes and cost-saving benefits, giving us further confidence that Triferic should be widely adopted if separate reimbursement is granted.”\nConference Call Information\nRockwell Medical will be hosting a conference call to review its 2017 fourth quarter and year end results today, Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EDT. Investors are encouraged to call a few minutes in advance at (866) 548-4713, or for international callers (323) 794-2093, Conference ID #8976030.

Via dialysate during each dialysis treatment, Triferic replaces the 5-7 mg iron loss that occurs in all patients, effectively maintaining their iron balance. Unlike IV iron products, Triferic binds iron immediately and completely to transferrin (carrier of iron in the body) upon entering the blood and it is then transported directly to the bone marrow to be incorporated into hemoglobin, with no increase in ferritin (stored iron and inflammation) and no anaphylaxis, addressing a significant unmet need in overcoming Functional Iron Deficiency (FID) in ESRD patients. Please visit www.triferic.com to view the Triferic mode-of-action (MOA) video and for more information.\nAbout Rockwell Medical, Inc.\nRockwell Medical, Inc. (“Rockwell”) is a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with innovative products and services for the treatment of iron replacement, secondary hyperparathyroidism and hemodialysis.\nRockwell’s FDA approved drug Triferic is indicated for iron replacement and maintenance of hemoglobin in hemodialysis patients suffering from anemia. Triferic delivers iron to patients during their regular dialysis treatment, using dialysate as the delivery mechanism. Triferic has demonstrated that it safely and effectively delivers sufficient iron to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin, without increasing iron stores (ferritin). Rockwell intends to market Triferic to hemodialysis patients in the U.S. dialysis market and globally.\nRockwell’s FDA approved generic drug Calcitriol is for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients. Calcitriol (active vitamin D) injection is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. It has been shown to significantly reduce elevated parathyroid hormone levels. Reduction of PTH has been shown to result in an improvement in renal osteodystrophy. Rockwell intends to market Calcitriol to hemodialysis patients in the U.S. dialysis market.\nRockwell is also an established manufacturer and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates/dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the U.S. and abroad. As one of the two major suppliers in the U.S., Rockwell’s products are used to maintain human life by removing toxins and replacing critical nutrients in the dialysis patient’s bloodstream. Rockwell has three U.S. manufacturing/distribution facilities.\nRockwell’s exclusive renal drug therapies support disease management initiatives to improve the quality of life and care of dialysis patients and are intended to deliver safe and effective therapy, while decreasing drug administration costs and improving patient convenience. Rockwell Medical is developing a pipeline of drug therapies, including extensions of Triferic for indications outside of hemodialysis.
