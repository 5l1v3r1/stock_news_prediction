Construction spending increased 3.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.\nIn January, spending on private construction projects fell 0.5 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in December. Outlays on private residential projects rose 0.3 percent after dropping 0.5 percent in December.\nSpending on nonresidential structures tumbled 1.5 percent in January, almost reversing Decemberâ€™s 1.8 percent jump.\nOutlays on public construction projects increased 1.8 percent in January to the highest level since August 2015, after rising by the same margin in December.\nSpending on federal government construction projects vaulted 14.9 percent to the highest level since September 2011. State and local government construction outlays rose 0.5 percent to levels last seen in March 2016.\nReporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:07:01.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
