HTA was acquired from Miami-based David and Leila Centner. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nHTA is combining with the Fleet Services unit of Platinum Equity portfolio company American Traffic Solutions (ATS), creating an organization that will process tolls for approximately 7 million vehicles annually. ATS has been part of Platinum Equity’s portfolio of operating companies since June 2017.\nPlatinum Equity Partner Jacob Kotzubei said he expects the acquisition to further strengthen ATS Fleet Services’ offering by leveraging the combined strengths of both businesses.\n“We see tremendous opportunity in fleet and rental car toll and violation management, and the addition of HTA creates an even stronger platform for growth,” said Mr. Kotzubei. “We are making good on our promise to help ATS maximize its potential and will continue seeking new ways to expand the company’s product offering and footprint.”\nMr. Centner, who has served as HTA’s CEO since he founded the business more than 15 years ago, will remain a minority shareholder. Mrs. Centner served as the company’s CFO.\n“We have great respect for the Centners, who broke new ground and built an organization with outstanding employees and highly innovative technology,” added Mr. Kotzubei.\nMr. Centner founded HTA in 2002 anticipating that increasingly dynamic vehicle usage and ownership would create complexities in the assignment and collection of tolls for rental cars and other fleets. The company’s proprietary electronic toll collection platform “TollKeeper” has since processed hundreds of millions of toll transactions for tens of millions of vehicles throughout the United States and Canada. HTA’s services encompass both transponder-based and license-plate-based video tolling solutions.\n“This is an exciting day for HTA and will open up new possibilities for the future of the business and its customers,” said Mr. Centner. “I’m proud of the company we built and would especially like to thank our executive team and our employees. Their hard work and commitment have created a world class business that will only grow stronger by joining forces with ATS.”\nArizona-based ATS is a leading provider of road safety cameras and toll and violations management solutions throughout North America. ATS Fleet Services is a leader in both toll and violation management solutions to fleets and rental customers. ATS’s Safety business has more than 4,000 installed school bus stop arm, red-light and speed safety cameras serving more than 30 million people across the United States and Canada.\nATS CEO David Roberts, who will lead the combined company, praised the move as a great advantage for all stakeholders.\n“ATS is excited about this acquisition,” said Mr. Roberts. “Bringing together these two companies provides a great opportunity for us to add value for both our customers and our shareholders. We look forward to welcoming HTA to the ATS family.”\nAbout Platinum Equity\nFounded in 1995 by Tom Gores , Platinum Equity is a global investment firm with $13 billion of assets under management and a portfolio of more than 30 operating companies that serve customers around the world.
