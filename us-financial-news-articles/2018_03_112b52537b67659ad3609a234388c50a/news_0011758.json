Once we start down this path it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in a deep recession.” (Reporting by Tom Miles; editing by Stephanie Nebehay)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:29:11.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
