NHTSA said in 2016 that the regulations posed \"significant\" hurdles to vehicles without human controls.\nThe Federal Transit Administration recently sought public input on autonomous bus technology and regulatory barriers, while the Federal Highway Administration sought views on how U.S. roads must adapt to autonomous technology.\nIn January, GM filed a petition with NHTSA requesting an exemption for a small number of autonomous vehicles in a ride-share program without steering wheels or human drivers. The department has still not determined whether that petition is \"complete\" before deciding whether to approve it.
