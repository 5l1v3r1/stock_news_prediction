Akamai has some extremely valuable assets, and Elliott will ... keep helping bring out the value of the enterprise, and if that value peaks or stalls, then I think the company will be put up for sale,\" Cramer said.\n\"The bottom line? The only thing better than a turnaround is a turnaround that's getting juiced with steroids by a very smart activist firm,\" he continued. \"That's what's happening at Akamai and it's why I like the stock right here, especially since it pulled back a few points from its highs last week, giving you an excellent entry point to do some buying.\"\nDefending Kudlow Scott Mlyn | CNBC Larry Kudlow On a down day for the major averages, Cramer highlighted for investors why the market could get a gift from President Donald Trump appointing CNBC host Larry Kudlow as his top economic advisor .\n\"First, let me distill Larry's philosophy into one word: growth,\" Cramer said on Wednesday. \"Growth is true north for this fine but forceful gentleman, and as long as the president takes him seriously about what's true north, that is good for the stock market.\"\nCalling Kudlow \"the most pro-growth person I've ever met,\" Cramer said that his years working with the TV personality on CNBC's \"Kudlow & Cramer\" taught him how articulate and \"at home with the media\" Kudlow was.\n\"That matters tremendously when you have a president who likes to take his cues from cable news, or at least the people on cable whom he agrees with,\" Cramer said.\nPayPal CEO on international potential Mark Neuling | CNBC Dan Schulman For PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, the main driver of his company's gains to date has been \"the digitization of cash.\"\n\"The entire financial system's ecosystem is moving, more rapidly than ever before, away from cash and towards digital payments because of the explosion of mobile phones,\" Schulman told CNBC on Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Cramer .\nWith 227 million subscribers, 65 percent of whom reside outside of North America, PayPal has seized on this \"explosion\" of digital payments around the world, Schulman said, speaking from CNBC's 1Market in San Francisco.\nThis rapid digitization has led to countries like India and China opting for efficiency and, in some cases, skipping over financial technologies like checking accounts and credit cards in favor of digital payments, Schulman told Cramer.\nSchulman also shared what running peer-to-peer payment service Venmo has shown him about how younger generations manage their money.\nNew SoFi CEO lists top 3 priorities Abigail Stevenson | CNBC Anthony Noto SoFi's new CEO, Twitter veteran Anthony Noto, took the CEO role at the financial technology company to help build a next-generation financial institution, he told CNBC on Wednesday.\nBut to outperform the rest of the increasingly crowded fintech space, the privately held SoFi needs to do three things, Noto told Cramer in an exclusive interview .\n\"First, we have to have the best selection — and not just selection of each product, but variations of those products,\" Noto said. \"Second, we have to provide unmatched convenience. Anytime, anywhere, on any device, you should be able to access all of your financial information, do any activity that you want across the broad spectrum of products that we'll launch over time.\"\nNoto's third initiative for the company — which helps its \"members,\" or customers, refinance student and mortgage loans, take out personal loans and even get career advice — had to do with speed.\nMad Money turns 13 Adam Jeffery | CNBC Jim Cramer on Mad Money. On Wednesday, \"Mad Money\" marked its 13th year on the air, and Cramer thought some thank yous were in order.\n\"The reason we have a 13th anniversary, the reason we have any anniversary, is that you've supported us, you've cheered us and informed us about what you need to take control of your finances. We're still on the air because of you,\" he told viewers.\n\"You started with us in the halcyon days of an economic expansion. You stuck with us during a horrendous downturn, the worst since the Great Depression. You fought with us to get back to even. You stayed with us as the market soared and we urged you to stay in when so many other people told you to get out,\" he continued.\nThe enthusiasm Cramer has seen in the last 13 years has inspired him to keep going. It has also confirmed what he's known all along: that homegamers can successfully invest for themselves.\n\"Believe me, as long as you keep watching — and the network doesn't haul me out of the studio in a straitjacket — I'll keep coming out here to entertain you and educate you and, hopefully, make you a better investor,\" he said. \"After 13 years, keep sticking with Cramer.\"\nLightning round: Steer clear of MRK In Cramer's lightning round , he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:\nMerck & Co. : \"Not a buyer of Merck here, even though I do like that yield. I prefer [Eli] Lilly or, more importantly, Abbott Labs .\"\nPhillips 66 : \"They are incredibly well-run. That stock can go higher. I have to tell you, they've created real value there. Stick with it.\"\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Abbott Laboratories.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
