(NYSE:ANW) (“Aegean” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter\nFourth Quarter Financial Overview\nRecorded sales volumes of 3,511,023 metric tons. Recorded gross profit of $59.8 million. Recorded operating loss of $16.8 million. Recorded net loss attributable to Aegean shareholders of $28.6 million or $0.70 basic and diluted losses per share (adjusted net loss was $19.6 million or $0.48 basic and diluted losses per share). Recorded negative EBITDA of $8.8 million (adjusted negative EBITDA of $1.4 million). Reduced quarterly dividend payment to $0.01 per share.\nManagement Commentary\nJonathan McIlroy, Aegean’s President commented, “We continue to operate in a highly competitive market that remains under significant pressure, which is reflected in our fourth quarter 2017 and full year results. During this period, we have focused on the consistent implementation of our optimization strategy, while simultaneously pursuing new business opportunities to create value and position Aegean for long-term success.\n“With uncertainty expected to persist, our board of directors and management took steps to enhance our expense and asset optimization efforts while also enabling Aegean to return to profitable and sustainable growth. The Board unanimously determined that the acquisition of all the outstanding share capital of H.E.C. Europe Limited (“HEC”), a complementary business with high margins, creates a global “one-stop-shop” for the shipping industry through integrating bunkering and ship waste management. The Board has determined that this transaction is in the best interest of Aegean shareholders and we are confident that with HEC, we can achieve growth significantly greater than what either company could achieve on a standalone basis.”\nAegean’s Q4 2017 loss of $28.6 million includes roughly $15.3 million of non-recurring expense items including $11.0 million of non-cash charges. In addition, the Company experienced approximately $12 million of hedging losses during the fourth quarter as a result of the Company’s first in, first out (FIFO) reporting method of inventory cost. This loss was recovered in January 2018 when inventory was sold at market prices, and the hedges were closed. Adjusting for all these non-recurring items, our net loss would have been $1.3 million. At the end of December 2017, the Company’s cash position was $71.1 million and its net debt was $52.1 million.\nIn the fourth quarter the Company announced its intention to cease operations as a physical supplier in Singapore. The Company delivered its last physical cargo in Singapore in January of 2018. In addition, Aegean has downsized operations in Fujairah and recalibrated its U.S. West Coast footprint while expanding in Germany, where the Company established a presence in Kiel. Aegean continues to seek new opportunities to replace volumes ceded by the group in both Singapore and Fujairah by seeking volume growth elsewhere in the network where margins are more sustainable. Key elements of this strategy are the anticipated expansion in volumes in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region, Germany and Savannah on the East Coast of the US being good examples.\nThrough a combination of fleet and storage rationalization and G&A reduction, the Company also achieved and identified roughly $25 million of annual cost reductions and expects to reach $30 million in cost reductions over time.\nThe Company has also sought to improve its contract base with significant customers, including renegotiating a few key contracts in core stations at higher margins in late 2017 for the entirety of the 2018 trading year, with some contracts extended into 2019.\nSpyros Gianniotis, Aegean's Chief Financial Officer, stated, “Our decision to cease operations in Singapore and downsize operations in Fujairah in order to focus on higher return areas contributed to a 15.2% decrease in sales volume when compared to the prior quarter. Gross spread per metric ton improved by 6.2% from the prior quarter, which reflects our focus on repositioning our portfolio towards higher margin business. Despite recent progress in gross spread improvement, our results are still significantly below the $21.10 level of Q4 2016, indicating that market pressures have not abated. We continue to take steps to right size the business and our financial profile through cost reduction initiatives, and reduced net operating expenses excluding non-recurring items by $2.7 million year-on-year.\n“While our recent results show the significant pressures on the markets in which we operate, we remain confident that we are taking the right steps to position Aegean for long-term growth. The acquisition of HEC diversifies the Company’s revenue streams, opens up growth opportunities in the environmental services market and creates potential for synergies within our existing network. Once completed, we expect the addition of HEC to be immediately accretive to our operating and financial results and the combined company to accelerate growth moving forward. We will continue our focus on reducing cost, rationalizing and optimizing our presence in key operating hubs and on maximizing asset utilization in order to create value for Aegean shareholders.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue – The Company reported total revenue of $1,365.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 14.1% compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the increase in oil prices.

Aegean’s board of directors will re-evaluate its dividend policy following the integration of the HEC transaction.\nYiannis Papanicolaou, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Aegean added, “After extensive consideration and in light of our challenging financial results in 2017, as well as our desire to conserve capital, the board of directors of Aegean has elected to reduce the payment of our quarterly dividend to $0.01 per share, down from $0.02 per share.\"\nSummary Consolidated Financial and Other Data (Unaudited) For the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, For the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated) Income Statement Data: Revenues - third parties $ 1,191,392 $ 1,361,545 $ 4,055,557 $ 5,655,868 Revenues - related companies 4,783 3,700 20,662 18,419 Total revenues 1,196,175 1,365,245 4,076,219 5,674,287 Cost of revenues - third parties 1,090,618 1,285,606 3,658,681 5,296,270 Cost of revenues– related companies 14,760 19,796 64,054 87,710 Total cost of revenues 1,105,378 1,305,402 3,722,735 5,383,980 Gross profit 90,797 59,843 353,484 290,307 Operating expenses: Selling and distribution 53,345 52,413 202,266 210,087 General and administrative 12,907 21,389 49,757 56,908 Amortization of intangible assets 170 170 1,070 676 Loss/(gain) on sale of vessels - - 6,312 (94 ) Vessel impairment charge - 2,648 - 2,648 Operating income 24,375 (16,777 ) 94,079 20,082 Net financing cost (6,091 ) (13,742 ) (36,248 ) (53,333 ) Foreign exchange gains / (losses), net 260 (7 ) (1,544 ) 1,172 Income tax (expense) / benefit (2,547 ) 1,891 (4,358 ) 2,789 Net income/(loss) 15,997 (28,6 35 ) 51,929 (29,290 ) Less (loss)/income attributable to non-controlling interest (28 ) (26 ) 58 17 Net income/(loss) attributable to AMPNI shareholders $ 16, 025 $ (28,609 ) $ 51,871 $ (29,307 ) Basic earnings/(losses) per share (U.S. dollars) $ 0. 41 $ (0.70 ) $ 1.11 $ (0. 76 ) Diluted earnings/(losses) per share (U.S. dollars) $ 0. 41 $ (0.70 ) $ 1.11 $ (0. 76 ) EBITDA (1) $ 32,458 $ (8,785 ) $ 125,610 $ 52,519 Other Financial Data: Gross spread on marine petroleum products (2) $ 84,068 $ 54,922 $ 326,100 $ 265,157 Gross spread on lubricants (2) 792 442 3,671 2,527 Gross spread on marine fuel (2) 83,276 54,480 322,429 262,630 Gross spread per metric ton of marine\nfuel sold (U.S. dollars) (2) 21.1 15.5 19.5 15.8 Net cash used in operating activities $ (32,817 ) $ (120,255 ) $ (47,615 ) $ (183,410 ) Net cash used in investing activities (3,987 ) (8,970 ) (3,788 ) (12,062 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 73,091 124,586 5,763 172,885 Sales Volume Data (Metric Tons): (3) Total sales volumes 3,954,700 3,511,023 16,519,079 16,575,404 Other Operating Data: Number of owned bunkering tankers, end of period (4) 45.0 45.0 45.0 45.0 Average number of owned bunkering tankers (4)(5) 45.0 45.0 47.1 45.0 Special Purpose Vessels, end of period (6) 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Number of operating storage facilities, end of period (7) 13.0 15.0 13.0 15.0\nSummary Consolidated Financial and Other Data (Unaudited)\nAs of\nDecember 31,\n2016 As of\nDecember 31,\n2017 (in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nunless otherwise stated) Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents 93,836 71,079 Gross trade receivables 512,398 638,037 Allowance for doubtful accounts (8,647 ) (11,179 ) Inventories 187,766 283,922 Current assets 909,252 1,081,093 Total assets 1,600,933 1,766,203 Trade payables 131,584 125,262 Total debt 817,631 1,007,896 Total liabilities 1,011,342 1,188,365 Total stockholder’s equity 589,591 577,838 Working capital excluding cash and debt (8) 629,370 831,909 Notes:\nEBITDA represents net income/loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that recorded by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, vessel and investment impairments, gains/losses on vessel disposals and other non-recurring exceptional items.\nAdjusted EBITDA per metric ton of marine fuel sold represents the net income/loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, vessel and investment impairments, gains/losses on vessel disposals and other non-recurring exceptional items the Company generates per metric ton of marine fuel sold. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA per metric ton of marine fuel sold by dividing the EBITDA by the sales volume of marine fuel. Marine fuel sales do not include sales of lubricants.\nAdjusted net income/loss attributable to AMPNI shareholders represents the net income/loss before vessel and investment impairments, gains/losses on vessel disposals and other non-recurring exceptional items.\nThese non-GAAP measures are presented in this press release as the Company believes that it provides investors with a means of evaluating and understanding how Aegean’s management evaluates operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income/(loss) attributable to AMPNI to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per metric ton of marine fuel sold for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, For the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 20 1 6 20 1 7 201 6 201 7 (in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nunless otherwise stated) Net income/(loss) to AMPNI shareholders 16,025 (28,609 ) 51,871 (29,307 ) Add: Net financing cost including amortization\nof financing costs 6,091 13,742 36,248 53,333 Add: Income tax expense/(benefit) 2,547 (1,891 ) 4,358 (2,789 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization excluding amortization\nof financing costs 7,795 7,973 33,133 31,282 EBITDA 32,458 (8,785 ) 125,610 52,519 Add: Loss on sale of vessels - - 6,312 (94 ) Add: Vessel impairment charge - 2,648 - 2,648 Add: Accelerated Shares - 4,786 3,230 4,786 Adjusted EBITDA 32,458 (1,351 ) 135,152 59,859 Sales volume of marine fuel (metric tons) 3,954,700 3,511,023 16,519,079 16,575,404 Adjusted EBITDA per metric ton of marine\nfuel sold (U.S. dollars) 8.21 (0.38 ) 8.18 3.61 The following table reconciles net income/(loss) attributable to AMPNI to Adjusted Net Income/Loss for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, For the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 20 1 6 20 1 7 201 6 201 7 (in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nunless otherwise stated) Net income/(loss) to AMPNI shareholders 16,025 (28,609 ) 51,871 (29,307 ) Add: Loss on sale of vessels - - 6,312 (94 ) Add: Vessel impairment charge - 2,648 - 2,648 Add: Accelerated Shares - 4,786 3,230 4,786 Add: Accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees - 1,533 - 1,533 Adjusted net income/(loss) to AMPNI shareholders 16,025 (19,642 ) 61,413 (20,434 ) Gross spread on marine petroleum products represents the margin the Company generates on sales of marine fuel and lubricants. Gross spread on marine fuel represents the margin that the Company generates on sales of various classifications of marine fuel oil (\"MFO\") or marine gas oil (\"MGO\"). Gross spread on lubricants represents the margin that the Company generates on sales of lubricants. Gross spread on marine petroleum products, gross spread of MFO and gross spread on lubricants are not items recognized by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit or any other indicator of a Company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of gross spread may not be the same as that used by other companies in the same or other industries. The Company calculates the above-mentioned gross spreads by subtracting from the sales of the respective marine petroleum product the cost of the respective marine petroleum product sold and cargo transportation costs. For arrangements in which the Company physically supplies the respective marine petroleum product using its bunkering tankers, costs of the respective marine petroleum products sold represents amounts paid by the Company for the respective marine petroleum product sold in the relevant reporting period. For arrangements in which the respective marine petroleum product is purchased from the Company's related company, Aegean Oil S.A., cost of the respective marine petroleum products sold represents the total amount paid by the Company to the physical supplier for the respective marine petroleum product and its delivery to the custom arrangements, in which the Company purchases cargos of marine fuel for its floating storage facilities. Transportation costs may be included in the purchase price of marine fuels from the supplier or may be incurred separately from a transportation provider. Gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold represents the margin the Company generates per metric ton of marine fuel sold. The Company calculates gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold by dividing the gross spread on marine fuel by the sales volume of marine fuel. Marine fuel sales do not include sales of lubricants. The following table reflects the calculation of gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, For the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 20 16 20 1 7 201 6 201 7 (in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nunless otherwise stated) Sales of marine petroleum products 1,175,578 1,348,534 3,996,642 5,599,658 Less: Cost of marine petroleum products sold (1,091,510 ) (1,293,612 ) (3,670,542 ) (5,334,501 ) Gross spread on marine petroleum products 84,068 54,922 326,100 265,157 Less: Gross spread on lubricants (792 ) (442 ) (3,671 ) (2,527 ) Gross spread on marine fuel 83,276 54,480 322,429 262,630 Sales volume of marine fuel (metric tons) 3,954,700 3,511,023 16,519,079 16,575,404 Gross spread per metric ton of marine\nfuel sold (U.S. dollars) 21.1 15.5 19.5 15.8 Sales volume of marine fuel is the volume of sales of various classifications of MFO and MGO for the relevant period and is denominated in metric tons. The Company does not include the sales volume of lubricants in the calculation of gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold.\nBunkering fleet comprises both bunkering vessels and barges.\nFigure represents average bunkering fleet number for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each bunkering tanker or barge was used as part of the fleet during the period divided by the cumulative number of calendar days in the period multiplied by the number of bunkering tankers at the end of the period. This figure does not take into account non-operating days due to either scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.\nSpecial Purpose Vessels consists of the Orion, a 550 dwt tanker which is based in our Greek market.\nThe Company owns three barges, the Mediterranean, Umnenga and Umnenga I, as floating storage facilities in Greece and South Africa. The Company also operates on-land storage facilities in Las Palmas, Fujairah, Tangiers, the U.S.A. and Hamburg.\nThe ownership of storage facilities allows the Company to mitigate its risk of supply shortages. Generally, storage costs are included in the price of refined marine fuel Quote: d by local suppliers. The Company expects that the ownership of storage facilities will allow it to convert the variable costs of this storage fee mark-up per metric ton Quote: d by suppliers into fixed costs of operating its owned storage facilities, thus enabling the Company to spread larger sales volumes over a fixed cost base and to decrease its refined fuel costs. Working capital excluding cash and debt is defined as current assets minus cash and cash equivalents minus restricted cash minus current liabilities plus short-term borrowings plus current portion of long-term debt.\nNet income as adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation, provision for doubtful accounts, share-based compensation, amortization, deferred income taxes, gain/loss on sale of vessels, impairment losses, unrealized loss/(gain) on derivatives and unrealized foreign exchange loss/(gain), net, is used to assist in evaluating our ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Net income as adjusted for non-cash items is not recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator of the Company's performance required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The following table reflects the calculation of net income/(loss) as adjusted for non-cash items for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, For the Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 20 1 6 20 1 7 201 6 201 7 (in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nunless otherwise stated) Net income/(loss) 15,997 (28,635 ) 51,929 (29,290 ) Add: Depreciation 6,001 6,004 24,941 23,762 Add: Provision for doubtful accounts 2,433 672 3,624 2,532 Add: Share based compensation 1,990 8,154 12,229 16,865 Add: Amortization 4,731 6,750 18,417 21,756 Add: Net deferred tax expense / (benefit) 2,108 (8,415 ) 1,437 (4,180 ) Add: Unrealized loss / (gain) on derivatives (4,007 ) (632 ) 29,445 (5,248 ) Add: Loss / (gain) on sale of vessels - - 6,312 (94 ) Add: Vessel impairment charge - 2,648 - 2,648 Add: Unrealized foreign exchange (gain)/loss (809 ) 680 (678 ) 612 Net income/(loss) as adjusted for non-cash items 28,444 (12,774 ) 147,660 29,363 Fourth Quarter 2017 Dividend Announcement\nOn March 7, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2017 dividend of $0.01 per share payable on or about April 4, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 21, 2018.

Although we believe that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.\nIn addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include our ability to manage growth, our ability to maintain our business in light of our proposed business and location expansion or other changes in our business, our ability to obtain double hull secondhand bunkering tankers, the outcome of legal, tax or regulatory proceedings to which we may become a party, adverse conditions in the shipping or the marine fuel supply industries, our ability to retain our key suppliers and key customers, material disruptions in the availability or supply of crude oil or refined petroleum products, changes in the market price of petroleum, including the volatility of spot pricing, increased levels of competition, compliance or lack of compliance with various environmental and other applicable laws and regulations, our ability to collect accounts receivable, changes in the political, economic or regulatory conditions in the markets in which we operate, and the world in general, our failure to hedge certain financial risks associated with our business, our ability to maintain our current tax treatments and our failure to comply with restrictions in our credit agreements and other factors. Please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties.\nCONTACTS:\nCompany\nAegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc.\nTel. +1-212-430-1098\nEmail: investor@ampni.com\nInvestor Relations / Media Advisor\nNicolas Bornozis / Daniela Guerrero\nCapital Link, Inc.\nTel. +1-212-661-7566\nEmail: aegean@capitallink.com\nSource:Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3yWpxAO5Np7C7mpVShnayk6ahDFdxh64YogrbfLVFxwIjUJO2SQ0CFjEMUlqdos66vturFToIfUbSOxwML06eA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5c051282-b161-4d5a-acd8-49f6344c490b", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2NHrjfMCdQnOYadpBkB06JPoO0NSa0Alf_K0UOZRrtCsIAjAUEXK0WRdhIj4RBubOvDLKKQTPHRs8MXhuw6a9w=="], "published": "2018-03-08T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T03:26:39.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
