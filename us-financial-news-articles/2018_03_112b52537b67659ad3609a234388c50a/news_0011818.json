ExxonMobil/Handout via REUTERS Here are five facts about one of the world’s most remote and challenging liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate production and export facilities.\nREMOTE LOCATION The Papua New Guinea LNG (PNG LNG) project opened in 2014 in the South Pacific country, one of Asia’s poorest and most politically troubled despite its resource wealth.\nThe main processing facility, the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant, sits in the rugged highlands of Hela Province and handles up to 1 billion cubic feet of gas daily from eight wells.\nThe site’s remote location required chartering huge Russian Antonov cargo planes to deliver equipment to a jungle airfield at Komo, the longest airstrip in Papua New Guinea.\nHides is linked by a 700-km (435 miles) pipeline snaking through the jungle to the LNG plant and export terminal near the capital city Port Moresby.\n(GRAPHIC: Papua New Guinea quake IMG, tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR )\nQUAKE DAMAGE A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck near the Hides facility on Feb. 25, killing dozens of people and knocking out production. The quake damaged power infrastructure and the Komo airfield.\nBefore it can restart the facility, Exxon will inspect the pipeline and check the gas field for structural damage.\nThe ExxonMobil Hides Gas Conditioning Plant process area is seen in Papua New Guinea in this handout photo dated March 1, 2018. ExxonMobil/Handout via REUTERS The export facility near Port Moresby, where the gas is liquefied for shipment on tankers, was not damaged, Exxon has said.\nPRICE TAG Exxon’s main partners in the project are currently Australia’s Oil Search and Santos.\nIn 2012, Exxon blamed unfavorable foreign exchange rates and delays caused by disgruntled workers and landowners for a $3.3 billion spike in costs, raising the price tag to $19 billion.\nHowever, Exxon stunned markets when it completed the project in 2014, ahead of schedule and producing at up to 25 percent above its annual 6.9 million tonnes nameplate capacity.\nTROUBLED PAST Not all has gone smoothly for Exxon in Papua New Guinea.\nIn November 2017, the company evacuated some staff and suspended“non-essential work” due to unrest in Hela Province. The violence was linked to national elections and disputes over royalties from the PNG LNG project.\nIn 2012, a landslide near a quarry used by Exxon killed at least 25 people and raised questions about the safety of excavations. Exxon said it had closed the quarry five months before the landslide.\nBIGGER FUTURE Only days before the Feb. 25 quake, Exxon said it had agreed to plans with French energy major Total to double capacity at PNG LNG at an estimated cost of $13 billion.\nIt was not clear if the quake had affected those plans.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Darren Schuettler and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:35:09.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
