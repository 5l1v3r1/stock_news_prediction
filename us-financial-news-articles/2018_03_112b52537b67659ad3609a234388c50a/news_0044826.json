Management will discuss the Company's results summarized below on a conference call on Tuesday, March 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nSummary financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nTotal investment income: $2.6 million, or $0.13 per share\nNet investment income: $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share\nNet realized and unrealized gains: $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share\nNet asset value: $47.8 million, or $2.37 per share (vs. $2.34 per share at September 30, 2017)\nFull realization of two OHA portfolio investments: $14.8 million\nFair value of portfolio investments: $64.9 million (1)\nPortfolio Activity - Three months ended December 31, 2017\nThe fair value of our investment portfolio was $64.9 million at December 31, 2017, decreasing 17.5% compared to September 30, 2017 and 38.2% compared to December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had realizations totaling $14.9 million and made no new investments. The concentration of our investment portfolio in the energy sector decreased to 13% at December 31, 2017, compared to 38% at December 31, 2016. The current weighted average yield of our portfolio based on the cost and fair value of our yielding investments was 13.2% and 14.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017.\nRealizations during the quarter totaled $14.9 million which consisted of the full repayment of two of our portfolio investments made under OHA: (i) Appriss Holdings, Inc's, second lien term loan in the amount of $9.3 million; and (ii) Royal Holdings, Inc.'s second lien term loan in the amount of $5.5 million, and $0.1 million of amortization on existing portfolio investments. Our investment in Appriss was initiated in November 2014 and generated an unlevered gross internal rate of return of 10.9% and a return on investment of 1.26x. Our investment in Royal was initiated in June 2015 and generated an unlevered gross internal rate of return of 9.6% and return on investment of 1.19x.\nSubsequent to year end, our energy exposure was reduced to 0% as a result of the full redemption of our $11.5 million investment in the unsecured notes of Talos Production, LLC (\"Talos\"), at par, on February 15, 2018. The redemption was $2.9 million, or $0.14 per share, greater than Talos' fair value of $8.6 million (marked at 75% of par) at December 31, 2017. This legacy energy investment was initiated in February 2013 and generated an unlevered gross internal rate of return of 9.95% and a return on investment of 1.30x.\nOperating Results - Three months ended December 31, 2017\nInvestment income totaled $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, decreasing 35.8% compared to $4.0 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease in investment income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily as a result of a decrease in average portfolio investment balance, lower weighted average yield on investment portfolio, Castex Energy 2005, LP, (\"Castex\") being placed on non-accrual in January 2017 and lower production payments on our investment in ATP Oil & Gas limited term royalty interest (\"ATP\"). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized $828 thousand and $371 thousand of income related to our investments in Castex and ATP, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we did not recognize any income related to these two investments.\nOperating expenses, net of incentive fee waiver, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.3 million, decreasing 8.7%, compared to $2.4 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower base management fees in 2017 and a reversal of incentive fees in 2017, partially offset by higher professional fees. Management fees in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.2 million lower than in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of lower average asset base subject to the base management fee. The decrease in expenses were partially offset by $0.1 million increase in professional fees driven by higher legal costs in 2017 associated with our investment in Castex. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 included an $89,000 fee waiver for incentive fees. On November 10, 2017, we entered into an Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement with OHA whereby OHA agreed to waive any incentive fees earned relating to fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Under the Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement, any capital gains fees that would have been earned and accrued during 2017 and 2018, which under our investment advisory agreement would not have been paid until 2018 and 2019, respectively, will be waived.\nResulting net investment income was $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.08 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe recorded net realized and unrealized gains on investments totaling $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12.9 million, or $0.64 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a tax benefit of $0.6 million, or $0.03 per share, related to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"Jobs Act\") that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $0.6 million of AMT credits were generated between the years 2008 and 2012 related to realized losses of certain legacy portfolio investments. Prior to the Jobs Act, we had a full valuation allowance against the AMT credits.\nOverall, we experienced a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. After declaring a quarterly dividend during the period of $0.02 per share, our net asset value increased 1.3%, from $2.34 per share as of September 30, 2017 to $2.37 per share as of December 31, 2017.\nIn February 2018, we exercised our option to extend our credit facility with Midcap through September 9, 2018.\nOperating Results - Year ended December 31, 2017\nInvestment income totaled $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreasing 42.6% compared to $17.9 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a lower average investment balance from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, placement of our investment in Castex on non-accrual in January 2017 and lower production payments from our investment in ATP/Bennu.\nOperating expenses, net of incentive fee waiver, in 2017 totaled $9.2 million, decreasing 18.9%, compared to $11.4 million in 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower base management and incentive fees, partially offset by higher interest expense and bank fees and professional fees. Management fees decreased 40.0% to $1.9 million from $3.2 million due to lower incentive fees incurred in 2016, $89,000 incentive fee waiver in 2017 and lower average asset base subject to the base management fee during 2016. The increase in professional fees is attributable to higher legal expenses related to our investment in Castex.\nResulting net investment income for 2017 was $1.0 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $6.5 million, or $0.32 per share, of net investment income in 2016.\nWe recorded net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $32.1 million, or $1.59 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $31.9 million, or $1.58 per share, in 2016. Our investment in Castex, a legacy energy related portfolio company, contributed $33.5 million, or $1.66 per share of the net realized and unrealized losses in 2017.\nOverall, we experienced a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $31.1 million, or $1.54 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, and after declaring dividends during the year of $0.08 per share, our net asset value decreased to $2.37 per share as of December 31, 2017 from $3.99 per share as of December 31, 2016.\nReview of Strategic Alternatives\nAs previously discussed on our November 14, 2017 earnings call, OHAI’s Board of Directors has decided to explore a variety of options that could provide more scale to OHAI. These options could include, among other things, raising additional capital, a merger or joint venture with another party, the acquisition of existing investment portfolios, or other strategic transactions. To assist OHAI in this process, the Board has retained Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (\"KBW\") as its financial advisor and investment banker. While we are actively working with KBW to explore these options and committed to taking actions that we believe will maximize shareholder value, there is no assurance that the Company will execute on any of them. No specific timetable or formal process has been set and OHAI does not expect to comment further or periodically provide updates to the market with additional information unless and until the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or otherwise deems disclosure appropriate or necessary.\nWebcast / Conference Call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 27, 2018\nWe invite all interested persons to participate in our conference call on Tuesday, March 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
