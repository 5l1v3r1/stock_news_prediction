They have now poached three writers and an editor from The Onion to work on the project, says The Daily Beast.\n\"We can confirm that we have learned nothing from prevailing trends in media and are launching a brand-new comedy project,\" Bolton and Berkley told The Daily Beast in a statement, though they said nothing about Musk in particular.\nMusk will have no direct oversight with the project, nor will he be involved on a daily basis, says The Daily Beast, citing unnamed sources.\nIt's not the first time the serial entrepreneur has show interest in The Onion.\nIn a 2017 Rolling Stone feature about Musk, he expressed respect for the publication.\n\"In order to understand the essential truth of things,\" Musk told Rolling Stone , \"I think you can find it in The Onion and occasionally on Reddit.\"\nAnd The Onion has also had its fun with Musk. In February a satirical headline read, \"Elon Musk offering $1.2 billion in grants to any project that promises to make him feel complete.\"\nWrote The Onion in Musk's voice: \"Even after all I've accomplished in this world, there is still a gaping hole inside of me that no amount of innovation or entrepreneurship has been able to fill.... If you can prove that your venture will give me any measure of wholeness — anything, anything at all — my money is yours. All I ask in return is to feel some sense of purpose in this bleak and pointless existence.\"\nSee also: \nElon Musk announces a big change to his tunneling venture: It will 'prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars' \nElon Musk: 'Mark my words — A.I. is far more dangerous than nukes' \nTalk about customer service—Elon Musk responds to Tesla drivers' super specific questions on Twitter \nshow chapters Elon Musk's personally responding to questions and complaints from his customers      5:04 PM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 00:54 Like this story?
