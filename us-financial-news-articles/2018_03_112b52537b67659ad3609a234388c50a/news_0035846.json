But with the prospect of government regulation in the offing, Kernen reminded viewers that even the mighty can fall.\nUsing AOL as an example, it was a darling of the 1990s internet boom, with a peak market cap of $222 billion at the end of 1999. But after its disastrous 2000 merger with Time Warner and a breakup nine years later, AOL was a shadow of its former self. It was purchased by Verizon in 2015.\nStressing he's not saying Facebook will be like AOL, Kernen said only time will tell how it deals with its own problems. Facebook's latest problems surfaced with allegations that Cambridge Analytica, which worked with Donald Trump's presidential election team, misused the data of 50 million Facebook users. That's on top of revelations that Russia used the platform to try to influence the 2016 election.\nBut currently, even after Monday's stock-price decline, Facebook's market cap is worth several multiples of other well-known companies.\nIn addition to the comparison with Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and McDonald's, Facebook's stock value is greater than that combined value of Johnson & Johnson and Merck .\nFacebook is also worth more in the market than J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs combined.\nKernen also pointed out the entire defense group of General Dynamics , Lockheed Martin , Raytheon and United Technologies is not even close to a Facebook. \"You still have a [nearly] a couple of hundred billion that you could buy Boeing . But you'd need an extra $20 billion,\" he said.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
