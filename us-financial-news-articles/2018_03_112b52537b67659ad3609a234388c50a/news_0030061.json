(Nasdaq:NATR), a leading natural health and wellness company engaged in the manufacture and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. At this time, the Company is providing preliminary ranges for its anticipated net loss for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 pending final determination of its provision for income taxes, including the impact of U.S. tax reform, among other factors. The Company expects to file its audited financial statements on form 10-K on March 16, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\n“Our fourth quarter results reflect continued year-over-year net sales growth, driven by gains across our Synergy Worldwide markets and strong growth in our NSP business in Russia, Central and Eastern Europe,” commented Gregory L. Probert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe the disruptions to our North America business as a result of a new ERP system deployed in April 2017 are now behind us, but we have additional work to do to re-energize the market. We posted growth in China and continue to emphasize expanding our direct selling efforts in this market with the goal of building a long-term profitable new market. Consistent with our initiative to evaluate our cost structure through a review of our direct and indirect costs, during the fourth quarter we took some actions to reduce SG&A, which led to some non-recurring restructuring and severance costs during the period. Our focus will continue to be to support and grow our business while matching our organizational structure to our business outlook in order to enhance profitability and shareholder value.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet sales of $88.3 million increased 5.2 percent, compared to $84.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a local currency basis, net sales increased 3.8 percent as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. NSP China net sales increased 200.3 percent, compared to the same period in 2016. Synergy WorldWide net sales increased 3.6 percent compared to the same period in 2016 (or 0.4 percent in local currencies). NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe net sales increased 7.9 percent compared to the same period in 2016. NSP Americas net sales decreased 4.9 percent compared to the same period in 2016 (or 5.1 percent in local currencies). Net sales were impacted by $1.2 million of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe Company began the initial implementation of its Oracle ERP system on April 2, 2017, for the Company’s NSP Americas segment as well other corporate operations. The implementation of Oracle ERP negatively impacted net sales and profitability during the nine months ended December 31, 2017, primarily by causing wait times for calls into the Company's call center to be longer than usual and by causing difficulties within the Company's on-line product ordering system. While the Company has addressed these issues, customer attrition rates increased. The Company currently expects net loss attributable to common shareholders to be between $17.0 and $18.0 million, or $0.90 to $0.95 per common share, compared to a net loss of $6.7 million attributable to common shareholders, or $0.35 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The anticipated fourth quarter net loss expressed above is preliminary and subject to final determination of the Company’s provision for income taxes, including the impact of U.S. tax reform, among other factors. The net loss range includes an estimated $14.0 to $15.0 million, or $0.74 to $0.79 per common share, non-cash re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to U.S. tax reform.\nThe Company's net loss in China attributable to common shareholders was approximately $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million, compared to $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation expense and other income/expense.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet sales of $342.0 million increased 0.3 percent, compared to $341.2 million in 2016. On a local currency basis, net sales decreased 0.2 percent as compared to 2016. NSP China net sales increased approximately 91.4 percent compared to the same period in 2016. NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe net sales increased approximately 7.3 percent compared to the same period in 2016. NSP Americas net sales decreased approximately 5.6 percent compared to the same period in 2016 (or 5.7 percent in local currencies). Synergy WorldWide net sales decreased approximately 0.8 percent compared to the same period in 2016 (or 1.7 percent in local currencies). The weakening of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies resulted in an approximate 0.5 percent or $1.6 million increase in net sales during the year.\nThe Company currently expects net loss attributable to common shareholders to be between $12.5 and $13.5 million, or $0.66 to $0.71 per common share, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted common share, in 2016. The anticipated 2017 net loss expressed above is preliminary and subject to final determination of the Company’s provision for income taxes, including the impact of U.S. tax reform, among other factors. The net loss range includes an estimated $14.0 to $15.0 million, or $0.74 to $0.79 per common share, non-cash re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to U.S. tax reform.\nThe Company's net loss in China attributable to common shareholders was approximately $0.18 per share for 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $12.2 million compared to $18.1 million in 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 and 2016 Regional Sales by Operating Segment\nNet Sales by Operating Segment Three\nMonths\nEnded\nDecember\n31, 2017 Three\nMonths\nEnded\nDecember\n31, 2016 Percent\nChange Impact of\nCurrency\nExchange Percent\nChange\nExcluding\nImpact of\nCurrency NSP Americas: NSP North America $ 34,273 $ 35,824 (4.3 )% $ 131 (4.7 )% NSP Latin America 6,377 6,930 (8.0 )% (57 ) (7.2 )% 40,650\n42,754\n0 (4.9 )% 74 (5.1 )% NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe 8,904 8,250 7.9 % 135 6.3 % Synergy WorldWide: Synergy Asia Pacific 23,448 22,843 2.6 % 472 0.6 % Synergy Europe 5,583 5,227 6.8 % 504 (2.8 )% Synergy North America 2,656 2,530 5.0 % — 5.0 % 31,687 30,600 3.6 % 976 0.4 % NSP China 7,045 2,346 200.3 % — 200.3 % $ 88,286 $ 83,950 5.2 % $ 1,185 3.8 % Full Year 2017 and 2016 Regional Sales by Operating Segment\nNet Sales by Operating Segment Year Ended\nDecember\n31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember\n31, 2016 Percent\nChange Impact of\nCurrency\nExchange Percent\nChange\nExcluding\nImpact of\nCurrency NSP Americas: NSP North America $ 140,405 $ 148,048 (5.2 )% $ 213 (5.3 )% NSP Latin America 25,612 27,874 (8.1 )% (15 ) (8.1 )% 166,017 175,922 (5.6 )% 198 (5.7 )% NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe 32,190 29,998 7.3 % 197 6.7 % Synergy WorldWide: Synergy Asia Pacific 89,329 89,694 (0.4 )% 743 (1.2 )% Synergy Europe 23,529 24,328 (3.3 )% 455 (5.2 )% Synergy North America 10,975 10,771 1.9 % — 1.9 % 123,833 124,793 (0.8 )% 1,198 (1.7 )% NSP China 19,989 10,446 91.4 % — 91.4 % $ 342,029 $ 341,159 0.3 % $ 1,593 (0.2 )% Active Distributors and Customers by Segment as of December 31 (1)\n2017 2016 Distributors\n& Customers Managers Distributors\n& Customers Managers NSP Americas 106,900 5,600 121,200 6,400 NSP Russia, Central and Eastern Europe 68,600 3,200 66,700 2,800 Synergy WorldWide 55,400 4,200 53,600 3,700 Total 230,900 13,000 241,500 12,900 (1) Active Distributors and customers include Nature’s Sunshine Products’ independent Distributors and customers who have purchased products directly from the Company for resale and/or personal consumption during the previous three months ended as of the date indicated.

Except as is required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has included information which has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as information concerning Adjusted EBITDA and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Management utilizes the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of its operations and believes that this measure is a useful indicator of the Company’s ability to fund its business. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, U.S. GAAP net income (loss) as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nIn addition, the Company believes presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of its foreign operations from period to period. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOther companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of Nature’s Sunshine Products’ performance in relation to other companies. The Company has included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, in the attached financial tables.\nNATURE’S SUNSHINE PRODUCTS, INC.
