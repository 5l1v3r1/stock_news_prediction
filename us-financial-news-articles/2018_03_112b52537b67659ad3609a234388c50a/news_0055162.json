REUTERS/Benoit Tessier Currently a company taking over a another firm has to acquire 95 percent of its shares and voting rights before its offer becomes obligatory for minority shareholders.\nThe lower squeeze-out threshold would bring France more in line with other European countries. It is one among a series of measures in a new wide-ranging corporate law being drafted that aims in part at making it easier for companies to raise capital.\nWith initial public offerings down by nearly half over the last decade, the government also wants to make it easier for small and mid-sized companies to sell shares on equities market.\nThe law, which is due to go to parliament in early May, would allow companies with annual revenues of less than eight million euros to file simplified IPO documentation rather than a full-blown prospectus.\nReporting by Yann Le Guernigou; writing by Leigh Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:12:36.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
