It goes without saying because uncertainty is really challenging us very much and not only us, it’s for the complete industry.\n“You hardly see inward investment any more or every decision is taking longer from every faculty. Therefore it would be ... appropriate to get more information about these kinds of deals.” (Editing by Stephen Addison)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T12:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T12:52:21.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
