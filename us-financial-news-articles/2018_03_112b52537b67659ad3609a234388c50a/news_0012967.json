But the restart of some mines and a sudden increase in stocks have taken some air out of the rally in the past two weeks.\nIf Trump levies a 25 percent tariff on steel, that could help Nexa over a six-month to one-year period, he added.\nIf U.S. domestic steel production increases, zinc, which is used to rust-proof steel, would likely come from nearby Mexico, he said. In turn, that would allow Nexa to sell more of its zinc in Latin America, where it is produced, at lower freight charges and better margins.\nThe company, currently facing a strike at its Cajamarquilla zinc smelter, expects to resolve the situation in the next 24 to 48 hours, he added. Some 300 unionized workers walked off the job on Monday, but production has not been impacted, he said.\nReporting by Susan Taylor; Additional reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:56:12.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
