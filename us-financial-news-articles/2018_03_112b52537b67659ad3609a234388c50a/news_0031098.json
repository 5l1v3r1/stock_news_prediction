Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Wales vs France - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - March 17, 2018 Wales head coach Warren Gatland before the match REUTERS/Rebecca Naden Wales finished runners-up behind Ireland after beating France 14-13 in Saturday’s finale, an “ugly win” but one that helped them finish ahead of Les Bleus and England. Wales defended ferociously around the impressive Alun Wyn Jones, who was back in the starting line-up after being rested last weekend for the game against Italy. “We have got something to build on ... Some of the depth we have created in the squad is pleasing,” said Gatland, who had made seven changes to his team.

I’d like to think that we have developed more strength in depth than we had at the beginning of the Six Nations.” “It is a tough competition to win or finish second (in) and we are pleased with where we are at the moment,” said Gatland.
