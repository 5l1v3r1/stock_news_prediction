Nearly $50 billion of market value was wiped out in two days.\nFacebook and Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.\nPrice accused Facebook and London-based Cambridge Analytica of negligence and violating a California unfair competition law.\nShe said the harvesting contravened Facebook's privacy policy, in which the Menlo Park, California-based company said user trust was \"important to us\" and that it would not share information without permission and notice.\n\"Our client saw a tremendous uptick in political messaging during the campaign on her Facebook page, which she had never seen,\" Yanchunis said. \"She had a glimmer of understanding at the time, but now sees there was an attempt to influence her vote.\"\nThe complaint seeks unspecified damages, including possible punitive damages.\nYanchunis, who has also been suing Verizon Communications Inc over data breaches at its Yahoo Internet business affecting 3 billion accounts, said it should be a \"fairly easy exercise\" to identify potential Facebook class members.\nHe said cybersecurity experts can assist with the case, and that Facebook \"leaves a footprint of what was taken that cannot be erased.\"\nThe case is Price v Facebook Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-01732. The shareholder case is Yuan v Facebook Inc et al in the same court, No. 18-01725.
