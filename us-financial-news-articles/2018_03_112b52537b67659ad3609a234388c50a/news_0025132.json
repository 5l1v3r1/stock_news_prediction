The increase in payrolls last month was the biggest since July 2016.\nBut the average hourly earnings, a closely watched inflation metric, edged up four cents, or just 0.1 percent, to $26.75 in February, a slowdown from the 0.3 percent rise in January. That lowered the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in January.\nU.S. benchmark 10-year yields hit session highs of 2.903 percent, up from Thursday’s 2.866 percent.\nU.S. 30-year yields also touched the day’s peaks at 3.171 percent, compared with 3.132 percent late on Thursday.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:00:37.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
