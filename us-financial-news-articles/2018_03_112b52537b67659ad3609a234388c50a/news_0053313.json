The conflict flared up again in 2016 and saw a number of deadly incidents over the past year.\n“Our colleagues were killed while working to make the land safe for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh,” The Halo Trust, a Scottish charity that has cleared minefields worldwide and was once sponsored by the late Princess Diana, said in a social media post.\nThe breakaway region’s self-proclaimed foreign ministry confirmed the incident. Karabakh authorities said the staff who were killed were locals.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Andrey Ostroukh\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:24:29.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
