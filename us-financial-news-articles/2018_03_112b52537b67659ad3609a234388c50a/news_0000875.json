Building on our 2015 decision to not sell modern sporting rifles, we announced important changes today:- Raising the age for purchase of firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21 years old- Removing online items resembling assault-style rifles — Walmart (@Walmart) February 28, 2018 \nWalmart, which sells rifles, shotguns and ammunition in thousands of its stores, had stopped sales of assault-style rifles in 2015. Earlier on Wednesday , Dick’s DKS, +0.69% said it would stop selling assault-style rifles at its Field & Stream chain, which has 35 locations. \nRead: Gun maker stocks fall after Dick’s Sporting Goods takes a stand \nCalls to ban high-capacity firearms and raise the minimum age to buy a firearm have been partly rekindled by students and survivors of the mass shooting in Florida. The policy changes come at a time that U.S. firearm sales have cooled. Under current law, licensed gun dealers can sell a handgun to someone 21 years old and sell a rifle to someone who is 18. President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have expressed support for raising the age limit for rifle sales, but the National Rifle Association has rejected any such move as a violation of the Second Amendment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T02:35:41.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
