(NASDAQ:CYCC) (NASDAQ:CYCCP) (\"Cyclacel\" or the \"Company\") a biopharmaceutical company developing oral therapies that target the various phases of cell cycle control for the treatment of cancer and other serious disorders, today reported its financial results and business highlights for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's net loss applicable to common shareholders for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.1 million and $14.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.9 million.\n“We are greatly encouraged by our clinical progress in 2017, particularly in our transcriptional regulation program with CYC065, our lead CDK inhibitor candidate,” said Spiro Rombotis, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cyclacel. “We have achieved clinical proof of mechanism with CYC065 by demonstrating durable reduction of Mcl-1 expression in Phase 1 patients for at least 24 hours after a single dose. We believe these unprecedented findings provide a strong rationale for evaluating CYC065 in combination with venetoclax in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and neuroblastoma, a predominantly pediatric cancer with poor prognosis. In collaboration with an academic center and a pharmaceutical company we have developed a protocol for a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial to evaluate combination treatment of an approved PARP inhibitor and sapacitabine in patients with BRCA mutant breast cancer. We have also completed analysis of the results from the SEAMLESS Phase 3 study of sapacitabine and plan to discuss the data with regulatory authorities. Finally, we improved our cash resources raising $14.9 million, net of expenses, which will fund currently planned programs through the first quarter of 2020. We look forward to reporting our progress during the remainder of 2018, including clinical data from our studies as they arise, such as the previously announced, oral presentation of Phase 1 data with CYC065 at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2018 Annual Meeting.”\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year Highlights\nDrug Development\nTranscriptional Regulation Program: CYC065 CDK Inhibitor\nIn part 1 of an ongoing, first-in-human, single agent, ascending dose, Phase 1 study, prolonged reduction of Mcl-1 was observed in 11 out of 13 evaluable patients treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, following a single dose of CYC065, which was generally well tolerated. Preliminary anticancer activity was observed in 5 patients, of which 4 were treated at the RP2D and 3 were reported by investigators to have molecular features of their cancers associated with CYC065’s mechanism of action, including amplification of Mcl-1, MYC or cyclin E. The trial is being conducted at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Part 2 of the Phase 1 translational study will evaluate additional dosing schedules in patients with advanced solid tumors, in particular those with amplification of Mcl-1, MYC or cyclin E, including subsets of high grade serous ovarian and uterine cancers. Several biomarkers relevant to CYC065’s mechanism of action will be assessed.\nThe protocol for the Phase 1b study of a combination regimen of CYC065 and venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration or FDA. The study will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the combination, including biomarkers related to the mechanism of action of CYC065.\nDiscussions with principal investigators and/or cooperative groups progressed with the objective of evaluating CYC065 in both pediatric and adult patients with solid tumors. The Company is discussing with an investigator cooperative group a potential evaluation of CYC065 in patients with neuroblastoma, a mostly pediatric, life-threatening malignancy, frequently associated with MYCN amplification.\nIn another study, to be conducted as an investigator sponsored trial, CYC065 will be evaluated in adult and pediatric patients with leukemias, including acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, and in particular those with mixed lineage leukemia rearrangements, or MLL-r.\nPreclinical data on the molecular rationale and therapeutic potential of CYC065 included an article published in the Journal of National Cancer Institute , reporting prominent antitumor activity against lung cancer cells through anaphase catastrophe, a novel, cancer specific, mechanism. CYC065 was found to be effective against lung cancer cell lines, including those with KRAS mutations. Additional preclinical data presented at the 2017 AACR Annual Meeting, demonstrated therapeutic potential of CYC065 as a targeted anticancer agent. CYC065 substantially inhibited growth, triggered apoptosis, and induced anaphase catastrophe in murine and human lung cancer cells with known high metastatic potential. This was in marked contrast to effects in immortalized pulmonary epithelial murine and human cells. CYC065 markedly inhibited migration and invasion of lung cancer cells and affected distinctive pathways involved in DNA damage response, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation and cell migration.\nDNA Damage Response (DDR) Program\nIn collaboration with an academic center and a pharmaceutical company we have developed a protocol for a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of a combination regimen of an approved PARP inhibitor and sapacitabine in patients with BRCA mutant breast cancer.\nEnrollment has been completed in an extension of part 1 of the Phase 1 study evaluating a combination regimen of sapacitabine and seliciclib, Cyclacel’s first generation CDK inhibitor, in an enriched population of approximately 20 patients with BRCA positive advanced breast cancer. An ongoing part 3 of this study is testing a revised dosing schedule in additional patients, including BRCA positive, patients with breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers.\nSEAMLESS Phase 3 Study\nData from the SEAMLESS Phase 3 study of sapacitabine in elderly patients with AML were the subject of an oral presentation in December 2017 at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting. The presentation included additional data from prespecified and exploratory analysis of subgroups that may benefit from treatment with the sapacitabine-decitabine alternating regimen. The Company believes that the subgroup results have defined a patient population for whom the sapacitabine regimen may represent an improvement over low intensity treatment by decitabine alone.\nThe Company has completed further statistical and exploratory analyses of the results from the SEAMLESS study and is preparing briefing documents for submission to regulatory authorities with the objective of determining a potential regulatory pathway for sapacitabine in AML.\nPLK1 Inhibitor; CYC140\nAt the 2017 AACR Annual Meeting, the Company presented preclinical data outlining the potential therapeutic utility of CYC140, a novel, polo-like kinase (PLK) 1 inhibitor, alone and in synergistic drug combinations, for the treatment of esophageal cancer and acute leukemia.\nInvestigator-Sponsored Trials (ISTs): Seliciclib in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)\nThe Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, for the “TRAFIC” trial sponsored by the UK Medical Research Council, (ISRCTN 36667085) determined that part 1 of the study was successfully completed per protocol. The IDMC recommended continuation of the trial into part 2 to assess potential efficacy of seliciclib as an addition to existing anti-TNF therapy based on a composite outcome of response in patients with moderate to severe RA.\nCorporate Developments\nThe Company raised net proceeds of approximately $13.7 million from an underwritten offering of common stock.\nCyclacel received notice from the European Patent Office of the grant of a European patent including claims to novel pharmaceutical formulations of sapacitabine.\n2018 Key Upcoming Business Objectives\nReport updated CYC065 Phase 1 data in patients with advanced cancers\nInitiate CYC065 Phase 1b in relapsed/refractory CLL in combination with venetoclax\nStart enrollment in the Phase 1b/2 IST of a combination regimen of an approved PARP inhibitor and sapacitabine in patients with BRCA mutant breast cancer\nStart enrollment in the Phase 1b/2 IST of CYC065 in pediatric patients with neuroblastoma\nUpdate mature data from the part 1 extension of the sapacitabine and seliciclib combination in patients with BRCA positive advanced breast and complete part 3 enrollment of the sapacitabine and seliciclib combination in patients with BRCA positive, breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers\nSubmit CYC140, PLK1 inhibitor, IND application\nConduct regulatory authority meetings regarding the SEAMLESS study of sapacitabine in AML\nFinancial Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.9 million, compared to $16.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase of $7.4 million was primarily due to net proceeds of $13.7 million from a direct registered offering, $1.0 million from the sale of common stock through the ATM sales agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co., $0.2 million warrant exercises and offset by $7.5 million of net cash used in operating activities.\nThere were no revenues for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.3 million and $0.8 million for the same period of the previous year. The revenue is related to previously awarded, UK government grants being recognized over the period to progress IND-directed preclinical development of CYC140, a novel, PLK-1 inhibitor, which was completed in November 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $0.7 million and $4.2 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $1.9 million and $9.5 million for the same periods in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reduced study and clinical supply costs associated with completion of the SEAMLESS study and 2016 expenditure related the development of CYC140.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.5 million and $5.3 million, compared to $1.5 million and $5.5 million for the same period of the previous year.\nOther income (expense), net for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.1 million and $1.0 million, compared to ($0.1) million and $0.4 million for the same period of the previous year. The increase is primarily related to income received under an Asset Purchase Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, or LTC, (formerly Invitrogen Corporation and subsequently acquired by ThermoFisher Scientific), resulting from certain assets and intellectual property sold by the Company to LTC in December 2005.\nUnited Kingdom research & tax credits were $0.2 million and $1.0 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $0.4 million and $2.0 million for the same periods in 2016.\nNet loss for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.9 million and $7.5 million compared to $2.8 million and $11.8 million for the same periods in 2016.\nConference call information:\nUS/Canada call: (877) 493-9121 / international call: (973) 582-2750\nUS/Canada archive: (800) 585-8367 / international archive: (404) 537-3406\nCode for live and archived conference call is 4857905\nFor the live and archived webcast, please visit the Corporate Presentations page on the Cyclacel website at www.cyclacel.com .
