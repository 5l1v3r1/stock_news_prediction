Stocks in the region rose 0.58 percent after closing February with a decline of over 4 percent, the largest monthly percentage drop since November 2016. Globally, emerging market stocks were little changed for the day. Markets were jittery as Powell took questions from U.S. senators two days after the newly appointed Fed chief raised speculation about increased monetary tightening in the United States in 2018. The Mexican equities benchmark IPC index rose 0.3 percent after falling 6 percent in February, its largest monthly percentage loss since September 2011. Brazil's Bovespa was up 0.7 percent. Steelmaker Gerdau rose 2.0 percent while Usiminas was down 1.5 percent as talk about potential U.S. tariffs on the metal made the rounds in Washington, with U.S. President Donald Trump set to meet with steel and aluminum executives.
