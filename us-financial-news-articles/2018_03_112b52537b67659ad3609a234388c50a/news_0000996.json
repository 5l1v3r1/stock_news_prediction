Dudley added that U.S. fiscal policy is turning“quite stimulative.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:47:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
