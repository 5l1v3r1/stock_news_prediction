SSI will continue to support the needs of HIEs and other healthcare organizations that need to aggregate and exchange patient clinical data through the CareAlign suite of products. Additionally, SSI will create new solutions derived from the integration of their administrative and clinical data services.\n“The integration of the CareAlign solutions into the SSI services platform will provide SSI the ability to expand the breadth of health information exchange services offered to our clients,” said Jimmy Lyons, CEO and President of SSI. “SSI has 30 years of experience in the development and delivery of EDI clearinghouse services to support the information exchange requirements of our revenue cycle clients. The expertise gathered from the operations of this network, which connects thousands of providers and payers daily, can be leveraged to address the growing demand for clinical data exchange.”\nJeff Miller, Chief Product Officer at SSI adds, ”Integrating clinical information with the administrative and financial data used by SSI revenue cycle solutions will be critical in responding to the changes in payment models represented by value-based reimbursement programs like MACRA.” As these models evolve, healthcare business leaders will demand solutions that can provide a more holistic view of the operational aspects impacting revenue performance.\nBen Rooks, Managing Principal of ST Advisors observed, “SSI’s been a client since 2017 and we have discussed how to grow its breadth of services. Health networks sponsored by HIEs, provider communities, and health plans can meaningfully improve patient care while lowering the costs to deliver it. This expansion into clinical data will provide SSI clients with a complete view of their patients, marrying the clinical and financial.”\nICA was headquartered in Nashville, TN, and SSI has decided to keep the office and establish a local presence. “With the concentration of healthcare in the Nashville area, it was always in our plans to open a regional office there. We look forward to growing the office and establishing a presence in Nashville,” added Mr. Lyons.\nSSI will be attending the HIMSS18 annual conference, March 5-9 in Las Vegas, Nevada, at booth #1929.
