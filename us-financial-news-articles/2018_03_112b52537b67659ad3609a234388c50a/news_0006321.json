In its first year, more than 175 corporate directors and senior executives completed the course, while an additional 135 who are enrolled in the program are progressing to complete the CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight. The in-depth online program helps directors enhance their cybersecurity literacy and strengthen their boards’ oversight practices. The course is offered in partnership with Ridge Global and Carnegie Mellon University’s CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute.\n“Corporations recognize that cyber risk isn’t just an IT challenge. It’s a strategic, enterprise-wide matter that demands active board-level engagement,” said NACD CEO Peter Gleason. “NACD, CERT, and Ridge Global are helping to close the board's knowledge gap on cyber risk with this one-of-a-kind program.”\nOver the past several years, NACD surveys of board directors have consistently revealed concerns on the part of board members about whether their companies are sufficiently prepared to respond to a cyberattack, and a desire to improve board-level cybersecurity knowledge. NACD, CERT and Ridge Global developed the Cyber-Risk Oversight Program to address these concerns. One year after the program launch, we recognize the following corporate leaders who earned the CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight:\nJennifer Addison\nRich Adduci\nLuis Aguilar\nGregory Aliff\nByron Bagby\nDavid Barnes\nAdrian Barry\nStacey Barrack\nRuth Bennett\nDennis Beresford\nKaren Bogart\nAndrea Bonime-Blanc\nOlga Botero\nSamara Braunstein\nMaureen Breakiron-Evans\nJames Brinksma\nRobert Brothers\nGregory Brown\nMarianne Brown\nJeffry Brown\nWilliam Brown\nMaryann Bruce\nRick Burdick\nSusan Cain\nKathleen Camilli\nBill Caruso\nJoseph Caruso\nKim Casey\nKent Clark\nLarry Clinton\nTodd Colvin\nJoseph Cooney\nHelen Cornell\nRick Crandall\nSamuel Crowley\nCarol Anthony Davidson\nWilliam Dawson\nGrant Deffenbaugh\nTeresa DeLuca\nNora Denzel\nMichael Devlin\nScott Diener\nKimberly Donica\nNicholas Donofrio\nJohn Dorman\nDeborah Dunie\nKathleen Dvorak\nRoxanne Dycek\nColin Eccles\nMark Ferguson\nMel Flanigan\nDhiren Fonseca\nMike Fortune\nThomas Gannett\nJerry Garcia\nNancy Gioia\nMaryann Goebel\nLinda Goodspeed\nElder Granger\nSari Greene\nJerome Greig\nRobert Greving\nWalter Grudzinski\nJerome Hauer\nRoger Hayashi\nRoger Heinen\nCharles Herman Joan Herman\nLuis Hernandez\nDaniel Hesse\nElizabeth Hight\nDaniel Hill\nAmy Hillman\nJohn Hogan\nSheila Hooda\nLacey A.

Although the core content of the Cyber-Risk Oversight program remains unchanged, the user interface has been enhanced and video introductions featuring former governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge and NACD president and CEO Peter Gleason have been added to guide participants through the modules of the program. The course details the respective responsibilities of the board and C-suite executives in cyber-risk oversight, and engages participants in an example of a cyberbreach “tabletop exercise.” The course includes a comprehensive exam that qualifies participants for the CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight.\nTo learn more and register for the NACD Cyber-Risk Oversight Program for corporate directors, visit NACD Cyber-Risk Oversight Program .\nAbout NACD\nThe National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) empowers more than 18,000 directors to lead with confidence in the boardroom.
