The case will be heard by the UEFA’s Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on May 31.\nBayern won 3-1 on Wednesday to go through to the quarter-finals 8-1 on aggregate over the two legs.\nThiago Alcantara and substitute Sandro Wagner both scored for Bayern, but the cat was voted “man of the match” in a poll on the German club’s Twitter feed.\nReporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-15T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:31:03.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
