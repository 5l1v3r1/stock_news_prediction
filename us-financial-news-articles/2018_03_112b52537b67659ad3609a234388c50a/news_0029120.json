Additionally, as rebuilding activity continues in Florida and Texas in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and more consumers show an interest in home improvement projects, contractors will be purchasing more plywood, framing lumber, insulation, siding, and other building materials. The combined operations of BlueLinx and Cedar Creek can supply builders and contractors with most, if not all, of these products.\"\nFor more information on the outlook for the US building construction industry, see the Construction Studies page featuring the following studies by The Freedonia Group:\nMoulding & Trim in the US\nHome Kitchen & Bathroom Remodeling\nSiding in the US by Material, Market, & Region, 17th Edition\nInsulation in the US by Material, Market, & Region, 12th Edition\nRoofing: US Forecasts by Product, Market, & Subregion\nSiding Distribution in the US by Channel, Market, & Type\nAbout The Freedonia Group – The Freedonia Group, a division of MarketResearch.com , is a leading international industrial research company publishing more than 100 studies annually.
