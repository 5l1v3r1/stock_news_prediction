That initially eclipsed volumes traded in the Brent May contract, before Europe's benchmark came alive around 0500 GMT.\n\"We've seen already this morning it appears to be a liquid contract from the off,\" said David Martin, JPMorgan Chase & Co's Asia Pacific head of global clearing, at an event for the launch in Shanghai.\nMartin said he expects a \"gentle\" start from abroad, though, because foreign investors have to overcome some regulatory hurdles in gaining access to the market.\nYuan-denominated trading and a blend of new rules and regulatory burdens will also likely hamper initial take-up on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), executives at a dozen banks and brokers and experts involved in the launch told Reuters.\nStill, China offers the potential for a deep, liquid market, buoyed by an explosion of interest from mom-and-pop investors that has supported its vast commodities derivative markets from apples to iron ore in Shanghai, Zhengzhou and Dalian.\nSTATE MAJORS PROVIDE LIQUIDITY\nWhat was a surprise to many was that Glencore - not a Chinese state oil major - executed Shanghai's first crude deal.\n\"Glencore's first bid reflected the high participation and enthusiasm of foreign traders for Chinese crude oil futures,\" said Yang Xidong, general manager of Xinhu Futures Co Ltd. The Switzerland-based commodities giant has an account with Xinhu.\nGlencore's early involvement was a morale boost to the fledging market, but state-controlled oil majors like PetroChina and Sinopec are expected to provide a significant amount of liquidity in the long term.\nSpeculative retail and institutional investors drove much of the launch-day's liquidity, said Chen Tong, Shanghai-based senior crude analyst at First Futures.\n\"In the short-term, we believe price fluctuations will reflect domestic crude oil supply and demand. In the long run, yuan crude price will mirror the moves of Brent,\" he said.\nThe most-active September contract opened at 440.4 yuan ($69.78) per barrel versus a reference point of 416 yuan, jumping as high as 447.1 yuan ($70.85) in the first few minutes.\nThe jump came after Brent futures for May delivery opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January on expectations OPEC-leader Saudi Arabia may extend supply cuts into 2019, as well as over concern that the United States may re-introduce sanctions against Iran.\nAt the end of the morning session, Shanghai prices were up 3.92 percent at 432.4 yuan, with 30,742 lots traded.\nBrent and WTI, in contrast, were down by that time, weighed down by concerns over a looming U.S. trade dispute with China.\nChinese exchanges count each side of a trade - the buy and the sell - as two lots, meaning the total oil changing hands was 15,371 lots, equal to 15.37 million barrels.\nFor an EXPLAINER on market concerns, click on\nFor a FACTBOX on contract details, specification, click on\n($1 = 6.3109 Chinese yuan)\n(Reporting by Josephine Mason and Meng Meng in BEIJING; Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T11:19:13.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
