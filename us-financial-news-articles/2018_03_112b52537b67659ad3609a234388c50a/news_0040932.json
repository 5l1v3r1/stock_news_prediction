Investors from Russia, China and the Middle East have poured billions into London, buying everything from luxury properties to entire companies, but the origin of some of those funds has been questioned by transparency campaigners. London property especially has attracted foreign buyers thanks to its mix of top-end apartments, luxury penthouses and gleaming skyscrapers alongside corporations who use the city as global hub.

It is unclear how much money is laundered through Britain, but the National Crime Agency has said calculations of between 36 billion pounds and 90 billion pounds are “a significant underestimate”.
