But with bond yields going up in anticipation of more hikes ..., that kind of scared the stock market again.\"\nFinancials, which benefit from a higher rate environment, briefly extended gains in the wake of the announcement but lost ground to close down 0.03 percent. Names sensitive to higher rates such as utilities, down 0.39 percent, and real estate, off 0.93 percent, were under pressure.\nStocks were choppy following the Fed announcement, as yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note moved closer to 3 percent, touching a one month high of 2.936 percent.\nStocks have struggled this year while bond yield have moved higher.\nEnergy jumped 2.63 percent and helped lift equities for a second straight session. Crude oil prices hit a six-week high after a surprise decline in U.S. inventories and as concern persisted over possible disruption to Middle East supply.\nMarkets participants are still trying to decipher the number of rate hikes this year - whether the Fed will stay at three increases as previously forecast by policy makers, or whether a fourth hike is possible.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.96 points, or 0.18 percent, to end at 24,682.31, the S&P 500 lost 5.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,711.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.02 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,345.29.\nFacebook shares gained 0.74 percent to stem its recent sell-off over the past two days, which cost the social media company about $50 billion in market value after reports of data misuse that raised broader questions about consumer privacy and the need for tougher regulation.\nThe company chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook \"made mistakes\" in a statement.\nGeneral Mills slumped 8.85 percent after the company cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher freight and commodity costs.\nThat weighed on other food companies, with Kellogg off 3.98 percent, JM Smucker down 4.20 percent and ConAgra off 2.94 percent.\nSouthwest Airlines fell 4.79 percent after the carrier cut its forecast for a key revenue metric. Other airlines also fell, with the NYSE Arca Airline index down 1.09 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.72 billion shares, compared to the 7.16 billion average over the last 20 trading days.\n(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew Editing by Nick Zieminski and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T07:00:18.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
