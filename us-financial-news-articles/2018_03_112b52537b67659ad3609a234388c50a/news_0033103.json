We introduced new capabilities with our data and database offerings, improved customer satisfaction and reduced operating costs,” commented Karen Puckett, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Progress continued into the fourth quarter; however, our revenue comparison was challenged due to exposure to several large retailers.”\n“In 2018, we will continue to focus on customer satisfaction and strive to generate additional bookings from new and existing clients, by leveraging our new capabilities, in part through our recently announced Wipro partnership,” she continued. “We believe our new data and database offerings are being well received in the marketplace and we intend to continue to make investments to support their adoption, while also focusing on cost containment throughout our business.”\n“As of year-end, we had zero debt and $8.4 million in cash. Since then, we have further improved our financial flexibility by increasing and extending the term of our undrawn credit facility, entering a strategic partnership with Wipro, reinforced by their preferred stock investment and by selling our 3Q Digital subsidiary,” stated Jon Biro, the company’s Chief Financial Officer. “With significant liquidity, we are now well positioned to invest in our business and seek new business opportunities.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nThe following table presents financial highlights of the company's continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016.\nRESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change Revenues $ 99,866 $ 110,107 (9.3 ) Operating income (loss) (33,682 ) (34,514 ) (2.4 ) Adjusted Operating Income (1) 1,673 4,438 (62.3 ) Adjusted Operating Margin (1) 1.7 % 4.0 % Net income (loss) (29,341 ) (72,891 ) (59.7 ) Earnings (loss) per share (4.73 ) (11.83 ) 60.0 Shares outstanding (weighted-average common and common equivalent shares outstanding) 6,208 6,161 0.8\n(1) See table for reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. Fourth quarter 2017 revenues were $99.9 million, compared to $110.1 million during the same quarter last year, representing a 9.3% decline. The decline was due to decreases in revenue from our retail, B2B, consumer and healthcare verticals.\nFourth quarter 2017 Adjusted Operating Income was $1.7 million, compared to $4.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was due to lower revenues, partially offset by lower labor costs, due to headcount reductions, and lower production costs, mostly within the mail and logistics service area.\nOperating loss in the quarter was $33.7 million and included a goodwill impairment charge of $34.5 million. This compares to an operating loss of $34.5 million in the year ago quarter, which included a goodwill impairment charge of $38.7 million.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29.3 million, or a loss of $4.73 per common share, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $72.9 million, or a loss of $11.83 per common share in the prior year.\nFull-Year Results\nThe following table presents financial highlights of the company's continuing operations for 2017 and 2016.\nRESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (In thousands, except per share amounts) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change Revenues $ 383,906 $ 404,412 (5.1 ) Operating income (loss) (40,865 ) (53,837 ) (24.1 ) Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) (1) (3,693 ) (12,495 ) (70.4 ) Adjusted Operating Margin (1) (1.0 )% (3.1 )% Net income (loss) (41,860 ) (89,778 ) (53.4 ) Earnings (loss) per share (6.76 ) (14.60 ) (53.7 ) Shares outstanding (weighted-average common and common equivalent shares outstanding) 6,192 6,149 0.7\n(1) See table for reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted results. 2017 revenues were $383.9 million, compared to $404.4 million, in 2016, representing a 5.1% revenue decline. Revenues declined in our retail, healthcare, and B2B verticals due to reduced mail volumes, partially offset by an increase in agency services in our financial vertical.\n2017 Adjusted Operating Loss was $3.7 million, compared to a $12.5 million Adjusted Operating Loss in 2016. Despite revenue declines, Adjusted Operating Loss improved due to lower labor expenses and production expenses driven by lower direct mail volumes and lower employee related expenses within advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses.\nFor the year, operating loss was $40.9 million and included a goodwill impairment charge of $34.5 million, compared to $53.8 in 2016, including a $38.7 million goodwill impairment charge.\nFull year, net loss from continuing operations for 2017 was $41.9 million, or a loss of $6.76 per common share, compared to a loss of $89.8 million or loss of $14.60 per common share for 2016.\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings release today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nTo access an audio webcast, please use the link available in the Investors Events section of the Harte Hanks website.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables below. The company evaluates its operating performance based on several measures, including non-GAAP financial measures. The company believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental financial measures of operating performance for investors because they facilitate investors’ ability to evaluate the operational strength of the company’s business. Any supplemental financial measures referred to are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and they should not be considered substitutes for net income as an indicator of operating performance.\nHarte Hanks, Inc.
