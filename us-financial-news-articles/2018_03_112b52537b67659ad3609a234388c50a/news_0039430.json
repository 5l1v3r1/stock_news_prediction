(“Holdings”), the parent of DynCorp International Inc. (“DI,” and together with Holdings, the “Company”), a leading global services provider, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was $567.3 million compared to $461.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement in revenue was due to increased scope on the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program IV (\"LOGCAP IV\") program and Afghanistan Life Support Services (\"ALiSS\") programs, the new G4 Worldwide Logistics Support and Contractor Logistics Support: C-12, C-26, UC-35 and T-6 Transport (\"CLS Transport\") contracts, the Naval Test Wing Pacific O-Level Maintenance (\"Naval Test Wing Pacific\") contract and the T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply Bridge (\"T-6 COMBS Bridge\") contract. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume on the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation (\"INL Air Wing\") program. Net income attributable to Holdings for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $21.0 million compared to a net loss of $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by the transition of the T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (\"T-6 COMBS\") contract to the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $38.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $32.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported revenue of $2.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was due to increased scope on the LOGCAP IV and ALiSS programs, the new G4 Worldwide Logistics Support and CLS Transport contracts, Theater Aviation Sustainment Manager - OCONUS (\"TASM-O\"), and the T-6 COMBS and T-6 COMBS Bridge contracts. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume on the INL Air Wing program and the completion of the Sheppard Air Force Base (\"Sheppard AFB\") and Flexible Acquisition and Sustainment Tool (\"F2AST\") contracts. Net income attributable to Holdings was $30.6 million for 2017 as compared to a net loss of $54.1 million for 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms, the performance on our Middle East programs and the ALiSS contract. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $152.5 million for 2017, which results in 7.6% margins for the period.\n“I am extremely proud of the outstanding performance the team delivered in 2017. Through a strategy rooted in a commitment to operational excellence, and business development execution we saw year-over-year revenue growth of 9.2% and profitability increase by 50.9%.” said George Krivo, Chief Executive Officer. “We expect that the recent strategic rebalance of our operating segments, superior program execution, and continued focus on capturing new business opportunities will drive growth and success in the year ahead.”\nFourth Quarter Highlights and Other Recent Developments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, AOLC definitized a six-month extension of services through April 30, 2018 for several locations on the INL Air Wing program. The extension has a total potential value of $120 million. In October 2017, DynLogistics announced the award of a change order to establish and operate base camp support for DoD Title 10 Forces, the National Guard, the Federal Emergency Response Agency personnel and First Responders supporting Hurricane Maria relief operations in Puerto Rico under the LOGCAP IV contract. The change order has a total potential value of $69.8 million. In November 2017, DynLogistics announced the award of a change order to support material management and logistics services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ South Atlantic Division, Task Force Power Restoration in Puerto Rico on the Northcom task order under the LOGCAP IV contract. The change order has a total potential value of $22.1 million. In January 2018, the Company changed its three operating and reportable segments, DynLogistics, AELS and AOLC, to two operating and reportable segments: DynLogistics and DynAviation. On March 21, 2018, we made a principal payment of $54.9 million on our Term Loan under the Excess Cash Flow provisions of the New Senior Credit Facility. This payment satisfied a principal amortization payment requirement of $22.5 million due on or prior to June 15, 2018.\nReportable Segment Results\nAELS\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $167.1 million, compared with $141.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the T-6 COMBS Bridge, the new Naval Test Wing Pacific O-Level Maintenance (\"Naval Test Wing Pacific\") contract and the Contract Field Teams task orders at the Davis-Monthan and Little Rock Air Force Bases. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $605.6 million compared to $585.2 million to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change was primarily due to increased content from the T-6 COMBS Bridge and Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center (\"NAWDC\") contracts, the new Naval Test Wing Pacific contract and the Contract Field Teams task orders at the Davis-Monthan and Little Rock Air Force Bases. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the completion of the Sheppard AFB contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.4 million, compared to a loss of $3.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the New T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was $29.5 million, compared to a loss of $16.8 million in 2016 and was primarily due to the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms, the timing of a performance fee award on the Contractor Logistics Support: T-34, T-44, T-6 (\"CLS T34/44/6\") contract, and improved performance from the NAWDC and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (\"CAL FIRE\") contracts.\nAOLC\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $155.6 million, compared with $147.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the new CLS Transport contract partially offset by decreased content on the INL Air Wing program. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $603.2 million compared to $617.3 million to the year ended December 31, 2016. The reduction was primarily due to decreased content on the INL Air Wing program and the completion of the F2AST contract. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by increased content from the TASM-O contract and the new CLS Transport contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.7 million, compared to $17.1 million for the same period in 2016. The reduction was primarily due to decreased volume on the INL Air Wing program. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was $66.0 million, compared to $56.8 million in 2016 and was primarily due to the performance on our Middle East programs and our TASM-O contract. These increases were partially offset by decreased volume on the INL Air Wing program.\nDynLogistics\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $244.4 million, compared with $172.5 million for the same period in 2016. The improvement was primarily due to increased scope on both the LOGCAP IV program and ALiSS contract and the new G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $796.2 million compared to $633.6 million to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on both the LOGCAP IV program and the ALiSS contract and the new G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $20.4 million, compared to $22.0 million for the same period in 2016. The reduction was primarily due to a one time settlement received in the prior year, partially offset by the new G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract and favorable contract terms on the ALiSS contract in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was $73.5 million compared to $71.5 million in 2016 driven by our increased revenue discussed above partially offset by an $8.2 million charge for the termination of a subcontractor agreement.\nEffective as of the first quarter of calendar year 2018, the Company’s three operating and reporting segments, AELS, AOLC and DynLogistics, were re-aligned into two operating and reporting segments by combining AELS and AOLC into DynAviation with DynLogistics continuing to operate as a separate segment.\nLiquidity\nCash provided by operating activities during 2017 was $73.2 million compared with $41.2 million during 2016. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the completion of the Sheppard AFB contract, the transition of the T-6 COMBS contract to the new T-6 COMBS Bridge contract with more favorable terms and new DynLogistics contract wins.\nThe unrestricted cash balance at year-end was $168.3 million with no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility.\nDSO was 54 days as of December 31, 2017, a two day improvement from year end 2016, as we continued to focus on managing our customer payment cycles.\nBill Kansky, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Based on our strong performance in 2017, we expect full year 2018 revenue of $1.97 billion to $2.0 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $148 million to $153 million.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 21, 2018, to discuss results for the fourth quarter and year end 2017.

For more information, visit www.dyn-intl.com .\nReconciliation to GAAP\nIn addition to the Company's financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) included in this press release, the Company has provided certain financial measures that are not calculated according to GAAP, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to the Company adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA for certain noncash items from operations and certain other items as defined in our Indenture and New Senior Credit Facility. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating operating performance and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in reviewing the Company. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in assessing our ability to generate cash to cover our debt obligations including interest and principal payments. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of the performance of other companies.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures please see the financial schedules accompanying this release.\nThe Company does not provide reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to Operating Income, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include other (loss) income and certain income/expense or gain/loss adjustments under the Company’s debt agreements that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis announcement may contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
