The first four would cost about 4.5 billion euros (3.98 billion pounds), according to earlier plans.\nThe German ministry of defense declined to comment on the exclusion, which was first reported by business newspaper Handelsblatt.\nReporting by Sabine Siebold and Tom Kaeckenhoff; Writing by Tom Sims; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:12:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
