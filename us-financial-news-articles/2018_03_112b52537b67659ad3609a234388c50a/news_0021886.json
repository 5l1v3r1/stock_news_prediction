The European Union has said that it should be exempt from the tariffs.\nFox said there was overproduction of steel in the world, mainly coming from China, but that protectionism “never really works”, adding that British steel was used to supply the U.S. military.\n“So it’s doubly absurd that we should then be caught on an investigation on national security,” Fox said on BBC’s Question Time late on Thursday evening.\n“We can deal multilaterally with the overproduction of steel, but this is the wrong way to go about it.”\nHe said he would raise the issue with the United States in a trip to Washington next week.
