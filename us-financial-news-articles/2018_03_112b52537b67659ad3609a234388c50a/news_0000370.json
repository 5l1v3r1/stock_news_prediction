Invesco shares recently traded at 10.7 times projected earnings for the next year, making the stock among the cheapest among asset managers, the Barron’s article said. The stock trades at a 44 percent discount to BlackRock Inc shares, more than twice the average such discount over the past decade, the article said. At the same time, Invesco is well-positioned in part because of its history of buying weaker players during downturns, Barron’s said. In 2018, Invesco shares have fallen nearly 12 percent compared with a 0.9 percent rise for the S&P 500 asset management and custody banks index.
