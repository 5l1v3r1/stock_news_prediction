The CA Board determined sanctions that would be appropriate in each player’s case, following their review of the report. \nThe Board has considered the recommendations and determined that the following sanctions will be offered to each player in accordance with the CA Code of Conduct process: \nSteve Smith Suspension of 12 months from all international and domestic cricket \nDavid Warner Suspension of 12 months from all international and domestic cricket \nCameron Bancroft Suspension of 9 months from all international and domestic cricket \nAll three players will be permitted to play club cricket and will be encouraged to do so to maintain links with the cricket community. \nIn addition, all three players will be required to undertake 100 hours of voluntary service in community cricket. LEADERSHIP \nSteve Smith and Cameron Bancroft will not be considered for team leadership positions until a minimum of 12 months after the conclusion of their respective suspensions from international and domestic cricket. \nAny consideration of future leadership would be conditional on acceptance by fans and the public, form and authority among the playing group. \nDavid Warner will not be considered for team leadership positions in the future.
