Fingers crossed!” tweeted Jessica Squeglia in Peabody, Massachusetts. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy ordered many state workers to head home early on Wednesday afternoon at staggered intervals to avoid traffic snarls on slippery roads.\nThe governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency, giving them access to support from the U.S. government if needed.\nLast week’s storm brought major coastal flooding to Massachusetts, killed at least nine people and knocked out power to about 2.4 million homes and businesses in the Northeast.
