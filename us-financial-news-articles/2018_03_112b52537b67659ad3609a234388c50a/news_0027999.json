(NYSE: TLYS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2017 ended February 3, 2018.\n“Tillys delivered an improvement in year-over-year operating income of 10% for the fourth quarter and 24% for the 2017 fiscal year as a whole,\" commented Ed Thomas, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We aim to continue our operating momentum during fiscal 2018, and are off to a good start in the first quarter thus far.\"\nFourth Quarter Results Overview\nThe following comparisons refer to operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (14 weeks) versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (13 weeks) ended January 28, 2017:\nTotal net sales were $164.3 million, an increase of 2.6% from $160.2 million last year, despite ending the quarter with four fewer stores than a year ago (219 total stores vs. 223 last year). Comparable store sales, which includes e-commerce sales, were flat. Comparable store sales increased 0.1% in the fourth quarter last year. Gross profit was $51.4 million, an increase of 4.8% from $49.1 million last year. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, increased to 31.3% from 30.6% last year. This 70 basis point increase in gross margin was attributable to a 90 basis point reduction in occupancy costs, partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease in product margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") were $40.0 million, or 24.3% of net sales, compared to $38.7 million, or 24.1% of net sales, last year. This 20 basis point increase was primarily attributable to increased store payroll as a result of minimum wage increases. Operating income was $11.4 million, or 7.0% of net sales, an increase of 10.0% from $10.4 million, or 6.5% of net sales, last year. This 50 basis point increase in our operating margin was attributable to improved occupancy costs, as explained above. Income tax expense was $5.2 million, or 43.5% of pre-tax income, compared to $4.2 million, or 40.2% of pre-tax income, last year. This year's income tax expense includes a net charge of $0.2 million due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") signed into law during December 2017. Net income was $6.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $6.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, last year.\nFiscal 2017 Full Year Results Overview\nThe following comparisons refer to operating results for fiscal 2017 (53 weeks) versus fiscal 2016 (52 weeks) ended January 28, 2017:\nTotal net sales were $576.9 million, an increase of 1.4% from $569.0 million last year. Comparable store sales, which includes e-commerce sales, increased 1.0%. Comparable store sales increased 0.5% in fiscal 2016. Gross profit was $175.4 million, an increase of 4.1% from $168.5 million last year. Gross margin was 30.4% compared to 29.6% last year. This 80 basis point increase in gross margin was attributable to reductions in total buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Product margins were flat. SG&A was $151.4 million compared to $149.1 million, or 26.2% of net sales in both years. SG&A includes legal provisions of $6.8 million this year compared to $2.4 million last year. After consideration of legal provisions, the remainder of SG&A decreased by $2.1 million for the year. Primary expense reductions were from marketing, non-cash store impairment charges, corporate payroll costs, and several other smaller expenses. Increases in store payroll and system implementation expenses partially offset these decreases. Operating income was $24.0 million, or 4.2% of net sales, a 24.1% increase compared to $19.3 million, or 3.4% of net sales, last year. This 80 basis point improvement in operating income was primarily driven by increased comparable store sales and reductions in buying, distribution and occupancy costs. Income tax expense was $10.5 million, or 41.7% of pre-tax income, compared to $8.3 million, or 42.2% of pre-tax income, last year. This year's income tax expense includes the previously noted $0.2 million impact of the Act. Net income was $14.7 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, an increase of 28.8% from $11.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, last year.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of February 3, 2018, the Company had $136.0 million of cash and marketable securities and no debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility. This compares to $133.9 million of cash and marketable securities and no debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility as of January 28, 2017. In February 2018, the Company paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately $29.1 million in the aggregate. The Company also paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately $20.1 million in the aggregate during February 2017.\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Outlook\nBased on current and historical trends, the Company expects its first quarter comparable store sales to range from flat to a low single-digit percentage increase, operating results to range from a loss of approximately $0.5 million to income of approximately $1.0 million, and per share results to range from a loss of $(0.01) to income per diluted share of $0.03. This compares to a comparable store sales increase of 0.6%, an operating loss of $(0.2) million, and loss per share of $(0.01) for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This outlook assumes an anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 27% and weighted average shares of approximately 29.5 million.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss these financial results is scheduled for today, March 12, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT).
