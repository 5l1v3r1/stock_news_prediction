No rocket launches were identified. The (military) is looking into the circumstances which led to the activation of the Iron Dome system.”\nAbu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing, said no rockets were fired into Israel.\nEarlier, Israeli media had reported that Iron Dome had intercepted a number of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip. Sirens had sounded around the border area in Israel and smart phone applications that warn of incoming rockets delivered a number of alerts in quick succession.\nDuring the Gaza war in 2014, Iron Dome interceptors largely protected Israel’s heartland from thousands of incoming rockets fired by Gaza militants. Israeli media said Sunday’s multiple launchings were the most intense since then.\nHeightening tension around the border, Hamas began a military exercise on Sunday in which its fighters set off explosions and test-fired rockets into the sea. Gunfire echoed across Gaza as hundreds of fighters were deployed for the exercise, which is due to continue on Monday.\n“The enemy (Israel) bears responsibility for any escalation and we will not stand handcuffed against any aggression,” Abu Ubaida said in a statement.\nThe army’s statement said that, in response to the machine gun fire into Israel, a tank targeted two observation posts in the northern Gaza Strip. It said it held Hamas responsible “for any terror emanating from the Gaza Strip”.\nPalestinian residents of Beit Hanoun said the tank fired two shells into their area at about the same time of the Iron Dome launches, but that there were no casualties.\nAdditional reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi in Gaza and Amir Cohen and Ran Tzabari in Ashkelon; Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T00:42:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
