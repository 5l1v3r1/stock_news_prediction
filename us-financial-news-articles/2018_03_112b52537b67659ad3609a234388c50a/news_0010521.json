If there are any differences in the ways the tariffs apply to specific countries, the official said, it would be that the tariffs would be tough for all countries and even tougher for some.\nCohn has been working behind the scenes to stop the tariffs, or at least mitigate their effects. He has scheduled meetings between Trump and executives from U.S. metals industries to try and dissuade Trump from moving forward with his protectionist trade goals, Bloomberg News and Politico reported, both citing sources.\nTrump on Thursday announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum. The new trade protections, Trump said at the time, would be implemented the following week.\nAmid the trade policy tug of war, Trump said in a tweet Tuesday morning that the White House still has \" some people that I want to change .\"\nTrump tweet: The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! \nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Bloomberg's story about Cohn.\nTuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , Cohn's fellow Goldman Sachs alum in the White House, backed the tariffs, but tried to tamp down talk of a trade war .\n\"We're not looking to get into trade wars. We're looking to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly around the world,\" Mnuchin told a House panel.\n\nWATCH:  If Gary Cohn resigns, watch out stock market, says Jim Cramer show chapters Cramer: If Gary Cohn resigns, watch out stock market      10:38 AM ET Fri, 2 March 2018 | 00:49", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T18:12:45.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
