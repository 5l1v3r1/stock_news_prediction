Formula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 22, 2018 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel during the press conference REUTERS/Brandon Malone This year marks the first ever in the series that two quadruple champions go wheel-to-wheel and their battle to join Argentine legend Juan Manuel Fangio on five titles will be a talking point throughout the season. Mutual respect was traded in for resentment last year when the pair bumped wheels at an explosive Azerbaijan Grand Prix, prompting an angry outburst from Mercedes’ Hamilton. Fans will hope passions are high when the pair face off at Albert Park on Sunday and can remain so through a proper season-long tussle. At the year’s first pre-race news conference, however, they staged little more than a mutual appreciation society when comparing their challenges, trading smiles and light-hearted banter while sitting side-by-side. “When you come to the end of your career you want to know that you’re competing against the best,” said reigning champion Hamilton, who overhauled Ferrari’s Vettel last year to claim his third title with Mercedes. “There are those that bow out early, those that have one championship maybe, that has not been as competitive and the ultimate goal to be the best is that you’re going to have to go up against the best. “It’s great because it’s been a great experience for me to be able to race Sebastian. “He’s got the four world titles, had the most of any other driver at the time and I think this is an exciting year for Formula One fans being that we have two four-time world champions battling it out.” German Vettel, who took four consecutive titles for Red Bull from 2010-13, was similarly generous to the driver he shook his fist at in a rage at Baku last year when he claimed the Briton had brake-tested him before their clash of wheels on track.

However, they agreed that matching Fangio, whose record of five titles is second only to Michael Schumacher’s seven, was the last thing on their minds. “I’ve not (thought about it), honestly,” shrugged Hamilton. For Vettel, there was no point in thinking ‘what if’. “I think nowadays the times are different, they are very different times to what Fangio achieved,” he added. “Every era has its own challenges.” Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T10:35:50.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
