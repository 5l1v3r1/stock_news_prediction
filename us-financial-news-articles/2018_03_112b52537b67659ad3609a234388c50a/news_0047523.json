Peugeot rose 2.7 percent, Porsche gained 2.6 percent and Volkswagen was up 2.4 percent.\nCyclical basic resources, autos, and banking stocks drove the pan-European STOXX 600 up 0.1 percent. The index was still set for its worst quarter in two years, however, suffering a 5 percent decline.\nStarting with a stellar rally in global equities in January, this quarter developed into a challenging one for stock markets with investors navigating a sharp spike in volatility, rumbling trade tensions and anxiety over the tech sector.\nM&A news was the main driver on Thursday.\nBesides Renault, Swiss Re was also a top gainer, up 2.3 percent after a report that Japanâ€™s SoftBank Group , which has been in deal talks with the reinsurance firm, is looking to buy a 25 percent stake.\nNEX Group shares rose 0.8 percent after U.S. exchange operator CME Group said it had agreed to take over the UK financial technology firm for $5.5 billion.\nMeanwhile services group Sodexo sank 15 percent after cutting its full-year sales and profit margin outlook, reporting a weaker than expected second quarter.\nPeers Elior and Compass Group also declined 2.2 to 2.4 percent, making the travel and leisure sector the worst-performing.
