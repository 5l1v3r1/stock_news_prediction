Around 50 investors had shown interest after its main shareholders announced their intention to sell, it said last summer.\nFosun, which has investments stretching from property development to insurance, became majority shareholder of the struggling French couture house Lanvin earlier this month.\nBased in Bregenz, western Austria, Wolford reported a loss before interest and tax (EBIT) of 15.7 million euros ($18.8 million) for the financial year that ended April last year.\nThe main shareholders of Austrian textiles company Wolford , the WMP Familien-Privatstiftung, Sesam Privatstiftung and M.Erthal & Co. Beteiligungsgesellschaft which represent the founding familiesâ€™ stake, said in June last year that they were looking to sell an undefined majority stake in the company.\nWolford was not immediately available for comment.
