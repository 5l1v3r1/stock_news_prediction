Sensirion is also offering nearly 2 million new shares as it aims to raise around 55 million francs to fuel growth. “We see ourselves as a growth company, not a dividend company,” said Moritz Lechner, who with Felix Mayer co-founded Sensirion in 2009. Mayer and Lechner will keep their shares. Sensirion generated 2017 revenue of 148 million francs and adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 26 million. It forecasts revenue growth of 15-18 percent and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15-16 this year. Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) and J.P.
