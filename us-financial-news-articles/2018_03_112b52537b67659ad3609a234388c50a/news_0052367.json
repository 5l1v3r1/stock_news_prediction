Four members of a local military council affiliated with the coalition were also injured, said the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\nThe troops were traveling in vehicles Friday evening when an improvised explosive device exploded in the Kurdish-controlled city of Manbij, according to a U.S. defense official. Aleppo24, a local news group, reported that a coalition patrol was targeted near a cemetery in a part of the city not previously patrolled. There are no military headquarters in that area, the group said.\n“It is with regret that we must confirm that a member of the UK Armed Forces was killed by an improvised explosive device in Syria,” the British Ministry of Defense said. \nThe attack happened just one day after President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S military effort in Syria aimed at destroying Islamic State would soon end. At least three other Americans have been killed in Syria since 2016, including one killed by an explosive. \n“We will be coming out of Syria, like, very soon,” Mr. Trump said at a rally Thursday in suburban Cleveland. “Let the other people take care of it now.”\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack and U.S. military officials said it was unclear who was behind it. But various groups are competing in Manbij. Analysts said the explosive could have been planted by militants from Islamic State, al Qaeda, or a Turkish proxy seeking to kill Kurdish fighters or even pressure the coalition to scale back its forces in Manbij.\nManbij was already on alert following the injury in an assassination attempt last week of a spokesman for that local coalition-affiliated council, according to the observatory. A local journalist said the city has been under a nighttime curfew for two months, enforced by the internal security force.\nSince January, Turkey has attacked Kurdish-controlled areas along its southern border with Syria. Ankara says that Syrian Kurdish fighters there, the Kurdish Peoples’ Protection Units, also known as the YPG, are a terrorist group affiliated with Turkish Kurds waging an insurgency in Turkey.\nA commercial street in the Kurdish-controlled city of Manbij in northern Syria.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to move Turkish forces toward Manbij and also has called for coalition forces to leave there.\nU.S. Army Gen. Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for the U.S. military operations in the Middle East, was in Syria just days ago and said that while the U.S. recognizes Turkey security concerns, the Kurds were a “key partner on the ground.” Kurdish fighters are members of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which has pushed Islamic State from several cities in eastern Syria.\n“We have to continue to work between these two objectives to ensure that we can find an appropriate way forward,” Gen. Votel told journalists.\n\nWrite to Nancy A.
