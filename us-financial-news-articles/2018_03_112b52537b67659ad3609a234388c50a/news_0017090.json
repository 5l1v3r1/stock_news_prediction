The acquisition enables Rivetz to bring the human touch to its hardware-based cyber security solutions and recovery models.\nThe CyberDeadbolt secure, scalable platform incorporates human factors to authenticate and authorize the exchange of sensitive information, employing phonetics-based voice identification and multi-person authentication to provide customizable levels of security depending on the user's needs. CyberDeadbolt provides a new paradigm for account recovery, recovered device unlocking and verified multi-user access intent. The app also allows users to enable a cyber 'deadbolt' to lock access to all or some of their devices. For example, a user may lock their home devices while away on vacation.\n\"The foundation of the Rivetz service relies on known devices in known conditions to protect digital assets like Bitcoin,\" said Steven Sprague, founder and CEO of Rivetz. \"With CyberDeadbolt, we now have the ability to add secure user intent to access that user's collection of devices and incorporate known and verified multiple human access confirmations as well.\"\n\"Rivetz and CyberDeadbolt are a natural fit and yield a compelling combination,\" said Bradley Rotter, CyberDeadbolt cofounder and a crypto and blockchain pioneer. \"The Rivetz model of provable controls benefits from the simple and easy-to-operate capabilities delivered by CyberDeadbolt to remotely lock a device or require multiple users to participate in the recovery of keys and secrets.\"\nPavan Mudanna, CyberDeadbolt cofounder, has joined the Rivetz team as vice president of shared services. Rotter is vice chairman of the Rivetz board.\nAbout Rivetz\nRivetz is focused on solving problems associated with consumer and machine-to-machine digital transactions.
