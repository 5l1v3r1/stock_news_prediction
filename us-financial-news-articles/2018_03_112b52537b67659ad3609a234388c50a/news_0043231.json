A war is very expensive. It is much easier to cooperate,” he said at the forum, whose slogan is “sharing water”.\nExamples include agreements in South America involving Amazonian rivers and the River Plate, as well as a deal for the Nile that supplies water to 11 countries in Africa, he said.\nOutside the gathering, hundreds of people attending the Alternative World Water Forum protested on Thursday against water privatization.\n“This water offensive comes at a time of crisis. Capitalists want to turn water into a big business, like they did with energy,” said Gilberto Cervinski of the Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB), an advocacy group.\nThe protesters included land activists, indigenous people, small farmers and descendants of runaway slaves, known as quilombolas.\nWater is under pressure globally as the planet warms and as demand grows along with populations, according to a United Nations report launched this week at the forum.\nGlobal demand is expected to increase by nearly one-third by 2050, when 5 billion people could be left with poor access to water, the World Water Development Report warned.\nTo avoid that, the U.N. proposed “nature-based solutions” that use or mimic natural processes to boost water availability.\nWater issues are much more complex in urban areas, especially in the developed northern hemisphere and in informal settlements in underdeveloped countries, Braga said.\nThe consequences of climate change – bringing both longer rainy seasons and dry seasons – means governments should invest in aspects such as better water storage to mitigate those effects, he said.\nIn Brazil’s case, he added, a project to divert water from the Sao Francisco river to the northeastern region would help to alleviate a seven-year drought.\nBraga said the WWC was also working to have access to water and sanitation regarded as a fundamental human right. One in nine people worldwide have no access to basic drinking water, while one in three lack access to a toilet.\nReporting by Karla Mendes; Editing by Robert Carmichael; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
