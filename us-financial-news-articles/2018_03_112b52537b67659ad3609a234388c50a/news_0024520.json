Those savings are spread over several years, he said. \nDana reported an effective tax rate of 33% last year. Company executives said last month they expect the new tax law’s lower corporate tax rate to contribute about 10 cents of an expected 23 cents in per-share profit growth this year, excluding unusual items. The legislation reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. \nDana executives did not specify how much they expect to pay in taxes if their deal for GKN’s driveline business goes through, but the corporate tax rate in the U.K. is 19%.\nThe deal calls into question one of the primary rationales for December’s tax overhaul: making it less attractive for U.S. companies to engage in so-called tax inversions, in which they shift their tax homes abroad in pursuit of lower taxes.\nIn general, U.S. tax law penalizes companies for inversions if more than 60% of the resulting company is owned by shareholders of the original U.S. company, and still more if at least 80% is. Dana’s merger would not trigger those penalties. \nBut the company’s shareholders could still get hit with a tax bill on their own shares under a separate provision that applies if the end company is at least 50% owned by the U.S. firm’s shareholders. Dana said the deal will give it nearly 53% ownership of the merged entity.\nThese provisions, which predate December’s tax legislation, were intended to make tax inversions less appealing to companies and shareholders alike. Dana’s Mr. Collins said the planned merger isn’t “technically” an inversion because a new company is being established and half of its business will remain in the U.K. \nTax experts say that is a distinction without a difference. \nU.S. lawmakers last fall repeatedly cited inversions as they debated and passed last year’s tax changes. The final version does relatively little to directly penalize inverted companies or stop the transactions. \nThe law’s supporters argued that the lower corporate tax rate and lighter taxes on U.S. companies’ foreign income would reduce the incentive to move abroad. \nRobert Willens, a New York City tax consultant, called Dana’s explanation of tax savings surprising.\nA combination of the lowered U.S. corporate tax rate and earlier regulations, which limited the degree to which foreign companies could “strip” profits from U.S. subsidiaries, seemed to remove the incentive for such deals, he said. “I didn’t think we’d ever see another inversion.”\n“The U.K. tax rates are very close to U.S. tax rates,” Mr. Willens said. “Now, with the corporate benefits of an inversion being difficult to identify, you’re creating a tax for your shareholders which seems unnecessary.”\nDana executives say the tax strategy is designed to take advantage of a lower tax rate and to assuage concerns about its commitment to GKN’s manufacturing operations in the U.K.\nGKN, listed in London, is turning its attention to aerospace and seeking to sell its auto business. Under the Dana deal, GKN shareholders would receive 47.25% of a new entity called Dana PLC. \nMore in Autos \nFord Falls Way Behind in China March 9, 2018 GM Faces Renewed Prospect of $1 Billion Payout Over Ignition Safety March 8, 2018 GM CEO Pushes for Renewed Tax Breaks on Electric Vehicles March 7, 2018 Daimler Interested in Closer Ties With China’s Geely Automotive March 6, 2018 The proposed takeover, which could close as soon as the fourth quarter, pits Dana against a rival bid from turnaround specialist Melrose Industries, which wants all of the company. GKN has been fighting off the hostile £7.4 billion ($10.25 billion) offer from Melrose, which faces a month-end deadline for a vote by GKN shareholders.\nExecutives from GKN and Melrose appeared before a British parliamentary committee this week to address concerns of legislators about the possible loss of jobs and skills in a takeover.\nRepresentatives for Melrose on Friday criticized the terms of the Dana deal, calling it a “hasty sale” that won’t benefit GKN shareholders. “Today’s announcement changes nothing and is a further admission of the management failure of GKN,” Melrose Chairman Christopher Miller said.\nFor Dana, the move would accelerate its move into electric vehicles, one of the fast-growing auto segments, and expand its global footprint. It pairs Dana’s expertise in drivetrains for larger vehicles, such as pickup trucks and commercial vehicles, with GKN’s focus on passenger cars. \n— Richard Rubin and Robert Wall contributed to this article.\nWrite to Chester Dawson at chester.dawson@wsj.com and Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T02:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T03:47:01.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
