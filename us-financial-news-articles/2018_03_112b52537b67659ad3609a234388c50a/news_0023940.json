Authorities have repeatedly promised to clean up the game.\nThere was no immediate comment from Savvides or PAOK Salonika.\nVassiliadis said the suspension was indefinite until all involved agreed on a code of conduct and rules; “On our part much tighter rules on issues of security,” he added.\nThe minister said “all necessary provisions would be taken” to make sure the suspensions did not affect the national side which has friendlies against Egypt and Switzerland later this month.\nRussian-born Greek businessman and owner of PAOK Salonika, Ivan Savvides (C), pictured with what appears to be a gun in a holster, enters the pitch after the referee annulled a goal of PAOK during their soccer match against AEK Athens in Toumba Stadium in Thessaloniki, Greece, March 11, 2018.

The police statement did not mention a weapon. A police source said the PAOK boss was licensed to carry a firearm.\nSavvides was born in Georgia of Greek heritage and is a former member of the Russian parliament. He has holdings in assets ranging from Thessaloniki port to tobacco and media companies.\nA derby between PAOK and Olympiakos Piraeus was called off last month after Olympiakos coach Oscar Garcia was hit by a roll of paper thrown from the stands.\nAdditional reporting by Lefteris Papadimas and Renee Maltezou; Editing by Gareth Jones and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T12:09:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
