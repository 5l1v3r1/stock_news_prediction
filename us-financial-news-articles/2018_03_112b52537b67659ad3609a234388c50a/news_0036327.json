There is nothing defined\" yet, said Republican Representative Mark Meadows , who heads the right-wing House Freedom Caucus.\nTalks were expected to go late into the night.\nLawmakers were hoping to pass the \"omnibus\" spending bill before the start on Saturday of a two-week spring break. Doing so would put an end for six months to the possibility of any more government shutdowns by funding federal agencies for the rest of this fiscal year.\nThe federal government was forced to close over a weekend in January because of a similar budget battle.\nPolarizing measures being shelved With government funding running out at week's end, several contentious items were tentatively being killed off to help speed passage of a bill that will significantly increase U.S. defense spending as well as many non-defense programs.\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said a move had failed to renew federal subsidies to health insurers, which would help make \"Obamacare\" more affordable for low-income people.\nAttempts to bolster the Affordable Care Act appeared to have collapsed after Republicans insisted on language that would have placed abortion prohibitions on those insurance plans and Democrats refused to go along.\n\"The speaker (Ryan) just said it wasn't in there,\" Meadows told reporters.\nTrump discontinued the subsidy payments last year.\nTrump also has threatened to veto the bill if it contains federal payments for constructing a New York-New Jersey railroad tunnel project known as the Gateway Program. Lawmakers said congressional leaders were still arguing over that money.\nThree Republican House members told reporters that a separate initiative to impose an internet sales tax also appeared to be doomed.\nSimpson, asked whether there were worries that the House and Senate would be unable to approve the spending bill before existing agency funds run out, said: \"There's always worries about that.\"\nRepublican leaders were hoping to hold the House debate and votes on Wednesday, giving the Senate a couple more days to do the same before the Friday deadline. But the House timetable might have to be delayed a day, some aides and lawmakers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T11:54:10.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
