The Form 10-K will be filed before the markets open, Tuesday, March 13, 2018.\nHighlights include:\nNet income was $33.1 million, $1.08 per share for the year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) created a tax benefit for 2017 of $18.0 million. Net income prior to the effects of the Tax Act was $15.1 million, $.51 per share for the year. Bank debt was reduced to $202.0 million in 2017, a reduction of $ 36.6 million. Leverage was reduced to 2.40X. In February 2018, Hallador Energy Company invested $4 million in Hourglass Sands, LLC, a frac sand mining company in the State of Colorado. Hourglass Sands currently controls a permitted sand reserve near Colorado Springs. The Company expects to truck test shipments to customers in the DJ Basin this summer. The Company believes it controls the only permitted frac sand mine in the State of Colorado. \"We believe this investment brings diversification and growth opportunities to our company and shareholders by capitalizing on the shale boom in the United States, while complementing our core coal business. We do not anticipate Hourglass Sands to be profitable in 2018, but are excited about its growth potential in future years,\" said Brent Bilsland, President and CEO of Hallador Energy. The Princeton Loop is expected to be operational in Q2 2018. It will serve as a truck to rail coal loading facility.
