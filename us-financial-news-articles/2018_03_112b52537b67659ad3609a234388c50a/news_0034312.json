TSA agents may also use Explosives Trace Detection technology to swab and test electronic devices for explosives.\nThe ACLU lawsuit seeks records related to policies regarding the search of passengers electronic devices; equipment used to search, examine, or extract data from passengers devices; and training of officers conducting the screening and searches of electronic devices. The ACLU said the TSA \"should not be digging through our digital data without a warrant.\"\nCustoms and Border Protection (CBP) agents do, at times, conduct searches of electronic devices at international border crossings, including airports, without first obtaining a warrant.\nThe ACLU and Electronic Frontier Foundation in September 2017 sued the Trump administration over the practice in Boston. The ACLU said last week that CBP conducted 5,000 searches of electronic devices at airports in 2015 and 30,000 searches in 2017. The government has asked a federal judge to dismiss the suit.
