The main indexes are on track for their worst month since January 2016.\nComments from top officials in the U.S. and China had given a sense that both the countries would negotiate over President Donald Trump’s move to impose tariffs on Chinese goods.\nChina is expected to soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on US exports, its state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday.\nThe Commerce Department is set to release its final estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which is expected to grow at a 2.7 percent annualized rate instead of the 2.5 percent pace reported last month. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nAt 7:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 58 points, S&P 500 e-minis rose 6 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 4 points.\nTesla dropped 1.5 percent after the U.S. government said it would investigate a fatal crash and vehicle fire of a Model X in California.\nBlackberry’s U.S.-listed shares jumped 7 percent after the company reported a smaller quarterly loss, helped by higher margins from software and services sales.\nWalgreen Boots rose nearly 5 percent after the drugstore chain reported better-than-expected earnings and lifted full-year profit forecast.
