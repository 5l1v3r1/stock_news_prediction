More importantly, the outlook for the local economy has also improved over the recent months,” Absa said.\nAnalysts say investor and consumer confidence and local assets have rallied since Cyril Ramaphosa took over as leader of the ruling African National Congress in December. Ramaphosa was then elected President of South Africa two weeks ago.\nThe Treasury has raised its 2018 economic growth forecast to 1.5 percent from estimated growth of 1 percent in 2017.
