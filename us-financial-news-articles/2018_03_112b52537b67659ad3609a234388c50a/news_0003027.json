Trudeau himself called Trump on Tuesday.\nCTV news said Canada’s ambassador to Washington would be having dinner on Wednesday with White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster. No one at the embassy was immediately available for comment.\nFrom the outset, Trudeau has taken a decidedly sunny approach to the unpredictable president, launching an outreach campaign to save NAFTA one encounter at a time with as many U.S. lawmakers, governors and administration officials as possible.\nThe Liberal government’s approach is largely backed across the political and business spectrum but pressure is building to abandon the measured tone.\n“Trump has already treated China and Russia with more kid gloves than us. Why is that?” said John Weekes, Canada’s chief negotiator for the original NAFTA deal.\nWeekes said Canada should draw up a long list of possible targets for retaliation, and publish it for public comment.\n“I’d be the first to agree that retaliation is a mug’s game, but how do we help our allies in the United States make the case to change the course of policy?” he said.\nLabor too, is demanding more action.\nJerry Dias, president of private-sector union Unifor, said the government’s keep-calm approach had been the right one up until Trump’s planned tariffs, but that Canada would look weak if it did not react.\n“What are we supposed to do? They come after us on everything. So we can just continue to be perceived as nice Canadians - when we get hit we say ‘Thank you’ - or we can say ‘enough is enough’” Dias told reporters on Wednesday.\nA source familiar with Canadian government thinking said retaliatory measures were “a live conversation going on at this moment” and would be deployed if the tariffs are implemented. Trump has linked the tariffs with ongoing NAFTA negotiations.\nBeyond the divide-and-conquer strategy of the outreach tour in the United States, those close to the trade file say that dealing with Trump brings its own imperatives.\n“We have to keep calm. It’s pointless talking in public about the ways you might retaliate until you have to act,” said a second source familiar with the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n“As for people who stomp around and say ‘We will strike back’ – why would you do that? It just irritates the president.” (Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr and David Ljunggren in Ottawa and Nichola Saminather in Toronto Editing by James Dalgleish)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T04:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:24:15.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
