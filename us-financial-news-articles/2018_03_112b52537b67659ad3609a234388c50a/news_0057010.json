(the “Fund”) (NYSE:KYE) announced today its quarterly distribution of $0.25 per share for the quarter ended February 28, 2018. The distribution will be payable on April 20, 2018 to common stockholders of record on April 13, 2018, with an ex-dividend date of April 12, 2018.\nThe Fund estimates that 100% of this distribution will be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. This estimate is based on the Fund’s anticipated earnings and profits for fiscal 2018 and its accumulated earnings and profits as of November 30, 2017. The Fund’s estimate does not include a projection of gains and losses on the sale of securities for the remainder of fiscal 2018. The final determination of the tax character of the distribution will be made in early 2019 when the Fund can determine its actual earnings and profits for the full year (including gains and losses on sales of securities during fiscal 2018) and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.\nKayne Anderson Energy Total Return Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 whose common stock is traded on the NYSE. The Fund’s investment objective is to obtain a high total return with an emphasis on current income. The Fund intends to achieve this investment objective by investing in a portfolio of companies in the energy sector, principally including publicly-traded energy-related master limited partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships and their affiliates, and other companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from operating assets used in, or providing energy-related services for, the exploration, development, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storing, refining, distribution, mining or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws.
