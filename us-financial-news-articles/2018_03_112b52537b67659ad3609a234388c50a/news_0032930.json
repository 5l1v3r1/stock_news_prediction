Trachtenberg \nMeredith Corp., the country’s largest magazine publisher, is expected to lay off 200 to 300 staffers as soon as this week after recently completing the acquisition of Time Inc., according to people familiar with the situation. \nThe job cuts, designed to reduce duplicative corporate staffing, are expected to primarily impact Time Inc.’s corporate employees in New York. The reductions are part of Meredith’s efforts to trim $400 million to $500 million in costs over the next two years. \nMeredith MDP, -0.46% is also expected to reveal a new sales structure that provides greater focus on specific magazine brands, the people said. In recent years, Time Inc. embraced a sales approach that emphasized advertising categories such as pharmaceuticals rather than individual magazines. As part of the reorganization, Meredith is also preparing a new way to pitch advertisers with much larger print and digital offerings. \nMeredith, which owns broadcast TV stations and publishes such magazines as Better Homes & Gardens, Allrecipes and Shape, closed its $1.85 billion acquisition of Time Inc. on Jan. 31. One reason that Time Inc. was attractive to Meredith was the opportunity to eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars in duplicative costs, including corporate administration areas such as legal, financial and human resources. Editorial staffers across the former Time Inc. portfolio aren’t expected to be affected significantly by the coming layoffs, according to people familiar with the situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T23:08:00.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
