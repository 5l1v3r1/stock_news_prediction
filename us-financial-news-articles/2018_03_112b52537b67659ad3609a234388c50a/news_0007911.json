Trimble, III, Easterly’s Chief Executive Officer. “Since its inception, Easterly has grown the portfolio to its current size of 3.7 million square feet of real estate in 46 operating properties.

As of December 31, 2017, the portfolio had an average age of 12.1 years, was 100% occupied, and had a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.0 years. With approximately 18.0% of leases based on square footage, or 18.7% based on total annualized lease income scheduled to expire before 2020, Easterly expects to continue to provide a highly visible and stable cash-flow stream.\nAcquisitions\nIn 2017, the Company acquired four properties with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $385 million.\nOn February 3, 2017, Easterly acquired an OSHA laboratory in Sandy, Utah. The 75,000-square foot building is a state-of-the-art forensics laboratory for testing of materials and products that have contributed to worker deaths or injuries nationwide. The build-to-suit facility was completed in 2003 and is fully leased to the GSA with six years remaining on an initial 20-year lease. The lease includes two five-year renewal options with fixed rental increases that, if exercised, would carry the lease term to 2034.\nOn June 1, 2017, Easterly acquired a VA outpatient clinic in Loma Linda, California. The 327,614-square foot property is one of the premier assets in the VA health system and provides a comprehensive solution for the outpatient needs of U.S. Veterans in the surrounding region. The LEED Silver build-to-suit construction, completed in 2016, is 100% leased to the VA through May 2036 for a total initial, non-cancelable lease term of 20 years.\nOn September 28, 2017, Easterly acquired a 169,542-square foot FBI field office in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Class A, LEED Gold certified facility is located on a 7.5-acre campus and houses the FBI’s division that oversees federal operations in all of Utah, Idaho and Montana. The build-to-suit facility was constructed in 2012 and has a number of security upgrades, including perimeter fencing, a restricted visitor screening facility, and vehicle blockades. The facility is fully leased to the GSA until 2032 for a total initial, non-cancelable lease term of 20 years.\nOn November 16, 2017, Easterly acquired an 86,363-square foot VA outpatient clinic just outside of South Bend, Indiana.

With the sale of this facility, Easterly now generates 98.7% of its annualized lease income from the U.S. Government and maintains 100% occupancy.\nDevelopment\nOn April 27, 2017, Easterly was awarded the lease for an estimated 53,120-square foot FDA laboratory in Lenexa, Kansas (“FDA – Lenexa”). The FDA currently operates 13 field laboratories, located strategically throughout the country. FDA - Lenexa will become the newest laboratory in the FDA’s portfolio and, upon completion, will be leased to the GSA for a 20-year term.\nOn October 4, 2017, Easterly purchased the re-development rights to a 210,373-square foot FEMA distribution center in Tracy, California. FEMA - Tracy, one of the eight regional distributions centers located strategically throughout the country, is currently under re-development with an anticipated delivery date in the fourth quarter of 2018. Easterly has assumed all re-development activities and, upon occupancy, will commence a 20-year non-cancelable lease with the GSA on this mission critical facility.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had total indebtedness of $579.7 million comprised of $99.8 million outstanding on its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, $100.0 million outstanding on its senior unsecured term loan facility, $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes, and $204.9 million of mortgage debt (excluding unamortized premiums and discounts and deferred financing fees). At December 31, 2017, Easterly’s outstanding debt had a weighted average maturity of 7.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%. As of December 31, 2017, Easterly’s net debt to total enterprise value was 33.4% and its net debt to annualized quarterly EBITDA ratio was 6.4x, pro forma for a full quarter of operations from VA - South Bend.\nOn September 11, 2017 the Company physically settled the forward equity sales agreements entered into on March 27, 2017 by issuing 4.945 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for approximately $92.7 million in gross proceeds. The forward equity sales agreements were entered into in conjunction with the closing of an underwritten offering on a forward basis and the announcement of the VA - Loma Linda and VA - South Bend acquisitions.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company issued 1,569,514 shares of the Company’s common stock at an average price of $21.41 per share through the Company’s ATM program, raising gross proceeds of $33.6 million to maintain balance sheet strength.\nDividend\nOn February 21, 2018 the Board of Directors of Easterly approved a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2017 in the amount of $0.26 per common share. The dividend will be payable March 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 13, 2018.\nOutlook for 2018\nThe Company’s financial guidance for the 12 months ending December 31, 2018 is as follows:\nOutlook for the 12 Months Ending December 31, 2018\nLow High Net income (loss) per share – fully diluted basis $ 0.23 0.27 Plus: real estate depreciation and amortization $ 1.08 1.08 FFO per share – fully diluted basis $ 1.31 1.35 This guidance assumes $350 million of acquisitions and $75 - $100 million of development-related investment during 2018. This guidance is forward-looking and reflects management's view of current and future market conditions. The Company's actual results may differ materially from this guidance.\nNon-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measures\nThis section contains definitions of certain non-GAAP financial measures and other terms that the Company uses in this press release and, where applicable, the reasons why management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and the other purposes for which management uses the measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with GAAP. Additional detail can be found in the Company’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as well as other documents filed with or furnished to the SEC from time to time.\nCash Available for Distribution (CAD) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not intended to represent cash flow for the period and is not indicative of cash flow provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP. CAD is calculated in accordance with the current NAREIT definition as FFO minus normalized recurring real estate-related expenditures and other non-cash items and nonrecurring expenditures. CAD is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company’s ability to fund its dividends. Because all companies do not calculate CAD the same way, the presentation of CAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nEBITDA is calculated as the sum of net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, is not presented as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of operating income or cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP. EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure with respect to liquidity because the Company believes it provides useful information regarding the Company's ability to service or incur debt. Because all companies do not calculate EBITDA the same way, the presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFunds From Operations (FFO) is defined by NAREIT as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a widely recognized measure of REIT performance. Although FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, the Company believes that information regarding FFO is helpful to shareholders and potential investors.\nFunds From Operations, as Adjusted (FFO, as Adjusted) adjusts FFO to present an alternative measure of our operating performance, which, when applicable, excludes the impact of acquisition costs, straight-line rent, above-/below-market leases, non-cash interest expense and non-cash compensation. By excluding income and expense items such as straight-line rent, above-/below-market leases, non-cash interest expense, non-cash compensation and other non-cash items including amortization of lease inducements from FFO, as Adjusted, the Company believes it provides useful information as these items have no cash impact. In addition, by excluding acquisition related costs the Company believes FFO, as Adjusted provides useful information that is comparable across periods and more accurately reflects the operating performance of the Company’s properties.\nOther Definitions\nFully diluted basis assumes the exchange of all outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in the Company’s operating partnership, or common units, the full vesting of all shares of restricted stock units, and the exchange of all earned and vested LTIP units in the Company’s operating partnership for shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis, which is not the same as the meaning of “fully diluted” under GAAP. Fully diluted basis does not include outstanding LTIP units in the Company’s operating partnership that are subject to performance criteria that have not yet been met.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard time on March 1, 2018 to review the fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance, discuss recent events and conduct a question-and-answer session. The number to call is 1-877-705-6003 (domestic) and 1-201-493-6725 (international). A live webcast will be available in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.
