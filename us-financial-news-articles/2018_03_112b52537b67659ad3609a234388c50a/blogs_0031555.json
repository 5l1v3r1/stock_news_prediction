It was not clear what impact the attacks had on the firms that were targeted.\nBut Thursday's alert provided a link to an analysis by the U.S. cyber security firm Symantec last fall that said a group it had dubbed Dragonfly had targeted energy companies in the United States and Europe and in some cases broke into the core systems that control the companies' operations.\nMalicious email campaigns dating back to late 2015 were used to gain entry into organizations in the United States, Turkey and Switzerland, and likely other countries, Symantec said at the time, though it did not name Russia as the culprit.\nThe decision by the United States to publicly attribute hacking attempts of American critical infrastructure was \"unprecedented and extraordinary,\" said Amit Yoran, a former U.S. official who founded DHS's Computer Emergency Response Team.\n\"I have never seen anything like this,\" said Yoran, now chief executive of the cyber firm Tenable, said.\nA White House National Security Council spokesman did not respond when asked what specifically prompted the public blaming of Russia. U.S. officials have historically been reluctant to call out such activity in part because the United States also spies on infrastructure in other parts of the world.\nNews of the hacking campaign targeting U.S. power companies first surfaced in June in a confidential alert to industry that described attacks on industrial firms, including nuclear plants, but did not attribute blame.\n\"People sort of suspected Russia was behind it, but today's statement from the U.S. government carries a lot of weight,\" said Ben Read, manager for cyber espionage analysis with cyber security company FireEye Inc.\nEngineers targeted The campaign targeted engineers and technical staff with access to industrial controls, suggesting the hackers were interested in disrupting operations, though FireEye has seen no evidence that they actually took that step, Read said.\nA former senior DHS official familiar with the government response to the campaign said that Russia's targeting of infrastructure networks dropped off after the publication in the fall of Symantec's research and an October government alert, which detailed technical forensics about the hacking attempts but did not name Russia.\nThe official declined to say whether the campaign was still ongoing or provide specifics on which targets were breached, or how close hackers may have gotten to operational control systems.\n\"We did not see them cross into the control networks,\" DHS cyber security official Rick Driggers told reporters at a dinner on Thursday evening.\nDriggers said he was unaware of any cases of control networks being compromised in the United States and that the breaches were limited to business networks. But, he added, \"We know that there is intent there.\"\nIt was not clear what Russia's motive was. Many cyber security experts and former U.S. officials say such behavior is generally espionage-oriented with the potential, if needed, for sabotage.\nRussia has shown a willingness to leverage access into energy networks for damaging effect in the past. Kremlin-linked hackers were widely blamed for two attacks on the Ukrainian energy grid in 2015 and 2016, that caused temporary blackouts for hundreds of thousands of customers and were considered first-of-their-kind assaults.\nSenator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked the Trump administration earlier this month to provide a threat assessment gauging Russian capabilities to breach the U.S. electric grid.\nIt was the third time Cantwell and other senators had asked for such a review. The administration has not yet responded, a spokesman for Cantwell's office said on Thursday.\nLast July, there were news reports that the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp, which operates a nuclear plant in Kansas, had been targeted by hackers from an unknown origin.\nSpokeswoman Jenny Hageman declined to say at the time if the plant had been hacked but said that there had been no operational impact to the plant because operational computer systems were separate from the corporate network. Hageman on Thursday said the company does not comment on security matters.\nJohn Keeley, a spokesman for the industry group the Nuclear Energy Institute, said: \"There has been no successful cyber attack against any U.S. nuclear facility, including Wolf Creek.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T11:45:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
