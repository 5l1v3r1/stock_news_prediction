Since Merkel and her contenders launched her electoral campaign last summer, Germany has had a “do not disturb” sign on its door. \nClose allies such as French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May have had to wait as Merkel’s first attempt to form a coalition collapsed last October, forcing her into last-ditch talks with her former ruling partners and ideological rivals in the center-left Social Democratic Party.
