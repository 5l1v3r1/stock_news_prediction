Apparently, agreements have been made in the Netherlands already. The board will have to be able to explain that to us,” Grolms said.\nThyssenkrupp’s supervisory board will gather for an extraordinary meeting on April 12, with the steel joint venture, which was originally planned to be signed in the beginning of 2018, among the topics to be discussed.
