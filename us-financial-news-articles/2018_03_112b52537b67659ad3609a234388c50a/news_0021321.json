The peso strengthened 0.28 percent, while the benchmark S&P/BMV IPC index gained 1.21 percent, its biggest jump since Jan. 2. Mexican cement maker Cemex led winners on the index as its shares rose more than 4 percent. The tariff exemptions for Canada and Mexico would start immediately with an unspecified duration, a U.S. administration official said, adding that their continuation depends partly on progress in negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexican and Canadian trade officials have rejected the NAFTA linkage. Concerns that the tariffs would spark a global trade war hurt demand for commodity-linked assets elsewhere in Latin America, especially after China warned it will respond \"as necessary\". Brazilian stocks were the biggest decliners among Latin American equity markets, dropping 0.58 percent and weighed down by falling prices of iron ore and a heavy batch of corporate updates. Shares in Embraer SA dropped more than 3 percent after the planemaker reporter lower-than-expected quarterly profits due to weaker deliveries to airlines and writedowns. Shares of Localiza Rent a Car SA, however, jumped more than 5 percent to an all-time high after fourth-quarter net income surged 27 percent. Outside of Mexico, only Argentina's peso gained among Latin American currencies on Thursday, up 0.29 percent.
