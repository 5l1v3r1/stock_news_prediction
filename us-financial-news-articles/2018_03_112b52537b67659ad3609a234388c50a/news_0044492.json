They could then receive transfers during a downturn.\nIn extreme circumstances, countries could borrow from the fund and repay their loans with future contributions, she said.\nTransfers from the fund should be conditional on members sticking to EU fiscal rules. Lagarde also recommended that countries pay a premium in good times based on the benefits they receive in bad times.\nThese twin steps would aim to avoid permanent transfers.\nOn a capital markets union, she called for enhanced regulation and upgraded oversight arrangements to handle a potential influx of financial services firms to continental Europe after Brexit.\n“One of the consequences of Brexit is that many financial services will likely move to continental Europe in the months ahead,” Lagarde said.\nOn a banking union, she welcomed signs of progress.\n“Agreement on a schedule for common deposit insurance, together with a roadmap for reducing vulnerabilities in the banking sector, would be an even bigger move in the right direction,” she added.
