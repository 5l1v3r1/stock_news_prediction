(NASDAQ:SNNA) today reported the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\n“We are pleased to report the results of our fourth quarter and first year ended as a public company,” said Frederick C. Beddingfield III, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Sienna. “We continue to execute across our innovative multi-asset pipeline. We are well under way with our Phase 2b trial of SNA-120 and recently entered the clinic with two separate proof-of-concept trials of SNA-125. These product candidates from our Topical by Design™ platform have the potential to address very large patient populations in atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and pruritus. We are eager for data readouts from our five clinical programs, beginning in the second half of this year, and believe there is additional potential in our Topical by Design™ and Topical Photoparticle Therapy™ platforms.”\nBusiness Highlights\nSienna announced on Mar. 12, 2018, that the first patient had been dosed in the Company’s Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of topical product candidate SNA-125 in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. SNA-125 is designed to inhibit Janus kinase 3, or JAK3, and tropomyosin receptor kinase A, or TrkA, with minimal to no systemic exposure. The Company expects to report top-line results, or TLRs, in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nSienna announced on Feb. 14, 2018, that the first patient had been dosed in the Company’s first-in-human, Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of SNA-125 in the treatment of psoriasis. The Company expects to report TLRs in the third quarter of 2018.\nSienna announced on Dec. 12, 2017, the formation of a Corporate Advisory Board that will provide scientific, clinical and strategic advice to the Company’s senior management. The Corporate Advisory Board comprises accomplished and highly regarded medical opinion leaders within dermatology and aesthetics who have specific scientific knowledge and clinical experience in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, pruritus, acne and laser medicine.\nSienna announced on Oct. 24, 2017, that the first patient had been dosed in the Company’s Phase 2b clinical trial of topical product candidate SNA-120 (pegcantratinib) in the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis and in the treatment of psoriasis itself. SNA-120 is designed to selectively inhibit TrkA with minimal to no systemic exposure. The Company expects to report TLRs in the first quarter of 2019.\nOn Aug. 1, 2017, Sienna closed the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, of 4,983,333 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to an additional 650,000 shares of common stock. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $66.4 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nSienna’s pipeline currently includes five clinical-stage programs:\n(from the Company’s Topical by Design™ platform)\nSNA-120 for the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis and the underlying psoriasis; Phase 2b TLRs expected in the first quarter of 2019 SNA-125 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and associated pruritus; Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept TLRs expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 SNA-125 for the treatment of psoriasis and associated pruritus; Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept TLRs expected in the third quarter of 2018\n(from the Company’s Topical Photoparticle Therapy™ platform)\nSNA-001 for the treatment of acne; pivotal TLRs expected in the second half of 2018 SNA-001 for the reduction of light-pigmented hair; pivotal TLRs expected in the second half of 2018\nSelected Financial Results\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, were approximately $14.0 million, which includes research and development, or R&D, expenses totaling approximately $9.5 million and general and administrative, or G&A, expenses totaling approximately $4.5 million. Total operating expenses for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016, were approximately $7.4 million, which included R&D expenses totaling approximately $3.8 million and G&A expenses totaling approximately $3.6 million. The year-over-year increase in R&D expenses was due primarily to increased development costs related to the ongoing pivotal trials for SNA-001 and initiation of the clinical trials for SNA-120 and SNA-125. The year-over-year increase in G&A expenses was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a reduction in professional fees.\nTotal operating expenses for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2017, were approximately $48.6 million, which includes R&D expenses totaling approximately $30.5 million and G&A expenses totaling approximately $18.1 million. Total operating expenses for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2016, were approximately $20.7 million, which included R&D expenses totaling approximately $11.0 million and G&A expenses totaling approximately $9.7 million. The year-over-year increase in R&D expenses was due primarily to increased development costs related to the ongoing pivotal trials for SNA-001 and initiation of the clinical trials for SNA-120 and SNA-125. The year-over-year increase in G&A expenses was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs, an increase in costs related to becoming a public company and a $3.0 million non-cash increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the Company’s acquisition of Creabilis plc in December 2016. Sienna expects the non-cash component related to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability to continue to impact G&A expenses in future quarters.\nCash burn during the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, was approximately $12.8 million. Cash burn during the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2017, was approximately $43.4 million. Sienna’s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec. 31, 2017, totaled approximately $74.5 million.\nAbout Sienna Biopharmaceuticals\nSienna Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovations in biotechnology to the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class, targeted, topical products in medical dermatology and aesthetics.
