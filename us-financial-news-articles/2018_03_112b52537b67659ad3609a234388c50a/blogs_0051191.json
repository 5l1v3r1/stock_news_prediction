With \"more customers than we can service right now\" on the company's manifest, Poynter said Straollite will be flying even more often in 2018. This year World View aims to complete flights last \"one or two months,\" Poynter said – far beyond the company's record of a five-day flight, set last year. \nIts successor, Voyager, is intended to fly up to eight people for over five hours to the edge of space in a capsule complete with massive windows to enjoy the view. While Poynter declined to offer a time frame for Voyager's first flight, the company is offering tickets for $75,000 each, after a $7,500 deposit. World View's December launchpad explosion \nThe investment comes after a mid-December a tear in a World View balloon, which caused an explosion felt throughout much of Tucson, Arizona. \nPoynter insisted that the \"explosion did not delay\" World View's operations \"by even one iota.\" While investors asked about it, it didn't hurt the fund-raising effort. \n\"It was a demonstration flight but not for Stratollite,\" Poynter said. \"It was a different customer I can't speak about, as I'm under a [non disclosure agreement].\" \nThe company reported only a couple of injuries – \"two employees were treated for ringing in their ears\" – for the launchpad incident that nearby residents described as earth-shaking. The explosion came after a test as World View was \"in the process of releasing gas from the balloon,\" the company said. The test used hydrogen, which reacts violently when exposed to air. \n\"But we don't use hydrogen with our Stratollites,\" Poynter said. \"This was different from our core business. And we now know exactly how it occurred, why, and how to stop it from ever happening again.\" \nThis is the first space-related investment from lead Accel Partners, which held early investments in technology companies such as Facebook, Dropbox, Slack, Spotify and Venmo. Accel partner Sameer Ghandi will join World View's board of directors, the company announced, a move Poynter called a \"really exciting demonstration of space technology being embraced by Silicon Valley.\" \n\"We share World View's belief that innovation in the stratosphere has the potential to unlock many new applications with unprecedented benefit,\" Ghandi said in a statement. \nThe fundraising effort also included notable contributions from Canaan Partners and Norwest Venture Partners, both of which invested in previous rounds with World View. \nWorld View also announced former satellite imaging executive Tom Ingersoll was appointed as executive chairman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T20:41:37.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
