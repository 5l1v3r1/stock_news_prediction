REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo TMK said IPSCO did not import steel, so should benefit from President Trump’s move. The company had yet to finish evaluating how the import duties would affect other parts of its business, it said in a written reply to a Reuters request.\nTMK also said an initial public offering of IPSCO, announced this year but put on hold due to volatility on global markets, was “postponed but not canceled”.
