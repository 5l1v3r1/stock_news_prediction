Output hit a record 10.057 million bpd in November, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\"If the production growth in Brazil, Canada and Norway is factored into the equation, these four countries will even exceed demand growth,\" Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\n\"According to the IEA, the call on OPEC is therefore set to decline to 31.8 million barrels per day in 2019, thereby falling below OPECs current production level. It is thus an illusion for OPEC to think about abandoning the agreement to cut production.\"\nWeekly U.S. crude inventory data is expected to show a second consecutive weekly rise in the week to March 2, according to a Reuters poll. The American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its weekly inventory data at 4.30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) on Tuesday, and the U.S. Energy Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports its data at 10.30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday.
