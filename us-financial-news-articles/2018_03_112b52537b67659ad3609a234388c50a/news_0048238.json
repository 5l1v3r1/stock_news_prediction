NEW YORK EXPANSION \nUcommune officially opened its first location in New York City on Wednesday as it seeks a bigger U.S. presence to tap in to cross-border trade and help businesses with the need for an American or Chinese partner. \nFlexible workspace has been growing at an average annual rate of 23 percent since 2010, according to Jones Lang Lasalle Inc JJL.N, and including coworking is now the primary growth driver in the U.S. office market. \nFor an interactive graphic showing flexible office space growth, click: ( tmsnrt.rs/2FNerRO ) \nUcommune (Beijing) Venture Investment Co Ltd opened the New York financial district site with Serendipity Labs, a U.S. firm that is rolling out a nationwide network of more than 125 coworking sites over the next three years. \nThe company already has sites in San Francisco and Los Angeles and is looking to partner again with Serendipity Labs in a U.S. city that has still to be announced, said Daqing Mao, chairman and chief executive of the Beijing-based company, in an interview with Reuters. \nNew York is viewed as a fintech capital where blockchain and finance converge, and Chinese companies want to be linked into that network, according to Ucommune. The company envisions American companies using its host of sites in 30 Chinese cities as well. \nThe New York opening follows two acquisitions in China this year that along with a Series C round of funding lifted the company’s valuation to about $ 1.7 billion, Ucommune said. \nThe company’s focus outside of China is Southeast Asia, where it has sites in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei, and plans to open sites in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, Mao said. \nWhile the coworking leader in China, Ucommune has only about 7 percent of that market, he said. \n“For us it’s all about building an ecosystem,” Mao said.
