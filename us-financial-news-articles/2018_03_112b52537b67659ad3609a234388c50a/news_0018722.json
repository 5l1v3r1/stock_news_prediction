It is one of the leading foreign insurers in the Southeast Asian country.\nThe British insurer’s talks with retirement fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP) are not exclusive and details of a possible deal could be finalised as early as this month, said the people who declined to be named as the talks are not public.\nKWAP CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad told Reuters that the fund had submitted its offer for the Prudential unit’s stake, but declined to give details. Prudential did not comment on the talks, but said it was committed to its local business.\nThere is no certainty that Prudential’s talks with KWAP will result in a deal, and the British insurer could also weigh a possible listing on the Malaysian bourse to divest the stake, the people said.
