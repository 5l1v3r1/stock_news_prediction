Democrat Phil Murphy, who ultimately won, committed during the campaign to move the Garden State toward 100 percent clean energy. \nHolland said the clean energy effort is also aided by the fact that the cost of wind and solar energy has fallen in recent years, making those technologies competitive with electricity fueled by coal or natural gas. \n“We are in this whole new world where clean energy makes sense regardless of your politics and regardless of the discussion around climate,” Holland said. \nThe clean energy push comes in addition to LCV’s previously announced decision to spend some $20 million on state-level races this election cycle to push its broader environmental agenda - a figure that is nearly double its previous record for investment in local elections. \nThe Washington-based group said it will leave it up to individual state organizations to define what precisely falls under the umbrella of “clean energy” - though fossil fuels including natural gas will be excluded.
