Yields on 10-year Treasury notes inched up to 2.856 percent, but remained short of last week’s top at 2.90 percent.\nIn currency markets the reaction was to offload both the yen and the U.S. dollar as appetite for riskier assets revived.\n“The yen is being quietly sold as risk hedges are unwound and looks particularly vulnerable on the crosses,” Citi analysts said in a note.\nShort-covering against the euro was especially sharp as the common currency jumped 1.4 percent overnight to stand at 131.51 yen.\nThat allowed the U.S. dollar to bounce to 105.61 yen, having been at its lowest since late 2016 at one point. Yet the U.S. currency ran into selling against almost everything else, with notable breaks by the euro and sterling.\nThe euro was up at $1.2450, after cracking the March top at $1.2446, and bulls were eyeing the peak for the year so far at $1.2556.\nThe broad-based softness kept the dollar retrained against a basket of currencies at 89.063, after touching a five-week trough of 88.979.\nThe improved mood on trade gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing, while spot gold inched up to $1,353.61 an ounce.\nIn oil markets, U.S. crude futures put on 29 cents to $65.84 a barrel, while Brent crude added 18 cents to $70.30 a barrel.\nReporting by Wayne Cole Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:47:10.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
