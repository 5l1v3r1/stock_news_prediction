Our idea is to seek approval of one or two new varieties this year,” he said.\nFounded in 1969 and maintained by private and public institutions, CTC is the world’s largest sugarcane research center. Among its main shareholders are BNDESPar, the investment arm of Brazil’s development bank, Copersucar, the world’s largest sugar merchant, and Raízen, a joint venture between Cosan SA Indústria e Comércio and Royal Dutch Shell Plc.\nCTC has previously said it was considering an IPO as a way to raise cash for its research, and Leite said that could happen around 2021.\nAmong other varieties being developed by the company are a GM cane resistant to another insect affecting plantations, known locally as‘bicudo’ (bollard), and one that would be resistant to the weed killer glyphosate.
