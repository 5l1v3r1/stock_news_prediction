Lukaku is one of the best strikers in the world, we needed to be around to pick up the ball, we were not and Rashford could use the situation twice,” said Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.\nIt wasn’t only the use of long balls that gave the game the feeling of an encounter from earlier times.\nDespite the abundance of international talent on display, the game was played at the kind of frantic pace typical of English derby games down the years.\nChallenges were flying in from the outset and composure was in short supply but Mourinho felt that mood to the game helped his side.\n“In the first half, the game gave us the opportunity to be direct, fast and score goals,” he said.\nWhile Liverpool enjoyed the bulk of possession, especially in the second half, United’s back four showed other timeless qualities providing solid, organized defense and gave little space to their opponents.\n“Our team was always in control. Even in set pieces, corners, dangerous situations we were in control so I think we deserved it,” said Mourinho.\nReporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:18:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
