Attridge said he expected to get a report back on these options within six months.\nAspen, which counts developed Europe as its biggest revenue generator, said normalized headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six-months ended Dec.31, rose to 872 cents from 692 cents, buoyed by a strong result from therapeutic focused brands and positive performance of the pharmaceutical business in its home market.\nHEPS is the main profit gauge in South Africa, which strips out certain one-off items.\nGroup revenue grew 11 percent to 21.9 billion rand ($1.85 billion) from 19.8 billion rand.\nTherapeutic focused brands comprising the Anaesthetics, Thrombosis and High Potency and Cytotoxic portfolios, delivered revenue of 9.9 billion rand, contributing 45 percent of total group revenue.\nSub-Saharan Africa was the primary growth driver in regional pharmaceutical brands, underpinned by the South African business which raised revenue 21 percent.\nAspen’s shares were up 2.78 percent to 264.15 rand by 1227 GMT.\n“The sales achieved in the first half of the 2018 financial year are expected to be maintained in the second half in spite of the continued supply constraints which will prevent realization of full potential,” Aspen said.\nIt also said performance in the second half would benefit from the additional rights to the AstraZeneca Anaesthetics ( AZN.L ), which it acquired in October.\nReporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Jane Merriman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:22:42.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
