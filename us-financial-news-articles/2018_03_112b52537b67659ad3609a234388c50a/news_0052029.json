(NASDAQ:GEVO) today announced financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Key highlights 2017 and key subsequent events included:\nAt the beginning of 2017, Gevo had approximately $35.7 million of debt due or puttable during the 2017 fiscal year. During 2017, through a combination of refinancing, pay-down, and exchange transactions, Gevo was able to eliminate and restructure its debt so that there was no outstanding debt due until at least 2020. At December 31, 2017, Gevo had $16.7 million of senior secured debt that is set to mature in 2020.\nGevo began to see the results of its ongoing efforts to reduce its overall cash burn which contributed to the decline in loss from operations of $1.7 million in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nOn January 3, 2018, Gevo announced that it was continuing several initiatives to improve the cash flow profile of its business in 2018 compared to 2017. As a result of these initiatives, Gevo expects that the cash burn for 2018 will be approximately 30% lower than in 2017.\nOn November 8, 2017, Gevo announced that its alcohol-to-jet fuel derived from renewable isobutanol (“ATJ”) was used by nine airlines for Fly Green Day, sponsored by the O’Hare Fuel Committee, at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, and executed with the cooperation of Air BP, ASIG, and Kinder Morgan. This event was the first time renewable jet fuel has been supplied at Chicago O’Hare using the existing airport fueling infrastructure, such as pipelines, terminals, tankage, and hydrant systems.\nIn 2017, the number of pumps in the Houston market with ethanol free gasoline went from just a few at the beginning of the year to approximately 200 pumps at the end of 2017. On February 8, 2018, Gevo announced that it had strengthened its existing relationship with Musket Corporation, a national fuel distributor under the umbrella of the Love’s Family of Companies, by amending its existing isobutanol supply agreement to provide Musket with the exclusive right to sell Gevo’s renewable isobutanol within a 300 mile radius of Houston, Texas.\nOn December 11, 2017, Gevo announced that GE Aviation had commenced jet engine combustor component testing with a jet fuel comprised 100% of Gevo’s ATJ. The testing is being performed as part of the Federal Aviation Authority’s Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise Program or CLEEN.\nFor the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2017, Gevo achieved a cash EBITDA loss 2 of $16.2 million.\n2017 Production and Sales\nDuring 2017 Gevo produced 15.6 million gallons of ethanol, 47 thousand tons of animal feed, and 1,050 tons of corn oil resulting in a revenue of $26.3 million. Consistent with Gevo’s market development efforts, during 2017, Gevo produced approximately 206,000 gallons of isobutanol at its production facility in Luverne, Minnesota (the “Luverne Facility”). During 2017, Gevo sold the equivalent of approximately 49,368 gallons of isobutanol, either directly as isobutanol or as renewable hydrocarbons (jet fuel, isooctane and isooctene) resulting in revenue of $1.1 million.\nMarket Development, Sales and Production Strategy for 2018\nIn 2018, Gevo intends to continue to develop the markets for its isobutanol, jet fuel, isooctane, and other products made from isobutanol and ethanol. Ultimately, Gevo’s primary target is to enter into binding supply contracts for isobutanol and related hydrocarbon products that represent the majority of the production volumes to be produced at the expanded Luverne Facility that Gevo plans to construct (the “Luverne Facility Expansion”). The focus for market development continues to be:\nIsobutanol for the ethanol free gasoline market, primarily in Reformulated Gasoline or RFG areas. Gevo plans to increase its distribution network, and add additional regions, broadening its distribution footprint. The isobutanol in inventory would be used in part to develop these sales.\nIsooctane for gasoline and chemicals are expected to continue to be a priority. The vast majority of sales are expected to go into the European Union. Gevo expects that the demand for this product will continue to grow, and it may expand or modify the hydrocarbon demonstration plant at South Hampton Resources in Silsbee, Texas to increase capacity for isooctane. Gevo plans to use the renewable isobutanol in inventory for the feedstock for this product. Gevo expects to continue to work on securing a set of offtake contracts that would support the Luverne Facility Expansion.\nATJ. Gevo plans to sell ATJ for market development purposes and demonstrations. In certain niche markets, Gevo may begin commercial sales, depending on price and volumes that can be supported from the hydrocarbon demonstration plant at South Hampton Resources in Silsbee, Texas. Gevo expects to continue to work on securing a set of offtake contracts that would support the Luverne Facility Expansion.\nGevo plans to continue to pursue licensing transactions for its isobutanol and ethanol-to-olefins (ETO) technologies. In partnership with Praj Industries, Gevo expects to enter into a commercial license agreement with Praj Industries whereby Praj will make Gevo’s proprietary isobutanol technology available for licensing to processors of sugar cane juice and molasses in India and elsewhere.\nIn 2018, Gevo expects to sell approximately 19 million gallons or more of ethanol, and approximately 56 thousand tons of its animal feed product. As previously announced, in 2018, Gevo expects to improve the cash flow out of the Luverne Facility by optimizing the ethanol production processes, developing value added products for ethanol, animal feed, and corn oil produced at the Luverne Facility plant and further reducing the cost of the Luverne Facility’s carbohydrates.\nGevo expects to use its inventory of isobutanol to meet its market development needs in 2018. In 2017, Gevo ran up an inventory of isobutanol. During the production runs at the Luverne Facility in 2017, Gevo also met its variable cost production targets for isobutanol. As previously disclosed, running isobutanol at a scale of 1.5 MGPY, the current capacity of the Luverne Facility, costs Gevo cash because not all of the fixed costs are covered given the relatively low run rate. Gevo is prepared to ramp-up isobutanol production in response to positive demand and price appreciation. Gevo will be focused on developing markets and generating cash using the current inventory. Gevo expects to be selling isobutanol into the gasoline blendstock market, as well as selling isooctane, jet fuel and other products made from inventoried isobutanol.\nNASDAQ Market Price Compliance\nOn June 21, 2017, Gevo received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market, notifying it that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of Gevo’s common stock was not maintained at the minimum required closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share as required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, Gevo had an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, to regain compliance with this requirement. On December 20, 2017, the Nasdaq Stock Market granted Gevo an additional 180 calendar days, or until June 18, 2018, to regain compliance. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of Gevo’s common stock must be $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time before June 18, 2018. The Nasdaq determination to grant the second compliance period was based on Gevo’s meeting of the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and Gevo’s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenues 2017 were $6.7 million compared with $5.8 million in the same period in 2016. During 2017, revenues derived at the Luverne plant were $6.6 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million from the same period in 2016. This was primarily a result of higher ethanol production and increased distiller grain prices in 2017 versus the same period in 2016.\nDuring 2017, hydrocarbon revenues were $0.05 million, $0.4 million lower than the same period in 2016. Gevo’s hydrocarbon revenues are comprised of sales of jet fuel, isooctane and isooctene.\nGevo generated grant and other revenue of $0.1 million during 2017, an increase of less than $0.05 million as compared to the same period in 2016.\nCost of goods sold was $9.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $8.2 million in the same quarter in 2016. Cost of goods sold included approximately $7.8 million associated with the production of ethanol, isobutanol and related products and approximately $1.5 million in depreciation expense.\nGross loss was $2.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, versus $2.3 million in the same quarter in 2016.\nResearch and development expense was $0.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1.5 million in the same quarter in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $1.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the same quarter in 2016.\nLoss from operations in 2017 was $4.8 million, compared with $6.5 million in the same quarter in 2016.\nNon-GAAP cash EBITDA loss in 2017 was $3.1 million, compared with $4.7 million in the same quarter in 2016.\nInterest expense in 2017 was $0.8 million, down $0.5 million as compared to the same quarter last year.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the derivative warrant liability increased by less than $0.05 million, resulting in a non-cash loss from a change in the fair value of derivative warrant liability.\nDuring the three months end December 31, 2017, Gevo recognized a $1.2 million gain from the change in fair value of the 2020 Notes embedded derivative.\nThe net loss 2017 was $4.4 million, compared with $2.3 million during the same period in 2016.\nThe non-GAAP adjusted net loss 2017 was $5.6 million, compared with $7.8 million during the same period in 2016.\nThe cash position at December 31, 2017 was $11.6 million and the total principal face value of the debt outstanding was $17.2 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nHosting today’s conference call at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2:30 p.m. MDT) will be Dr. Patrick Gruber, Chief Executive Officer, Bradford Towne, Chief Accounting Officer, and Geoff Williams, General Counsel.
