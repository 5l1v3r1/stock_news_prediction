McCain to Cam Ranh Bay, a crucial logistics complex during the Vietnam War.\nA U.S. Navy band will play a concert in Danang during the Vinson's visit, and sailors from the carrier are scheduled to spend time at a treatment centre for people who were exposed to Agent Orange chemicals during the war.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:31:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
