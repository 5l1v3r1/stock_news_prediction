There were also 3,000 spots free in former U.S. military sites, Mayer told the newspaper.\nHuman rights groups and other opponents have sharply criticized plans to open federal centers based on the Bavarian model, arguing that the Bavarian sites tend to isolate residents in difficult conditions.\nMayer said the government should also work to increase the 400 slots now available for rejected asylum seekers who were being detained ahead of deportation, often due to convictions for various crimes. That number is “clearly too low,” he said.\nSeehofer and other Bavarian CSU politicians have taken a hardline stance on migration ahead of a regional election on Bavaria in October, keen to woo back the large number of voters who fled the party for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the September national election.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:33:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
