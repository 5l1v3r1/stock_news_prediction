Co-lead director Jeff Fettig will assume that role at the company, now known as DowDuPont Inc. DWDP, +2.34% and soon to be broken apart. \nLiveris lieutenant Jim Fitterling will be chief executive of the materials-science company that is expected to be created when the breakup takes place next year. \nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news of the executive changes early Monday. \nDow’s board and Liveris had gone through a search process that involved Fitterling, 56, who is chief operating officer for the materials business, and Howard Ungerleider, DowDuPont’s chief financial officer, according to people familiar with the matter. The candidates, both of whom have spent their entire careers at Dow and held several roles, met with directors and made presentations in recent months, the people said.
