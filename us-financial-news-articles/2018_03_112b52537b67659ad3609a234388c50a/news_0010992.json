Tinseth declined to say when it might make a decision, but industry sources say it could start offering the jet this year.\n“We continue to make progress on the programme. Things around configuration are coming together,” Tinseth said, adding Boeing had not decided whether to offer two engine choices or stick with a single engine maker, as on its 737 and 777.\nThe mid-market plane would offer 40 percent lower costs per trip than some wide-bodies - although with shorter range - and it would offer airlines 30-40 percent more revenue than a single-aisle jet“with little or no additional cost”.\nAirbus says its largest single-aisle, the A321neo, has already scooped up demand in the market above 200 seats.\nTinseth said Boeing was meanwhile making progress in filling a production gap between the current 777 large wide-body model and its proposed 777X replacement, due to enter service in 2020. A contributing factor is a recent surge in cargo demand.\n“There are a lot of aircraft in the pipeline right now,” he said, adding the wider aircraft market is“very strong”.\nThat strength coincides with a slew of available capital as new investors flood into the aircraft market looking for higher yields, despite the growing prospect of interest rate rises.\n“The asset class is real. It’s not a niche class any more,” Tim Myers, Boeing Capital Corp president, said on the same call.\n“We are in the most liquid financing environment I have ever seen in the industry.”\nMyers said Boeing was in talks with countries representing some of its suppliers to help provide last-resort export funding as the U.S. Export Import Bank remains offline for large deals, due to delays in the confirmation of top officials.\nBoeing is discussing potential funding with Australia after Britain and Italy stepped up last year, but Myers said it was nonetheless“extremely important” to unblock EXIM, which served as a valuable buffer against unexpected shocks in the market.\nMeanwhile, insurance companies could finance 5 percent of deliveries this year, up from 2 percent last year, he added.
