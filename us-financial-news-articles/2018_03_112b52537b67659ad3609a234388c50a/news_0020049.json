Clifford had agreed, in exchange for a payment of $130,000, not to publicly discuss her allegations that she had a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006 and 2007. \nRead: Stormy Daniels sues Trump over ‘hush agreement’ \nThe arbitration order, first reported by NBC News, became public a day after Clifford filed a lawsuit against Trump in Los Angeles County Superior Court asking a judge to declare the nondisclosure agreement invalid. In the suit, Clifford alleged that Cohen had initiated an arbitration proceeding in late February in a continuing effort to silence her. \nClifford’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Wednesday that the arbitration order has no force because the underlying nondisclosure agreement is void. He also said Clifford hadn’t been served with any notice of the proceeding or been given an opportunity to respond. “We don’t believe the order is worth the paper it’s printed on,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T03:56:20.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
