It also followed J.M. Smucker , which bought Big Heart Pet Brands for $5.8 billion in 2015 in its largest deal ever. \nThe reason for all this kibble capital investment? The $30.6 billion U.S. pet food market is expected to grow 2.3% a year over the next five years, according to Euromonitor, easily outpacing the 1% clip for packaged human food. And much of that growth will come from the premium side of the business as humans project their gourmet appetites onto Fido and Felix.
