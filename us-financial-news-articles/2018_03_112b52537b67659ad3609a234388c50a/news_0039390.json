The Company deploys machine learning and proprietary decisioning technology to facilitate affordable digital credit for one of the world's largest untapped consumer credit markets: China's 500 million Emerging Middle-class Mobile Active consumers (EMMAs). China Rapid Finance operates a pure play marketplace, and does not take credit risk. The Company utilizes its technology to efficiently select quality EMMAs for its platform. China Rapid Finance facilitates smaller, shorter-term initial loans to these EMMAs and then enables larger, longer-term loans for repeat borrowers who demonstrate positive credit behavior. This \"low and grow\" strategy enables the Company to attract and retain high quality EMMAs who generate significant customer lifetime value. China Rapid Finance was founded by Dr. Zane Wang, who has decades of consumer credit experience in both the U.S. and China, and is governed by a global board of directors.
