(NASDAQ:SELB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on unlocking the full potential of biologic therapies by avoiding unwanted immune responses, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided a corporate update.\n“Several important achievements have been made over the course of the past several months, and we are excited to be in a strong position to execute on our 2018 milestones,” said Werner Cautreels, Ph.D., President and CEO of Selecta. “We remain on track with the development of SEL-212 for chronic severe gout, with higher dose data from our Phase 2 trial to be presented in April and plans underway to initiate our Phase 3 program in 2018. We also recently announced that our next clinical candidate, SEL-403, has entered the clinic for the treatment of patients with mesothelioma at the National Cancer Institute. This also provides us with the opportunity to demonstrate for a second time the translation of our technology in the clinic. When coupled with the Board and management enhancements that were made over the course of the past year, we believe we have positioned Selecta for a momentous year in 2018.”\nRecent Business Highlights and Activities\nCohorts Added to SEL-212 Phase 2 Trial with Initial Data to be Reported in April 2018: As of March 9, 2018, a total of 111 patients had been dosed in Selecta’s ongoing Phase 2 trial of SEL-212 (SVP-Rapamycin in combination with pegsiticase) for the treatment of chronic severe gout. Selecta has now fully enrolled cohorts that are receiving three monthly doses of either 0.125 or 0.15 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of SVP-Rapamycin in combination with either 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone. The company plans to report further data from this ongoing trial at the upcoming Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology (PANLAR) Congress on April 9 th or 10 th , 2018 and will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET on the day of the presentation.\nInitiated Dosing of SEL-212 Cohort Expected to Receive Five Combination Doses: In February 2018, Selecta began enrolling patients in the current Phase 2 trial who are expected to receive five monthly doses of SVP-Rapamycin in combination with pegsiticase. The patients will be receiving SVP-Rapamycin doses ranging from 0.1mg/kg-0.15mg/kg in combination with 0.2mg/kg of pegsiticase. The company expects to present data from these patients at a medical meeting in Q3 2018.\nSEL-212 End of Phase 2 (EOP2) Meeting Planned for Mid-2018 and Plans for Phase 3 Program Initiation in 2018: The Selecta team is currently compiling the data package for an EOP2 meeting with the FDA, targeted for mid-2018, which will define the company’s design for the Phase 3 program. The team has also begun preparations for the Phase 3 program which the company plans to initiate in 2018.\nSEL-403 Phase 1 Trial Initiated: On March 8, 2018, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial of SEL-403, Selecta’s combination product candidate consisting of SVP-Rapamycin and LMB-100, for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma who have undergone at least one regimen of chemotherapy. LMB-100, which was in-licensed by Selecta in 2017, is a recombinant immunotoxin that targets mesothelin, a protein expressed in nearly all mesotheliomas and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and a high percentage of other malignancies, including lung, breast and ovarian cancers. This open-label dose-escalation Phase 1 trial is being conducted under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and is expected to enroll at least 18 patients. The trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability of this treatment and provide data on pharmacokinetics, anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels, as well as an objective response rate assessment.\nPublished SEL-403 Preclinical Data in January 2018: Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences (PNAS) published a paper in January 2018 co-authored by the company and researchers from the NCI. The paper, entitled “Tolerogenic nanoparticles restore the anti-tumor activity of recombinant immunotoxins by mitigating immunogenicity,” focuses on SEL-403 preclinical work conducted by Selecta and Dr. Ira Pastan’s lab at the NCI. Dr. Pastan is Senior Investigator, Head, Molecular Biology Section, at NCI’s Center for Cancer Research and a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences.\nEnhanced Leadership of the Company: Selecta announced the addition of two management team members in the fourth quarter of 2017: Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Strategy John Leaman, M.D., and Chief Commercial Officer Stephen Smolinski. Dr. Leaman most recently served as Head of Corporate Development at InfaCare Pharmaceutical Corp., a specialty pharmaceutical company that was acquired by Mallinckrodt plc. Mr. Smolinski most recently served as Vice President and Head of Sanofi/Genzyme’s North American Rheumatology Business Unit. In early January, the company announced that Dr. Omid Farokhzad, a member of Selecta’s Board and a cofounder of the company, was appointed Chairman of the Board effective December 31, 2017.\nReceived Payment from Spark Therapeutics: In the fourth quarter of 2017, Selecta received a cash payment of $2.5 million under a license agreement, and proceeds from share purchases under a stock purchase agreement in the amount of $5.0 million ($7.5 million in the aggregate), bringing the total amount of proceeds received by Selecta from Spark Therapeutics to $30.0 million. These payments are associated with the December 2016 license and stock purchase agreements that provided Spark Therapeutics with exclusive worldwide rights to SVP-Rapamycin for co-administration with Spark’s gene therapy vectors for Hemophilia A and up to four additional pre-specified and undisclosed indications.\nFourth Quarter Financial Results:\nRevenue: For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s total revenue was less than $0.1 million, which compares with $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline is primarily the result of the termination of the Company’s collaboration with Sanofi, and reduced revenue recognized from the company’s nicotine vaccine candidate grant award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\nResearch and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $13.6 million, which compares with $11.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily the result of greater clinical costs related to the company’s Phase 2 trial of SEL-212, planning for the SEL-212 Phase 3 program and incremental headcount-related expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.7 million, which compares with $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease is primarily the result of greater headcount and related salaries needed to support a clinical-stage public company offset by a reduction in sublicensing payments made to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resulting from the agreement with Spark Therapeutics.\nNet Loss: For the fourth quarter of 2017, Selecta reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(19.5) million, or $(0.88) per share, compared to a net loss of $(14.1) million, or $(0.77) per share, for the same period in 2016.\nCash Position: Selecta had $97.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, investments and restricted cash as of December 31, 2017, which compares with a balance of $104.8 million at September 30, 2017. Selecta continues to expect that its cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, investments and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund the company’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into mid-2019.\nConference Call Reminder\nSelecta management will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET today to provide a corporate update and review the company’s fourth quarter and year end 2017 financial results.
