This will continue, we expect, in 2018,” he said.\nDetsky Mir saw its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin in the fourth quarter fall to 13.7 percent from 14.1 percent a year earlier, he said.\nLike-for-like sales growth slowed to 7.2 percent from 9 percent, although the company managed to increase its net profit by 19 percent, its results showed on Monday.\nChirakhov said its market share stood at about 20 percent in 2017, according to preliminary estimates.\nA number of players are expected to leave the market this year, he said, adding this could help Detsky Mir.\nRussia’s economy grew 1.5 percent in 2017 after two years of recession and growth is expected to accelerate this year.\nRetail sales rose 2.8 percent in January and are expected to grow by 2.7 percent this year, with anticipated interest rate cuts seen boosting consumer demand.
