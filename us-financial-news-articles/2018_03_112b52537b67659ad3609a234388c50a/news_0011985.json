Investors now believe U.S. President Donald Trump may back down from imposing a tariff on imports of steel and aluminium after strong reactions from Canada and Mexico, and as leading Republicans leaned on Trump to rethink his decision. Asia shares ex-Japan rose 1.3 percent, while U.S. stocks ended Monday higher, with all three major indexes closing up more than 1 percent. In Southeast Asia, Singapore shares snapped a five-day losing streak to rise as much as 1.4 percent, with top lenders leading the gains. DBS Group Holdings, United overseas Bank and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation rose over 1.3 percent each. Vietnam was up 0.9 percent, recovering from steep losses in the previous session as Vingroup JSC and Petrovietnam Gas rose 1.6 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. The index closed 2.5 percent lower in the previous session. The Philippine stock index, however, fell 0.4 percent after data showed inflation in February ticked above the central bank's 2-4 percent target. \"Uncertainty considering that the inflation number, if you use the 2006 base year, has already surpassed the 4 percent limit by the central bank\" has spurred selling for the day, said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Asiasec Equities Inc in Manila. \"That may mean that in the policy meeting this month, BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) may raise interest rates. If not, in the near term, the central bank may be compelled to do something to prevent any escalation of inflation.\" Food and beverages company Universal Robina Corp fell 3.4 percent, while real estate firm SM Investments posted a 0.8 percent loss.
