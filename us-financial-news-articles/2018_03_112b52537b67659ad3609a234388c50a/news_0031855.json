(Nasdaq:IDXG) (“Interpace” or the “Company”), a fully integrated commercial and bioinformatics company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services, today announced financial results and business progress for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 as well as recent accomplishments.\n“2017 definitively positioned IDXG as a force in the growing molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics sector as we delivered strong, sequential revenue growth, improved margins, and greatly improved liquidity during a period characterized by enhanced reimbursement and volume growth in our endocrine or (thyroid) franchise as well as growth in our gastrointestinal or (pancreas) franchise,” said Jack Stover, Interpace’s President and CEO. “During the year we raised approximately $30 million in capital and eliminated over $9 million of secured debt and royalties to further strengthen our balance sheet, providing the capital needed to keep us on a sustainable path during 2017 and 2018,” said Stover.\nQ4 and 2017 Year End Financial Results and Performance\nRevenue for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 was $4.4 million and $15.9 million, respectively, an increase of 40% and 21% over the prior year periods principally as a result of our endocrine (thyroid) franchise but also due to growth in our gastroenterology (pancreas) franchise as well. Revenue for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 also grew 4.0% over the preceding quarter. Gross profit percentage improved from 49.2% to 53.7% year over year, while improving for the fourth quarter from 43.2% in 2016 to 62.5% in 2017, as we began to recognize the benefits of scale as well as reduce certain royalty obligations. General & Administrative costs decreased for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year p eriods by 4% and 13%, respectively. Sales & Marketing costs increased for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year periods by 61% and 20%, respectively, supporting our revenue growth and reflecting the rational rebuilding of our commercial operations to take advantage of market opportunities. Research & Development costs decreased for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year periods by 16% and 11%, respectively. Loss from Continuing Operations for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 was ($5.0) million and ($12.7) million, respectively, while Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations for the three and twelve-month periods of the prior year was $6.3 million and ($8.4) million, respectively. Net Income (Loss) for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 was ($5.0) million and ($12.2) million, respectively, and $6.3 million and ($8.3) million for the comparable periods of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA (in the attached schedule), which we believe is a meaningful supplemental disclosure that may be indicative of how management and our Board of Directors evaluate Company performance, adjusts Income or Loss from Continuing Operations for non-cash charges such as depreciation & amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairment, loss on extinguishment, the change in fair value of both our contingent consideration and certain warrant liabilities. Accordingly, our Adjusted EBITDA for the three-and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 was ($1.6) and ($7.1) million, respectively, an improvement of 45% and 32%, respectively, over the ($2.9) and ($10.5) million for the comparable periods of the prior year. Our cash balance at the end of the year was $15.2 million, up from $0.6 2016 and our stockholders’ equity balance is approximately $40 million as of December 31, 2017, up from $6.5 2016.\n2017 and Recent Business Highlights\nReimbursement:\nUnitedHealthcare, the largest health plan in the United States, agreed to cover our ThyraMIR® test, our microRNA-based molecular test used in assessing indeterminate thyroid nodules.\nWe signed a new national contract with Aetna for our ThyGenX ® and ThyraMIR® tests covering many of Aetna’s products. The agreement is our first national provider contract with a national health plan and means that Interpace will now be part of Aetna’s laboratory network for these services.\nCigna, one of the largest national health plans in the United States, agreed to cover Interpace’s ThyGenX test for Cigna’s 15 million members nationwide.\nOxford Health Plans began to cover Interpace’s ThyraMIR test. Oxford offers health care benefits to employers primarily in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut making it one of the largest health plans in the heavily populated tristate Region.\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) assigned a new, discreet CPT code to facilitate reimbursement of ThyraMIR simplifying and expediting the process for Interpace in submitting claims and securing reimbursement.\nMedicare reimbursement for ThyGenX increased by 40% effective January 1, 2018. Medicare represents approximately 40% of the Company’s volume for the ThyGenX test.\nIn 2018 we announced that five Blue Cross Blue Shield plans agreed to cover both ThyGenX and ThyraMIR. These five plans combined represent over 8 million members who now have coverage for the Company’s molecular thyroid tests.\nCommercial Expansion :\nWe announced the renewal and expansion of our agreement with Lab Corp, a NYSE listed company which provides leading-edge medical laboratory tests and services through a national network of primary clinical laboratories and specialty testing laboratories, to now co-market ThyraMIR along with ThyGenX.\nWe announced that the New York State Department of Health has reviewed and approved our TERT marker of aggressiveness which can now be ordered in conjunction with the ThyGenX molecular panel or on a stand-alone basis.\nWe also announced that the Company has entered into a Laboratory Services Agreement with ARUP Laboratories, Inc., whereby ARUP is utilizing Interpace as a laboratory services provider for its menu of molecular testing services.\nClinical Evidence\nWe commenced a multi-site study to provide further evidence of the Clinical Utility of our ThyGenX/ThyraMiR tests in accurately identifying malignancy or benign status in indeterminate thyroid nodules.\nWe announced the data presented in six posters at the Digestive Disease Week (DDW) meeting including:\nThree posters supporting the clinical utility of PancraGEN® in assessing long-term risk of malignancy in pancreatic cystic lesions and three posters supporting the clinical utility of PancraGEN as an ancillary test for solid lesions of the pancreas and bile duct.\nWe also announced the presentation of new data based on actual clinical results for 3,471 patients tested with ThyGenX/ThyraMIR at the annual meeting of The American Thyroid Association (ATA).\nWe reported two publications presented at the WCOG American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2017 Conference.\nWe also announced that G2 Intelligence selected Interpace as the “Company of the Month for September 2017”.\nIn January 2018 we announced that CIO Applications magazine designated Interpace as one of the top 20 Companies in 2017 for providing bioinformatics solutions to their customers through the Company’s extensive data base, and,\nIn February 2018 we announced the acceptance of five abstracts of the Company being presented at the US and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP). “Based on our accomplishments in 2017 and progress to date in scaling operations, gaining additional reimbursement and expanding our commercial activities, we are pleased with our performance in 2017 and we are looking forward to 2018,” concluded Stover.\nAbout Thyroid Nodules, ThyGenX and ThyraMIR testing\nAccording to the American Thyroid Association, approximately 15% to 30% of the 525,000 thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed on an annual basis in the U.S. are indeterminate for malignancy based on standard cytological evaluation, and thus are candidates for ThyGenX and ThyraMIR.\nThyGenX and ThyraMIR reflex testing yields high predictive value in determining the presence and absence of cancer in thyroid nodules. The combination of both tests can improve risk stratification and surgical decision-making when standard cytopathology does not provide a clear diagnosis for the presence of cancer.\nThyGenX utilizes state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify more than 100 genetic alterations associated with papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, the two most common forms of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR is the first microRNA gene expression classifier. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that bind to messenger RNA and regulate expression of genes involved in human cancers, including every subtype of thyroid cancer. ThyraMIR measures the expression of 10 microRNAs. Both ThyGenX and ThyraMIR are covered by both Medicare and Commercial insurers.\nAbout PancraGEN\nPancraGEN® is a molecular test that stratifies the risk of progression to pancreatic cancer from pancreatic cysts and solid masses by incorporating endoscopic ultrasound images, cytology, first-line chemistry testing like CEA and Amylase, and molecular markers into one of four risk categories ranging from Benign to Aggressive. PancraGEN® is 90% accurate according to clinical studies, enabling effective risk stratification of patients. Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose in early stages and typically spreads rapidly with signs and symptoms appearing when the cancer is significantly advanced. Because of this, and that complete surgical removal of the pancreas is not possible, pancreatic cancer is considered a leading cause of cancer deaths.\nAbout RespriDx\nRespriDx™ is a molecular test that differentiates between new primary lung tumors and metastasis by identifying the unique molecular fingerprint of a tumor using a series of tumor markers and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Discerning whether a lung neoplasm is the result of a newly formed tumor or metastasis is useful in determining what course of action physicians should take, e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, etc.\nAbout Interpace Diagnostics Group, Inc.\nInterpace is a fully integrated commercial and bioinformatics company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for evaluating risk of cancer by leveraging the latest technology in personalized medicine for improved patient diagnosis and management. The Company currently has four commercialized molecular tests and one test in a clinical evaluation process (CEP); PancraGEN® for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer from pancreatic cysts; ThyGenX® for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a next generation sequencing assay; ThyraMIR® for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer from thyroid nodules utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay; and RespriDX™ that differentiates lung cancer of primary vs. metastatic origin.
