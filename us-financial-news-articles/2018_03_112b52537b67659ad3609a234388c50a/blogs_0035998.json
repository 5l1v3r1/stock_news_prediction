Flight cancellations were minimal as of Tuesday morning. The storm comes a week after another snowstorm hit the region. CNBC.com Getty Images The tarmac of La Guardia Airport is cleared during a winter storm in the Queens borough of New York City. (File photo). \nAirlines have canceled more than 1,500 flights as an early-spring nor'easter is threatening to dump more than a foot of snow and bring high winds to to parts of the Northeast. \nMore than a third of the scheduled departures from Newark Liberty International Airport, or 222 flights, were called off for Wednesday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. \nOther affected airports include Philadelphia, all New York City-area airports, those in the Washington area and in Boston. \nCarriers including American , Delta , United and JetBlue said travelers scheduled to fly on Tuesday or Wednesday from a dozen airports along the East Coast can change travel dates to as late as March 25 without paying a date-change fee. If travelers can only change their tickets beyond that date, travelers may have to pay a difference in fare. \nAirplanes can generally fly in snow without a problem, but some flights can be called off in an effort to avoid accidents if visibility is low, winds are high, or if runway conditions are unsafe. Airlines also cancel flights ahead of time to avoid stranding crews and passengers, which can lead to a cascade of delays later on.
