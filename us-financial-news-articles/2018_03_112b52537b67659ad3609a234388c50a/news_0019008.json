(TSX:XDC) ( “Xtreme” or the “Company” ) announces its fourth quarter 2017 financial and operating results. It is anticipated that filing will take place on SEDAR of Consolidated Financial Statements as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, by March 9, 2018. All reported amounts are in Canadian dollars (\"CAD\"), unless otherwise noted.\nThe recent trend of strong utilization for Xtreme’s XDR 500 rig fleet continued in the fourth quarter of 2017. All nine of the available XDR 500 rigs worked during the quarter. Two of these rigs were released from well to well contracts in November and commenced operations with a new customer in January 2018 on one-year term contracts. Along with strong utilization in the fourth quarter, the average revenue per operating day increased by approximately 12 percent from the prior quarter. Xtreme increased contract backlog days to nearly 3,900 at the end of 2017 as compared to approximately 300 at the end of 2016. The current contract backlog represents approximately $77 million US dollars (\"USD\") in revenue.\nIn 2017 the Company re-activated four XDR 500 rigs which had been idled in prior years. As a reference point, the bottom of the US market was in the second quarter of 2016 when less than 375 drilling rigs were operating. During this period Xtreme’s activity decreased to four active XDR 500 rigs. Today approximately 965 drilling rigs are operating in the United States. The majority of rigs that have returned to work are the most efficient and technologically advanced. The increased requirement on efficiency and depth capacity will continue to reward drilling contractors with innovative technology and the highest quality fleets.\nThe development and build of the first generation of Xtreme’s Evolution Series 850XE rig represents a significant competitive leap forward for the Company. The 850XE was designed to meet all of the leading-edge requirements from US resource play operators. The goal of the initial design and engineering of the 850XE was to optimize the mechanization of the drilling rig, all while increasing drilling depth capability and pad efficiency. It is Xtreme’s belief that the 850XE represents the highest capacity and most technologically advanced rig in today’s US land market.\nThe first 850XE commenced operations in January 2018 on a two-year term contract. The second 850XE is currently in transit to the Utica play in Southwestern Ohio and the final 850 XE should begin mobilization to the same customer in Ohio by the end of March. The Company took more time than was initially estimated to commission the 850XE rigs in order to make certain that the cutting-edge technology and rig componentry were optimized. While the additional time had the effect of increasing overall project cost to near $19 million USD per rig, the end result is a rig with proprietary technology and limited rivals in today’s market. In addition, the 850 XE design gives Xtreme a very strong platform to meet the future demands of ever increasing well depths and operator requirements.\nUpon completion of the final 850XE, Xtreme will have executed on the announced strategy of transforming the Company into a pure play, high specification US drilling contractor. The entire 12 rig marketed fleet will consist of tier 1 AC electric rigs with 1,500hp or greater capacity. As part of the strategic transition to a high spec drilling contractor, the Company continues to actively hold for sale four XDR 300 rigs. These are heavy single AC rigs with 600 hp draw works that have historically worked in Canada, Mexico, India and the United States.\nXtreme president and CEO Matt Porter commented on the progress, “Our transformation to a high spec US driller is nearing completion. We are excited to develop additional opportunities around our industry leading technology and 850XE rig design in 2018 and beyond. Our belief is the winners in the next cycle will be drilling contractors that can deliver the highest level of capacity, efficiency and technology to their customer. We believe Xtreme is well positioned to compete with anyone.”\nQ4 2017 Highlights\nOperating days for the quarter were 707, a decrease from 851in the third quarter. The decrease in operating days from the prior quarter was based on two XDR 500 rigs that released from well to well contracts earlier than anticipated in November. Both rigs were subsequently contracted to one-year term contracts and began operations in January of 2018. In addition, in the third quarter the Company had approximately 19 days related to rigs working in Canada. These rigs were sold on September 30, 2017. Utilization was 77 percent for the fourth quarter.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenue of $16.3 million as compared to $18.2 million in the previous quarter. Revenue per day increased to $23,088 in the fourth quarter from $21,354 in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expenses include all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of the drilling operations. Direct costs are tied and to operating levels; however, indirect costs are often not affected by changes in operating days and utilization as they are more fixed in nature. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, operating expenses were $18,919 per operating day, an increase from $17,310 per operating day in the previous quarter. Operating expenses per operating day increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, a slight increase in repair and maintenance, along with a decrease in operating days.\nGeneral and Administrative expenses decreased from $2.4 million for the third quarter to $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from the previous quarter is due to lower professional fees related to legal and infrastructure costs and lower administrative costs related to international offices. On a go forward basis, the Company expects the general and administrative expenses to be in the range of $2.2 to $2.4 million per quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $0.8 million for the fourth quarter, a slight decrease from what was reported in the third quarter of $1.0 million. This was primarily due to decrease in revenue and rig utilization.\nThe Company entered into an agreement with an equipment finance company to borrow $6 million USD- equivalent secured by one of the 850XE rigs. The loan has an implied interest rate of 12.46 percent and amortized over a 42-month period. There are no restrictive covenants associated with this debt. On February 27, 2018, the Company amended its agreement with a commercial lender to provide an additional amount of $3 million USD under the collateralized debt agreement. The loan was funded on March 1, 2018. The Company’s USD revenue and expenses are impacted by the exchange rate between the US dollar and Canadian dollar. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the average exchange rate used to convert the USD-denominated revenues and expenses to CAD was $1.27/$1 USD ($1.25 for the previous quarter).\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $9.1 million, which included approximately $8.8 million related to the 850XE upgrade program. Through December 31, 2017, total capital expenditures amounted to $75.7 million. It is anticipated that the Company will have capital expenditures of $10.0 to $12.0 million in the first quarter, relating primarily to remaining costs for the 850XE rigs and associated ancillary equipment and drill pipe.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Information from Continuing Operations\nThree months ended Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Mar 31, 2017 Revenue 16,323 18,172 15,141 12,379 Adjusted EBITDA 818 1,008 (1,630 ) (78 ) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 5 % 6 % (11 )% (1 )% Net loss (9,564 ) (8,673 ) (48,366 ) (12,168 ) Net loss per share - basic ($) (0.13 ) (0.12 ) (0.61 ) (0.14 ) Operating cash flows from continuing operations (3,403 ) (3,096 ) (4,957 ) 101 Capital assets 205,456 203,316 196,704 245,267 Total assets 251,573 253,171 272,798 348,083 Net debt (2,389 ) (19,144 ) (41,682 ) (88,152 ) Operating days 707 851 683 583 Utilization (percentage) 77 % 93 % 75 % 36 % Weighted average number of rigs in service 10 10 10 18 Total number of available rigs, end of quarter 10 10 10 18 Dec 31, 2016 Sep 30, 2016 Jun 30, 2016 Mar 31, 2016 Revenue 9,929 8,468 7,369 16,266 Adjusted EBITDA (148 ) (1,423 ) (5,449 ) 784 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue (1 )% (17 )% (74 )% 5 % Net loss (11,122 ) (29,542 ) (28,699 ) (7,350 ) Net loss per share - basic ($) (0.13 ) (0.35 ) (0.34 ) (0.09 ) Operating cash flows from continuing operations (1,032 ) (1,168 ) (10,849 ) (615 ) Capital assets 240,656 243,564 266,188 276,521 Total assets 366,762 373,104 409,794 316,270 Net debt (113,882 ) (118,863 ) (110,794 ) 90,242 Operating days 479 433 355 564 Utilization (percentage) 25 % 22 % 19 % 30 % Weighted average number of rigs in service 21 21 21 21 Total number of rigs, end of quarter 21 21 21 21 Conference Call Details\nXtreme has scheduled a conference call to discuss results with investors, analysts, and stakeholders on Friday, March 9, 2018, beginning promptly at 10:00 am MT (11:00 am CT, 12:00 am ET).\nMatt Porter, President and Chief Executive Officer, will host the conference call.\nConference operator dial in numbers\nTo participate in the conference call, please dial in as follows approximately ten minutes before the start time in your time zone.\n+1 844-889-6858 (North America Toll Free) or +1 661-378-9711 (International) Webcast: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/38vw9vuo Conference ID: 1087317\nAn audio replay of the call will be available until 4:00, March 14, 2018.
