It aims to open its first Indian store, in Hyderabad, early this summer.\nIn India, his efforts to get close to the customer included 800 visits to family homes either by himself or members of his team during his time there.\n\"This is something we will do even more,\" Maeztu said.\nIkea, whose founder Ingvar Kamprad died in January at the age of 91, operates through a franchise system. Inter Ikea is the brand owner and franchisor. Ikea owns 393 stores in 29 markets out of a total of 413 store in 49 markets.\nLast September Ikea made its first-ever acquisition outside the group of companies that make up Ikea when it bought TaskRabbit, a U.S. online marketplace for odd jobs - such as furniture assembly. It has flagged more acquisitions or partnerships could be on the cards.\nFor the new CFO, that strategy shift spells a new way for the company to keep a lid on costs, a necessity as the market transforms.\n\"TaskRabbit is an example of partnership in order to really keep prices down at the same time as we are offering the best of Ikea,\" Maeztu said.\n\"We are exploring other partnerships, but we don't have anything specific (to communicate) now,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:51:02.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
