We have the pieces in place to position KeyW for growth, profitability and predictability going forward,” said Bill Weber, KeyW’s president and chief executive officer.\n“Integration efforts related to our April 2017 acquisition of Sotera are complete, and KeyW is now the unified, focused and diversified company we have always intended it to be. We entered 2018 with a more competitive cost structure in place, and the ability to pursue contracts that neither company could have competitively bid on its own before the acquisition. Our business development engine continues the robust pace we began at the start of our turnaround, and the right management team is in place to take this company to the next level and beyond. Moreover, KeyW achieved its goal of generating 2017 awards of greater than one times revenue—and in doing so, 2018 revenue exposed to recompete risk is negligible. 2018 is an execution year for KeyW, and we are looking forward to what lies ahead.”\nBusiness Development Highlights and Contract Awards\nFor the fourth quarter, contract awards totaled approximately $78 million, which was in line with company expectations. Fiscal year 2017 contract award values totaled $548 million, or 1.1 times revenue. The company reported having approximately $1.4 billion in proposals submitted and awaiting award as of December 31, 2017.\nKeyW’s fourth-quarter awards reflected the company’s commitment to lead with technology to win new work in areas including, but not limited to, data science, cyber and autonomy. Notable among the fourth-quarter awards was a new win for research and development of data science applications in the cyber domain. In addition, KeyW was awarded an advanced analytics contract for applied research related to the principles of robust machine learning capabilities.\nLastly, KeyW extended its longest-running contract—a predecessor U.S. Navy award that dates to 1969—providing advanced radar expertise. These awards are a testament to the unique, differentiated technologies KeyW brings to the market combined with best-in-class delivery.\nFourth-Quarter 2017 Results from Continuing Operations\nRevenue increased by $58.0 million, or 84.1%, to $126.9 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to contracts acquired through the acquisition of Sotera.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.5 million, or 3.5% of revenue, compared with an operating loss of $0.5 million, or (0.8%) of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating income and margin resulted primarily from the additional revenue acquired in the Sotera acquisition, partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs and amortization expense.\nKeyW reported GAAP net income from continuing operations of $16.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, largely resulting from a non-cash tax benefit driven by the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as the factors affecting operating income. There were no discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $14.0 million, or 11.0% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017, versus $5.2 million, or 7.5% of revenue, in the prior-year period. Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased year-over-year primarily because of the additional Sotera revenue, partially offset by the associated higher direct and indirect expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased primarily because of higher-than-anticipated product solutions sales during the fourth quarter.\nFull-Year 2017 Results from Continuing Operations\nFull-year 2017 revenue was $441.6 million, compared with full-year revenue for 2016 of $288.0 million, an increase of 53.3%, which is primarily attributable to contracts acquired through the acquisition of Sotera. Net loss from continuing operations for 2017 was $11.0 million, compared with net income from continuing operations of $1.9 million in 2016. Diluted GAAP net loss per share from continuing operations in 2017 was $(0.22), compared with diluted GAAP net income per share from continuing operations of $0.05 in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for 2017 was $40.6 million, or 9.2% of revenue.\nAdditional Financial Metrics\nKeyW reported total backlog at December 31, 2017, of $1.2 billion, compared with total backlog at September 30, 2017, of $1.3 billion.\nCash flow provided by operations for the full year 2017 was $10.2 million, a decrease of $12.9 million, compared with full year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to increased cash expenses related to the acquisition and integration of Sotera. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were 63 days for the full year, and cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, totaled $17.8 million. KeyW paid down $13.4 million of debt during 2017. At December 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under its 2017 Credit Agreement.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nThe table below summarizes the company’s fiscal year 2018 guidance, which incorporates a full fiscal year of Sotera operations:\nFiscal 2018 Guidance Revenue $495 million - $515 million Adjusted EBITDA margin 8.9% - 9.3% Weber concluded: “KeyW achieved critical strategic objectives in 2017, which reinforced the solid growth foundation we’ve built. 2018 is about executing our operating plan, realizing new revenue synergies, generating strong cash flow and further de-leveraging the balance sheet to consider the year a success.”\nConference Call Information\nAs previously announced, a conference call has been scheduled to discuss these results today, March 15, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT.

The adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations reconciliation table and adjusted EBITDA as percentage of full year revenue guidance reconciliation table below provide a reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to net income (loss) from continuing operations and estimated net income (loss) from continuing operations margin, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income margin, operating income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted EBITDA margin or similarly titled measures in the same manner as we do. We prepare adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA margin to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. We encourage you to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA margin are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\nwe have various non-recurring transactions or non-operating transactions and expenses that directly impact our net income from continuing operations. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is intended to approximate the net cash provided by operations by adjusting for non-recurring or non-operating items; and securities analysts use adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies.\nOur board of directors and management use adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations:\nas a measure of operating performance; to determine a significant portion of management's incentive compensation; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; and to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies.\nAlthough adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nadjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments; adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect interest expense or interest income; adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes; adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not include non-cash expenses related to stock compensation; adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not include acquisition costs and other adjustments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations or similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nTHE KeyW HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAdjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations Reconciliation Table\n(in thousands and unaudited)\nTable 1\nThree months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net income (loss) from continuing operations $ 16,049 $ (3,112 ) $ (10,951 ) $ 1,865 Depreciation 2,781 1,468 8,946 6,449 Intangible amortization 2,558 1,651 11,416 6,113 Stock based compensation 1,174 1,300 4,228 3,472 Interest expense, net 4,663 2,617 17,015 10,812 Tax (benefit) expense (16,196 ) (35 ) (11,060 ) 2,457 Acquisition costs and other adjustments 2,986 1,299 21,046 255 Adjusted EBITDA $ 14,015 $ 5,188 $ 40,640 $ 31,423 Adjusted EBITDA as Percentage of Full Year Revenue Guidance Reconciliation Table\nFiscal Year 2018 Estimate Low High Net (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations -0.2 % 0.4 % Depreciation 1.9 % 1.8 % Intangible Amortization 2.6 % 2.4 % Stock Compensation Amortization 0.8 % 0.8 % Interest Expense 3.9 % 3.8 % Tax Expense -0.1 % 0.1 % Acquisition Costs and Other Adjustments 0.0 % 0.0 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 8.9 % 9.3 %\nSource:KeyW Corp.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kbnSxT2P3P__v8sS9J-9Gq7k_84CYExWQeLJWIjvGKvRCKafq5HgIVT_cnnI7bZaRUJ-YL7RS4W08qdE_wesIw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eH7Tno-11dpJcsJXtemD2gst4iUr9fce0MgZJiOK_QL2t2rNj5OCg7I1aNLCU982Cm-h_yyrwqdmz5ufvNdx92bqIPEN7iw0YWvGD9Pi2Z4j5F7ohTEJ5Zp1Ui_N44UA0l-4MCCMJ_U4vRQMOVXgPQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Pnqdp8lDvbOUI1dEorhx8lDCkyB4-kLIYtPc95Ax_2trMWv8IwRZuQmqCpLnxScs0uVPDd0eEStmDJnBapXt5QJ4BvgXGj8X7NRQCg-R43I=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1622bfc4-051c-41f9-b245-a33c02318113", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5gMv0dYIdsxpIwEDbQy6DnQkKYm3EqsOsZXKCn2hyhNyEzEtHhDsb5RaFJN1-dcbIUNdB5Gcmbxa8jpgXGERqA1n33fpHS3WPpHfKJjkWfQNsrgii-ZrM-WUIo1QafXKvA4bJmygyFrqZe-ziOtFGeyyR5BzcbW2jzemwW29L0xUqOKtqhpfz46yvql3RZ3MEnzkE2BLX1eDgrRzr0ghYA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-PFEBOBjm-KS5ijud7iYvr2W2SzaREGMMVInLxHt3yD7AJnMJuvSk-x0l8tMiHFzQ4GjPjMSUNeAIv__vbNU6xi09zybgNXQ322rNUB3oEw=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-PFEBOBjm-KS5ijud7iYvr2W2SzaREGMMVInLxHt3yBqaV3HmR8wpqiHWJ22-8GcihRnui_ModJ_n-_ecjAMsLnEGc7M3zgpxSJowpqUUo0=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=09w2-tlw9w90ICNdFvrqWOevfwjMu1kcw_us_GUuJPtegrCY5jx1OrLgxbl-RW7fTqSo0Z7J8CJC4GiUbYzvpEuXEYXKc4iIEqtS6Iq2iEtKL3IxJiUCNmfVIfBUB4y9", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-X7UC7aaaYCSmJxYUoMM9nZAC8dFYX8c7NUHyrrwXErqD0lSYlkN2ta_8gSXM4wfNqIB_ZiaG1fTfguGRDHBsMVMY3aR1SF1hg6kVozWLVE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fZpjI4l1oMszEAbTZW4fWCmJVtNMWJy-E_inQ0jM0hq0fIqYZhcyPfZRifYIXsGIgH50a7c7gHutW34EnVPInu7KQeUAmTxa4RqFeebGd_pPRXJPjOM5imeF5D9y9W0u"], "published": "2018-03-15T23:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T01:23:38.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
