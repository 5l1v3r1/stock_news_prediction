Speaking at an event hosted by Brazil’s supermarket industry association in Rio de Janeiro, Abilio Diniz partially attributed the poor performance of shares in BRF - a company that posted disappointing 2017 results and has been affected by corruption accusations - to financial speculation. “There is nothing abnormal, nothing exceptional (about shareholders pressing for a new board). This happens in all big companies that don’t have a controlling shareholder,” Diniz was quoted as saying in a story on the newspaper’s website. BRF shares have fallen almost 32 percent this year. The company was ensnared in a major bribery scandal last year and arrests have continued into 2018. In addition, the company recently reported its worst results ever, posting a 1.2 billion real ($365 million) 2017 net loss. Two pension funds that are BRF’s largest shareholders presented earlier in March a list of 10 candidates for seats to the company’s board that excluded Diniz. A shareholders meeting to vote on the board changes is expected for next month. $1 = 3.29 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Peter Cooney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T00:44:11.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
