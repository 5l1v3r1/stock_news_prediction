Smart Estimates give greater weighting to more accurate analysts.\nRevenue rose 11.9 percent to 60.16 billion yuan. Gross profit margin increased 2.4 percentage points from a year ago to 35.2 percent amid relatively low raw milk prices and an improving product mix.\nMengniu is stepping up development and sales of premium products that are gaining favour with Chinese consumers and is working with partners like Danone Group and Arla Foods to bring more dairy goods to China.\n$1 = 6.2781 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:10:09.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
