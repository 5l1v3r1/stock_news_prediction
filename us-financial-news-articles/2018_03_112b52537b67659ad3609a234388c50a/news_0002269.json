A rupture of the fault in northern California caused the massive San Francisco earthquake in 1906.\nThe last big quake to strike near Los Angeles was 300 years ago, and the average interval in the region is just 150 years, experts say.\nStudies show California and other western states are having more days of extreme summer heat than in the past, raising the risk of drought and wildfires.\nOther cities working with 100 Resilient Cities are Mexico City, Australia’s Melbourne, and Jordan’s Amman, officials said.\nReporting by Ellen Wulfhorst, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
