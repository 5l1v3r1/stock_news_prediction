The last thing, the absolute last thing this company needs is a bad first quarter.”\nThe company was valued around $20 billion based on private stock transactions among existing investors and employees in February, according to its filing.\nLoss-making Spotify, which is prioritizing rapid growth over profits, said it expected to have signed up between 73 and 76 million paying subscribers this month, roughly twice as many as closest rival Apple has disclosed. For the full year, it is aiming for 92-96 million premium users, it said.\nIt expects total monthly active users in March to number 168-171 million, including those who use the service for free in return for watching advertisements, up from 157 million at the end of last year.\nOperating losses should narrow during 2018 to between 230 and 330 million euros, the company said, including 35-40 million euros in costs associated with its stock market listing. In 2017, Spotify reported charges on debt financing drove up operating losses to 378 million euros.\nThe 2018 sales forecast compares with the Stockholm-based company’s long-term target for revenue to grow between 25 and 35 percent, which it spelled out for investors earlier in March.\nGross margins for the first quarter are expected to rise to around 23-24 percent from 21 percent for last year as a whole and possibly reach 23-25 percent in 2018 overall. That remains well off its long-term target of 30 to 35 percent.\n($1 = 0.8059 euros)\nReporting by Olof Swahnberg and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm; Writing by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T15:34:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
