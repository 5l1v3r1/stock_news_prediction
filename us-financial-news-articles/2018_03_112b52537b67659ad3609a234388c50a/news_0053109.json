Summitview was not accused of wrongdoing and could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe agency said that Yin bought more than two million DreamWorks shares through five brokerage accounts in April 2016 shortly before the company’s acquisition by Comcast became public, causing its stock to surge and making Yin $29 million.\nThe agency said Yin may have been tipped off by his friend Chaofeng Ji, who worked for China-based Legend Capital. Legend was working at the time on a potential partnership with PAG Asia Capital, which in turn knew of the DreamWorks deal because it had made a rival offer for the company, the SEC said.\nThe SEC said Ji controlled one of the five brokerage accounts and named him as a “relief defendant” for the purpose of seeking disgorgement of funds. He lives in Beijing and no lawyer represents him in the case, according to court documents.\nPAG and Legend were not accused of wrongdoing and could not immediately be reached for comment.\nYin also bought more than seven million shares of Lattice through the five brokerage accounts beginning in July 2016, the SEC said, making more than $7 million in profits after Chinese-backed private equity firm Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ plan to buy the microchip maker became public in November 2016.\nThe SEC said that Yin learned of Lattice’s planned sale directly from an insider at Canyon Bridge, which was not accused of wrongdoing. The fund declined to comment.\nThe DreamWorks deal closed in August 2016. The Canyon Bridge deal was blocked by U.S. President Donald Trump in September 2017.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:13:17.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
