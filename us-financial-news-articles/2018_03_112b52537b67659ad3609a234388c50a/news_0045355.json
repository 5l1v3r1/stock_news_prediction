Dohrer’s current role at RSM International, a global network of audit, tax and consulting firms, is global leader, quality and risk. He will succeed Charles “Chuck” Landes, CPA , the AICPA’s vice president of professional standards – public accounting, who plans to retire early next year.\n“Chuck Landes’ contributions to the profession over the course of his career are numerous and notable,” said Susan S. Coffey, CPA, CGMA , Association of International Certified Professional Accountants’ executive vice president for public practice. Most recently, Landes has been instrumental in clarifying auditing and attestation standards, especially in his recent work around modernizing the audit. He has also been a lead representative with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, modernizing Preparation, Compilation and Review standards, and authoring standards for the AICPA’s Financial Reporting Framework for Small- and Medium-Sized Entities.\n“In looking to find a successor with Chuck’s unique skill set – an in-depth knowledge of the global profession and auditing and a successful track record – the AICPA sought an individual who understands the audit process for firms of all sizes,” Coffey explained.\nNow based in London, Dohrer has overall responsibility for RSM’s audit and other attest services policies, procedures and guidance, as well as general risk containment policies for the network. Prior to joining RSM in 2012, Bob served as RSM US’s (then McGladrey LLP) National Director of Assurance Services and International Assurance Services Practice Leader and served a broad range of clients. He has 29 years of experience in public accounting, all with RSM International and RSM US.\nDohrer currently serves as chairman of the AICPA’s Assurance Services Executive Committee and has led efforts related to System and Organizational Controls, cybersecurity and sustainability. Internationally, he is a member of the IAASB, where he serves as Chair of the Board’s Data Analytics Working Group, Co-Chairs the IAASB Group Audits Task Force and is a member of the IAASB Quality Control Task Force.\n“As chief auditor, Bob will serve as the AICPA’s expert on U.S. and international auditing, attestation, quality control, review, compilation and preparation standards, as well as internal control and enterprise risk management,” Coffey said. “He will lead the Public Accounting Professional Standards team to deliver high-quality standards, and will lead and provide strategic direction to the Auditing Standards Board and Accounting and Review Services Committee, in partnership with their chairs.”\nTo ensure a seamless transition, Dohrer will join the AICPA in October, three months before Landes retires.\nAbout the American Institute of CPAs\nThe American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) is the world’s largest member association representing the CPA profession, with more than 418,000 members in 143 countries, and a history of serving the public interest since 1887.
