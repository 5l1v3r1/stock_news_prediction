But he exempted NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico, and the White House will let other nations justify their own case for exception from the tariffs.\nThe only EU nation in the top 10 sources of U.S. steel imports is Germany, which ranks ninth, according to IHS Global Trade Atlas data for the first nine months of 2017. Canada ranks first and Mexico fourth, the data showed.\nJust days after announcing the tariffs on March 1, Trump threatened to impose a tax on car imports from the EU if it \"wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there.\"\nLast week, the EU threatened to impose duties on U.S. bourbon , peanut butter, cranberries and orange juice if Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.\nâ€” CNBC's Jeff Cox and Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T15:20:19.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
