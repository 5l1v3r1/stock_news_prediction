FILE PHOTO: The logo of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA is seen at the company's headquarters in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio Embraer shares fell nearly 3 percent in Sao Paulo as investors weighed the company’s challenges even as its delicate talks proceed with U.S. company Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and the Brazilian government on a new venture joining their efforts in the passenger jet market. Related Coverage Embraer missed 2017 profit target due to KC-390 flight tests: CFO Embraer’s next-generation line-up in the 70- to 130-seat segment is facing stiff competition from the CSeries aircraft designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) and recently taken over by European heavyweight Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ). Older planes in Embraer’s executive jet portfolio have also forced a series of writedowns. The latest of these reduced net income in the fourth quarter to $35 million, missing an average forecast of $137 million of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totaled $645 million, well short of an annual target of at least $770 million. Including depreciation and amortization (EBIT), operating profit of $329 million also missed a minimum target of $450 million. Even adjusted for one-time effects such as the writedowns - $54 million for executive jets and $9 million in defense during the quarter - EBIT and EBITDA missed 2017 targets that Embraer had reaffirmed in October. Unexpected additional costs for flight testing the new KC-390 military airlifter contributed to that miss, Chief Financial Officer Jose Filippo told journalists on a call. In November, Embraer said it had stopped flying the first prototype of the KC-390, which is due to enter service this year, after a stall test pushed the cargo jet beyond its operating limits. Filippo said the plane has resumed testing. The company narrowed its 2018 revenue outlook by $200 million to between $5.4 billion and $5.9 billion, compared to $5.84 billion last year. Embraer also lowered its estimate for maximum cash burn this year, or negative free cash flow, to $100 million from a prior forecast of $150 million, citing more certainty about estimates.
