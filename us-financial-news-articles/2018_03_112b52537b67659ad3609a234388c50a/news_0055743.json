The U.S. government’s own Dietary Guidelines state that coffee can be part of a healthy lifestyle,” the NCA statement said.\nFILE PHOTO: A man holds an Americano at a Starbucks coffee shop in Seoul, South Korea, March 7, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji In his decision, Berle said: “Defendants failed to satisfy their burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that consumption of coffee confers a benefit to human health.”\nOfficials from Dunkin’ Donuts, McDonald’s Corp , Peet’s and other big coffee sellers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit was filed in 2010 by the Council for Education and Research on Toxics (CERT). It calls for fines as large as $2,500 per person for every exposure to the chemical since 2002 at the defendants’ shops in California. Any civil penalties, which will be decided in a third phase of the trial, could be huge in California, which has a population of nearly 40 million.\nCERT’s lawyer Raphael Metzger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nStarbucks lost the first phase of the trial in which it failed to show the level of acrylamide in coffee was below that which would pose a significant risk of cancer. In the second phase of the trial, defendants failed to prove there was an acceptable “alternative” risk level for the carcinogen, court documents showed.\nFILE PHOTO: A barista makes drinks inside a newly designed Starbucks coffee shop in Fountain Valley, California August 22, 2013.
