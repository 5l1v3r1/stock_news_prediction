He is not the first. \nSince the late 1980s, successive Paris governments have tried but failed to nurture a liberal “Islam of France” that would help integrate the faith into a mostly secular society. \nThe issue is back in focus after a Moroccan-born French national killed four people in southwestern France on March 23, proclaiming allegiance to Islamic State. About 240 people have now been killed in France since early 2015 by militants or inspired by the ultra-hardline Islamic State group.

They contain about 20,000 people, of which about 10,000 for reasons of religious radicalisation or connections. \nFormer Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls urged the government to consider internment in cases where a real risk of militant activity is perceived. \nValls has also pressed for a ban on Salafism, a step current Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has so far dismissed. \n“You cannot ban an idea but you can punish its consequences if they undermine public order, the laws or the republic or the basic rules of society,” Philippe told lawmakers this week. \nFrance, a traditionally Catholic nation, formally separated church and state a century ago and strict secularism is the official rule. The country has Europe’s largest Jewish and Muslim communities. The latter is estimated to number upwards of five million.
