The raw beef products incorporated a non-meat ingredient, Au Jus Seasoning, that was found positive for the presence of Salmonella.\nThe frozen, marinated top sirloin items were produced on various dates between Feb. 19, 2018 and March 14, 2018. The following products are subject to recall:\nApproximate 20-lb. boxes containing “USDA Select or Higher Beef 6 oz Top Sirloin Steak Mechanically Tenderized” with case code 45966.\nApproximate 30-lb. boxes containing “USDA Select or Higher Beef 8 oz Top Sirloin Steak Mechanically Tenderized” with case code 45968.\nThe products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 33861” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to restaurant locations nationwide.\nThe problem was discovered when Standard Meat Company was notified by their supplier, who shipped the seasoning, of a voluntary seasoning recall based on Salmonella contamination. Standard Meat Company uses this seasoning product to formulate marinade that is injected into the top sirloin steaks. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.\nConsumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.\nThe products were shipped to restaurants frozen. Restaurants cook and prepare the product for consumers, who may take the product home as leftovers. FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.\nFSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.\nFSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume steak that has been cooked to a temperature of 145°F. The only way to confirm that steak is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ .\nMedia and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Joe Brhlik, Supply Chain Manager, Standard Meat Company, at (866) 859-6313.\nConsumers with food safety questions can \"Ask Karen,\" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov .
