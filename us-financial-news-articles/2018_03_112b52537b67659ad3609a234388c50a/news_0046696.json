(“ProPetro” or “the Company”) (NYSE: PUMP) today announced financial and operational results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017, and additional expansion of its fleet.\nFull Year 2017 Operational Highlights\nGrew year-end fleet capacity by 64% to 690,000 hydraulic horsepower (“HHP”), or 16 fleets, from 420,000 HHP, or ten fleets, at the end of 2016; Maintained 100% fleet utilization throughout the year; Purchased 86 Tier 2 engines estimated to yield approximately $30 million in savings; Implemented and completed transition from carbon steel to stainless steel fluid ends; Expanded operations to the Delaware Basin, and Maintained safety and performance metrics while growing employee head count nearly 100%.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nSuccessfully completed initial public offering to fund growth initiatives and strengthen balance sheet; Increased total revenue by 125% to $981.9 million from $436.9 million in 2016; Reported net income of $12.6 million as compared to a net loss of $53.1 million in 2016; and Grew adjusted EBITDA (1) to $137.4 million from $7.8 million in 2016 – more than a 1,600% increase.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nIncreased total revenue by 11% to $313.7 million from $282.7 million in the third quarter of 2017; Posted net income of $10.1 million and adjusted EBITDA (1) of $42.8 million; and Deployed one new-build fleet (45,000 HHP).\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is described and reconciled to net income (loss) in the table under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nDale Redman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “2017 was clearly the most transformational year in the Company’s history from both an operational and financial perspective. Driving our results was a continued unwavering focus on exceeding the needs of our customers and working closely with our supply chain partners as we grew our best-in-class fleet without sacrificing safety or performance. I am incredibly proud of our team’s accomplishments during the past year, which is a direct testament to the tireless efforts of our workforce. While our fourth quarter results were affected by a higher than originally anticipated amount of holiday time off, more vertical completion work than expected, and inclement weather, I am pleased to report we are off to a strong start for 2018 and anticipate another outstanding year for ProPetro.”\nFinancial Summary\nPROPETRO HOLDING CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA (In thousands, except per share, total HHP and fleet count data) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31 September 30 December 31 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue $ 313,712 $ 282,730 $ 163,921 $ 981,865 $ 436,920 Operating income (loss) $ 14,189 $ 22,704 $ (22,295 ) $ 24,113 $ (67,386 ) Net income (loss) $ 10,078\n$ 21,965 $ (17,315 ) $ 12,613 $ (53,147 ) Net income (loss) per diluted common share $ 0.12 $ 0.25 $ (0.33 ) $ 0.16 $ (1.19 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 42,790 $ 47,768 $ 6,246 $ 137,443 $ 7,816 Total HHP (end of period) 690,000 645,000 420,000 690,000 420,000 Total HHP (average for period) 677,900 575,400 420,000 533,800 420,000 Fleet count (end of period) 16.0 15.0 10.0 16.0 10.0 Fleet count (average for period) 15.7 13.5 10.0 12.5 10.0 Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $313.7 million, or 11% higher than $282.7 million for the third quarter of 2017. Contributing to the increase was larger fleet size and improved pricing for the Company’s pressure pumping and other services. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 97.4% of total revenue was associated with pressure pumping services, as compared to 96.2% in the third quarter of 2017.\nCosts of services excluding depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $262.0 million from $225.4 million during the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to larger fleet size, coupled with an associated increase in headcount. As a percentage of pressure pumping segment revenues, pressure pumping costs of services increased to 84% from 80% for the third quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $10.3 million as compared to $11.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $10.1 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, versus $22.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $42.8 million as compared to $47.8 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, fourth quarter profitability was impacted by more holiday time off than originally expected, a higher than anticipated amount of vertical frac work to assist certain customers in addressing year end lease obligations, and inclement weather.\nFleet Expansion Update\nActive HHP deployed during fourth quarter 2017 averaged 677,900, or 15.7 fleets, and active HHP at year end was 690,000, or 16 fleets. As previously announced, an additional 90,000 HHP, or two fleets, recently commenced operations under multi-year dedicated agreements in January and February, bringing active horsepower to 780,000, or 18 fleets. To support growing demand for the Company’s pressure pumping services, ProPetro announced today plans to further expand its fracturing capacity by an additional 90,000 HHP, or two fleets. Fleets 19 and 20 are expected to be deployed in the second and third quarter of 2018, respectively. Both fleets will be deployed to new customers and are supported by multi-year dedicated agreements. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company also plans to enhance its legacy fleet by an incremental 35,000 HHP, which will bring average pressure pumping capacity to 45,000 HHP per fleet. The combination of the two new build fleets and enhancement of existing fleet capabilities will bring total capacity to 905,000 HHP, or 20 fleets, by the end of the third quarter of 2018.\nThe Company recently deployed one new build coiled tubing unit and one new build cementing unit, both of which will operate under long-term dedicated agreements. This brings total coiled tubing capacity to three units and total cementing capacity to 16 units. To support growing demand, ProPetro announced today plans to further expand its cementing unit fleet capacity with two additional new build units that are targeted to commence operations later this year.\nCapital Spending and Liquidity\nProPetro incurred $305.3 million of capital expenditures in 2017, which was inclusive of seven new build frac fleets, 68 additional Tier 2 diesel engines, a small amount of growth in ancillary services, and maintenance capital expenditures. 2017 full year capital expenditures were $276.8 million excluding the $28.5 million payment that was incurred at the end of the year for fleet 17, which was not deployed and revenue producing until January of 2018. ProPetro continues to expect maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of revenue while growth capital expenditure opportunities will be continuously evaluated.\nAs previously announced, on February 22, 2018 the Company expanded the capacity of its existing asset-based loan facility (the “Amended ABL”) to $200 million – a 33% increase over the previous cap of $150 million. ProPetro is committed to maintaining financial discipline, a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. The Company continues to target a net debt to last-twelve-month EBITDA ratio of less than 1.0x and plans to remain below that level for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total liquidity was $103 million, including $24 million in cash as well as $79 million available under ProPetro’s pre-amended asset-based loan facility.\nOutlook\nDue to the timing of reporting the Company’s year-end results for 2017 near the end of the first quarter, ProPetro is providing preliminary financial estimates for the first quarter of 2018. This includes revenue of between $372 million to $382 million and adjusted EBITDA of between $64 million and $70 million.\nMr. Redman concluded, “Supported by frac operations focused solely on the Permian, the outlook for our business in 2018 is outstanding. Demand for our services is strong and we are continuing to collaborate with our customers to drive wellsite efficiencies. In addition, our supply chain partners have assisted us in avoiding many of the near-term transitory issues in the industry and remain flexible to our needs. These factors, combined with our reputation for providing industry-leading execution, provide us the confidence to continue to invest in our business and thereby increase shareholder value.”\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:00 AM Central Time on Tuesday, March 27, 2018 to discuss financial and operating results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017 along with recent developments.

We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Pressure Pressure Pressure ($ in thousands) Pumping All Other Total Pumping All Other Total Pumping All Other Total Net income (loss) $ 20,330 $ (10,252\n) $ 10,078\n$ 28,372 $ (6,407 ) $ 21,965 $ (10,501 ) $ (6,816 ) $ (17,317 ) Depreciation and amortization 15,927 1,099 17,026 13,637 1,108 14,745 9,377 1,496 10,873 Interest expense - 878 878 - 644 644 - 4,445 4,445 Income tax expense - 3,000 3,000 - (96 ) (96 ) - (9,328 ) (9,328 ) Loss on disposal of assets 10,117 -\n10,117\n7,552 1,190 8,742 10,279 (610 ) 9,669 Stock-based compensation - 759 759 - 751 751 - 519 519 Property and equipment impairment - -\n- - 751 751 - 6,305 6,305 Goodwill impairment - - - - 751 751 - 1,177 1,177 Other expense and legal settlement - 233 233 - 340 340 - (97 ) (97 ) Deferred IPO bonus expense 452 247 699 452 225 677 - - - Adjusted EBITDA $ 46,826 $ (4,036 ) $ 42,790 $ 50,013 $ (2,245 ) $ 47,768 $ 9,155 $ (2,909 ) $ 6,246 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Pressure Pressure ($ in thousands) Pumping All Other Total Pumping All Other Total Net income (loss) $ 50,417 $ (37,804 ) $ 12,613 $ (45,316 ) $ (7,831 ) $ (53,147 ) Depreciation and amortization 51,155 4,473 55,628 37,282 6,260 43,542 Interest expense - 7,347 7,347 - 20,387 20,387 Income tax expense (benefit) - 3,128 3,128 - (27,972 ) (27,972 ) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets 38,059 1,027 39,086 23,690 (1,161 ) 22,529 Stock-based compensation - 9,489 9,489 - 1,649 1,649 Property and equipment impairment - - - - 6,305 6,305 Goodwill impairment - - - - 1,177 1,177 Other expense - 1,025 1,025 - 321 321 Legal settlement expense - 722 722 - - - Gain on extiguishment of debt - - - - (6,975 ) (6,975 ) Deferred IPO bonus expense 5,491 2,914 8,405 - - - Adjusted EBITDA $ 145,122 $ (7,679 ) $ 137,443 $ 15,656 $ (7,840 ) $ 7,816\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180326006045/en/\nProPetro Holding Corp\nSam Sledge, 432-688-0012\nDirector - Investor Relations\nsam.sledge@propetroservices.com\nSource: ProPetro Holding Corp.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180326006045/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.propetroservices.com&esheet=51778972&newsitemid=20180326006045&lan=en-US&anchor=www.propetroservices.com&index=1&md5=5c3e2881899ff226685099eab0dbcaad"], "published": "2018-03-27T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T01:16:40.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
