It is aiming to increase production to 3.3 mt this year.\nThe company earned revenue of 6.6 billion dirhams ($ 1.8 billion) in 2017, up 22 percent on the year, and saw a 12 percent increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), he said without providing specific numbers.\nThe UAE is investing billions of dollars in industry, tourism and infrastructure to diversify its economy away from oil. A slowing economy saw construction activity slackening in the last couple of years but a recovery in oil prices is seeing the sector bouncing back.\n“Demand (for steel) has been very buoyant, particularly in Dubai and sections have been developing well in terms of the Expo (2020) in Dubai,” said Chief Financial Officer Stephen Pope.\nReporting by Stanley Carvalho, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:13:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
