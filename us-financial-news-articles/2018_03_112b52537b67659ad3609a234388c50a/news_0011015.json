Rakell set up along the boards and sent the puck deep in the zone to Ryan Getzlaf before going to the net for the return feed and quickly fired a one-timer that beat Chicago goalie Anton Forsberg.\nPerry made it 2-0 at the 6:14 mark with an even-strength marker. He gained the puck along the boards, drove to the front of the net and spun to avoid the check before firing the puck into the net.\nPettersson, a defenseman selected in the second round of the 2014 draft, made his eighth NHL game a memorable one at the 2:09 mark of the second period when his long, high point shot found the twine.\nSilfverberg made it a 4-0 lead with his first of the day coming 6:39 into the middle frame. Andrew Cogliano claimed the puck deep in the zone while forechecking and threw it to the high slot where Silfverberg grabbed it and ripped home a shot.\nAfter the Blackhawks put a couple of goals on the board, Silfverberg — who went into the game with just one goal in 14 games — added his second of the contest seven minutes into the third period, and Perry rounded out his team’s scoring at 14:41.\nRyan Getzlaf collected three assists while Cogliano and Derek Grant had two-point games for Anaheim.\nTomas Jurco scored with five minutes left in the second period to put the Blackhawks on the board, while Nick Schmaltz scored a pair of third-period goals to give him 20 on the season.\nForsberg surrendered four goals on 21 shots before giving way to Jean-Francois Berube in the Chicago net. Berube made eight saves in his relief appearance for a Blackhawks team with just four wins in 16 outings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:17:44.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
