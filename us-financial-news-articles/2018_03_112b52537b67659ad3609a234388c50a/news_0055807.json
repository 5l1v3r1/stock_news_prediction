Late last year we asked senior leaders across Snap to look closely at their teams to ensure they had the right resources and organizations to support their missions,\" Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan said in a statement. \"As a result, new structures have been put in place for Content, Engineering, Sales and many other parts of Snap.\" \nIt's the second round of layoffs in recent weeks. The company behind pioneering disappearing message app Snapchat earlier this month said it was laying off \"just over 120\" engineers. \nThe company also saw several smaller rounds of layoffs in its marketing, recruiting and content divisions earlier this year, each time cutting just a couple dozen employees. \n\"These changes reflect our view that tighter integration and closer collaboration between our teams is a critical component of sustainably growing our business,\" Khan said. \"While this process has required us to make some really tough decisions, we believe that rigorously ensuring our team structure always aligns with our goals will make us stronger.\" \nIts stock price was flat Thursday. \nSnap said it had roughly 3,000 employees as of the December quarter, and in its first annual filing it said it expected \"headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future.\" WATCH: Celebrities attacking Snap is not a good look for the company: Recode's Kara Swisher show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:10:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
