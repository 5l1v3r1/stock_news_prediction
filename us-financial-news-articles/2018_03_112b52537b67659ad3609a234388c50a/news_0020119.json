We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of our performance. It is commonly used to analyze and compare media companies on the basis of operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Nonetheless, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indication of our financial performance, an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may compute Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner; therefore, Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as we report it.\n(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA over Revenues.\nInvestor Relations Contacts:\nIn Buenos Aires:\nIn New York:\nCablevisión Holding S.A.\ni-advize Corporate Communications, Inc\nAgustín Medina Manson, Head of Investor Relations\nCamilla Ferreira / Kenia Vargas\nPatricio Gentile, Sr. Analyst of Investor Relations\nEmail: cferreira@i-advize.com\nEmail: ir@cablevisionholding.com\nkvargas@i-advize.com\nTel: (+54 11) 4309-3417\nTel: +1-212-406-3695 / 3696\nhttps://www.cablevisionholding.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cablevision-holding-announces-fourth-quarter-and-accumulated-2017-results-300611298.html\nSOURCE CVH", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cablevision-holding-announces-fourth-quarter-and-accumulated-2017-results-300611298.html", "https://www.cablevisionholding.com/"], "published": "2018-03-09T03:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T05:00:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
