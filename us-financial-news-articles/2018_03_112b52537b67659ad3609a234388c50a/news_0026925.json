The acquisition is consistent with our strategy of disciplined growth through complementary bolt-on acquisitions in our core markets.\"\nPaul Wright, Managing Director of Europe Metals continued, \"Our acquisition of these businesses is an excellent example of how our UK growth strategy is taking shape. Morley's large ferrous and non-ferrous processing facilities will extend our footprint into new markets, while offering local businesses competitive solutions to their metal recycling needs. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues into the Sims UK team.\"\nStan, Tom and Michael Whittaker, owners of Morley, commented, \"Credit for today's business lies with our parents and founders of the business, Stan Snr and Kay; they founded the business 58 years ago, providing us with the platform to successfully expand across the North of England.
