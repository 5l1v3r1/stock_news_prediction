Media buyer GroupM—itself owned by WPP— said in December that the two web giants likely accounted for 84% of all digital ad investment outside China in 2017. There’s often no middle-man in this picture, so less business for the likes of WPP. \nConsumer goods companies such as Unilever are also cutting ad spend to save costs, although it’s worth noting that Unilever recently threatened to yank its ads from Facebook and Google if the digital platforms don’t stop dividing society and amplifying hatred. \nWhile Sorrell downplayed the effects of Google and Facebook on his business, he did suggest they would have major effects on the companies whose content runs alongside his ads, telling CNBC on Thursday that a “fearsome seven” tech firms—Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft , Netflix , Alibaba and Tencent—would cause major consolidation in the media. \n“On the content side, companies like Netflix and Amazon can pay significantly higher sums for an hour of content than traditional content producers. And that has created changes in the market, some would say distortions in the market, that are driving this consolidation,” he said. \nWPP’s price drop had an immediate effect on other European media stocks, hitting ad giant Publicis Groupe (pubgy) and broadcaster ITV (itvpf) . \nShore Capital downgraded WPP to a “hold” rating on Thursday and JPMorgan Chase left it at “overweight.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T16:45:28.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
