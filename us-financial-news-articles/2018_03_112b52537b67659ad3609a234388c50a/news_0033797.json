In addition, we have concerns about the lack of focus on profitability for the company, and the one profitability metric that is used excludes the cost of stock-based compensation,\" CalSTRS's Director of Corporate Governance, Anne Sheehan, said.\nEarlier this month, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended Tesla stockholders reject the package, saying the \"unprecedented\" award was too rich.\nMusk could own as much as $55.8 billion in Tesla stock and more than a quarter of the electric car company in the next decade if he hits all targets of the new plan.\nUnder the proposed award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla's market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder.\nTesla is valued at about $52.46 billion at Tuesday's closing price, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its shares have fallen nearly 12 percent since the pay plan for Musk was announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T16:05:38.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
