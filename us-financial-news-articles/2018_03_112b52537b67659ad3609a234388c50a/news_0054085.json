The FIFA world cup trophy is displayed during the Fifa World Cup Trophy Tour, in Amman, Jordan February 20, 2018. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed/File Photo \nThe list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees published by world soccer’s ruling body FIFA on Thursday confirmed officials from 46 countries but none from England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. \nThe United States, with two referees and two assistants, was best represented. \nVideo assistant referees, who will be used for the first time at a World Cup when the tournament starts on June 14, will be chosen from the pool of named officials. \nEngland’s Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the 2016 European championship final between hosts France and Portugal, had been on FIFA’s early list but he left the Premier League last season for a job in Saudi Arabia. \n“It is a disappointment, because we pride ourselves on the international games that our referees have had over the years,” Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) boss Mike Riley told Sky Sports television this month.
