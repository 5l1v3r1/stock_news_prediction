Analysts on average had expected an operating profit of 273.68 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company said in October that it expected annual operating profit to be slightly lower than its previous estimate, due to higher costs and investments in the mining business.\nFull-year revenue rose 27.7 percent to 2.36 billion pounds, also above analysts’ estimate of 2.31 billion pounds.
