That’s traumatic,” Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said at a news conference hours after the Friday morning shooting.\nThe shooting led authorities to order a lockdown of the campus, which has more than 20,000 students, and police also warned Mount Pleasant residents to be on guard.\nThe site of shooting at Central Michigan University is seen, in Mount Pleasant, U.S., March 2, 2018 in this picture obtained from social media. COURTESY of GRANT POLMANTEER /via REUTERS Police in helicopters and patrol cars spent Friday scouring the locked down campus and the area for the suspect, local media reported. Police escorted people leaving the campus, as university events were canceled and Saturday classes were called off, university officials said in a statement.\nDavis had been taken to a local hospital on Thursday night after an apparent overdose or“bad reaction to drugs,” Klaus told reporters.\nThe two victims were James Davis Sr. and Diva Davis, both 47, university officials said on Twitter.\nJames Davis Sr. was a police officer in Bellwood, Illinois, a Chicago suburb, Emanuel Chris Welch, an Illinois state lawmaker, said in a post on Twitter.\nThe incident came just over two weeks after 17 students and educators were killed by a 19-year-old gunman with an assault-style rifle at a Florida high school.\nReporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T09:35:19.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
