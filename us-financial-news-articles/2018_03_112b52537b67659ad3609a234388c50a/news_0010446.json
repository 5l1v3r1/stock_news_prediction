The Tigers finished the campaign with back-to-back wins coming off a season-high-tying three-game skid.\nDaniel Gafford had 16 points to lead Arkansas (21-10, 10-8). Daryl Macon scored 12 and both Jaylen Barford and Anton Beard had 11 as the Razorbacks saw the end of their two-game winning streak that included a 91-82 upset of No. 14 Auburn on Tuesday.\nDespite the loss, Arkansas capped the regular season with victories in six of their final eight games.\nThe Tigers held a 37-25 rebounding advantage but won despite shooting only 41.7 percent (20 of 48) from the floor. The Razorbacks shot 44.6 percent (25 of 56) in defeat.\nMissouri led 39-31 at halftime.\nThe Tigers had their lead up to 12 points with 6:04 remaining before Arkansas pulled within six after Gafford’s dunk with 3:58 to play.\nThe Razorbacks were again within six at 69-63 with 2:30 left after Macon’s layup, but they failed to come any closer.\nArkansas led by as many as seven in the opening half, with a free throw from C.J. Jones at the 13:36 mark putting the Razorbacks ahead 14-7.\nAn 8-0 run capped by Robertson’s 3-pointer gave Missouri the lead, and the Tigers never trailed after that.\nArkansas won the first meeting with Missouri this season on Jan. 13, with Gifford (15 points) one of four Razorbacks in double figures. Missouri got a game-high 26 points from Robertson in that contest.\nThe Southeastern Conference tournament begins Wednesday at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:55:37.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
