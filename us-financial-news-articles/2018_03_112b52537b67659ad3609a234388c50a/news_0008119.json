(NYSE: TCO) (“Taubman,” “Taubman Centers” or the \"Company”) Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the upcoming 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “2018 Annual Meeting”). Additionally, Land & Buildings announced that it has submitted a non-binding business proposal for an advisory vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting that would substantially improve the ability of all Taubman shareholders to make their voices heard with respect to the direction of the Company.\nLand & Buildings’ statement follows:\n“Land & Buildings has nominated a director candidate for election to the Taubman Centers Board of Directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting. We believe the election of directors is the most powerful way that shareholders can influence the strategic direction of a public company – something which is sorely needed at Taubman.\nLand & Buildings has also submitted a non-binding business proposal for consideration by shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting asking the Board to eliminate the dual class voting stock structure. Under the proposal, the Company would offer to exchange 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock for all outstanding shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), which is almost entirely owned by the members of the Taubman family (the “Taubman Family”), or such other amount of shares of Common Stock as the Company and the Taubman Family shall agree.\nThe exchange of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock for the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock represents an approximate 32% premium to the value of the Series B Preferred Stock and Operating Partnership Units stapled securities as disclosed in the Company’s 2017 Proxy Statement.\nIn our view, the Taubman Family’s ownership of approximately 30% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock currently disenfranchises other shareholders. We believe an offer for the Taubman Family’s shares of Series B Preferred Stock is necessary to provide all shareholders a meaningful role in the election of directors and a true mechanism to make their voices heard.\nIn our view, dual class voting structures serve to disenfranchise common shareholders. In fact, the new SEC Commissioner, Robert J. Jackson Jr., recently opined on the efficacy of dual class share structures, asking, “Do Main Street investors in our public markets benefit when corporate insiders maintain outsized control in perpetuity?” 1\nWe believe one of Taubman’s most valuable assets is its qualification to be taxed as a REIT. In fact, the Company’s Articles of Incorporation (the “Charter”) outline in great detail the actions the Board can take to insure that the REIT status is maintained. Troublingly, we believe the Taubman Family’s ownership of the Series B Preferred Stock violates the Company’s Ownership Limit set forth in the Charter and could jeopardize the Company’s REIT status. Buying the Series B Preferred Stock from the Taubman Family would eliminate this risk, in our view.\nIt is well established, despite being a bitter pill to swallow, that companies can purchase what amounts to controlling interests from insider shareholders. Specifically, the Taubman Family’s control interest was purchased at Sotheby’s, and last year the Ratner family’s control interest was purchased at Forest City (NYSE: FCE) at about the same premium as Land & Buildings is proposing for Taubman.\nAs a reminder, at the 2017 Annual Meeting, nearly all actively managed shareholders voted to remove Chairman, CEO and President Robert Taubman and Lead Director Myron Ullman from the Taubman Centers Board. Only a last minute announcement by the Company to declassify and refresh its Board likely swayed several key investors to management’s side. Unfortunately, since the 2017 election, the Board has continued to demonstrate its disregard for shareholders’ voices, and performance has remained dismal. Since the 2017 Annual Meeting, shares of Taubman declined by 16%, underperforming its Class A Mall Peers by 22%. 2\nThe Board initially refused to outline the time frame for declassification and the time frame for Board refreshment, which if left to their own devices could have dragged on much longer than it should have. Land & Buildings was compelled to file proxy materials with the SEC seeking to call a special meeting of shareholders to hold an advisory vote on the timing of both the declassification as well as the board refresh. The Board denied our requests to immediately declassify, and instead, chose to begin to declassify in 2018, leaving 2019 as the first opportunity for a majority of the Taubman Board to potentially stand for re-election.\nIn November 2017, the Board announced that two new Directors would be appointed, one of which was the investment banker who led the IPO of Taubman Centers in 1992 at Morgan Stanley. In our view, this highlights the same entrenchment-minded action taken by the Taubman Centers’ interconnected Board during the 2017 election contest, namely, cosmetic changes designed to preserve the troubling status quo.\nFurthermore, Taubman’s operating and financial performance has remained disappointing and concerning. Consider the following items that were announced in conjunction with the Company’s recent fourth quarter earnings release:\nTaubman’s best-in-class portfolio continues to generate lackluster results, with same store net operating income and releasing spreads again worst amongst its Class A Mall Peers. 3 Taubman announced that its balance sheet will remain overleveraged for even longer than it anticipated. Taubman announced additional development missteps in conjunction with its earnings release with additional delays and lower yields. Taubman engaged an outside consultant in the fourth quarter of 2017 that is expected to result in cost savings, but in reality raises more answers than questions.\nWe believe the pattern of lackluster performance is directly tied to Taubman’s resistance to change – namely its desire to do the bare minimum when it comes to enhancing corporate governance and independent Board oversight. We will continue to take all actions necessary to ensure that the best interests of all Taubman shareholders are protected.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T16:50:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
