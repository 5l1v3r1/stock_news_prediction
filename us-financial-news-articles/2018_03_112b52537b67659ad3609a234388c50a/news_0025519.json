Eyes will be firmly on U.S. inflation figures (1230 GMT), with the anticipation likely putting a dampener on early trading volumes. The British finance minister’s Spring Statement, also at 1230 GMT, won’t deliver any policy shifts but is likely to reveal slightly better economic growth figures. Germany-listed shares in Steinhoff could also be ones to watch after the crisis-hit South African retailer said it would place up to 450 million shares in KAP Industrial, reducing its holding in the firm to 26 percent from 43 percent, in a bid to plug a liquidity gap. M&A drove shares in German utilities RWE, E.ON and Innogy up yesterday, and shareholders will likely be pleased with RWE’s latest announcement, that it will hike its dividends in 2018 and 2019. In fresh dealmaking news French bank Natixis is buying stakes in three independent boutique advisory firms including Vermilion Partners, which focuses on cross-border M&A involving China. The bank hopes to diversify its banking activities and increase its presence in China through the acquisitions. Encouraging earnings from Geberit could drive the stock up 2 to 3 percent, according to pre-market calls, while traders say premium drinks maker Fevertree, a small UK-listed stock, could dip despite strong results, as investors take profits on the fast-growing stock.

FTSE futures are lagging the rest, down 0.1 percent ahead of the Spring Statement at 1230 GMT. Here's SocGen's economists' take ahead of the statement: \"The OBR will present updated economic and (better) fiscal forecasts. Mr Hammond’s speech will be very short, however, because he will only acknowledge and welcome the improved forecasts but will not make any policy changes.\" Policy tweaks will have to wait for the Autumn Budget. (Helen Reid) EARLY MORNING COMPANY HEADLINE ROUND-UP (0657 GMT) While U.S. inflation is likely to focus the attention of investors today, there's also a lot of company results with OMV, Iliad, Wacker Chemie and Geberit among the firms reporting. And RWE's promised its shareholders higher dividends after its deal to break up Innogy with E.ON. Here's a quick round-up of the morning company headlines so far: RWE pledges higher dividends after Innogy break-up deal Telecoms group Iliad dials up higher annual profits Austria's OMV aims to increase core profit by 70 pct by 2025 Wacker Chemie sees 2018 earnings growing faster than sales French bank Natixis buying into 3 M&A boutiques, bolsters China presence Geberit sees decent construction market in 2018 Under pressure, ING scraps plan to raise CEO pay (Helen Reid)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T10:28:58.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
