Uber develops its own sensing and drive technology,\" Huang said in response to a question asked at the conference.\nThe Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors.\nHuang's comments provide more detail as to the relationship between Nvidia and Uber, one of its many partners.\nNvidia's shares have fallen by about 9.5 percent since the company said on Tuesday it was temporarily halting its self-driving tests on public roads out of respect for the victim in the March 18 accident involving an Uber self-driving vehicle. An investigation is ongoing.\nThe chipmaker is continuing tests on closed enclosures, the chief executive said.\nUber suspended self-driving tests in North America after an autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Arizona earlier in the month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:45:02.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
