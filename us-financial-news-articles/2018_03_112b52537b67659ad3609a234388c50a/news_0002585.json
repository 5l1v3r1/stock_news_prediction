REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki TRUCKS ON STANDBY Egeland said a “two-way” humanitarian corridor was needed, with several convoys each week into eastern Ghouta, while 1,000 priority medical cases must be evacuated for treatment.\n“I have to say I know no humanitarian actor... who thinks the five hours is enough for us to be able to deliver relief into eastern Ghouta and to organise orderly medical evacuations out,” he said of the Russian unilateral declaration.\nDuring Thursday’s meeting of the humanitarian taskforce in Geneva, the United Nations received notice that it may get permission from Damascus to go to Douma in eastern Ghouta.\n“We have 43 trucks standing by to go there and full warehouses to load into the trucks as soon as we get the permit,” Egeland said.\nU.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura told reporters the world body would not give up seeking a full 30-day ceasefire, as mandated by the U.N. Security Council last Saturday.\n“We are determined because otherwise this becomes the copycat of Aleppo,” de Mistura said, referring to a battle for besieged rebel-held eastern Aleppo in late 2016.\nGhanem Tayara, chairman of the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations (UOSSM) working in Syria, said some 1,123 patients needed evacuation from eastern Ghouta, where two hospitals have been bombed since Saturday’s resolution.\n“The U.N. resolution has been ignored completely,” he said.\nReporting by Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T14:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:00:13.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
