Instead, the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is Amazon,” the news website reported, citing five sources who have discussed the issue with him.\nThe report comes at a time when tech stocks are already under pressure after Facebook Inc acknowledged earlier this month that user data had been improperly harvested by a consultancy firm.\n“With Facebook and regulatory worries the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see was news that Trump is targeting Bezos and Amazon over the coming months as this remains a lingering cloud over the stock and heightens the risk profile in the eyes of the Street,” GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.\nTrump had in the past criticized Amazon and its founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who is also the richest person www.forbes.com/billionaires/ #b88398c251c7 in the world with a net worth of more than $100 billion, according to Forbes.\nBezos also owns The Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media.\n“He’s obsessed with Amazon,” a source told Axios.
