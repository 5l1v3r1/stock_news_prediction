The test was negative.\nFrench customs said they had followed regulations and were ready to clarify with the Italians any legal and operational procedures to avoid future incidents.\nMassimiliano Fedriga of the right-wing League, which made big gains in recent elections, said the French had made Italy look like the laughing stock of Europe.\n“French police do whatever they want on Italian territory without being disturbed, as if they are at home. What happened in Bardonecchia is grave and shows how our so-called friends in Europe have little or no consideration for us,” he said in a statement.\nReporting By Philip Pullella; Additional reporting by Leigh Thomas in Paris; Editing by Andrew Bolton and Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T18:57:00.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
