REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo The facilities replace Glencore’s existing US$7.335bn one-year revolving credit facility agreed in May 2017.\nThe financing launched at US$6bn and closed oversubscribed, raising US$9.7bn from the market after receiving strong support from the company’s broad group of existing banks.\nDue to a stronger commodity price environment, Glencore decided to increase the size of the facilities.\nThe new facilities are unsecured and include a 12-month extension option and a 12-month borrower’s term-out option, extending the final maturity out to May 2020.\nThe facilities have no financial covenants.\nBNP Paribas, HSBC Bank, MUFG and Santander UK were active bookrunners on the financing. A total of 58 banks committed to the financing, including 31 mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners.\nReporting by Alasdair Reilly\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:58:37.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
