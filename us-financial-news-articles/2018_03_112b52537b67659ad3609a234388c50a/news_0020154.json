That followed revelations the finance ministry had retained documents that officials had said no longer existed.\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T08:14:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
