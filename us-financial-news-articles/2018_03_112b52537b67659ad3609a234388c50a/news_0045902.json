A second list of goods, including wine, apples, ethanol and stainless steel pipe, would be charged 15 percent, mirroring Trump's tariff hike on aluminum.\nOverall, the nation's farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. The American pork industry sent $1.1 billion in products, making China the No. 3 market for U.S. pork.\n\"No one wins in these tit-for-tat trade disputes, least of all the farmers and the consumers,\" said National Pork Producers Council President Jim Heimerl, a pig farmer from Johnstown, Ohio.\nThe U.S. has complained for years about China's sharp-elbowed trading practices, accusing it of pirating trade secrets, manipulating its currency, forcing foreign companies to hand over technology, and flooding world markets with cheap steel and aluminum that drive down prices and put U.S. manufacturers out of business.\nThe spiraling trade dispute between the world's two largest economies has spurred concerns among companies and investors that global commerce could be depressed.\nThis story corrects Liu He's title.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T01:59:09.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
