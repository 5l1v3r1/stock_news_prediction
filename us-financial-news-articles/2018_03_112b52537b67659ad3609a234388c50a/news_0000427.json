And many Chinese people have supported his leadership—but now that support might be tested.\nThe ruling Communist Party changed the Chinese Constitution this week, removing term limits and effectively giving Xi the ability stay in power for the foreseeable future . This move has been largely unpopular, with many drawing parallels to the rule of Mao Zedong.

Despite being a seemingly cute bear, Chinese censors are notorious for blocking any content that seems even mildly critical of the Chinese leader.\nWinnie the Pooh gets banned from Chinese social media for looking too much like Xi Jinping https://t.co/5L4DTTPexa pic.twitter.com/KKbcAaZYzJ\n— Shanghaiist.com (@shanghaiist) July 17, 2017", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/asia/china-censorship-xi-jinping.html", "https://twitter.com/manyapan/status/967729594093785088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/5L4DTTPexa", "https://t.co/u9kL5OYGwq", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/XiJinping?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/kingwinnie?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/Bb6Dmy46xH", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/shanghaiist/status/886855671592996865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/KKbcAaZYzJ"], "published": "2018-03-01T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T15:59:02.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
