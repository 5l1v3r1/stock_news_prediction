Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS Martin Vizcarra, who had been Peru’s vice president, abruptly became president last week after Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned amid growing graft allegations.\nA former Wall Street banker who once held U.S. citizenship, Kuczynski had been one of Maduro’s most outspoken critics, deeming him a “dictator” and barring him from the Summit of the Americas that Peru will host on April 13-14.\nMaduro vowed to attend the summit anyway, and his loyalists exulted over Kuczynski’s downfall with a fireworks display last week.\nBut Vizcarra declined to weigh in on the dispute as he focuses on building support across Peru by promising to refocus the government’s attention on domestic problems that had been neglected while Kuczynski struggled to remain in power.\nAfter returning from a coastal region still reeling from severe floods last year, Vizcarra was asked at a news conference what he thought about Maduro’s being banned from the summit.\n“Our foreign policy is so delicate we must leave it in the hands of specialists,” Vizcarra told journalists at the presidential palace. “The foreign affairs ministry is taking the corresponding decisions that we’ll support.”\nPeruvian President Martin Vizcarra visits flood victims in the northern city of Piura, Peru March 27, 2018.
