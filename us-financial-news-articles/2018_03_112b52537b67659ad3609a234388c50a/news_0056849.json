REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh The town of Douma, controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebel group, is the last patch of eastern Ghouta still held by insurgents who have been routed in a ferocious offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian military that began in February.\nIts recovery would seal a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad, crushing the last big rebel stronghold near Damascus seven years into a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.\nThousands of people - fighters from other rebel factions, their families and other civilians - have been leaving for northwestern Syria from other parts of eastern Ghouta in convoys of buses that have been given safe passage to Idlib province.\nJaish al-Islam has so far refused such an evacuation, saying it amounts to forced demographic change by Assad and his allies.\nFILE PHOTO: Rebel fighters pray before they are evacuated outside Harasta in eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria March 23, 2018.

There are tens of thousands of civilians in the town.\nSyrian state TV said a deal had nearly been reached for Jaish al-Islam to leave Douma to the Idlib, citing preliminary information.\nThe government offensive in eastern Ghouta has killed more than 1,600 civilians, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. It said a total of 144,000 people have now been displaced from eastern Ghouta.\nWhile thousands have gone to rebel-held territory near the Turkish border, the bulk of the displaced have fled the fighting to shelters in government-held areas near eastern Ghouta.\nReporting by Maria Kiselyova in Moscow and Tom Perry in Beirut; writing by Tom Perry; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T14:13:03.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
