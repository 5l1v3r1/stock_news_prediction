Although the southern European country has been growing above 1 percent in the past few years, unemployment levels are still over 11 percent and an inflow of immigrants has deepened social tensions .\nAlessia Pierdomenico | Bloomberg | Getty Images \"The social malaise that has been accumulated in this country, like in most other countries, is fostering populistic — kind of — political approaches in parties,\" Passera said. He added that it was a \"good piece of news\" that the Italian economy has been growing but the rate is not enough to generate enough employment. \"That's the priority number one for the new government, no matter who wins the elections,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, UBS estimates the Italian economy grew 1.5 percent in 2017, supported by domestic demand and trade. It also predicts that its fiscal position has improved, in terms of both deficit and debt. Analysts at the bank, in a research note Tuesday, also said that growth was mostly due to cyclical reasons, but added that it has further room to run if Italian companies invest more. However, it warned that a \"prolonged phase of political uncertainty could harm the recovery and undermine entrepreneurs' animal spirits.\"\nshow chapters Italy edges closer to an unpredictable election 3:28 AM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 01:47 The latest election polls from a few weeks ago suggest there will be no clear winner on Sunday. Analysts expect a hung parliament and weeks, potentially months, of negotiations to form a government.\nSpeaking to CNBC on Friday, Deborah Bergamini, party spokesperson for Forza Italia, said it would be very difficult for her party to join forces with the center-left.\n\"I see it as really, really, really impossible,\" she said. \"We did try this experiment back in 2013 and it was a big failure.\"\nAfter weeks of political deadlock following a general election in 2013, the party of Silvio Berlusconi — at the time called The People of Freedom — supported Enrico Letta from Partido Democratico. That government lasted only for a year.\nUniCredit analysts believe that the \"election outcome remains surrounded by a degree of uncertainty.\"\n\"Between the election date and the formation of a broad coalition, headline risk will dominate, likely causing BTP (multi-year Italian sovereign bonds) volatility,\" the analysts said in a note. Italian bonds have proved resilient in the last couple of months, supported by stronger euro zone growth as well as less Euroskeptic sentiment in the country.\nLast week, their gap against German bunds widened to the most since January on concerns over the election outcome, but tightened again this week suggesting some confidence among investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T12:15:24.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
