(NYSE:GLOG) (\"GasLog\") announced today that they have approved entering into two agreements:\nFor the Partnership to purchase from GasLog 100% of the shares in the entity that owns and charters GasLog Gibraltar (the \"Acquisition\"). The aggregate purchase price for the Acquisition will be $207 million, which includes $1 million for positive net working capital balances to be transferred with the vessel. The Acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The Board of Directors of GasLog, the Board of Directors of GasLog Partners (the \"Board\") and the Conflicts Committee of the Board have approved the Acquisition; and\nFor the Partnership to repay in full its $45 million unsecured term loan from GasLog (\"New Sponsor Credit Facility\"). The New Sponsor Credit Facility accrues interest at a rate of 9.125% per annum with an annual 1.0% commitment fee on the undrawn balance, with scheduled maturity in March 2022.\nGasLog Partners expects to satisfy the above transactions through a combination of (i) $58 million in cash on hand, sourced from the proceeds of its recent 8.200% Series B preference units offering; (ii) $45 million of new privately placed common units issued to GasLog (1) ; and (iii) the assumption of $149 million of existing debt on GasLog Gibraltar.\nGasLog Gibraltar is a 174,000 cubic meter tri-fuel diesel electric liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") carrier built in 2016 and operated by GasLog since delivery. The vessel is currently on a long-term time charter with a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc (\"Shell\") through October 2023. Shell has two consecutive extension options which, if exercised, would extend the charter for a period of either five or eight years.\nThe Partnership believes that the Acquisition will be immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit and is consistent with its strategy to grow cash distributions through dropdown and third-party acquisitions. GasLog Partners estimates that GasLog Gibraltar will add approximately $22.4 million to EBITDA (2) in the first 12 months after closing. Accordingly, the Acquisition purchase price represents a multiple of approximately 9.2x estimated EBITDA. Upon closing, the Acquisition will be supportive of GasLog Partners' guidance of 5% to 7% year-on-year distribution growth in 2018.\nAndy Orekar, Chief Executive Officer of GasLog Partners, stated, \"I am very pleased to continue executing our growth strategy with the accretive acquisition of GasLog Gibraltar. This 2016-built vessel is highly complementary to our strategy and its charter to Shell provides approximately five and a half years of stable cash flows at attractive fixed charter terms. In addition, the repayment in full of our highest cost debt is immediately accretive to our distributable cash flow per unit and strengthens our balance sheet. Furthermore, our partial satisfaction of the total consideration payable through the issuance of new privately placed common units to GasLog enables the Partnership to retain substantial liquidity to fund future growth.\"\nPaul Wogan, Chief Executive Officer of GasLog, stated, \"We continue to execute on our strategy of dropping vessels into GasLog Partners at a premium to book value and recycling the capital to GasLog. The receipt of newly issued, privately placed common units as partial consideration for these two transactions highlights the strong alignment of GP and LP interests and increases our ownership in the Partnership to approximately 30%. Through our unit ownership and incentive distribution rights, we will benefit from future increases in GasLog Partners' distributions, which should continue to enhance our cash flow, growth prospects and valuation.\"\n(1) Number of and allocation between general partner and common units to be determined prior to closing of the Acquisition based on the volume weighted average pre-closing trading price of the Partnership's common units.\n(2) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. The Partnership believes that this non-GAAP financial measure assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. The Partnership believes that including EBITDA assists our management and investors in (i) understanding and analyzing the results of our operating and business performance, (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (iii) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold our common units. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of interest, gain/loss on interest rate swaps, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, financial market conditions, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect results of operations between periods.\nEBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered as an alternative to, or as a substitute for, or superior to profit, profit from operations, earnings per unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with IFRS. Some of these limitations include the fact that it does not reflect (i) our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs and (iii) the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. It is not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statement of cash flows and other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently to how we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nFor the entity owning GasLog Gibraltar, estimated EBITDA for the first 12 months of operation following the completion of the Acquisition is based on the following assumptions:\n· closing of the Acquisition in the second quarter of 2018 and timely receipt of charter hire specified in the charter contracts;\n· utilization of 363 days and no drydocking;\n· vessel operating and supervision costs and charter commissions per current internal estimates; and\n· general and administrative expenses based on management's current internal estimates.\nGasLog and GasLog Partners consider the above assumptions to be reasonable as of March 21, 2018, but if these assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual EBITDA for the entity owning the vessel could differ materially from our estimates. The prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, but, in the view of management, was prepared on a reasonable basis and reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this document are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information. Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent accountants have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained above, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such prospective financial information.\nContacts:\nAlastair Maxwell\nChief Financial Officer\nPhone: +44-203-388-3105\nPhil Corbett\nHead of Investor Relations\nPhone: +44-203-388-3116\nJoseph Nelson\nDeputy Head of Investor Relations\nPhone: +1 212-223-0643\nEmail: ir@gaslogmlp.com\nSource:GasLog Ltd.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mioHZhST7czFKjSNdE55YmpfdjwQz-tFAQCB0yat6c5zwW2zKCuHyjA9U0eYv4kPIZnYZPUOxCAhoOAxPqTBgPQaQ_8W2wnzKqo0K4nFeWc=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c0558058-e762-4b33-a549-de60a9f5a8b2", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mioHZhST7czFKjSNdE55YpQggNy1Y-B4qUJ2sSGMk6Id5GzdzwkpsLngYfb8LAWPUvW71dRqxOT_gMskwvJL4w==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mioHZhST7czFKjSNdE55YsfJJNV-pQgzcQX9Uxz7jt3MaFf3c9OhY_PPKk9KMAZINHhg1XzjjxM1OlucyIrtSxydJK7C-Ej4Djud85bDYtc="], "published": "2018-03-21T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T14:23:25.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
