But there’s one person you won’t hear repeating the Bud Light marketing tagline: Miller Lite marketer Greg Butler. He tells Ad Age : “I get a ton of people saying, ‘Are you going to do something like Dilly Dilly?’ And I’m like ‘No, I have to sell beer, not sell a meme...and the reality is it’s not selling beer.” (For all the sass, both brands are in decline, according to Beer Marketer’s Insights.)\nJohnny B Gone Papa John’s and the NFL have been in an unhappy marriage in recent months. After the pizza chain said in November it was evaluating the relationship in the wake of declining TV ratings that it blamed for hurting its third-quarter sales, Papa John’s confirmed it will no longer be the official pizza of the league , WSJ reports. Papa John’s, an NFL partner since 2010, isn’t ditching football altogether, and will shift its sponsorship spend to individual teams and players. It’s also planning to redirect investments into building its data and analytics capabilities. Paul Samuels, executive vice president of global partnerships at sports and entertainment presenter AEG, tells me team and personality sponsorships allow brands to be more targeted regionally, especially in locations where Papa John’s may not be as strong. “It also gives them greater flexibility in delivering consistent promotions to these regions, greater on the ground presence for experiential activity and engagement with visitors and fans of the team, and arguably more relevance to the individual fan of a team via more targeted messaging,” Mr. Samuels added.\nAll These Little Things A couple of years ago, LittleThings Chief Executive Joe Spieser was giving Quote: s in interviews like “ Facebook is everything to us ” and “ Facebook loves publishers .” Love is an unpredictable and sometimes heartbreaking beast. The four-year-old social publisher shut down Tuesday , leading to the loss of around 100 jobs, Digiday first reported. The closure comes after Facebook’s recent algorithm change led its traffic to plunge by 75%. In November, The Wall Street Journal reported that LittleThings had hired a bank to explore a variety of options, including a sale, but potential buyers were “spooked” by the traffic drop, Mr. Spieser wrote in a memo . The news might sound ominous for other digital media companies seeking investments or exits. However, Sachin Kamdar, CEO of analytics firm Parse.ly, tells me that overall, Facebook traffic to its network of publishers had already declined significantly over 2017 and has only seen a slight decrease since the algorithm announcement in January. At present, publishers across Parse.ly’s network are counting on Facebook for around 23% of their traffic on average, a percentage that’s held fairly steady over February, and suggests the social network still remains a big opportunity for audience growth.\nFacebook and the Facebook Book Guy A rollercoaster couple of days for Facebook’s public relations team, which you can relive in GIF and meme form , thanks to BuzzFeed. The tl;dr version: Earlier this week, professional ex-Facebooker and author of “Chaos Monkeys,” Antonio Garcia Martinez, wrote for Wired , suggesting the Trump 2016 election campaign had more engaging creative than Clinton’s and therefore was able to access lower prices in Facebook’s ad auctions. That assertion was supported by Brad Parscale, the former digital director of the Trump 2016 campaign (who yesterday was tapped to become Trump’s 2020 campaign manager ). Mr. Parscale tweeted , “We had CPMs that were pennies in some cases.” This led Facebook’s VP of AR/VR (and former VP of ads, who still seems to tweet a lot about ads,) Andrew Bosworth, to respond with a chart that shows the Trump campaign paid slightly higher CPMs on most days . Still, the chart is perhaps more revealing of what we don’t know than what we do--such as targeting criteria and campaign objectives. We’ll only find out more if each campaign gives Facebook permission to release the data.\nUpfront and Personal Here’s a cautionary tale about throwing too many of your marketing dollars in the TV upfronts. Weight-loss brand Nutrisystem blamed its slow start to 2018--the key diet season-- on a marketing effort that flopped , owing to tired creative ( decide for yourself ) and cable news ratings declines, which meant its ads reach fewer people than hoped, Bloomberg reported. The company had committed to high-rate upfront ad buys and couldn’t switch up the marketing mix when January viewership figures came out and some cable news stations were down on 2017. The comparatives were tough as that was a time when networks were pulling in big audiences around President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The plan now? A creative revamp that’ll launch in the second quarter, better media optimization, and more variety in the messaging for its direct-response campaigns.\nBest of the rest YouTube has restored ads on Logan Paul’s channels, but his content remains in a 90-day “probation period” in which his videos are prevented from appearing in the YouTube trending section and he won’t be included in YouTube’s notifications to users who don’t subscribe to his channels. Mr. Paul’s channels also haven’t returned to the Google Preferred lineup. [ Tubefilter ]\nA study from Mathias Bärtl, a professor at Offenburg University of Applied Sciences in Offenburg, suggests that 96.5% of people trying to become YouTube stars won’t make enough money from advertising to break above the U.S. poverty line. A YouTube spokeswoman said the number of channels earning six figures is up 40% on last year. [ Bloomberg ]\nConsolidation of WPP’s agencies continues apace. The advertising holding company has merged its Burson-Marsteller and Cohn & Wolfe PR agencies to become Burson Cohn & Wolfe, a network with more than 4,000 employees across 42 countries. [ The Holmes Report ]\nPinterest has hired former Google and Square executive Francoise Brougher as its first COO. [ Recode ]\nA group of leading French media companies, including Le Monde, Le Figaro and Le Parisien, are in talks to implement a common single-login system across their sites. The idea is to gain consumer consent for cookie use in preparation for the forthcoming European ePrivacy Regulation. [ Digiday ]\nFedEx released a statement Tuesday clarifying its relationship with the National Rifle Association. The company said its discount pricing program is “not for the NRA itself,” but for American small businesses and consumers that are members of the association, and pointed out the NRA’s shipping page demonstrates a relationship with UPS. [ Ad Age ]\nAn appeals court on Tuesday ruled that TVEyes, a media-monitoring company that distributes TV clips and transcripts of broadcasts to customers, is cheating Fox News out of revenue by not paying for some of the content it resells. In a statement, TVEyes said it was disappointed by the ruling and is evaluating its options. (Reminder: Fox News parent 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.)
