Argentine shares have slid 4.2 percent in March, although they are still up 5.2 percent so far this year. Distribuidora de Gas del Centro distributes natural gas to the Argentine provinces of Catamarca, Cordoba and La Rioja, according to its March 15 prospectus. Banco Santander Rio acted as the organizer and selling agent for the IPO, while AR Partners acted as a selling agent.
