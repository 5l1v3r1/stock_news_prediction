A deal for the companies with combined revenue of around 600 million euros could be finalised in April, a spokeswoman for Equistone told Reuters, confirming a report in Le Figaro. Further details were not immediately available. This latest move follows recent consolidation in the French tourism sector, notably the acquisition of Look Voyages and Vacances Transat by sector leader TUI France. Equistone initially bought Karavel-Promovacances in 2007 before selling it to LBO France in 2011. LBO France had bought Toulouse-based Fram in 2015.
