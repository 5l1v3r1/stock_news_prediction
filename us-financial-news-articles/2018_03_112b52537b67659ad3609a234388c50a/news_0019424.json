Ray Spalding added 18 points, while Deng Adel contributed 15 and reserve Dwayne Sutton netted 10 points. Louisville gets a crack at top-seeded and No. 1 Virginia on Thursday in the first of the quarterfinal games in Brooklyn.\nPJ Savoy and Trent Forrest came off the bench to pace the Seminoles (20-11) with 14 points each. Phil Cofer scored 12 and Mfiondu Kabengele hit for 10 points off the bench, but it wasn’t nearly enough to keep Florida State from facing a tense wait until Selection Sunday.\nFlorida State actually got off to a good start, aided by the Cardinals’ lack of attention to detail. Twice in the first eight minutes, Louisville fouled 3-point shooters. The Seminoles led 17-14 after the second of those infractions and had Savoy marching to the line for a possible 4-point play after a TV timeout.\nBut Savoy missed the shot and Louisville just took over from there. While Florida State made just 2 of 17 shots to close the half, the Cardinals found traction offensively, going on a 27-5 run to close the half with a blend of post and perimeter scoring.\nThey closed the half in fitting fashion, getting a 3-pointer from Ryan McMahon as the horn sounded to take a 41-22 lead to the locker room.\nLouisville kept the roll going to start the second half, expanding its advantage to 26 points at the 11:35 mark when Snider stroked a 3-ball. The Seminoles actually made a good run, cutting the deficit to 80-74 with 15.7 left as Kabengele dunked, but ran out of time.\nThe teams combined for 21 blocked shots, a single-game record in the tournament.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:13:54.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
