Initial price thoughts on SEC-registered perpetual non-call five and non-call 10 notes are 6.375 percent area and 6.625 percent area respectively. The subordinated securities have ratings of Baa3/BBB (Moody’s/Fitch). The AT1s will automatically convert into HSBC shares if the core equity Tier 1 ratio of HSBC Group falls below 7 percent. HSBC is sole structurer and sole bookrunner. The British bank said in its 2017 annual results that it planned to issue $5-$7 billion of AT1 capital this year.
