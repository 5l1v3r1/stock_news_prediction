(NYSE: NSM) today reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $41 million, or $0.41 per diluted share driven principally by strong operating results in the servicing segment. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported earnings for the fourth quarter of $42 million, or $0.43 per diluted share.\n\"Nationstar had an outstanding year in 2017,\" said Jay Bray, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We welcomed over one million new servicing customers, launched new origination channels, and expanded our third-party client base at Xome®. Last month we announced our transformational agreement to merge with WMIH Corp. and we are both committed to continuing and accelerating our growth, leveraging our best-in-class integrated servicing and originations platform. We have taken considerable steps to make homeownership more rewarding for our three million customers and we look forward to identifying additional opportunities to enhance value for the combined company’s shareholders.\"\nServicing\nFor the fourth quarter, Servicing earned $77 million GAAP pretax income or $78 million adjusted pretax income (5.8 basis points). Adjusted profitability increased 23% sequentially driven by decreased amortization and lower expenses. We also continued to implement technology and process initiatives to improve overall servicing profitability. For the full year, the Servicing segment achieved $76 million GAAP pretax income or $248 million adjusted pretax income.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q3'17 (1) Q4'17 (2) $ BPS $ BPS Operational revenue $ 295 22.6 $ 284 21.2 Amortization (60 ) (4.6 ) (55 ) (4.1 ) Mark-to-market (44 ) (3.4 ) — — Total revenues 191 14.6 229 17.1 Expenses (185 ) (14.2 ) (173 ) (12.9 ) Total other income (expenses), net 9 0.7 21 1.5 Income before taxes (GAAP) 15 1.1 77 5.7 Mark-to-market 44 3.4 — — Adjustments 2 0.2 1 0.1 Adjusted pretax income $ 61 4.7 $ 78 5.8 We expanded our portfolio by boarding $175 billion loans during the year, including $145 billion of subservicing.

Prepayments are trending lower, down 26% year-over-year, extending the life of an average loan and increasing the value of the servicing portfolio. Annualized CPR, net of recapture was 15% in the fourth quarter 2016 compared to an average of 13% for the fourth quarter 2017. The Company has grown the portfolio 7% year-over-year with predominantly high-performing loans and limited use of capital. In 2018 Nationstar will implement initiatives designed to leverage scale and reduce expenses. These initiatives will provide customers with the tools, technology, and education necessary to take full control of their home loan experience through self-service. The Company believes adjusted servicing profitability should exceed 6.0 bps on average for the full year 2018 based on the current annualized CPR, net of recapture.\nOriginations\nThe Originations segment posted $30 million GAAP pretax income or $34 million adjusted pretax income in the fourth quarter. We funded approximately $5.2 billion and recapture improved sequentially to 26%. The decline in pretax income was driven by a shift in channel mix, increased rates and seasonality. For the full year, Originations earned $153 million GAAP pretax income or $163 million adjusted pretax income and funded over $19.1 billion.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q3'17 Q4'17 Income before taxes (GAAP) $ 45 $ 30 Adjustments 1 4 Adjusted pretax income $ 46 $ 34 Quarter Ended ($ in millions) Q3'17 Q4'17 Total pull through adjusted volume $ 4,930 $ 4,796 Funded volume $ 5,102 $ 5,152 Recapture percentage 24 % 26 % Purchase volume as a percentage of funded volume 36 % 37 % Throughout 2017 we made key investments in the correspondent, purchase recapture and new customer acquisition channels. We believe these expansions are critical to developing and maintaining relationships with existing and new customers. We also plan to leverage key customer data through our needs-based product offerings designed to restructure debt and lower monthly payments. We believe that these investments will allow us to grow volume and improve profitability.\nXome\nXome delivered $12 million GAAP pretax income or $12 million adjusted pretax income in the fourth quarter. The Exchange business sold over 2,700 properties in the quarter, exiting the year with approximately 6,900 properties in inventory due to improving third-party inflows. Quarter-over-quarter, third-party inflows increased 24% and third-party closings now represent 17% of total sales. The Services business continues to gain new business opportunities and this quarter we added nine new title clients which should provide us with additional revenue and relationships. SaaS remained consistent on a sequential basis as we continue building our white-label product and referral program.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q3'17 Q4'17 Income before taxes (GAAP) $ 11 $ 12 Adjustments 1 — Adjusted pretax income $ 12 $ 12 Adjusted pretax income margin 18 % 18 %\nIn addition, we continue to see growth in our referral program which launched earlier this year. Our referral relationship allows homeowners selling their homes to have access to Xome's exchange platform, real estate agent panel and transaction support to facilitate the lending, title and overall closing experience. The program, launched this last year, has 1,700 property listings and over 700 closings, presenting opportunities for diversified non-default fee income, purchase originations and Xome downstream services.\nQuarter Ended Q3'17 Q4'17 Default property listings sold 2,772 2,725 Default property listings at period end 6,764 6,886 Referral property listings sold 311 409 Xome services completed orders 99,407 96,281 Percentage of revenue earned from third-party customers 33 % 29 % Key strategies for 2018 include re-entering the property inspection and property preservation businesses in order to capture additional revenue and clients.

The replay will be accessible through March 15, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company utilizes non-GAAP (or “adjusted”) financial measures as the measures provide additional information to assist investors in understanding and assessing the Company’s and our business segments’ ongoing performance and financial results, as well as assessing our prospects for future performance. The adjusted financial measures facilitate a meaningful analysis and allow more accurate comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to the Company’s and our business segments’ core operating performance, and are better measures for assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operational and planning decisions and evaluating the Company’s and our business segment’s ongoing performance. Adjusted earnings (loss) in the servicing segment eliminates the effects of mark-to-market adjustments which primarily reflects unrealized gains or losses based on the changes in fair value measurements of MSRs and their related financing liabilities for which a fair value accounting election was made. These adjustments, which can be highly volatile and material due to changes in credit markets, are not necessarily reflective of the gains and losses that will ultimately be realized by the Company. Adjusted earnings (loss) also eliminates in each segment, as applicable, transition and integration costs, gains (losses) on sales of fixed assets, certain settlement costs that are not considered normal operational matters, and other adjustments based on the facts and circumstances that would provide investors a supplemental means for evaluating the Company’s core operating performance.\nImportant Information & Where to Find It\nThis communication is being made in respect of the proposed merger transaction involving WMIH Corp.
