Early retirement and generous pensions are also under attack.\nTransport Minister Elisabeth Borne took to the airwaves to talk up the government’s investment pledges after a decision by the unions to hold fire on strike threats and meet again in mid-March - a move some saw as proof of disunity.\n“Nobody has anything to gain from a protracted strike,” she told Europe 1 radio. Investment would rise by about 50 percent under the reform, she said, adding: “That’s 10 million a day”.\nThe last concerted effort to overhaul the SNCF as part of broader social welfare reforms in 1995 unleashed three weeks of rolling strikes that paralysed transport and precipitated the downfall of president Jacques Chirac’s prime minister, Alain Juppe.\nThere are positive signs for Macron in doing what nobody dared do before him. Opinion polls show broad public support for SNCF reform.\nThe state-appointed boss of the SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, is on board. He warned that refusal to reform would be “an amazing leap backwards” for the company when rival firms start being allowed to compete with it on French tracks in 2019.\nThe government has also said it could write off an SNCF debt of 47 billion euros, easing a burden that includes 1 billion euros of debt interest payments alone per year.\nThe Fitch ratings agency said it read that as a signal of state disengagement and announced that it may cut the safe-bet AA rating that SNCF debt has long enjoyed due to the implicit guarantee of state support.\nMACRON POPULARITY DIP The unions say Macron is laying the ground for an eventual privatisation of the SNCF - something the government denies.\nWhile surveys show broad public support for SNCF reform, a poll published on Wednesday was the second in two days to show a drop in Macron’s popularity, driven by voter concerns over other social and economic reform.\nThe BVA poll showed his approval rating at 43 percent, down four points and one point above a low he hit in October after he announced cuts to wealth tax and social housing aid.\nAn Odoxa poll on Monday showed that while 69 percent favour SNCF reform, they are more evenly split over his government’s decision to reform by decree, bypassing votes in parliament, if necessary.\n“Behind those voicing negative appraisals were the frequent accusations of arrogance or ‘he favours the rich’, or fears of purchasing power,” BVA said of its latest soundings. “But this month many spoke of the SNCF reform fuelling fears that public services will be dismantled or social rights eroded.”\nMacron reiterated his “determination” to pursue the railway reform during a cabinet meeting, a government spokesman said.
