The president has said that he is in favor of raising the federal minimum age to buy guns to 21 from 18 — a policy staunchly opposed by the National Rifle Association. Trump has also said that he supports stronger background checks which would focus more on mental health.\nRead Walmart's full statement below:\nIn light of recent events, we've taken an opportunity to review our policy on firearm sales. Going forward, we are raising the age restriction for purchase of firearms and ammunition to 21 years of age. We will update our processes as quickly as possible to implement this change.\nIn 2015, Walmart ended sales of modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15. We also do not sell handguns, except in Alaska where we feel we should continue to offer them to our customers. Additionally, we do not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories. We have a process to monitor our eCommerce marketplace and ensure our policies are applied.\nWe take seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms and go beyond Federal law by requiring customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm. The law would allow the sale of a firearm if no response to a background check request has been received within three business days, but our policy prohibits the sale until an approval is given.\nWe are also removing items from our website resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys. Our heritage as a company has always been in serving sportsmen and hunters, and we will continue to do so in a responsible way.\n— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. \nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that Walmart will remove items resembling assault-style rifles from its website. An earlier version mischaracterized what kind of items would be removed. \nWATCH: Dick's CEO says it's time to do something about gun violence show chapters Dick's CEO: It's time to do something about gun violence      20 Hours Ago | 02:58", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T02:23:46.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
