Related Coverage Liverpool are back where they belong says Klopp In a predictably low-key game, Liverpool striker Sadio Mane, whose hat-trick in Porto helped ensure there was little at stake at Anfield, came closest to breaking the deadlock. Mane was off target with an effort at full-stretch from a Joe Gomez cross in the 18th minute and then hit the post in the 31st minute after taking down a ball from James Milner and releasing a low diagonal drive. While the night lacked drama, the passion was brought by Porto’s supporters who, despite the heavy loss from two weeks ago, travelled to Merseyside to fill the away section and sang their hearts out all night.

Substitute Danny Ings then forced a fine save out of Porto’s veteran Spanish keeper Iker Casillas with a looping header in the final stages.

The keeper was given an impressive round of applause from Liverpool’s fans as he took his place in front of the Kop for the second half. “We are through to the next round which is the most important thing - obviously we wanted to win - but we have to give credit to Porto because they played well,” said Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson. “This is the business end of the season. The next few months are very important for the team. We need to put performances in like we have been and the results will follow,” he added.
