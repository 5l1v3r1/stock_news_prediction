Brent, the global benchmark, lost $1.66, or 2.5%, to $64.13 a barrel.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that the amount of crude in storage rose by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended March 2, compared with average analyst forecasts for a 2.3 million barrel build.\nAn oil rig off the Pacific Ocean coastline in California.

Analysts said a stronger U.S. dollar helped pull down oil prices on Wednesday, with the WSJ Dollar Index up 0.14% at 83.58.\nAdditionally, U.S. stocks slid on investor concerns over the impact of steel and aluminum tariffs on the economy, particularly following White House economic adviser Gary Cohn’s departure.\nGasoline futures fell 1.5% to $1.9046 a gallon and diesel futures fell 1.9% to $1.8673 a gallon.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThe International Energy Agency lifted its forecasts for U.S. oil production Monday.
