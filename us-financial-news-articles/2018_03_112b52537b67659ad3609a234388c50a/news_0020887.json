The manufacturing PMI survey showed activity rose in February at its slowest pace since mid-2016.\nReporting by Polina Nikolskaya; editing by Andrey Ostroukh, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:22:26.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
