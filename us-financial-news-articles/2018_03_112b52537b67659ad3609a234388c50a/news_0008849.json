Mandatory Credit: Eric Bolte-USA TODAY Sports Wie’s seventh birdie of the day completed a bogey-free round of 65 to finish on 17-under 271 for the tournament, a stroke ahead of American compatriots Danielle Kang and Nelly Korda, South Korea’s Jenny Shin and Canada’s Brooke Henderson. The victory is Wie’s first since she claimed the 2014 U.S. Open title, the American pumping her fist and galloping towards the green as her long-range putt dropped into the middle of the cup.
