This is a train wreck.\n“This was pre-planned cheating. It may have been implemented by a junior player in Cameron Bancroft but it came with the backing and knowledge of ‘the leadership group’, a core of senior guys in the Australian set-up.”\nDISTANCING THEMSELVES The identity of the leadership group that Smith admitted was responsible for Bancroft attempting to scuff up one side of the ball with a piece of tape was the subject of some conjecture, with Warner the only name definitely in the frame.\nFILE PHOTO: Cricket - South Africa vs Australia - Third Test - Newlands, Cape Town, South Africa - March 25, 2018 Australia's Steve Smith before the start of play. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Files Several of the Australian correspondents in Cape Town report that some of the other supposed members of the group, pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, have moved swiftly to distance themselves from the incident.\nWarner’s chequered past and predilection for aggressive “sledging” had always made it highly unlikely that he would be promoted to the top job but his slim hopes of a promotion have surely been extinguished by his part in the scandal.\nDarren Lehmann will also have questions to answer after clearly trying to cover up the incident once he realised the TV pictures had exposed Bancroft’s cheating, even if Smith insisted the coach had not been part of the conspiracy.\nCricket Australia, coming off a highly damaging labour dispute last year, have also come under fire for the temerity of their initial response.\n“Frankly, we believe that Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft should have been on the first plane home yesterday,” Australian Sports Commission chairman John Wylie told ABC Radio on Monday.\n“If an athlete had been representing Australia in an Olympic Games and they had brought the country and the team into disrepute, that’s what would have happened to them.”\nIn the immediate future, wicketkeeper Tim Paine will almost certainly captain the side for this week’s final test in Johannesburg as he did on the final day of the defeat at Newlands which left Australia 2-1 down in the series.\nThe tourists could still draw the four-match series with a victory at the Wanderers but given the damage the ball-tampering has done to the name of Australian sport, it looks like very few back home will care.\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T07:18:07.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
