The Nuggets got to within 108-101 with 5:39 to play but then missed nine of their next 10 shots as the Mavericks did all they needed to do to win.\nDallas ended a three-game losing streak and won for just the third time in its past 10 games. The Mavericks have dropped 21 of the 28 games they’ve played since the calendar turned to 2018.\nThe Nuggets had a two-game winning streak snapped and lost for just the third time in their past 10 contests.\nDennis Smith Jr. added 18 points and 11 assists for Dallas, which also got 17 points from Dirk Nowitzki, 15 each from Doug McDermott and Harrison Barnes, 14 points from Dwight Powell, and 15 rebounds from Nerlens Noel in the victory.\nWilson Chandler led Denver with 21 points while Will Barton added 16 points, Paul Millsap hit for 12, Gary Harris poured in 11, and Malik Beasley, Trey Lyles and Mason Plumlee scored 10 each.\nDenver led 62-58 at halftime on the strength of a 54.8 percent-39.2 percent shooting edge from the floor and 16 points from Chandler, who made 5 of his 6 shots in the half including a pair of 3-pointers.\nPowell led the Mavericks with 12 points and Nowitzki added 11 points, with Noel grabbing 7 rebounds to keep Dallas within arm’s length.\nThe Nuggets led 75-71 near the midway point of the third quarter before Dallas took charge of the game with a 14-3 run that included seven points from Smith Jr. and six from Ferrell. McDermott’s jumper with 24 second to play granted the Mavericks a 96-83 lead heading into the final period.\nThe Nuggets head home to host Cleveland on Wednesday. Dallas doesn’t return to the court until Saturday, when it hosts Memphis in the first game of a home back-to-back that concludes with Houston on Sunday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:44:18.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
