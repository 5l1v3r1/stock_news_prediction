In addition to executing these strategic initiatives, I am delighted to report that performance of our core Modular – US and Modular – Other North America segments met our high expectations, delivering Adjusted EBITDA in line with our prior guidance of $122 million for the year, and with year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter accelerating from third quarter levels. The momentum is driven by the continued adoption of ‘Ready to Work’ solutions by our customers and the scalability of our operating platform to grow units on rent across both of our modular operations. Consolidated total revenues of $120.4 million in the fourth quarter were up 16.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by our U.S. leasing operations. In our Modular - US segment, modular space units on rent were up 6.0% and average monthly rate was up 10.2% in the fourth quarter year-over-year, evidencing the success our value proposition and growth initiatives have in the market.”\nSoultz continued, “We are accelerating robust organic growth with the acquisitions of Acton Mobile and Tyson Onsite. These strategic assets build seamlessly upon our existing platform, further differentiate Williams Scotsman with our customers, and expand our distribution of value added products and services. Looking ahead, our end markets are strong, we remain excited about the momentum in our U.S. business, and look to build upon this momentum in 2018.”\n2018 Outlook\nTimothy Boswell, Chief Financial Officer of Williams Scotsman commented, “We are exiting the fourth quarter of 2017 with momentum in our core operational metrics, and we expect to deliver a strong year of organic growth in 2018, which will be supplemented by our two recent acquisitions.” The company’s outlook for the full year 2018, inclusive of the Acton and Tyson acquisitions, appears below. This guidance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the “Forward-Looking Statements” below:\nTotal revenue between $560 million and $600 million\nAdjusted EBITDA between $165 million and $175 million\nNet rental capital expenditures after gross rental unit sales between $70 million and $100 million\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Conference Call Update\nHaving confirmed selected 2017 operational results, Williams Scotsman announced that it will reschedule the release of its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results, previously scheduled for today, March 5, 2018 for Friday March 16, 2018. The postponement is to allow the Company and its independent accountants more time to finalize their review of certain tax items stemming from the reverse acquisition of Double Eagle Acquisition Corp. by Williams Scotsman International Inc. (“WSII”), WSII’s separation from its former parent company, Algeco Scotsman Global S.á r.l., WSII’s acquisition of Acton Mobile Resources Holdings LLC, as well as the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. All of these events occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with complex tax accounting implications that will not impact the Company’s revenue and operating income results.\nWilliams Scotsman intends to file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 on March 16, 2018 and will host its Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call on that date, concurrent with the 10-K filing and the finalization of its financial audit.\nDial-in information for the conference call will be provided through a subsequent press release.

The words “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “plans,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “shall,” and variations of these words and similar expressions identify , which are generally not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside our control, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ discussed in the . Although Williams Scotsman believes that these are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that any such forward-looking statement will materialize. Important factors that may affect actual results or outcomes include, among others, our ability to acquire and integrate new assets and operations; our ability to manage growth and execute our business plan; our estimates of the size of the markets for our products; the rate and degree of market acceptance of our products; the success of other competing modular space and portable storage solutions that exist or may become available; rising costs adversely affecting our profitability; potential litigation involving our company; general economic and market conditions impacting demand for our products and services; implementation of tax reform; our ability to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls; and such other risks and uncertainties described in the periodic reports we file Commission (“SEC”) from time to time (including our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 5, 2017), which are available through the SEC’s EDGAR system at www.sec.gov and on our website. Any forward-looking statement speaks only at the date which it is made, and Williams Scotsman disclaims any obligation to update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Williams Scotsman believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it (i) allows investors to compare performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance; (ii) is used by our board of directors and management to assess our performance; (iii) may, subject to the limitations described below, enable investors to compare the performance of Williams Scotsman to its competitors; and (iv) provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. A metric similar to Adjusted EBITDA is also used to evaluate Williams Scotsman’s ability to service its debt. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures differently, and therefore Williams Scotsman’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nAdditional information about Williams Scotsman can be found on the Williams Scotsman Investor Relations website at https://investors.willscot.com .\nContact Information\nInvestor Inquiries:\nMark Barbalato\ninvestors@willscot.com\nMedia Inquiries:\nScott Junk\nscott.junk@willscot.com\nSource:Williams Scotsman", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s7gpMP8wsLyYDEAfJXOaiYfR5vTLuy0Cp8IHTseFHUQrNCtbxe-gMBPS-q7v5rbMZnUtqSD1YFeaVf4IB5IaKthsN7ltZisnl-z_bU7DrbpIxYILMMM9FUd1rrjfKhKy", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4-DreVhLf5IM0jBYhiRBufR3HqHQ7dTDam4UQLMceUg5PqrllUv4lcE0nUzge2AcRwtmFrNgKAMSfJfdAusHXH3Hd9DaJM7BnBbPA5YlDUo=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cOgNwlay8vIkfoU2VqKs6i7iFr58YZyJxB_6pxyTZySGD3CEKDeEQhIN20-PKpKtwjAdcK9i9L4NLAlmLPYJf36guwlX1P2weAMR9iIFdtM=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=s7gpMP8wsLyYDEAfJXOaiYfR5vTLuy0Cp8IHTseFHUQv5WhdSguzGtff3HSRaUtm_WUfWMZa7E1Fod-sLYSwlL07aGepmvWyjG2hRyiSuJpgVYfdFAMVrmUop9hXbXR5", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aeed7f0c-90d3-4f93-b1fb-14d748f5eba5"], "published": "2018-03-05T15:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T14:41:27.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
