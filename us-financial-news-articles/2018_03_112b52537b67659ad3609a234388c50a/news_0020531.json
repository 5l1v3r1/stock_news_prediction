Creditors include foreign and local banks, bondholders and suppliers.\nPerusko said that, once settlement terms had been reached, creditors would vote on the deal before July 10, the legal deadline for avoiding bankruptcy. Two thirds of the creditors must support the deal to make it valid.\n“I’m sure we will reach a deal as it is in the best interest of the creditors. That’s the only way for them to retrieve part of the funds invested. Our challenge is to find a good balance between the creditors’ views, as some write-offs are unavoidable,” Perusko said.\nClaims against Agrokor total about 58 billion kuna ($9.68 billion), of which more than 26 billion kuna are disputed either by the crisis management or among the creditors themselves.\nThe biggest single creditor is Russia’s Sberbank whose claim of more than one billion euros ($1.24 billion) has been disputed by the previous crisis manager, who cited lawsuits filed by Sberbank outside Croatia to secure repayment.\n“We are in talks with Sberbank and our positions are getting closer. It is our aim to get them back into the process,” Perusko said.\nPerusko’s deputy Irena Weber said companies owned by Agrokor, including retail and food production firms, were operating well and in line with business plans, adding that this would support the firm in future after a settlement was reached.\nReporting by Igor Ilic Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:35:46.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
