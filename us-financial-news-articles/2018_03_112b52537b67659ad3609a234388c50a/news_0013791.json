House Bill 1510 will return to the House to reconcile differences between the two Republican-controlled chambers’ versions, Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves said in a statement.\n“Mississippians are committed to protecting the lives of unborn children, and this law will be a major step in accomplishing that goal,” he said.\nRepublican Governor Phil Bryant has vowed to approve the measure if lawmakers send it to his desk.\nLeslie McGorman, deputy policy director at Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group, said the measure targeted the state’s only abortion provider, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The clinic provides abortions up to 16 weeks after conception.\n“It really only makes sense in the state of Mississippi because of that provider. It has no real gestational significance,” she said by telephone.\nState Representative Becky Currie, who introduced the measure, did not respond to requests for comment. A similar measure banning abortion 15 weeks after conception also has been introduced in the Louisiana state Senate.\nMcGorman said abortion rights groups likely would mount a court challenge if the Mississippi measure became law, and anti-abortion organizations then could use the case to test the limits of abortion all the way to the Supreme Court.\nThe high court legalized abortion in its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. It has banned prohibiting abortion before the fetus is able to live outside the womb, usually seen at about 20 weeks of gestation.\nSeventeen states ban abortion at about 20 weeks after fertilization or its equivalent of 22 weeks after the woman’s last menstrual period, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which opposes abortion limits.\nThe Mississippi bill includes an exception in the case of severe fetal abnormality or a medical emergency.\nThe Guttmacher Institute has said that about 926,200 U.S. abortions were performed in 2014, down 12 percent from 2011.\nA 2017 Gallup poll showed that 49 percent of Americans say they support abortion and 46 percent oppose it.
