MBTs originate from the discovery by CohBar’s founders of a novel group of peptides within the mitochondrial genome which regulate metabolism and cell death, and whose biological activity declines with age. CohBar’s development of these mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) into clinically relevant MBTs offers the potential to address a broad range of age-related diseases, including obesity, fatty liver disease (NASH), type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the Company and its founders have discovered more than 100 biologically active MDPs.\nFor additional company information, please visit www.cohbar.com .\nInvestor and Media Contact:\nJeff Biunno, CFO\nCohBar, Inc.\n(650) 446-7888, Option 3\njeff.biunno@cohbar.com\nSource:CohBar, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LlK_JXygWE2kSZ8sOJRcoTX5EtcvTqL1gq-NygvyLRwJGqfRiLGhNJQt1IVvdpN_12HzT5FIzrpA8v79O0LM0w==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aQqDtJQCVrwft7xoB5fKWQMnB5YWHhw0qL_8yAF1-nE_hd3xpp49b9PwBh193uDLhfMtPTBmUsjmeGPIRWu9zN8d2cS0u46tHL1zEhncC14=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/17ec4007-256a-45a3-bb01-44b343442386", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LlK_JXygWE2kSZ8sOJRcoVJ9Uz8yyGMzlPrO1kVgGgsgWAaLd0KWpHLfQTADUq3kYJTH0OVYtsKovP_6jaB5OA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LlK_JXygWE2kSZ8sOJRcoSkbhiInO3ZVEBIAWTBJgbPdI0Z1jk3-kEcp9DXUeRwxevzLtP70lDxzIL2D5DjnYw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LlK_JXygWE2kSZ8sOJRcofwacS6SrPxUJ3BCryJeL2qGWsFcFQYaSRhI4ecaGQ4zFMHPvOQ09IKyfYmjCil1PA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=i4Wr2C3jjANMmbNDInrVquQrL3xp5LWfkjOKYBs0z659Iyg643ypHGXzdrut7Nk2cO6CiIJrDPTE-qJii0YLAg=="], "published": "2018-03-19T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T02:38:51.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
