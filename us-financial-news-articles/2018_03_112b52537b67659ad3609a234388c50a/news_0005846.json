They date to 3351 to 3017 BC, which is the Predynatic period before Egypt was unified by the first Pharaoh.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Researchers said the female tattoos may have denoted status, bravery or magical knowledge, while the male’s were likely symbols of virility and strength.\nPrior to the discovery, archaeologists believed tattooing in Egypt was only performed on women, as tattoos were only depicted on female figurines of the period.\nThe oldest surviving tattoos are geometric designs on a mummified corpse known as Otzi, who lived around 5,300 years ago and was discovered preserved in the Italian Alps in 1991.\nThe research, lead by Antoine and Oxford University’s Renee Friedman, was published in the Journal of Archaeological Science on March 1.\nReporting by David Doyle; Writing by Mark Hanrahan; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T23:16:53.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
