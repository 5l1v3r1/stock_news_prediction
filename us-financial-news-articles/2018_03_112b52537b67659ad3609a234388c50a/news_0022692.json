Rosen, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter from the lawyer for Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels. \nPreviously, the White House has denied any sexual relationship between Trump and Clifford and refused to answer questions about the nondisclosure agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T21:23:14.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
