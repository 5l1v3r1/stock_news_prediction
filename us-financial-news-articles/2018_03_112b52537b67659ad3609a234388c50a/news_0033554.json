They don’t say, however, that you must personally undertake all that tedious doing. I’d call myself handy, which is to say I can construct IKEA furniture, install a shelf and hang a painting. I once ambitiously swapped a shower head. But if a wall has to be opened up, I call the pros. So when I realized after a recent move that my shower’s water lines were installed backward on the knob—hot as it dribbled out and colder as the pressure increased—I signed up for three of the new-breed apps that make it easier to find fix-it men or women who will solve your problems at a fair price. Here, the respective pros and cons. \nFor Prompt Help I first browsed Homee , a new app focused on electrical, HVAC and plumbing tasks that promises assistance will arrive in about 30 minutes. With the handymen, whose backgrounds are checked, Homee lets you specify a range of experience (in years) before you search, and lets you pay by the minute, not the hour, with an in-app timer you control. It all seemed ideal, but Homee’s service is slowly rolling out and was as yet unavailable in my area. Still I persist. ( homeeonedemand.com ) \nFor Intense Response Hoping to be “the Uber of” handyman apps, Thumbtack locks in on your location, asks a detailed list of questions to help narrow down exactly what you need and matches you with those best equipped to do the job. Pick a skill level (or price) with which you’re comfortable and your savior can often assist you that day. However, Thumbtack left me confronting an onslaught of would-be aides, as if nine Uber cars showed up before I’d even confirmed a ride. Thirty minutes after I signed up, workers were emailing to offer me a “good deal” if I called them directly—not the model for me, but great if you see eagerness as a virtue. ( thumbtack.com ) \nFor the Most Options Next I opened TaskRabbit , selected “plumbing” from a drop-down menu and was then annoyingly forced to write a little essay detailing my issue—which didn’t seem to matter since I was given an immediate list of candidates. I soon found Joe Dzwill, a Bronx-based handyman who, judging from his photo, appeared to have as many tattoos as he did positive reviews. TaskRabbit displayed his skills, work history, rating, rate and schedule. I picked a time, we exchanged emails, and soon he was shaking my hand and fixing my shower. He was done in about 30 minutes (it was a simpler task than I imagined), but TaskRabbit charged me the full hour. Still, since I hadn’t washed up in three days it felt like a small price.
