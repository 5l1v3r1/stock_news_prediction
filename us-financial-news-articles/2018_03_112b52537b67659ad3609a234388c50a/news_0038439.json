HTLD 1.58% dismissed its auditing firm of 16 years, KPMG LLP, citing differences over internal communication and procedures after the firm’s acquisition last July of Interstate Distributor Co.\nThe apparent dust-up highlights a key issue facing a trucking market where mergers and acquisitions are heating up: the value truckers place on the equipment and the business they’re acquiring.\n“There has to be some consistency in the methodology of how you value things when you buy them,” said Mike Regan, chief of relationship development with logistics and freight management consultancy TranzAct Technologies Inc.\nIn the $113 million deal last July, Heartland acquired IDC’s fleet of 1,350 trucks. At the time, Heartland said in a statement the “purchase accounting remains ongoing” and that the value of IDC’s assets, including the trucks, “could be reduced versus the values previously recorded by IDC due to shorter useful lives.”\nAlso in Logistics\nKeepTruckin Raises $50 Million to Back Truck Technology Expansion March 20, 2018 Chinese Shipyards See Surge in Orders, Margins Remain Thin March 19, 2018 Knight-Swift Buys Trucker Abilene Motor Express March 16, 2018 In December 2017, KPMG said in a report that Heartland had kept “ineffective controls over the allocation of the purchase price for Interstate Distributor Co. to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,” according to a March 8 Heartland filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nHeartland said in the SEC filing that Grant Thornton LLP would become the company’s public accounting firm, replacing KPMG. Chris Strain, Heartland’s chief financial officer, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for KPMG didn’t return messages seeking comment.\nAs M&A heats up and far-flung truck fleets attempt to integrate their operations, auditors will be paying close attention to details like the valuation of equipment assets, analysts said.\nA series of recent acquisitions by Roadrunner Transportation Systems Inc. led to wide-ranging accounting problems. Roadrunner announced last year that it had to restate the last three years of earnings reports, and this week the company said it would be postponing its latest quarterly report, sending its stock price plummeting.\n“There’s heightened sensitivity among analysts because the Roadrunner fiasco kind of opened some eyes,” Mr. Regan said.\n‘ There has to be some consistency in the methodology of how you value things when you buy them. ’\n—Mike Regan, TranzAct Technologies. Since last July, the Interstate business has driven up Heartland’s operating expenses, tamping down its margins.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the firm’s operating income was down $11 million, to $9.9 million, from the same period a year earlier, despite an 18.3% improvement in revenue. Net profit nearly tripled to $38.6 million, including a $32.8 million gain from the new tax law.\nAsset sales appear to have helped keep Heartland’s finances on firm footing, according to Barclays Capital Inc. In a note to investors Tuesday,\nBarclays analysts said Heartland historically led the industry in profitability but its acquisitions of Gordon Trucking in 2013 and IDC last year have cut margins nearly in half, even “with a sizable contribution from gains on sales of equipment.” Strong consumer and industrial spending, as well as a rapidly-tightening supply of truck capacity, has driven up the value of those and other used trucks.\nWrite to Erica E.
