Investors largely expect the Fed to lift its benchmark overnight lending rate to a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday and also update its assessment of the economy. More importantly, traders will be closely eyeing the Fed's policy statement in search of clues over the pace of future rate hikes, following signs of Powell's growing confidence in the U.S. economic recovery. Higher U.S. rates could drive capital away from emerging markets, which offer high yields. \"There's still much doubt over how much the Fed will tighten in coming months after the latest economic indicators,\" Infinity Asset chief economist Jason Vieira said. The Brazilian real and the Mexican peso weakened between 0.3 and 0.4 percent, while the Colombian peso was flat. Brazilian stocks, however, fell 0.9 percent, as volatility spiked due to the expiration of several option contracts. Shares of miners and steelmakers, such as Vale SA and Usinas Sider√∫rgicas de Minas Gerais SA, tracked iron ore prices lower. Vale's share subtracted the most points from the benchmark index. Still, shares of Suzano Papel e Celulose SA jumped for a second day to an all-time high after it won the battle to acquire larger rival Fibria Celulose SA.
