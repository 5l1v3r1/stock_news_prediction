REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director and head of its health emergencies programmed, also said the United Nations agency hoped to deliver vital medical and surgical supplies soon to the rebel-controlled area of 400,000 people near Damascus.\nAfter the U.N. Security Council agreed on a 30-day cessation of hostilities, Russia proposed a five-hour daily pause which collapsed quickly on Tuesday. U.N. agencies are seeking a safe corridor for aid to enter and evacuees to leave.\n“What we’re calling for as WHO is at the very least an immediate approval from the Syrian government and all the warring parties for evacuation of the critically unwell, starting with the top 84 which have been listed by the NGOs, U.N. agencies and Red Cross as the most urgent,” Salama told Reuters in an interview at WHO headquarters in Geneva.\n“They include children, they include women, they include a range of conditions from people that have had direct trauma (injuries) related to the conflict in eastern Ghouta,” he said.\nPeter Salama, Executive Director of the Health Emergencies Programme at the World Health Organization (WHO), attends an interview with Reuters in Geneva, Switzerland March 2, 2018.
