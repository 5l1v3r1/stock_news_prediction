On the strength of Newcastle pricing, we secured positive Coal Valley EBITDA and cash flow for 2018 through locked-in offtake commitments and secured rail and port contracts for the large majority of our production this year.”\nGary Kohn, Chief Financial Officer, commenting on the capital structure activities noted, “While our efforts on both the MLP and San Juan debt continue, we are now diligently working on the next step in our capital structure improvement process: a holistic solution for all of Westmoreland. Accordingly, we have engaged advisers, Alvarez & Marsal and Centerview Partners, to assist us in the evaluation of all options available to us to improve our overall balance sheet health.”\nAbout Westmoreland Coal Company\nWestmoreland Coal Company is the oldest independent coal company in the United States.

Westmoreland has provided ranges for its expectations described above because its financial reporting closing procedures are not yet complete. While the Company expects its final financial results for full year ended December 31, 2017, following the completion of its financial closing procedures, will be within the ranges described above, actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of the completion of Westmoreland’s financial closing procedures as well as final adjustments and other developments that may arise between now and the time that its financial results for the full year are finalized. All of the data presented above has been prepared by and is the responsibility of management. This summary is not a comprehensive statement of Westmoreland’s financial results. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net income the effects of income tax expense and benefit; interest income and expense; depreciation, depletion and amortization; accretion of asset retirement obligations; amortization of intangible assets and liabilities; and certain other non-recurring or non-cash items including advisory fees paid to advisors related to the Company’s capital structure review; gains and losses on foreign exchange; losses on impairments; acquisition-related costs; customer payments received under loan and lease receivables; derivative gains and losses; gains and losses on the sale or disposal of assets and other adjustments; and share-based compensation. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by or used in operating activities less cash paid for property, plant and equipment, plus net customer payments received under loan and lease receivables. Reconciliations to 2017 GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities have not been provided because doing so would require an unreasonable effort due to the nature of providing a range of possible outcomes for such results, which inherently involves a level of variability and complexity for the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. Further, final GAAP figures are still under audit review and any changes arising from the audit could provide additional variability as to the final calculations of these items. When planning, forecasting and analyzing its business, for periods for which final results are unavailable, Westmoreland does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis as that would require estimates for reconciling items which are inherently difficult to predict with reasonable accuracy.\nFor further information please contact:\nGary Kohn, Chief Financial Officer\n1-720-354-4467\ngkohn@westmoreland.com\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements contained in this news release are based on Westmoreland’s current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions.
