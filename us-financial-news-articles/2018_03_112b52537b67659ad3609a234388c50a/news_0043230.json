ZDNet said it was withholding the name of the utility and other details.\nKaran Saini, a New Delhi-based security researcher, said that anyone with an Aadhaar number was affected.\n“This is a security lapse. You don’t have to be a consumer to access these details. You just need the Uniform Resource Locator where the Application Programming Interface is located. These can be found in less than 20 minutes,” Saini told Reuters.\nVikas Shukla, spokesman for the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which runs the Aadhaar programme, said the agency would issue a statement later on Saturday.\nAadhaar, a biometric identification card with over 1.1 billion users, is the world’s biggest database.\nBut it has been facing increased scrutiny over privacy concerns following several instances of breaches and misuse.\nLast Thursday, the CEO of the UIDAI said the biometric data attached to each Aadhaar was safe from hacking as the storage facility was not connected to the internet.\n“Each Aadhaar biometric is encrypted by a 2048-key combination and to decode it, the best and fastest computer of our era will take the age of the universe just to hack into one card’s biometric details,” Ajay Bhushan Pandey said.
