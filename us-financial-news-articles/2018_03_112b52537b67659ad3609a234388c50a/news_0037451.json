With earnings season drawing to a close, corporate news is thin on the ground but M&A news is still coming in: Hammerson has just announced it rejected an acquisition offer by Kl√©pierre which valued the UK real estate company's shares at a 40.7 percent premium to their closing price on Friday. (Helen Reid) MORNING CALL: CAUTION DOMINATES FIRST DAY OF BUSY WEEK Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. European stocks are called down this morning, following the lead of Asian markets which hit a speed-bump in the first trading day of a busy week. Britain prepares for a critical EU summit this week, and investors are also eyeing Jerome Powell's first press conference as Federal Reserve Chair and the central bank's decision on Wednesday. Asian shares were mixed as tension built ahead of this week's Fed meeting which will likely result in an interest rate hike. Spreadbetters call the DAX 17 points lower at 12,373, the CAC 40 down 17 points at 5,265, and the FTSE 100 16 points lower at 7,149.
