The Nikkei fell 1.6 percent as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell rattled global stock markets.\nJGBs showed no reaction to comments from Bank of Japan board member Goushi Kataoka calling for additional stimulus.\nKataoka is the only member who has consistently voted against BOJ Governor Kuroda in recent months and has been widely seen as an outlier.
