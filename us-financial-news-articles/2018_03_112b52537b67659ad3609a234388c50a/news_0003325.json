A company can transfer a certain amount of its shares to an intermediary, for example a bank, who then notifies the depositary bank abroad to issue depositary receipts for the stock on the local market.\nAllowing Xiaomi to sell CDRs could open the floodgates for more deals from so-called“red chips”, overseas-incorporated Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. China Mobile and others expressed interest in an A-share listing when Shanghai planned to launch an international board a decade ago.\nChina’s top legislative body could also decide to grant a one-off approval allowing Xiaomi to sell A-shares under its current structure.\n“To list at home, Xiaomi will need the blessings from all related regulators, and it’s challenging,” said one of the people.”\nXiaomi declined to comment.\nTECHNOLOGY CONTEST Xiaomi has picked CLSA, a subsidiary of China’s Citic Securities, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint sponsors for its proposed IPO, other people close to the deal told IFR earlier. It is widely expected to float in Hong Kong, but has yet to decide on the timing or venue.\nA high-profile mainland listing, even alongside an international offering, would be a landmark for China’s stock market at a time when global exchanges are vying to attract fast-growing technology issuers.\nChina has been stepping up its pursuit of major technology listings in recent months.\nFoxconn Industrial Internet, the mainland unit of Taiwan’s Foxconn, received unusually swift attention from the CSRC after applying for a Shanghai IPO on February 1 to fund investments totalling some Rmb27bn (US$4.3bn). Slightly over a week after the IPO application was filed, the regulator had responded with a long list of questions.\nThe CSRC has also given special treatment to another big tech company – Chinese security software maker Qihoo 360 Technology. The CSRC approved Qihoo’s relisting last month, clearing the way for the first backdoor listing of a formerly overseas-listed Chinese company since May 2016.\nThe company, which delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016, began trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange as 360 Security Technology on Wednesday.
