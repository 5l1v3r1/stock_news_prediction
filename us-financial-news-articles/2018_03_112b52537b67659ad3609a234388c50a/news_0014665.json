There was no immediate comment from Fernandez.\nThe petition included 18 top leaders of the communist party as central committee members, including founder Jose Maria Sison and peace negotiator Luis Jalandoni, both based in The Netherlands for three decades.\nSison was a mentor of Duterte when he was at university. They are now bitter rivals, with seemingly no limit on the ferocity of their rebukes of each other.\nMore than 40,000 people have been killed in the Maoist rebellion. Negotiations have been on and off since being brokered by Norway in 1986.\nFormer congressman Satur Ocampo, who has a pending criminal case for his involvement in the murder of suspected military spies in the communist movements in the 1980s, was also on the list.\nOcampo told Reuters he would challenge any “terrorist” label.\nEditing by Martin Petty, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T07:32:29.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
