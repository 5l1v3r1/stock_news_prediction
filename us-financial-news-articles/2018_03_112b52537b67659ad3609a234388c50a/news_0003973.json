The seasonally adjusted data showed gross domestic product grew by 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter compared to a revised 0.4 percent in July-to-September. The data also showed the economy expanded at an annual 1.9 percent clip in the fourth quarter, accelerating from a revised 1.4 percent growth rate in the previous quarter. Based on a first estimate of seasonally unadjusted data, full-year GDP growth last year came to 1.4 percent, ELSTAT said.
