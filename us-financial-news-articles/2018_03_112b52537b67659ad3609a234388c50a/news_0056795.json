A benchmark issue is usually around $500 million.\nCitigroup, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered are arranging the issue, which will likely have a five year duration, the source said.\nActivity in the Islamic bond market has been relatively brisk this month, with Dubai-based airline Emirates, Saudi Arabia’s Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co and the government of Sharjah all issuing sukuk. Most recently, Bahrain this week issued a $1 billion sukuk.\nSince chief executive John Iossifidis joined Noor in April last year, the bank has undertaken a turnaround plan, including moving away from unsecured lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and shifting the focus of its retail business more towards affluent consumer clients.\nThe government of Dubai, members of the emirate’s ruling family and a select group of United Arab Emirates nationals own 88.3 percent of the bank’s shares in aggregate, according to its website.
