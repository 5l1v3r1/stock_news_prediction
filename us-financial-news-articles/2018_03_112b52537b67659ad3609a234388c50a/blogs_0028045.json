Paper Excellence has offered cash to all shareholders, sources said. \nFibria shares rose nearly 4 percent in Monday trading, while Suzano shares fell about 5 percent the biggest gain and loss on the benchmark Bovespa stock index. \nRepresentatives of Fibria and Paper Excellence did not respond to requests for comment. Last week Paulo Rabello de Castro, chief executive officer of Brazilian development bank BNDES, confirmed the talks between Fibria and Suzano. \nBNDES and industrial conglomerate Votorantim Participações SA are controlling shareholders in Fibria. BNDES also has a stake in Suzano. The sources added that BNDES' support would be decisive in reaching a deal. \nBrazilian newspaper Valor Econômico first reported the Paper Excellence bid on Monday. \nPaper Excellence acquired Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA last year for $4.7 billion. Fibria and Eldorado both have operations in the city of Três Lagoas, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. \nThe investment banking unit of Banco BTG Pactual SA is advising Paper Excellence on the Fibria bid, according to sources. \nBTG Pactual did not respond to a request for comment. BNDES declined to comment. \n($1 = 3.26 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl Additional reporting by Gram Slattery and Tatiana Bautzer Editing by David Gregorio and Tom Brown)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T05:00:10.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
