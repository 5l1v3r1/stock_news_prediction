Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized Wednesday and outlined how the social media giant will boost measures to protect data . \nIn a tweet Thursday, Tim Berners-Lee, who created the World Wide Web, called the scandal a \"serious moment\" in the internet's future but struck a positive note. \nHe empathized with Zuckerberg, and said that he was likely feeling \"devastated.\" But there was a fix. TWEET \nBerners-Lee called for tighter controls over data use by companies. He said that a person's data should be theirs alone \"to control.\" \nThe computer scientist struck a positive tone and urged internet users to talk to government representatives and tell them that data matters.
