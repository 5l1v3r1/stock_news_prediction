Proponents led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe say the project will spark badly needed economic growth.\nThe case has raised concerns that bid-rigging is still a problem in the construction industry despite legislation introduced in recent years to stamp it out.\nReporting by Takahiko Wada; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:07:36.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
