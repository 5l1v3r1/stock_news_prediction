You've got to bring in much bigger guns.\"\nFacebook's stock fell for the third straight day Wednesday as the fallout from the data breach scandal continues.\nFabrizio Bensch | Reuters A man walks in front of the Facebook logo at the Facebook Innovation Hub. On Tuesday, a report said the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the use of personal data from Facebook users by Cambridge Analytica violated a consent decree the tech company signed with the agency. Additionally, Zuckerberg was summoned by British lawmakers to give evidence related to the company's links to Cambridge Analytica.\n\"Zuck is no longer enough,\" Cramer said on \"Squawk on the Street.\" The longer Facebook waits, it could end up being like Wells Fargo's scandal or Equifax, he argued.\nZuckerberg plans to make a statement on the data fiasco in the next 24 hours. Axios, which first reported the news, said Zuckerberg wanted to say something meaningful rather than pushing out a comment quickly.\nFacebook did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
