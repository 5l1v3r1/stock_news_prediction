That confirmed Xi's status as China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong died more than 40 years ago.\nAmong other proposed changes in the biggest ministry shake-up in years, China said it will merge its banking and insurance regulators, and create new bureaus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T03:36:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
