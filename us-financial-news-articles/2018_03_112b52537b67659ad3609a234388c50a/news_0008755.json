It gives a range of 7 percent decline to 9 percent growth (for the games unit),\" said SEB Equities analyst Mathias Lundberg, who has a \"hold\" rating on the stock.\nInvestors expect management to explain reasons behind the profit warning in a news conference starting 1200 GMT.\n($1 = 0.8118 euros) (Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell Editing by Simon Johnson and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T08:12:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
