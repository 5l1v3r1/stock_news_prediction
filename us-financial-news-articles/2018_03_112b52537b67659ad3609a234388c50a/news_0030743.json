Soccer Football - Serie A - Inter Milan v Napoli - San Siro, Milan, Italy - March 11, 2018 Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi reacts REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini Icardi’s haul included a 14-minute first half hat-trick as he took his tally for the season to 22 and gave Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli a timely reminder of his scoring prowess. Ivan Perisic opened the scoring with a looping header in the 26th minute before Icardi, playing against his former club, did the rest. FILE PHOTO: Football Soccer - Argentina vs Brazil - International Friendly - Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne, Australia, June 9, 2017. Argentina's coach Jorge Sampaoli. REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo He converted a penalty on the half hour for his 100th Serie A goal, then scored with a back-heel after Perisic’s cross was deflected into his path and completed his sixth Serie A hat-trick from close range in the 44th minute. Sampdoria gifted the fifth as Edgar Barreto, in no danger, sliced an attempted clearance high into the air, the home defence hesitated and Icardi volleyed his effort into the ground but the ball bounced up and looped into the net. Inter moved into fourth place with 55 points, two ahead of Lazio who were at home to Bologna in a later game. Icardi played for Argentina in their World Cup qualifiers last September and October but was overlooked for this month’s friendlies against Spain and Italy.
