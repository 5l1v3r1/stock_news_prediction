FILE PHOTO - Rugby Union - England Training - St Edward's School, Oxford, Britain - February 28, 2018 England's Dylan Hartley during training Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra Hartley is struggling with muscle tightness in his leg, Nowell rolled his ankle in training and Underhill has a toe problem. “Dylan trained yesterday (Monday) and felt a bit of tightness afterwards. He reported that and the decision of the medical team is to monitor it daily,” Borthwick said. “I think we’ve got some great options.” Hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie has been called into the squad along with prop Kyle Sinckler as cover for Harry Williams who is also experiencing muscle tightness. Nowell is also likely to miss England’s final game against Ireland on March 17 but Underhill could be fit for that match. England are looking to get their title defence back on track following the shock defeat by Scotland which ended their hopes of securing a second grand slam in three years.
