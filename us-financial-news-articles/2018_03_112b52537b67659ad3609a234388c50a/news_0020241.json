After markets closed, White House Director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs banker and free trade advocate, said he planned to resign as Trump showed no sign of backing away from imposing new tariffs of steel and aluminum imports. Mexico's peso currency fell more than 0.5 percent after news of Cohn's resignation was reported. The peso has swung wildly over the past year on concerns that Trump could rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Carlos Vejar, a trade expert who was head counsel negotiator for Mexico on the original Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, said Cohn's departure removed a moderating influence on protectionist tendencies inside the White House. \"However, the main concern for Mexico is NAFTA, not the steel tariffs,\" he said. Going forward, the main question occupying Mexico would be who replaces Cohn inside the Trump administration, Vejar added. Earlier in the day, most Latin American markets rose as Trump's plan to slap tariffs on the metal imports faced stiff opposition from U.S. lawmakers. The surprise tariff announcement coincided with the latest round of talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and Mexico's top trade official on Tuesday rejected making a bilateral trade treaty with the United States if the three-way talks collapse. In Ecuador, President Lenin Moreno named a new finance minister following the unexpected resignation of his top finance official, as his government prepared to announce a plan to revive its sluggish economy.
