The EU will react firmly and commensurately to defend our interests.”\nJuncker said that the Commission would put forward a proposal for WTO-compatible countermeasures against the United States in the next few days to rebalance the situation.\nEuropean steelmakers association Eurofer said a global tariff of 25 percent on steel imports meant the United States had chosen trade confrontation, rather than a quota that could have allowed allies to maintain their U.S. presence.\n“From one day to the next, EU steel exports to the U.S. - which were at 5 million tonnes in 2017 - will be cut drastically by an estimated 50 percent or more,” Eurofer Director Genereal Axel Eggert said in a statement.\nHe said he welcomed the Commission’s announcement of appropriate and swift measures.\n“The EU must not allow that the moderate recovery in our industry over the last year is now being destroyed by the EU’s most important political ally,” Eggert said.\nReporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar and Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Peter Graff and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T06:57:10.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
