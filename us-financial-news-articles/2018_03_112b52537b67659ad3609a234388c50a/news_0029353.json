BlackBerry Chen’s base salary, short-term cash incentive and benefits will remain unchanged, and that the extension was weighted toward long-term performance-based equity and cash awards in addition to a time-based equity award. For all the performance-based awards to vest, BlackBerry’s market capitalisation would have to rise about 134 percent from the current value, to roughly $16.1 billion, the company said.
