Daniel Ek, Spotify’s co-founder and CEO, will be eligible to sell 15.8 million shares—less than a third of the total amount he owns.\nSpotify also came to agreements with some of its shareholders that they would only sell up to a certain amount of their holdings on the first day, according to a person familiar with the process. It is unclear when they will eligible to sell the rest.\nThe move appears to be a way to impose some limits on what is a largely untested way for a company to go public. That route, known as a direct listing, allows the company’s existing shares to begin trading openly on an exchange, creating a liquid market for them. Unlike a typical IPO, this route largely eschews underwriting banks and won’t raise any additional money for the company. That means the market will set the initial price for shares rather than a bank.\nWithout a bank to backstop and stabilize Spotify’s trading on the first day, limiting the available supply of stock could be seen as a move to curb potential downward volatility for a stock that is expected to see healthy demand.\nSpotify’s listing will likely be coveted by investors who are seeking the high growth that often comes with big-name, highly valued technology IPOs. Those have been rare of late.\nTypically in an IPO, early investors and employees are restricted from selling shares for six months after the initial offering. Spotify in its investor day last week said one of the reasons it chose to pursue this type as listing was so eligible employees could sell immediately.\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T02:57:58.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
