Whenever a new asset is listed, it will be automatically added to the fund.\n“We’re seeing strong demand from our customers and the market generally for a passive investment management product,” Bramanathan said.\nHe said the investment product has long been in the company’s roadmap, “but we’re finally seeing demand so that’s why we’re just launching now.”\nFor now, the fund will only be available to U.S.-resident accredited investors. Bramanathan said Coinbase is working on launching more funds that are accessible to investors and cover a broader range of digital assets.\nThe new fund will track the Coinbase Index to be launched as well, which is a benchmark of the performance of all assets listed on Coinbase. Digital currencies listed on Coinbase are bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and litecoin.\nEvery time a new asset is listed, the index will automatically be rebalanced to include it, Bramanathan said.\nThe cryptocurrency boom has seen a plethora of digital currency hedge funds and index funds launched in the market.\nAccording to data from Autonomous NEXT, there are now 225 crypto funds across seven strategy types, with assets in the space estimated at $3.5 billion to $5 billion.\nThe diversification of strategies reflected a market that combined cryptocurrencies with software, putting hedge fund managers and venture investors into the same exchange, Autonomous NEXT said.\nCoinbase’s Bramanathan said most of those funds are actively managed funds, and there is a big gap or demand for index funds that enable investors to track the performance of an entire asset class, rather than trying to pick winners.\nEarlier reports said Coinbase told shareholders it posted revenue of $1 billion in 2017, bolstered by a frenzy of applications and trading as the price of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies surged in the last two months of the year.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T01:14:35.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
