Amazon Web Services still leads, generating more than $5 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, and Microsoft pulled in more than $5 billion in revenue, though that category includes the Azure public cloud as well as services like Dynamics 365 and Office 365 business subscriptions. \nThe Spotify relationship is big for Google Cloud, but Snap is bigger. \nLast year Snap said it would spend $2 billion over five years on Google public cloud services, or about $400 million per year. In other words, Snap is contributing as much as 10 percent of the $1 billion or more that Google is getting on a quarterly basis. \nUsing the current exchange rate, Spotify will be paying Google around $149 million per year, or $37.25 million per quarter. That works out to about 3.7 percent of Google's quarterly cloud revenue figure. \nBefore adopting Google cloud, Spotify was a prominent AWS customer. A Spotify case study is still listed on the AWS website.
