Their employers add a further 10 percent.\nThe NSSF is one of the major investors in Uganda’s financial markets.\nSome officials had argued private funds were likely to be more aggressive in mobilising contributions, potentially growing the pool of savings and long-term capital in the country’s financial system.\nThe government operates a separate pensions scheme for public workers, whose benefits are entirely funded by the state.\n$1 = 3,650.0000 Ugandan shillings Editing by Duncan Miriri and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:22:46.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
