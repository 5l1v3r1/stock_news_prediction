People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy! [0755 EST]\n- Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made! [0800 EST]\n- We are getting it done - jobs and security! bit.ly/2FWtQ2Z [0802 EST]\n- We will see what happens! bit.ly/2I9uriv [0805 EST]\n- Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)! [0825 EST]\n- Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that “President Trump has the right to end DACA.” President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem, and didn’t.
