Culberson was sacrificed to second by Ender Inciarte. After Ozzie Albies popped out and Freddie Freeman was intentionally walked, Markakis (7-for-14 in his career against Neris entering the game) delivered the winning blast to right to end the game.\nThe winning pitcher was Arodys Vizcaino (1-0), who struck out the side in the top of the ninth.\nNeither starting pitcher figured in the decision.\nAaron Nola, at 24 years and 298 days, became Philadelphia’s youngest Opening Day starter since Dennis Bennett (24 years, 192 days) in 1964. Nola pitched 5 1/3 innings and got the hook after only 68 pitches. He allowed one run on three hits and one walk with three strikeouts.\nAtlanta’s Julio Teheran, who was making his fifth consecutive Opening Day start, was chased after 5 2/3 innings as he allowed four runs on four hits with three walks and three strikeouts.\nThe Phillies scored their first run in the opening inning. Left fielder Rhys Hoskins ripped a double to right field that scored first baseman Carlos Santana.\nPhiladelphia added four runs in the sixth inning. Second baseman Cesar Hernandez hit a solo homer to right-center field, just out of the reach of a leaping Markakis. After a hit batsman and a walk, Teheran was lifted for left-hander Rex Brothers, who walked back-to-back batters, scoring one run. He was relieved by A.J. Minter, who allowed a two-run single by catcher Andrew Knapp.\nAtlanta scored a pair of runs in the bottom of the sixth when first baseman Freddie Freeman greeted southpaw reliever Hoby Milner with a two-run shot.\nAlbies led off the eighth inning with a solo homer to start a three-run rally. The Braves tied the game with a passed ball and an RBI single from Preston Tucker.\nThe Braves lost starting catcher Tyler Flowers in the second inning with an oblique injury. Flowers swung and missed at a Nola offering and immediately grabbed his left side. Flowers went to the clubhouse and was replaced by Kurt Suzuki, the other half of Atlanta’s catching platoon.\nAtlanta manager Brian Snitker was ejected in the top of the ninth for arguing a checked swing by Hernandez, who would eventually strike out.\nThe three-game series continues on Friday, with Atlanta sending right-hander Mike Foltynewicz (10-13, 4.79 in 2017) against Philadelphia right-hander Nick Pivetta (8-10, 6.02 in 2017).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:50:27.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
