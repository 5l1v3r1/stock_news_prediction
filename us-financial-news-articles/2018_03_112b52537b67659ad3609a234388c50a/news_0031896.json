(NASDAQ:ZUMZ) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended February 3, 2018.\nTotal net sales for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018 (14 weeks) increased 16.9% to $308.2 million from $263.6 million in the quarter ended January 28, 2017 (13 weeks). Comparable sales for the 14-week period ended February 3, 2018 increased 7.5% compared to the same fourteen-week period ended February 4, 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $19.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to net income of $18.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results include $3.8 million in net sales related to the recognition of deferred revenue due to changes in our STASH loyalty program estimated redemption rate and $3.4 million of charges in our provision for income taxes due to a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in Europe, partially offset by a $0.5 million benefit related to U.S. federal tax legislation. The combined impact of these items reduced net income and earnings per share by $0.5 million and $0.02 respectively.\nTotal net sales for fiscal 2017 (53 weeks) increased 10.9% to $927.4 million from $836.3 million in fiscal 2016 (52 weeks). Comparable sales for the fifty-three-week period ended February 3, 2018 increased 5.9% compared to the same fifty-three-week period ended February 4, 2017. Net income in fiscal 2017 increased to $26.8 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to net income in the prior fiscal year of $25.9 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. Fiscal 2017 was also impacted by the deferred revenue and tax items referred to above in our fourth quarter results. The combined impact of these items reduced net income and earnings per share by $0.5 million and $0.02 respectively for fiscal 2017. At February 3, 2018, the Company had cash and current marketable securities of $121.9 million, an increase of 54.7% compared to cash and current marketable securities of $78.8 million at January 28, 2017. The increase in cash and current marketable securities was driven by cash generated through operations partially offset by capital expenditures.\nRick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer of Zumiez Inc., stated, \"We concluded 2017 with strong fourth quarter comparable sales performance which came on top of a successful holiday selling period in the prior year fourth quarter. The top-line momentum exhibited by our business underscores the benefits of our differentiated merchandising strategies, integrated sales channels, and best in class customer service. While we are pleased with our recent top-line results, we believe the company is positioned to deliver accelerated earnings growth in 2018 through a combination of positive comparable sales, margin enhancement programs, improved expense leverage, and lower taxes. I am optimistic about Zumiez future prospects and I’m confident that our approach to expanding market share will lead to increased value for our shareholders over the long-term.”\nFebruary 2018 Sales\nTotal net sales for the four-week period ended March 3, 2018 increased 23.2% to $63.4 million, compared to $51.5 million for the four-week period ended February 25, 2017.
