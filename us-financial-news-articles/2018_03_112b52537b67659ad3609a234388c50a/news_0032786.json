Then a senator from Alabama, Sessions chaired the meeting as head of the Trump campaign's foreign policy team. \n\"Yes, I pushed back,\" Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee on Nov. 14, when asked whether he shut down Papadopoulos' proposed outreach to Russia. Sessions has since also been interviewed by Mueller. \nThree people who attended the March campaign meeting told Reuters they gave their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although the accounts they provided to Reuters differed in certain respects, all threes, who declined to be identified, said Sessions had expressed no objections to Papadopoulos' idea. \nHowever, another meeting attendee, J.D. Gordon, who was the Trump campaign's director of national security, told media outlets including Reuters in November that Sessions strongly opposed Papadopoulos' proposal and said no one should speak of it again. In response to a request for comment, Gordon said on Saturday that he stood by his statement. \nSessions, through Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, declined to comment beyond his prior testimony. The special counsel's office also declined to comment. Spokeswomen for the Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee did not immediately comment. \nReuters was unable to determine whether Mueller is probing discrepancies in accounts of the March 2016 meeting. \nThe three accounts, which have not been reported, raise new questions about Sessions' testimony regarding contacts with Russia during the campaign. \nSessions previously failed to disclose to Congress meetings he had with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and testified in October that he was not aware of any campaign representatives communicating with Russians. \nSome Democrats have seized on discrepancies in Sessions' testimony to suggest the attorney general may have committed perjury. A criminal charge would require showing Sessions intended to deceive. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he had always told the truth and testified to the best of his recollection. \nLegal experts expressed mixed views about the significance of the contradictions cited by the three sources. \nSessions could argue he misremembered events or perceived his response in a different way, making any contradictions unintentional, some experts said. \nJonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said Sessions' words might be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what the term pushing back means. \n\"If you're talking about false statements, prosecutors look for something that is concrete and clear,\" he said. \nOther legal experts said, however, that repeated misstatements by Sessions could enable prosecutors to build a perjury case against him. \n\"Proving there was intent to lie is a heavy burden for the prosecution. But now you have multiple places where Sessions has arguably made false statements,\" said Bennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor. \nThe March 2016 campaign meeting in Washington was memorialized in a photo Trump posted on Instagram of roughly a dozen men sitting around a table, including Trump, Sessions and Papadopoulos. \nPapadopoulos, who pleaded guilty in October to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his Russia contacts, is now cooperating with Mueller. \nAccording to court documents released after his guilty plea, Papadopoulos said at the campaign meeting that he had connections who could help arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nPapadopoulos continued to pursue Russian contacts after the March 2016 meeting and communicated with some campaign officials about his efforts, according to the court documents. \nTrump has said that he does not remember much of what happened at the \"very unimportant\" campaign meeting. Trump has said he did not meet Putin before becoming president. \nMoscow has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T17:29:06.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
