And it could have an easier time buying U.S. targets if it goes through with plans to redomicilie in the United States.\nTan has already turned Avago, a small chipmaker with a market value of $3.5 billion in 2009, into a more than $100 billion company.\n\"He looks for value. Hes of the view that there is a lot of value to be extracted from this industry,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. \"He buys franchises, things that he believes have competitive modes, long visibility on revenues, opportunities for operational improvements.\"\nTan bought California-based companies Broadcom for $37 billion in a leveraged deal in 2015 and Brocade Communications in a $5.5 billion deal two years later.\nMost analysts assume Broadcom will now walk away from Qualcomm, with some flagging San Jose-based Xilinx Inc and Israel's Mellanox Technologies Ltd, both diversified makers of communications chips, as likely next targets.\nBroadcom could not be immediately reached for comment.\nShares of Broadcom were last up 1.4 percent in midday trading. Qualcomm shares fell 4.3 percent.\nTwo analysts said Xilinx and Mellanox would be a good fit for Broadcom, though not as transformational as Qualcomm.\nSan Diego-based Qualcomm evolved from a U.S. military aerospace contractor to become the dominant player in wireless radio technology over the past two decades, with its chips used in half of all smartphones.\nIt fended off antitrust concerns around the globe over its intellectual property strategies, taking the biggest share of wireless royalties in the 3G and 4G eras and getting a head start on next decades 5G era, which promises to embed wireless connections in cars, factories, homes and cities.\nQualcomms dominance of baseband chips that connect phones to networks would have represented the crown jewel in Broadcoms portfolio of communications chips that supply wi-fi, graphics, video and networking features alongside baseband chips.\nXilinx makes chips for wireless communication and Mellanox's products connect servers and storage systems.\nBroadcom has ample firepower for smaller deals, with about $11 billion in cash and the potential to generate nearly $9 billion in annual free cash flow, analysts estimate. Xilinx has a market value of $20 billion and Mellanox is just under $4 billion.\nMellanox was not immediately available for comment. Xilinx declined to comment.\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which raised concerns about the Qualcomm deal with Trump, listed the highly leveraged nature of Broadcom's bid for its larger rival as a major concern coupled with the risk of the U.S. losing mobile technology leadership.\nBefore Trump's order, Broadcom had planned to relocate its legal headquarters to the United States, avoiding the need for a CFIUS review.\n\"If Broadcom completes its redomiciling in the U.S. in a way that extinguishes any non-U.S. ownership or control, then I think they can open the door to many, if not all, acquisitions ... they would effectively no longer be subject to a CFIUS-initiated review or investigation,\" said Guillermo Christensen, a lawyer who works on CFIUS issues at Brown Rudnick in Washington.\n\"But that really hinges on completely severing the foreign ownership connection, and they would probably have to endure a pretty deep dive on the first deal.\"\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru, Chris Sanders in Washington; Editing by Bill Rigby and Meredith Mazzilli)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T03:11:18.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
