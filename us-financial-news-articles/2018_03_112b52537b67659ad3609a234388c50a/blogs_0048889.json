However, the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,\" Wayfair's head of public relations, Jane Carpenter, told CNBC. \n\"We do not plan to continue advertising on this particular program,\" Carpenter said. \nThe other companies listed in Hogg's tweet did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. \nHogg thanked TripAdvisor in a tweet shortly following Ingraham's apology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T20:07:08.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
