The existing rate of 18.75 percent was set during the administration of former President George W. Bush.\nThe panel, which is made up of department and state officials, tribal representatives, and energy companies, also voted to increase the amount of acreage available for offshore oil and natural gas leasing in the outer continental shelf.\nThe Houston meeting was aimed at updating around a dozen federal royalty rules, which guide energy and mineral production in the United States.\nThe committee was formed last year to advise Zinke on whether the government was getting a fair price from resources companies for their use of public land. He will take its recommendations into account.\nThe panel also voted to approve a proposal letting coal companies that mine on federal land set their own rates for coal used to calculate royalties.\nZinke last year halted an Obama-era rule that had required coal companies to pay royalties on sales to their first unaffiliated customer. The rule, which had been intended to close a loophole that had let companies sell coal to its own subsidiaries at deflated prices, was criticized by Zinke as confusing.\nRandall Luthi, president of offshore energy lobby group the National Ocean Industries Association, said at the meeting that existing production offshore was “declining and at a very quick rate” and that lowering royalty rates should spur new activity.\nPam Eaton, an advisor to conservation group Wilderness Society, attended the meeting as an observer.\nShe said in comments after formal presentations that she wanted to remind the committee that its mission was “to ensure the public receives the full value of the natural resources produced from federal lands.”\nReporting By Valerie Volcovici, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:11:48.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
