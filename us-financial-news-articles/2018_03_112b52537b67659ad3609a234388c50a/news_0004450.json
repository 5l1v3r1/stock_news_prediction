REUTERS/Staff/Remote The spectre of a full-blown trade war has reared its head. U.S. President Donald Trump has mooted steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, declaring that“trade wars are good, and easy to win”. Market reaction has been swift, with heavy stock market falls, especially in steel producers’ shares - some names such as ArcelorMittal have tumbled as much as 5 percent. As for policy reactions, the European Union has pledged firm counter-measures, China urged Trump to show restraint, and Canada, the biggest supplier of steel and aluminium to the U.S., said it would retaliate if hit by duties. The sustained multi-year rebound in global trade has driven much of the upswing in equities. Trade is currently expanding at annualised rates of more than 4 percent, the strongest since 2011. Now with trade war possibly brewing, global stocks are on course for a hefty weekly loss of around 3 percent. Next week could bring more.

In fact before Friday’s trade tantrum, Italian shares had risen 2.5 percent year-to-date, bucking broader European equity losses. Still, with no clear winner expected and no immediate clarity on the new government’s make-up, next week may bring turbulence. Atop equity investors’ watch-list is media firm Mediaset, which will get a boost if its owner, right-wing leader Silvio Berlusconi, does well in the election. A good result for the 81-year-old ex-premier could give Mediaset more bargaining power in a long-standing pay-TV dispute with Vivendi. Financials, a proxy for political uncertainty given their big sovereign bond holdings, may also see volatility, especially smaller names such as Banco BPM or UBI Banca with little or no foreign exposure. State-run firms such as Eni and Leonardo will face worries over management if the anti-establishment 5 Star movement scores strongly in the election. Bond investors meanwhile appear sanguine - Italy’s 10-year yield touched a three-week low on Friday and the yield premium over German peers was the tightest in two weeks.

Neither is expected to change rates or alter their QE programmes, but that doesn’t diminish their importance. They are pumping more stimulus into the global system than anyone else, yet both are making noises about wanting to bring their extraordinary policy measures to an end. Trouble is, even though economic growth is strong, inflation continues to undershoot. Recent market turbulence, the strong euro and a dip in both headline and underlying inflation should ensure ECB officials hold off signalling the end of asset buys until the summer. The BOJ is juggling similar issues and the yen’s recent surge, especially, will be unnerving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T00:01:31.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
