(NASDAQ: GHDX) today reported financial results and business progress for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal revenue was $340.8 million in the full year 2017, compared with $327.9 million in 2016, an increase of 4 percent.\nU.S. product revenue was $287.4 million in the full year 2017, compared with $280.1 million in the full year 2016, an increase of 3 percent. U.S. invasive breast revenue from Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score ® tests was $259.7 million in the full year 2017, compared with $257.0 million in the full year 2016. U.S. prostate test revenue from Oncotype DX ® Genomic Prostate Score™ (GPS™) tests was $17.9 million in the full year 2017, compared with $10.8 million in the full year 2016, an increase of 66 percent.\nInternational revenue for the full year 2017 was $53.1 million compared with $46.8 million in 2016, an increase of 13 percent, and an increase of 15 percent on a non-GAAP constant currency basis.\nOperating loss improved to $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss was $3.9 million, or $0.11 per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $13.9 million, or $0.42 per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, the company recorded $0.4 million net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"In 2017, we delivered improved profitability, which included a $1.9 million profit in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarter of U.S. invasive breast cancer revenue and test growth in the year. As expected, we delivered a full-year profit on a non-GAAP basis, excluding transaction costs of $4.2 million from our collaborations with Biocartis and Cleveland Diagnostics,\" said Kim Popovits , chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of Genomic Health. \"With multiple revenue growth catalysts now in place, including the implementation of PAMA and AJCC breast cancer staging criteria, the recent strengthening of NCCN prostate guidelines and the launch of the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test, we expect to deliver double-digit growth in both tests delivered and revenue in 2018, along with significant improvement in profitability. In addition, we anticipate the near-term reporting of final TAILORx results to drive Oncotype DX to a new standard of care for patients diagnosed with early-stage invasive breast cancer, positioning us to deliver a record-setting performance this year.\"\n2018 Financial Outlook\nIn positioning its business to deliver near-term growth and increased profitability, the company is directing its focus and resource allocation toward catalysts that it expects will drive further adoption and reimbursement of its portfolio globally with greater operational efficiency. Specifically, the company plans to direct resources to expand its Oncotype DX offering through the development of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test solutions, including on the Biocartis ® Idylla™ platform, to increase global access in markets where localized testing is critical for adoption and reimbursement. With this shift in focus, the company will no longer provide the Oncotype SEQ ® Liquid Select™ test or further invest in non-proprietary next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based panels. Accordingly, the company will reduce positions by approximately 10 percent and take a charge of approximately $10 million in the first quarter for costs associated with personnel reductions and the write-off of certain assets associated with NGS-based panels.\n\"We believe this strategic direction to maximize profitable growth in the short term will result in approximately $3 million saved per quarter, enabling us to enhance operational efficiency and deliver operating leverage above 50 percent, improved over our 40 percent leverage target of the past few years,\" said Brad Cole , chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Genomic Health. \"In 2018, we expect continued improvement in profitability on a non-GAAP basis and double-digit revenue growth. We expect to successfully execute on multiple revenue growth catalysts leading to an acceleration in revenue growth in the back half of the year and double-digit operating income as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter.\"\nThe company is providing the following guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018 under ASC 606 revenue recognition standards:\nLow\nHigh\nRevenue (1)\n$ 366\n$ 382\nRevenue Growth (2)\n10%\n15%\nNet Income (GAAP) (1)\n$ 0\n$ 5\nGAAP EPS\n$ 0.16\n$ 0.22\nNet Income (Non-GAAP) (1) (3)\n$ 14\n$ 20\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$ 0.32\n$ 0.50\n(1)\nIn millions\n(2)\nThe outlook for 10% to 15% revenue growth in 2018 represents management's estimates for 2018 versus 2017 reported revenues adjusted to reflect the impact of ASC 606 revenue recognition rules which were effective January 1, 2018. Under the new rules, the company will report most uncollectible balances as a reduction in net revenues; historically certain uncollectible amounts were classified as bad debt expense and were approximately 2.5% of revenue and classified within selling, general and administrative expenses. The company does not expect ASC 606 to impact net income or EPS.\n(3)\nNon-GAAP net income excludes stock-based compensation, charges for personnel reductions and asset write-offs associated with product cessation, and clinical and commercial development milestone payments.\nAdditional 2017 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenue was $87.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $82.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 6 percent. On a non-GAAP constant currency basis, revenue increased 5 percent compared with the same period in the prior year.\nU.S. product revenue was $73.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $70.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 5 percent. U.S. invasive breast revenue from Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score tests was $66.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $63.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. prostate test revenue from GPS tests was $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 39 percent.\nInternational revenue was $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $12.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 14 percent, and an increase of 12 percent on a non-GAAP constant currency basis.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.2 million, compared with $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income was $1.9 million, or $0.05 per share on a basic and fully diluted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $1.4 million, or $0.04 per share on a basic and fully diluted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, more than 31,990 Oncotype™ test results were delivered, an increase of 7 percent, compared with more than 30,020 test results delivered in the same period in 2016.\nMore than 126,740 Oncotype test results were delivered for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 7 percent, compared with more than 118,570 test results delivered in the same period in 2016. Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score tests delivered in the U.S. grew 3 percent in the full year 2017 compared to the prior year. Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score tests delivered in the U.S. grew 37 percent in the full year 2017 compared to the prior year. International tests delivered grew 11 percent for the full year compared to the prior year and represented approximately 20 percent of total test volume in 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities at December 31, 2017 were $129.6 million, which included the fair value of the company's investment in marketable securities of $3.5 million, an increase of $32.6 million compared with $97.0 million at December 31, 2016, which included the fair value of the company's investment in marketable securities of $9.3 million.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. An explanation and reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this press release.\nRecent Business Highlights\nLaunched Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™, the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind to help prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by accurately detecting a splice variant of the androgen receptor protein (AR-V7) in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated its guidelines for prostate cancer to now include molecular testing. Specifically, the updated 2018 guidelines include the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) test for men with NCCN low- and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer to provide prognostic information in order to choose active surveillance or definitive treatment. Reviews in Urology published real-world clinical evidence demonstrating that the Oncotype DX GPS test increases use of active surveillance by 30 percent in low-risk patients, resulting in greater adherence to guideline-based care. These findings from a large U.S. payer system are consistent with four previously published studies demonstrating the positive effect of GPS testing on active surveillance use. Established additional private coverage for the Oncotype DX GPS test, bringing the total number of U.S. covered lives to more than 67 million. Announced an exclusive licensing agreement with Cleveland Diagnostics, Inc. to develop and commercialize new prostate cancer tests based on Cleveland Diagnostics' IsoPSA™ reagents and technology. Initial efforts will focus on Genomic Health's development of a high-PSA (prostate-specific antigen) reflex test to accurately predict the presence of high-grade cancer (Gleason score >7) prior to prostate biopsy. Announced a multi-year research collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals to evaluate the GPS test for their prostate cancer drug pipeline. As part of the agreement, Genomic Health will test samples from Janssen studies to examine the association of GPS results with clinical outcomes. Made a $4 million equity investment in Biocartis Group NV, further strengthening the partnership between the companies to develop an IVD version of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test on the Idylla platform that can be performed locally by laboratory partners and in hospitals around the world. Presented results from 10 studies that reinforce the unmatched value of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test and Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score™ test in optimizing patient treatment across the breast cancer disease continuum at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Received acceptance to present three studies at the 11th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC-11), in March.\nConference Call Details\nTo access the live conference call today, March 8 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time via phone, please dial (877) 303-7208 from the United States and Canada, or +1 (224) 357-2389 internationally.
