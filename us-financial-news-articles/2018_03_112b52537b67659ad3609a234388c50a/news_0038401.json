(NASDAQ: RTTR) (“Ritter Pharmaceuticals” or the “Company”), a developer of novel therapeutic products that modulate the gut microbiome to treat gastrointestinal diseases with an initial focus on the development of the first FDA-approved treatment for lactose intolerance, today reported financial results and a business update for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nRecent Highlights\n● Closed approximately $23 million in equity in the fourth quarter of 2017 in an underwritten public offering to fund initiation of the Phase 3 clinical program of RP-G28 for lactose intolerance. ● Completed the Phase 2b Extension Trial in which a subset of patients from our Phase 2b clinical trial was observed for durability of treatment. ● Announced top-line microbiome data results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, reporting beneficial adaptation of the gut microbiome. The results of the analysis were consistent with the results noted in the Phase 2a study and further support our proposed mechanism of action for RP-G28. ● Strengthened the clinical development team with the appointment of Diane J. Plotkin, Ph.D., as Vice President of Clinical Development. ● Appointed Distinguished Gastroenterologist, William Chey, M.D., to the Company’s Medical Advisory Board. ● Initiated a Phase 1 clinical pharmacology safety study of RP-G28 to support our planned Phase 3 program. ● Announced approval for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the company’s common stock, anticipated effective date on or before March 23, 2018.\n“Our focus in 2018 is on the initiation of our first pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of RP-G28 in lactose intolerance for which we are currently on track to start screening in the second quarter,” said Michael D. Step, Chief Executive Officer of Ritter Pharmaceuticals. “With collaboration and feedback from the FDA, we have diligently laid out our Phase 3 program and trial design and we are now vigilantly preparing to launch the trial.”\nAndrew J. Ritter, President of Ritter Pharmaceuticals, added, “We believe that RP-G28 can serve as an effective treatment for people suffering from lactose intolerance, a significant unmet need, as there are no currently approved therapies. While we focus our efforts on the Phase 3 trial, we are also continuing to explore the therapeutic potential of RP-G28 to positively effect gut microbiome adaptation in treating and/or preventing a variety of other conditions.”\nFourth Quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Ritter Pharmaceuticals reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $5.1 million compared to a net loss of approximately $7.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.11 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.74 for the same period in 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Ritter Pharmaceuticals reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $11.0 million compared to a net loss of approximately $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per share was approximately $0.50 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to basic and diluted net loss per share of approximately $2.04 for the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses totaled approximately $0.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 versus approximately $6.1 million for the comparable period of 2016. The quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately $5.6 million was primarily driven by a decrease in activity related to our Phase 2b clinical trial; which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, research and development expenses totaled approximately $2.9 million compared to approximately $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses was attributable to the completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for both the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 were approximately $1.4 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $4.8 million, compared to approximately $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in general and administrative costs for the year was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense offset by an increase in professional fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total operating expenses were approximately $7.9 million, compared to approximately $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by the decrease in research and development expense attributable to the completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Ritter Pharmaceuticals had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $22.6 million.\nAbout Ritter Pharmaceuticals\nRitter Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
