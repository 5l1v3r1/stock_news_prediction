It is also aimed at improving combat abilities of the whole military,” Ren said. \n“As to the specific movements of the aircraft carrier the Liaoning, the navy will release information in due course,” he added, without elaborating. \nHowever, he later confirmed that the Liaoning had passed through the Taiwan Strait, in what he said was also part of normal and regular training activities, and that these drills would continue. He gave no details.
