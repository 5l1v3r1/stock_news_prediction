Like a lot of times you can venture off and start, you know, doing other things.” \nStephens faced just one break point in reaching her first semi-final since winning the U.S. Open last year. \nKerber, who was playing less than 24 hours after a three-set win over qualifier Wang Yafan that lasted nearly three hours, said her schedule was beginning to take its toll. \n“I was really feeling a little bit tired today,” Kerber said. “I mean, of course it was windy, it was tricky, but I have played so many matches in the last three months that I was feeling it a little bit today in my body.” \nAzarenka continued her strong run in Miami where she has now won 11 straight dating back to her 2016 title triumph. \nAzarenka, who broke Pliskova seven times, will be playing in her first semi-final in two years. The former world number one was absent from the game for eight months due to a custody dispute involving her son.
