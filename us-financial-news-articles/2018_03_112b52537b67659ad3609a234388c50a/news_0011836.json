That was a mistake.\" We run surveys to understand how the community thinks about how we set policies. But this kind of activity is and will always be completely unacceptable on FB. We regularly work with authorities if identified. It shouldn't have been part of this survey. That was a mistake. â€” Guy Rosen (@guyro) March 4, 2018 \nThe decision to send out the surveys, then pull them once they were discovered, is the latest in a series of recent flip-flops by the company. \nLast month, for example, Facebook blocked the account of an Ethiopian political activist who was documenting unrest in that country, then restored it and apologized after his supporters protested on social media, in a campaign that included spamming Mark Zuckerberg's Valentine's Day post with messages of support.
