The driver lost control of the vehicle which plunged 25 feet down from a small bridge near Ranghola,” said Vishal Dinesh Mehta, a sub-inspector of police.\nRanghola is a village in Bhavnagar district, around 200 km (around 125 miles) from the state capital, Gandhinagar.\n“At least 10 among the dead are women,” said Mehta, adding a detailed investigation was under way.\nDeadly road accidents are common in India, where driving standards are poor and roads and vehicles badly maintained. In 2016, road accidents claimed 17 lives every hour, government data shows.
