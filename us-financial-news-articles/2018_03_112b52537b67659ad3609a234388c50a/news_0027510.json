(NASDAQ: INWK), the leading global marketing execution firm, today announced financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. For all non-GAAP references below, please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables at the end of this release for more information.\n“We had a strong finish to 2017 with a growth rate that exceeded our expectations. In addition, we’ve won several large new contracts in recent months, and we’re well down the path on a number of exciting sales pursuits,” said Chief Executive Officer Eric D. Belcher. “This combination sets us up for strong growth in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRecord gross revenue was $301.0 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 11% compared with $270.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit (net revenue) was $71.3 million, or 23.7% of gross revenue, in the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% compared to $68.7 million, or 25.4% of revenue, in the same period of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter was $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to $5.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $14.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.06, compared to $0.12 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull-Year 2017 Results and Recent Highlights\nGross revenue was $1,136.3 million in 2017, an increase of 4% compared with $1,090.7 million in 2016. Gross profit (net revenue) was $278.3 million, or 24.5% of gross revenue, in 2017, a 6% increase compared to $263.5 million, or 24.2% of revenue, in 2016. Net income in 2017 was $19.0 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $62.3 million in 2017, reflecting growth of 5% compared to $59.2 million in 2016. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2017 was $0.41, compared to $0.38 in 2016. Cash flow from operations was $16.1 million in 2017, compared to $10.5 million in the year before. InnerWorkings signed new client contracts during 2017 totaling $130 million of annual revenue at full run-rate. This growth is a blend of expansions with existing accounts as well as the addition of a number of first time clients. In 2018 to date, InnerWorkings has already signed several new client contracts totaling $41 million of annual revenue at full run-rate.\n“Our expected growth in 2018 will generate meaningful operating leverage and free cash flow in 2018, giving us the ability to reinvest in our business on behalf of our clients, employees and shareholders,” said Chip Hodgkins, Interim Chief Financial Officer of InnerWorkings.\nRich Stoddart, incoming Chief Executive Officer, added, “InnerWorkings has evolved its business over the past five years to be at the forefront of software, digital, and other growing components of marketing execution. I look forward to helping the company capitalize on its early lead in this emerging market.”\nOutlook\nInnerWorkings reaffirms the existing full-year 2018 guidance announced previously. The Company expects 2018 annual gross revenue to range between $1,195 million and $1,230 million, representing growth of 5% to 8% compared to 2017. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $74 million and $77 million in 2018, representing growth of 19% to 24% compared to 2017. The Company forecasts 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $0.56 to $0.59, representing growth of 37% to 44% compared to 2017.\nConference Call\nEric D.

The Company believes these measures provide useful information to investors because they provide further insights into the Company’s financial performance. These measures are also used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall performance. The presentation of this financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures, please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included in this release.\nThe Company has not quantitatively reconciled its guidance for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to their most comparable GAAP measure because the Company does not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of the Company’s control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial metric is not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company’s results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains statements relating to future results.
