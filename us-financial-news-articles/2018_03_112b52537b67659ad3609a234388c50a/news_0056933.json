Ecuador produced 193.9 million barrels in the year, down 3.4 percent from the previous year.\nEcuador has suffered from the drop in oil prices, a major earthquake and bad economic management over the last decade, according to President Lenin Moreno.\nThe non-oil sector registered growth of 3.5 percent during 2017, due to the recovery of electricity, water, financial services and some other economic sectors.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the economy expanded 3 percent year on year, and 1.2 percent compared to the previous quarter. Ecuadorian authorities expect the country’s economy to grow more than 2 percent in 2018.
