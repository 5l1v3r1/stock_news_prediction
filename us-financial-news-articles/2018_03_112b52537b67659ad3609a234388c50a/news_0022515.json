REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo The decision comes after the European Union’s Single Resolution Board and the European Central Bank (ECB) said last month ABLV was failing and would be wound up.\nIt followed allegations by U.S. authorities Latvia’s third-biggest bank had covered up money laundering, bribed officials and facilitated the breach of sanctions against North Korea. ABLV has denied wrongdoing.\nThe accusations effectively froze the bank out of U.S. dollar financial markets, prompting its closure and hurting some local peers.\nBut the Luxembourg court on Friday rejected a request from the financial regulator — Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) — to liquidate ABLV’s Luxembourg branch, the court said in a statement.\nThe CSSF had been made a temporary administrator of the bank. The court said it appointed two new administrators on Friday.\nABLV said its Luxembourg branch had a strong financial standing, which was recognized by the court, and it would now look for new investors.\n“The court has appointed two external administrators which will work at the bank during the following six months until the bank finds new investors,” the bank said in a statement late on Friday.\nIt was “very satisfied that the soundness of the Luxembourg entity has been recognized”, it added.\nABLV could not be immediately reached for further comments.\nReporting by Michele Sinner; writing by Alissa de Carbonnel; editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T15:59:01.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
