(“First Majestic” or the “Company”) announces that its board of directors has approved the extension of its share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase”) pursuant to a normal course issuer bid in the open market through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) or alternative Canadian market places over the next 12 months. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase, the Company proposes to repurchase up to 8,286,401 common shares of the Company which represents 5% of the 165,728,029 issued and outstanding shares of the Company as of March 12, 2018.\nIn order to implement the Share Repurchase, First Majestic has received TSX approval of its notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid. The notice provides that First Majestic may, during the 12 month period commencing on March 21, 2018 and ending on or before March 20, 2019, purchase up to 8,286,401 common shares through the facilities of the TSX and alternative Canadian marketplaces.\nIn accordance with TSX rules, daily purchases made by the Company on the TSX will not exceed 183,231 common shares, or 25% of First Majestic’s average daily trading volume of 732,923 common shares on the TSX for the six calendar months preceding the date of the acceptance of the original notice, subject to certain prescribed exemptions.\nThe Company repurchased 230,000 common shares for cancellation for a volume weighted average price of CDN$7.00 under its prior normal course issuer bid which commenced on March 21, 2017 and expires on March 20, 2018.\nFirst Majestic will make no purchases of common shares other than open-market purchases. The price that the Company will pay for any common shares will be the prevailing market price of such shares at the time of acquisition. All common shares purchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase will be cancelled.\nThe Company believes that, from time to time, the market price of its common shares may not fully reflect the underlying value of the Company’s business and its future business prospects. The Company believes that at such times the purchase of common shares would be in the best interests of the Company. Such purchases are expected to benefit all remaining shareholders by increasing their equity interest in the Company.\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nFirst Majestic is a mining company focused on silver production in Mexico and is aggressively pursuing the development of its existing mineral property assets. The Company presently owns and operates six producing silver mines; the La Parrilla Silver Mine, the San Martin Silver Mine, the La Encantada Silver Mine, the La Guitarra Silver Mine, Del Toro Silver Mine and the Santa Elena Silver/Gold Mine. Production from these six mines is projected to be between 10.6 to 11.8 million ounces of pure silver or 15.7 to 17.5 million ounces of silver equivalents in 2018.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION contact info@firstmajestic.com , visit our website at www.firstmajestic.com or call our toll free number 1.866.529.2807.\nFIRST MAJESTIC SILVER CORP.\n“signed”\nKeith Neumeyer, President & CEO\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD‐LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis news release includes certain “Forward‐Looking Statements” of “forward looking information” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws, respectively.
