The S&P 500 gained 1.14 percent to 2,617.85 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.18 percent at 7,074.96.\nMicrosoft jumped 5.4 percent and was the biggest driver of the three main indexes. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Microsoft’s stock, saying the software company could hit $1 trillion in market value with growing public adoption of the cloud and improving margins.\nIntel rose 3 percent after brokerage Raymond James upgraded the stock to “market perform”.\nLast week, the three main U.S. indexes posted their steepest weekly declines since January 2016 as the fears of a global trade war added to jitters about a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and fears of increased regulations to the high-flying technology sector in the wake of Facebook’s data scandal.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.43-to-1 ratio and for a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
