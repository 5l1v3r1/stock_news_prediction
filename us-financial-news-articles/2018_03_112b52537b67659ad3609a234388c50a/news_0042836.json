It suggests South Africa’s investment-grade rating is secure, for at least one rating agency,” said Razia Khan, chief Africa economist at Standard Chartered.\n“This considerably lessens the likelihood of World Government Bond Index exclusion. It lessens the risk that South Africa will be subject to significant outflows. It is positive for the currency,” Khan said.\nS&P Global Ratings downgraded South African local currency debt to ‘BB+’, or junk territory, in November, citing a deterioration in the country’s economic outlook and public finances.\nIn April, Fitch downgraded the rating to sub-investment grade after Zuma abruptly fired Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, saying it would likely result in a change in economic policy direction. It kept both local and foreign currency credit ratings unchanged at BB+ in November, with a stable outlook.\nThe country has, however, seen a return of sorely needed investor confidence since Ramaphosa replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma, who resigned in mid February on the orders of the ruling African National Congress party.\nRamaphosa has wasted little time in working to pull South Africa back from the brink.\nHe reshuffled his cabinet in February, sacking and demoting several Zuma allies and restored Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister - two years after Nene’s sacking from the same role by Zuma.\nRamaphosa this week also suspended Zuma ally Tom Moyane as head of the revenue service.\nThe Treasury also took the politically risky decision in its 2018 budget to raise value added tax for the first time in 25 years was cheered by investors and ratings firms.\n“The stable outlook reflects a careful balance of risks. The new administration faces equally significant opportunities and challenges,” Moody’s said.
