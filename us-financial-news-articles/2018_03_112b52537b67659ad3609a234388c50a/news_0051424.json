Comparable stores sales rose 2.33 percent and consolidated gross profit margin rose to 18.26 percent from 16.09 percent a year earlier.\nZhang also said GOME will develop “smart community stores” and unstaffed stores equipped with cutting-edge technology, and develop various virtual stores covering both online and offline channels.\n“In the next three years, GOME plans to open 3,000 county stores, to fully cover the top 100 counties and other areas in China,” Zhang said.\n“With the consumption upgrade in China, GOME will proactively adjust its presence nationwide,” he added.\nGOME said it will take advantage of opportunities to extend its network of stores in lower tier Chinese cities.\nLast month, bigger rival Suning.Com Co Ltd said 2017 sales surged 30 percent to 243.2 billion yuan, with profit up nearly 500 percent at 4.21 billion yuan amid rapid growth in revenue and net profit margin both online and offline.\nGOME shares closed up 2.3 percent prior to the results statement, compared with a 0.8 percent rise in the benchmark stock price index.
