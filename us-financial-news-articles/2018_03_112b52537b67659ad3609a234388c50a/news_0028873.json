(NYSE: DSW), a leading branded footwear and accessories retailer, announced financial results for the fourteen week and fifty-three week periods ended February 3, 2018, compared to the thirteen week and fifty-two week periods ended January 28, 2017.\nRoger Rawlins, Chief Executive Officer stated, \"Our fourth quarter performance capped our first year of adjusted earnings growth since 2013. Our initiatives drove comparable sales growth and strong margin improvement at the DSW Segment this quarter. The sales inflection at our Power 35 locations, including our Lab store where we have introduced an elevated warehouse experience, prove our initiatives are gaining traction and provide us a blueprint to drive sales. We are drawing on our strong cash flow and the benefit from U.S. Tax Reform to enhance shareholder returns by boosting our quarterly dividend and reinvesting in strategic initiatives that will advance DSW's dominant position in the marketplace in the years to come,\" stated Mr. Rawlins.\nThe Company achieved several important milestones in fiscal 2017:\nTotal Company revenues hit a new high of $2.8 billion; Renewed momentum in the core business, with footwear posting positive comparable sales for three quarters in a row; The revitalization of DSW's Power 35 locations; The successful expansion of DSW Kids, with plans to complete the chain-wide roll-out in 2018; The Company's strongest growth in digital demand in the last 9 years; The first increase in operating profitability and EPS since 2013; The development of a new store design and the innovation of new services and technology that will define DSW's future customer experience.\nFourth Quarter Operating Results\nSales increased 6.7% to $720.0 million, including $35.6 million from the extra week. For the thirteen-week period, comparable sales increased 1.3% compared to last year's 7.0% decrease. Reported gross profit increased by 150 bps, driven by favorable sourcing, lower markdowns and occupancy leverage. Reported operating expenses improved by 20 bps, driven by tighter expense management, partly offset by higher incentive compensation. Reported net income was $11.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, which included net after-tax charges of $18.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, excluding costs related to Ebuys, restructuring, acquisition expenses related to Town Shoes and the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Adjusted net income was $30.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 90%, excluding costs related to Ebuys, restructuring, acquisition expenses related to Town Shoes and the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week of $0.06 per diluted share, adjusted earnings per share increased by 60%.\nImpact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"U.S. Tax Reform'):\nAs a result of the recent passage of the U.S. Tax Reform, the Company recorded an additional $10.1 million net tax expense resulting from the remeasurement of its net federal deferred tax assets, partially offset by the benefit of applying the new rate on the last month of the fiscal year. This additional amount is excluded from the Company's adjusted results.\nBased on its initial analysis of the U.S. Tax Reform, the Company estimates an effective tax rate of approximately 29% for fiscal year 2018 compared to its historical rate of 39%, with the benefit from the reduction in federal tax rate partly offset by other provisions in the new law. The Company's effective tax rate will be subject to changes in its interpretation and application of the new tax legislation, future guidance and regulatory updates from governing bodies go forward.\nExit of Ebuys\nFollowing a comprehensive evaluation of strategic alternatives for Ebuys, the Company made the decision to exit the business. Consequently, the Company revalued its remaining assets including inventory, fixed and intangible assets at liquidation value and reduced its contingent consideration liability. The Company expects to complete the liquidation process in early 2018 and may incur additional one-time exit charges, which will be excluded from adjusted results.\nFull Year Operating Results\nSales increased 3.3% to $2.8 billion, including $87.0 million from Ebuys. For the fifty-two week period, comparable sales decreased by 0.4% compared to last year's 3.0% decrease. Reported net income was $67.3 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, which included net after-tax charges of $55.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, excluding costs related to Ebuys, restructuring costs, acquisition expenses related to Town Shoes and the impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Adjusted net income was $122.8 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, a 4.1% increase to last year.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nCash, short-term and long-term investments totaled $300.5 million compared to $287.1 million the previous year. Inventories were $501.9 million compared to $500.0 million last year. On a cost per square foot basis, DSW inventories increased by 6%, primarily due to higher in-transit goods as the Company funds growth initiatives. On a two-year basis, inventories per square foot declined 2%. For the full year, the Company repurchased a total of 0.5 million shares for a total of $9.4 million and has $524.1 million remaining under its share repurchase program. The Company has returned $625 million in dividends and share repurchases since 2013.\nRegular Dividend\nDSW Inc.'s Board of Directors approved to increase its quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share. The dividend will be paid on April 6, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Annual Outlook\nFor the fifty-two week period ending February 2, 2019, the Company expects full year revenue growth to decrease by 1% to 3%, with the exit of non-core businesses and the impact of the 53rd week. Excluding the exit of non-core businesses and the 53rd week, total revenues are expected to increase in the 2% to 4% range. This assumes comparable sales increase in the low single digit range and the opening of 3 to 6 net new locations for the DSW Segment.\nFull year adjusted earnings per share is expected to range between $1.52 to $1.67 per diluted share, representing earnings growth of 4% to 14% excluding the income from the 53rd week. The Company's outlook assumes a tax rate of 29% and 81.0 million shares outstanding. Guidance excludes charges related to the exit of Ebuys and does not assume the consolidation of Town Shoes.\nWebcast\nThe Company is hosting a conference call today at 8:30 am Eastern Time.

The unaudited reconciliation of adjusted results should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company believes that this non-GAAP information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate the Company's operating performance, when reviewed in conjunction with the Company's GAAP statements. These amounts are not determined in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be used exclusively in evaluating the Company's business and operations.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dsw-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2017-financial-results-300612800.html\nSOURCE DSW Inc.", "external_links": ["http://m.dsw.com/", "http://www.dswinc.com/", "http://twitter.com/DSWShoeLovers", "http://www.facebook.com/DSW", "http://www.dsw.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dsw-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2017-financial-results-300612800.html"], "published": "2018-03-13T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T14:01:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
