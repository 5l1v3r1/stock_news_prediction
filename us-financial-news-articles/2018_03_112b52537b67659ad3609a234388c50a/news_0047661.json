The significant increase in Franchise revenues resulted from brand acquisitions in 2016 and the organic unit growth that occurred throughout 2017.\nDivisional profit from the Franchise segment increased from $5.3 million in 2016 to $13.8 million in 2017 representing an increase of 158.8 percent. Divisional profit margin in the Franchise segment increased 675 basis points to 28.3 percent for the 2017 fiscal year.\nThe Company executed 144 franchise license agreements in 2017. This total included 29 midscale and 115 economy properties.\nMidscale system-wide same store RevPAR increased by 2.5 percent in 2017.\nIn early October 2017 the Company announced its intention to market for sale 11 of its hotels to significantly improve its balance sheet, increase its cash reserves and focus its future growth on its high-profit margin and less capital-intensive Franchise business. During 2017, the Company made significant progress in its marketing activities to sell the hotels identified for sale as part of its real estate divestiture strategy. During the first quarter of 2018 the company sold five of its hotels and has contracts or letters of intent to sell 2 more hotels in upcoming months.\nThe Company sold its Entertainment business on October 3, 2017, and that segment is now disclosed as discontinued operations. Prior to the sale date, the Entertainment business generated $0.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, the continuing operations and discontinued Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $23.1 million, increasing $3.6 million over 2016 Adjusted EBITDA.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2017 was $2.7 million, as compared to $2.5 million in the same period last year.\nMidscale system-wide same store RevPAR increased in 2017 by 2.0 percent, as compared to 2016.\nDivisional profit margin on the Franchise Business increased 670 basis points to 32.1 percent fiscal year 2017.\n“2017 was a year of fundamental strategic changes for RLH Corporation. We fully integrated the employees, infrastructure and technology of the hotel brands we acquired in 2016, which set the stage for the significant growth of our franchise business profitability in 2017,” said Greg Mount, RLH Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer. “We also successfully sold our entertainment business which helped to simplify our business model by eliminating a non-strategic business segment. In October, we announced our intention to market for sale 11 hotels representing the majority of our real estate holdings. We closed the sale of five hotels during the first quarter. These sales will allow us to significantly reduce long-term debt and the expected gains on the sales will increase our cash reserves. This cleanup of our balance sheet will further enhance our position as we pursue the aggressive growth of our franchise business through organic growth and brand and multi-franchise agreement acquisitions.”\nJoint Venture Entities\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is required to consolidate 100 percent of its joint venture entities’ assets, liabilities and operating results. Although the Company is required to consolidate these entities, its economic share of the joint venture entities is 55 percent, except for Baltimore where its economic share is 73 percent. The Company at year-end had ownership interests in 18 of its hotels. Four of the hotels were leaseholds, and the remaining 14 were in joint ventures. RLH Corporation engaged CBRE to market for sale 11 of the hotels held by a joint venture and recently closed the sales of five of these hotels. Over the course of the next few years the Company’s intention is to continue to reduce its majority real estate ownership.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $22.4 million. The Company’s joint venture partners’ pro rata share of this Adjusted EBITDA was $6.9 million, and RLH Corporation’s share of the Adjusted EBITDA was $15.5 million.\nThe strength of the Company’s balance sheet should improve as it continues to close on the sales of its hotels, and the Company expects to use the resulting cash on its balance sheet to finance a significant portion of the growth of its Franchise business. RLH Corporation’s pro rata share of the consolidated debt position was $63.7 million, and its share of the consolidated cash equivalents balance was $29.7 million, resulting in $34.0 million of net debt as of December 31, 2017. Hotel sales since year end have resulted in $38.2 million in debt reduction, lowering our pro rata share of debt to $42.7 million.\n2018 Expectations\nIn 2018, the anticipated sales of hotels will reduce our hotel divisional profitability. As the sales are closed, we will disclose the material terms of each transaction in our 8K filings including the historical Adjusted EBITDA relating to the hotels sold. Due to the inability to predict the timing of the hotel sales, our initial guidance for the 2018 fiscal year will concentrate on our Franchise business, which will represent the majority of the ongoing future earnings of the Company.\nFranchise:\n2018 Midscale system-wide RevPAR expected to increase 1 percent to 3 percent year over year.\nFranchise divisional profit from $16 million to $17 million representing a potential increase of 16 percent to 23 percent.\nThe Franchise divisional profit margin is expected to increase from 28.3 percent in 2017 to between 30 and 32 percent in 2018. This profit margin should improve further as the hotels the Company sells enter new franchise agreements with the Company.\nSo far, the Company has entered new franchise contracts on all five hotels sold in the first quarter of 2018. These five franchise contracts are expected to generate franchise fee revenues of $400 thousand to $600 thousand over the remainder of 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses are expected to be $16.2 million to $16.5 million. With the change in focus from hotel ownership to franchising, the Company expects to reduce costs of $4 to $5 million as an initial target for 2018. Cost reduction efforts will be ongoing and impact will depend on the timing of additional hotel sales in 2018.\nThe Company expects to execute between 150 and 200 license agreements in 2018.\nHotel Division:\nAdjusted EBITDA for the leasehold hotels (Anaheim, Seattle, Spokane, and Kalispell) and the three hotels not being marketed for sale (Washington DC, Baltimore and Atlanta) achieved an EBITDA contribution of $5.9M in 2017. We anticipate modest growth in these properties due to the generally favorable market conditions and the continued work to stabilize the JV properties to hire occupancies and achieve room rates.\nThe 2018 Adjusted EBITDA for the five hotels sold in the seasonally slow first quarter of 2018 was $150,000 through the dates of their respective sales. The Adjusted EBITDA contribution for these five hotels was $4.7 million for fiscal 2017.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA contribution for the six hotels currently being marketed for sale was $12.1M for fiscal 2017. Our 2018 Adjusted EBITDA for these six hotels will be for the period in 2018 through the dates of each of the hotel sales.\nConference Call Information\nRLH Corporation will conduct a conference call on Wednesday, March 28th at 5:00p.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the results for interested investors, analyst and portfolio managers.

Comparable hotels are defined as properties that were operated by the Company for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the current year other than hotels for which comparable results were not available. Comparable results excludes two hotels, one of which was sold in 2016, and one property that opened during the second quarter of 2016, as these properties had not been open at least one year as of the beginning of the current year. In addition, we exclude revenue earned and expenses incurred related to our hotel management agreements.\nRLH Corporation utilizes these comparable measures because management finds them a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core, ongoing operations. The Company believes the comparable measures are a complement to reported operating results. Comparable operating results are not intended to represent reported operating results defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and such information should not be considered as an alternative to reported information or any other measure of performance prescribed by GAAP.
