We invested significant amounts of money in premises and facilities so, therefore, our industry has limited short-term flexibility,” he said.\nThe Trump administration last week set out specific demands that included greater access to China by U.S. auto makers, chip makers and financial firms. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on as much as $60 billion of Chinese imports, while China on Friday rolled out penalties against $3 billion in U.S. goods as Washington’s levies on imported steel and aluminum took effect on the same day.\nThe EU’s temporary exemption from the U.S.’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum means “we bought time,” Mr. Witter said. “But the subject isn’t off the table,” he said, calling the trade dispute between the U.S. and various international trading partners “a complicated matter.”\nChanges to the North American Free Trade Agreement also might have an impact on Volkswagen. The auto maker has production facilities in both Mexico and the U.S. and recently opened a factory for its Audi Q5 SUV in Mexico.\n“Nobody knows what the new rules would look like,” Mr. Witter said, referring to the continuing renegotiation of the Nafta. U.S. companies with operations in Mexico and Canada could be affected as well as foreign firms doing business in all three countries, he said.\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T23:04:33.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
