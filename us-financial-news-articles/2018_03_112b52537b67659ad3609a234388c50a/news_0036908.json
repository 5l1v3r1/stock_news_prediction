The bodies were recovered from a mound in Badush, in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which was freed from the Islamic State last July. DNA tests had confirmed the bodies to be those of the construction workers who went missing from Mosul, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said. “With full proof I can say these 39 are dead,” Swaraj told parliament. The government had for years said it would only declare the men dead once it had full evidence. Swaraj said authorities in Baghdad helped identify the mound in Badush, about 420 kms (260 miles) from the capital Baghdad, and with the help of deep penetration radar, the buried bodies were discovered and exhumed. DNA testing provided matches for 38 of the missing men while one was a 70 percent match, Swaraj said, as his parents were both dead and the DNA sample of next of kin was provided. “We recovered ID cards, long hair, kada and some non-Iraqi footwear,” Swaraj said. A kada is a steel bracelet worn by Sikh men, who do not cut their hair.

Opposition leaders and families of the men said the government had kept them in the dark. “Why did the government give false hope to the nation for three and a half years that the people were still alive? That was disappointing behaviour,” Shashi Tharoor, a leader of the opposition Congress party, said in a tweet.
