REUTERS/Regis Duvignau On Friday Siemens said Busch will serve as chairman of the combined entity’s board of directors while Yann Delabriere, who is currently lead director of Alstom’s Board, would be appointed as vice chairman.\nThe board of directors of the combined company will consist of 11 members, six of whom – including the chairman – are to be appointed by Siemens, the German company said. Four independent members and the CEO will complete the board.\nThe deal is expected to close at the end of this year and new group will be headquartered in Saint-Ouen, France, and continue to be listed on the Paris stock exchange.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:23:18.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
