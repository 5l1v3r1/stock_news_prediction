But a typical worker’s net wage is far lower at around 1,500 zloty - still a world away from the German average of 3,911 euros gross.\nIn a posting on broadcaster TVN24’s website one user, Polak, said Gowin’s complaint was “detached from reality” and described his comments as embarrassing.\nA second user, maroobit, said on the Wprost.pl site: “You’re shameless, all of you who finally get an access to money. You’re pathetic.”\nGowin, whose small Accord party is part of the PiS coalition, offered apologies for his comment, especially to ”those who are struggling with real poverty.\n“My intention was not to complain about my own situation, which is undoubtedly much better than that of millions of Poles,” he said in a Twitter posting.\nLow Polish wages are a focal point in PiS’s strategy of resisting adoption of the euro, which all EU members are obliged join. The party’s official line is that Poland will become part of the euro zone once its wages match Germany‘s.\n$1 = 3.4187 zlotys Reporting by Marcin Goclowski; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:19:41.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
