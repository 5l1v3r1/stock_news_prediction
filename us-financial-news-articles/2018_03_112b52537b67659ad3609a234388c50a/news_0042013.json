Prime   blamed   Putin for the incident last week and expelled 23 diplomats from the Russian embassy in a move which was replicated by Moscow. Russia denies any involvement in the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who have been critical in hospital since they were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the city of Salisbury. London and Wiltshire police had no immediate comment on the Mail Online story when contacted by Reuters. The second police officerâ€™s symptoms include skin irritation, the website said.
