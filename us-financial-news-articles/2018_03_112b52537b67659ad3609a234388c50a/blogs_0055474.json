Each package was collected for further analysis by the FBI,” agency spokesman Andrew Ames said. \nAt Fort McNair, a suspicious package was delivered at about 8:30 a.m. eastern time, prompting officials to evacuate the building, according to a base spokesman. \nSome four hours later a U.S. Army Ordnance Disposal unit confirmed that the package had tested positive for explosive residue and determined that a fuse was attached, the spokesman said. \nFew details were released on the package found at Fort Belvoir, but a base spokesman said that it had been rendered safe. \nReporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T03:43:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
