Despite its more vulgar connotations, the style is rooted in British aristocracy, having been originally developed as a sporting coat for the upper crust. It soared to broader popularity during World War I, when British officers adopted the weatherproofed, double-breasted, oft-belted style (typically in khaki) for use on the front lines, according to Jane Tynan, leader in the M.A. in Fashion Critical Studies at Central Saint Martins in London.\nYet “somehow it was within civilian life that the trench coat developed,” Ms. Tynan explained. At the time, she said, any marketing tied to the war effort made for a good business strategy, one adopted by brands like Burberry and Aquascutum. The coats have been a fashion mainstay ever since. Cultural touchstones include Humphrey Bogart’s Burberry number in “Casablanca” and the versions immortalized by female role models like Marlene Dietrich, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Brigitte Bardot and Audrey Hepburn. Each made her own mark on the classic. \nEasily dressed up or down, the trench has unswervingly stayed in fashion—nearly every designer worth his salt has riffed on the theme, from the late Azzedine Alaïa’s oversize 1980s variations to the pastel tweed takes Michael Kors showed for spring 2018. “I love taking wardrobe staples and twisting them in new ways,” said Mr. Kors. “I wanted this season’s trench coats to have the easy relaxed feel of a bathrobe or kimono blended with the classic polish of a city trench.”\nSerafina Sama, designer of the London-based label Isa Arfen, has also experimented extensively with the coats, introducing features like glitter buttons or puffed sleeves that have only the most tangential ties to the battlefield. Still their basic trenchness endures. “It’s important to [pick] something you can wear season after season,” said Ms. Sama. “At least that’s the relationship I like to have with my trench coats.”\nTrench Masters How eight greats wore it 1941 | On the set of her film “Manpower,” Marlene Dietrich demonstrated a femme-fatale take on the trench, pairing it with pumps and an attitudinal beret.

Shoulder Straps Button-down straps on the shoulders are a trench tell, a vestige from the style’s military heyday.\n2. Double Breasted Most traditional trenches are double-breasted, a feature originally designed to provide maximum warmth.\n3. Belt Whether you prefer to style it tied in front, buckled, open, or knotted in the back, the belt is one of the hallmarks of the classic trench.\nDON’T SIGH OVER SIZING // Finding the right one for you needn’t be stressful. A few tips \nSO YOU’VE decided to invest in a trench—what next? Whether you’re after the ladylike Audrey Hepburn “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” effect or a seductive Catherine Deneuve, “Belle de Jour” moment, finding the right match for your needs is key. The good news? These wardrobe workhorses tend to be one-size-fits-most—tailoring is generally not necessary—and can look fine even on the loose side. Said designer Michael Kors, “Softer fabrics and less structure make oversize trenches more user-friendly for almost any shape or height.” \nAs for length, trenches range from fingertip-short to ankle-grazing long. While shorter women might try on longer styles with trepidation, designer Serafina Sama of Isa Arfen urges an open mind: “Personally I find longer hemlines to be most flattering, because I think they’re more elongating,” she said. “Generally there is this preconception that if somebody’s short she should do a shorter hemline, but I think a longer hemline looks very chic on somebody shorter too.” For other tastes, shorter can look breezier, more playful, more youthful.\nMs. Sama recommends that fuller-hipped women seek out something with a strong shoulder and a straighter silhouette. “I personally prefer [one] without a waist, without a belt if you don’t want to accentuate your hips further,” she said.\nRegarding color: Khaki, the classic hue, is a good investment. But feel free to branch out into chic navy, kid-proof black, summer white or something more irreverent: Plaid can easily be had. \nBEYOND THE BEIGE // Six Current Options—From Familiar to Newfangled—To Handle Spring’s Capricious Weather Photo: F.
