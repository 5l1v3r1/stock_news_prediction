Trump picked CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be the next secretary of state.\nThe moves followed Trump's abrupt announcement last week of a yet-to-be-arranged meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nshow chapters Trump: Proud to nominate Mike Pompeo at State Department 6 Hours Ago | 01:53 But the prospects for any diplomatic breakthrough are clouded by senior State Department vacancies, including a permanent U.S. ambassador to South Korea. The Trump administration has also yet to fill other positions critical to any talks with North Korea, including a permanent undersecretary for arms control and international security affairs, as well as a permanent assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\nDozens of other key diplomatic jobs remain unfilled, including ambassadors to key U.S. allies such as Germany, Australia and Saudi Arabia.\nMore than two dozen ambassador posts are waiting for nominations to be put forward; nominees for more than a dozen others are waiting for confirmation.\nThe vacancies have strained ties with key U.S. allies. On Tuesday, Germany's Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Roth tweeted that Tillerson's firing won't help.\n\"The dismissal of Rex #Tillerson does not make anything better,\" Roth said in a tweet.\nRoth tweet\nTillerson's departure also adds to ongoing uncertainty about Trump's promised reorganization of the State Department. Last fall, the senior official charged with overseeing that effort stepped down after less than four months on the job amid widespread criticism from current and former American diplomats.\nRumors about friction between Trump and Tillerson began circulating last year. In October, NBC News reported that Tillerson called the president a \"moron,\" something Tillerson never directly denied. Tillerson continued to insist his relationship with the president was solid and brushed off rumors of strain between them.\nHis departure is just the latest in a high-velocity revolving door that has dogged the Trump administration. Last week chief White House economic advisor Gary Cohn resigned after a heated dispute over Trump's announcement of steep steel and aluminum tariffs, a move Cohn opposed.\nWATCH: Tillerson 'classy and pointed' in State Dept. speech\nshow chapters Rex Tillerson both 'classy and pointed' in State Department speech, says CNBC's John Harwood 1 Hour Ago | 03:24", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T20:15:13.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
