REUTERS/Issei Kato Barnaby Joyce, who was pressured to quit by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over the sex scandal, told Fairfax Media that the identity of the biological father was“a grey area”, but that it made no difference to his feelings.\n“It’s mine, on the record, there it is,” Joyce was Quote: d as saying in a story published late on Saturday.\n“And can I say, even if it wasn’t, I wouldn’t care, I’d still go through this, I’d still love him.”\nThe revelation is the latest twist in a long-running saga that pitted the National Party, the junior partner in Australia’s coalition government against its senior ally, the Liberal Party.\nThe coalition holds a one-seat majority in parliament, rendering the decades-old conservative alliance vulnerable to any instability.\nJoyce had initially resisted pressure from Turnbull to quit, but resigned as leader of the Nationals in February after a new allegation of sexual harassment emerged. He was replaced by Michael McCormack as leader in a party-room ballot and now sits on the backbench.\nReporting by Alison Bevege; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-04T07:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T08:13:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
