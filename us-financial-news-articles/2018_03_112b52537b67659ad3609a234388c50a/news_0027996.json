Only Russia pumps more, at almost 11 million bpd.\n\"It seems only a matter of time before the U.S. becomes the biggest oil producer in the world,\" Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at Dutch bank ABN Amro, said in a note to investors.\nUnlike Middle East producers, where output is largely dictated by state-owned oil companies, U.S. producers drill and sell purely based on economics. If prices remain at current levels or rise further, U.S. drillers are profitable and will raise output; if prices stumble, U.S. production will fall.\n\"The correlation between the U.S. oil production and the oil prices will remain considerable,\" van Cleef said.\nAs much as production, oil prices will also depend on demand.\nHere, there are signs of a slowdown, although much of this could be seasonal as the northern hemisphere winter ends.\n(additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T01:43:30.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
