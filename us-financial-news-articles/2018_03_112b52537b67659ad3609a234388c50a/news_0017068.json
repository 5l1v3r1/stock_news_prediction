The number of debt collection reports was due in part to complaints submitted by a data contributor who collects them via a mobile app, the FTC said.\nIdentity theft represented the second biggest complaint category, with nearly 14% of all reports.

Consumers reported they lost more money to imposter scams — $328 million in all — than any other type of fraud, the report showed.\nMilitary consumers reported losing the most to imposter scams, with $16 million in all.\n\"While we received fewer overall complaints in 2017, consumers reported losing more money to fraud than they did the year before,\" Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement issued with the data. \"This underscores the importance of the FTC's work in educating consumers and cracking down on the scammers who try to take their money.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T18:57:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
