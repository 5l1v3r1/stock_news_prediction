The audit of the consolidated financial statements has been completed. The auditors’ report is currently being prepared.\nRevenue: continued growth of JAZZ®\nIn 2017, Implanet had sales of €7.8 million. Sales of JAZZ ® , Implanet’s core business, rose to €4.7 million and now contributes 60% of total revenue (vs. 52% in 2016). This performance reflects the faster pace of Implanet’s expansion both in France (16%) and in international markets, as it moved into new markets such as Germany, Europe’s top spinal surgery market, Australia and South America.\nThe Knee business recorded a 16% decline since the distribution of arthroscopy implants was halted, as planned in early 2017. Sales of our total knee prosthesis (Implanet’s product) remained however flat.\nOngoing operating expense control\nImplanet kept a tight grip on its operating expenses, which were 11% lower than in 2016. The main improvements were in general and administrative expenses, regulatory affairs and operating costs. This helped drive a 16% reduction in the recurring operating loss to €5.8 million in the 2017 financial year (vs. €6.9 million in 2016) and a 9% reduction in the operating loss to €6.2 million (vs. €6.9 million in 2016).\nIn 2017, Implanet’s net financial result recorded a 9% improvement, owing in particular to the reduction in financing costs.\nTaking these factors into account, Implanet’s net result improved by 9% to reach €6.6 million (vs. €7.3 million in FY 2016).\nCash and cash equivalents\nIn 2017, Implanet reduced its cash burn by 19% to €5.2 million, from €6.5 million in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Implanet had €4.0 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nOn December 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had redeemed the 2013 bond issue to Kreos Capital IV (UK) Ltd. As a result, since the repayment in full (principal and interest) of this €1.1 million was completed in 2017, cash burn is expected to decline by the same amount in 2018.\nPost-closing event : on March 8, 2018, Implant announced that it had arranged a bond financing line (the “OCA”) under which it can raise up to a maximum of €5.0 million. The new funding provided by the European Select Growth Opportunities Fund is intended to finance the commercial development of JAZZ® worldwide, including under the distribution agreements now finalized with L&K BIOMED. This new bond line supersedes and replaces the €1.9 million outstanding under the previous financing line.\nSignificant advances and highlights of 2017\nImplanet achieved key milestones in the fundamental pillars of its strategy, demonstrating the successful ramp-up in JAZZ®, the priority area of development.\nInnovation and regulatory affairs: sustained pace of new product launches\nmarketing clearance and launch (FDA and CE mark) of four innovations: JAZZ Frame®, JAZZ Standalone®, the new JAZZ® braid and JAZZ Passer System®; award of patents strengthening JAZZ®’s intellectual property, 3 new patents awarded in 2017, increasing the total to 24.\nBusiness development: acceleration of international expansion\n144 surgeons using JAZZ® technology in France and the United States (vs. 127 at December 31, 2016); first direct sales in Germany (Europe’s largest spinal surgery market); exclusive distribution agreement with Device Technologies covering Australia and New Zealand.\nClinical development: recognition of JAZZ®’s medical value in the US\npresentation at the SRS conference of the White Paper entitled “How to optimize axial correction without altering thoracic sagittal alignment in hybrid constructs with sublaminar bands: description of the frame technique” presenting results of clinical analyses based on 3D radiological reconstruction; presentation of encouraging results for JAZZ® at the NASS (North American Spine Society) Annual Meeting in the United States targeting unmet in complex spinal deformity surgery.\nFinancing: expansion of the United States shareholder base\nimprovement in financing terms of the convertible bond financing raised from the European Select Growth Opportunities Fund, with the removal of the dilution linked to the share subscription warrants; €1.75 million increase in capital through the issue of shares to US institutional investors; redemption of €5 million financing arranged in 2013 with Kreos Capital, completion and withdrawal of the pledge of the business and intellectual property provided as collateral for this financing.\nPartnership with L&K BIOMED finalized: significant acceleration in international expansion of the JAZZ® platform\nin the United States: Implanet America is pooling its resources with those of Aegis Spine to accelerate commercialization of its JAZZ® platform; in Asia and Oceania: L&K BIOMED will distribute the JAZZ® platform alongside its existing product range; in Europe : Implanet will distribute L&K BIOMED’s products, which complement the JAZZ® platform, in France, the United Kingdom and Germany.\nOutlook\nImplanet will continue to expand its spine business in 2018 thanks to its partnership with L&K BIOMED and the ramp-up of its JAZZ ® platform.\nNext financial press release : Q1 2018 revenue on April 23, 2018.\nAbout IMPLANET\nFounded in 2007, IMPLANET is a medical technology company that manufactures high-quality implants for orthopedic surgery.
