Similar packages were found at mail processing facilities for the Central Intelligence Agency and White House, the source said.\nAuthorities have already said publicly that packages were found at Fort McNair in the District of Columbia and Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Virginia, both U.S. Army installations.\nNBC News said another was found at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, a Navy and Air Force facility, in the U.S. capital on Tuesday. The suspect sent 12 packages in all, and investigators expected more to arrive on Tuesday, it said.\nThe package delivered to Fort McNair prompted officials to evacuate the building. An Army bomb squad confirmed that the package had tested positive for explosive residue and determined a fuse was attached, a base spokesman has said.\nA Fort Belvoir spokesman said its package had been rendered safe.\nThe incident occurred the same month as Austin, Texas, was left on edge by a bombing spree that killed two people before the accused bomber blew himself up as police closed in.
