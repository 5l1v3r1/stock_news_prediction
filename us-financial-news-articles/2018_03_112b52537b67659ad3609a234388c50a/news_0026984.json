About 60% of participating merchants, which had at least $100,000 in annual revenue, said they are “willing” to accept Bitcoin as payment.\n“This result is surprising, especially amid Bitcoin’s elevated volatility,” wrote Instinet analyst Dan Dolev.\nShares of the company helmed by Jack Dorsey have become increasingly tied to Bitcoin in recent months, after it began allowing most users to buy and sell Bitcoin through its Cash app .\nStill, while Square jumped on news of increased U.S. Bitcoin acceptance among merchants, the cryptocurrency itself took a beating. On the same day, Google would ban cryptocurrency and initial coin offering ads, while the IMF called for increased regulation. That helped push the price of Bitcoin down to $8,400; Ethereum to $695; and Ripple to 79 cents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T22:59:00.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
