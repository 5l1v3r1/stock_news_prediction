Any changed regulation will not be finalized until next year.\nCalifornia's emissions rules are followed by a dozen states including New York and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia that account for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.\nOther automakers also have been holding meetings with regulators in recent weeks as have environmental groups as others. A meeting is planned this week between EPA officials and Ford Motor Co's top environment and safety officer, officials said.\nThe EPA is expected to announce by April the existing 2022-2025 requirements are \"not appropriate,\" but it is unclear precisely when EPA and the Transportation Department will unveil proposed reductions in the requirements.\nTwo administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing reductions in the requirements or new flexibilities for automakers remained in flux. EPA officials suggested a proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier unveiling of a proposal, automakers say.\nIn June, New York states attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules.\nThe Obama administration sought to \"lock in\" the rules by announcing in January 2017 the completion of a \"midterm review\" to determine the feasibility of the 2022-2025 model year rules ahead of an April 1, 2018 deadline.\nIn March 2017, Trump announced he would reopen that review and suggested he would soften the mandates. \"The assault on the American auto industry is over,\" he told autoworkers in Michigan.
