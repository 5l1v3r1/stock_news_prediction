An out of sorts Cuevas failed to convert any of his three break points against the Italian, who set up a final showdown with world number 73 Nicolas Jarry. Fognini was particularly dominant on his serve and will head into Sunday’s final seeking his sixth ATP title and his first since triumphing in Gstaad last July. Chilean Jarry reached his first ATP final by overcoming Argentina’s Horacio Zeballos 6-7(5) 6-4 6-4.
