Ingraham has since apologized tweeting, “Any student should be proud of a 4.2 GPA —incl. @DavidHogg111. On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland.

I will only accept your apology only if you denounce the way your network has treated my friends and I️ in this fight.
