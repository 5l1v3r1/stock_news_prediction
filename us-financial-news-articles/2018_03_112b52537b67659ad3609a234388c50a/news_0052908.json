It suspended one newspaper, The Edge, in 2015 and blocked other websites for publishing stories critical of Najib’s role.\nA deputy minister was Quote: d in Malaysian media last week as saying that any news on 1MDB that had not been verified by the government was “fake”.\nGovernments elsewhere in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and the Philippines, have proposed laws aimed at clamping down on the spread of “fake news”, moves decried by media rights advocates.\n$1 = 3.9020 ringgit Reporting by Rozanna Latiff Editing by Praveen Menon and Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:52:54.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
