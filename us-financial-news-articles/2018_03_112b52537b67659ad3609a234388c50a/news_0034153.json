Lots of news today.\nYesterday, Michael Ferro, chairman of newspaper publisher Tronc, announced his retirement . A Tronc news release said he was departing after negotiating the $500 million sale of the L.A. Times. Although he stepped down from his role, Ferro will still be paid $5 million-per-year by Tronc through Dec. 31, 2020, to serve as a consultant.\nSome people on Twitter were skeptical about the sudden retirement, asking “What’s the rest of the story?”\nHours later, my colleagues Kristen Bellstrom and Beth Kowitt published a bombshell story detailing the accounts of two women who say Ferro made unwanted physical advances toward them, including groping and an unwelcome kiss. The women — The Muse CEO and co-founder Kathryn Minshew and former Ingersoll Rand executive Hagan Kappler — spoke on the record.\nBellstrom and Kowitt raise a good point in the story — both women’s stories unfold where so much of business and deal-making takes place: that murky area outside the 9-to-5. This includes late-night dinners and after-work drinks. “It is an arena that is more difficult to navigate, more complicated, and has fewer rules—and one that, for decades, largely excluded women,” they write. From the story:\nThese venues and networks are gradually becoming more inclusive, but while women are now venturing into the rooms where alliances are struck and money is promised, that doesn’t mean they stand on equal ground. Women who infiltrate the old boys network must often weigh a set of questions that would never occur to their male counterparts: How do I respond to that suggestive remark? Could he think this is a date? Does this man really believe in my business—or does he just want to have sex with me?\nThese are some important points to think about.

The startup provides a cloud-based records management system for incident logging, and it currently works with 13 public safety agencies across the U.S. CEO Scott Crouch said the company will use the funding for international expansion. The round was led by General Catalyst and Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, who were joined by existing investors Spark Capital, Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures, Bezos Expeditions, Goldman Sachs, and General David Petraeus.

Its assets and employees are going to private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners, but the deal also nullifies all the non-disclosure agreements that Harvey Weinstein made his accusers sign when he settled with them. In other words, this opens up the possibility that more of his victims could come forward. “No one should be afraid to speak out or coerced to stay quiet,” according to a statement. “The Company thanks the courageous individuals who have already come forward. Your voices have inspired a movement for change across the country and around the world.” Read more here.\nAdvertisement THE LATEST FROM FORTUNE...\n• Bumble Escalates Tinder Rivalry With Biting Response to Patent Lawsuit (by Hallie Detrick)\n• How Innovative Health Entrepreneurs Are Using Big Data (by Erika Fry)\n• Commentary: How Silicon Valley Can Help Fix Our Health Care System (by Lloyd B.
