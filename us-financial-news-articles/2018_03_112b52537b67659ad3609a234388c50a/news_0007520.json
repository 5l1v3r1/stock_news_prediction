Boeing was down 3.5 percent and Caterpillar was down 3.4 percent.\nThe declines put the market on track for a third straight day of losses and the S&P 500 back into negative territory for the year. The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX jumped to a more than two-week high.\n“It’s been tenuous for the last month, so anything that even looks or smells like it’s not good is going to bring the market down quickly. But this is more than that. It’s going to raise prices no matter what,” said Peter Costa, president at Empire Executions Inc in New York.\nRising inflation and bond yields were the main concerns as Wall Street ended a turbulent February on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 .SPX posting its first monthly loss in 11 months.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 542.91 points, or 2.17 percent, to 24,486.29, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 48.58 points, or 1.79 percent, to 2,665.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 122.38 points, or 1.68 percent, to 7,150.63.\nThe S&P 500 was trading just above its 100-day moving average. The index closed below its 50-day moving average on Wednesday.\nStocks had mostly traded lower before Trump’s announcement.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell tried to temper remarks he made on Tuesday that raised concerns about the potential for four interest rate hikes this year rather than the Fed’s forecast of three, but New York Fed President William Dudley was a bit more pointed and said four rate hikes would be “gradual”.\nBut it was the tariff issue that was spinning the market lower as the afternoon wore on.\n“The risk to imparting these tariffs is that it invites a retaliatory response from our trading partners and particularly China,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 23 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 39 new highs and 99 new lows.\nAdditional reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:24:59.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
