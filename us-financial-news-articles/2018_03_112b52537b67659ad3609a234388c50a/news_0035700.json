Core elements of that are atypical brainstorming experiences that we call labs. We are proud to feature such organic installations at InfoComm 2018.\"\nC2 will bring several of its most engaging labs to InfoComm 2018 in Las Vegas, encouraging attendees to connect with big ideas and collaborate in new ways. C2 labs combine technology, immersiveness, and networking into a series of unique, facilitated encounters.\n\"The introduction of C2 experiences to the InfoComm 2018 show floor complements nicely other AVIXA initiatives, like the TIDE Conference (Technology. Innovation. Design. Experience.), which returns to InfoComm this year, and the launch of our Integrated Life program,\" said Jason McGraw, CTS, AVIXA Senior Vice President of Expositions. \"The AV industry continues to grow and evolve faster than any of us could imagine. We are dedicated to introducing new content and experiences that help grow our industry and start fresh, new conversations among creative professionals who use AV solutions to drive outcomes.\"\nRegistration for InfoComm 2018 is now open at www.infocommshow.org .
