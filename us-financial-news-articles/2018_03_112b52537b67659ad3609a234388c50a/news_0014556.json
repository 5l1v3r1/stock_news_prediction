Drivers will still be present in the trucks to take over if needed. In late 2017, Waymo said it would begin a pilot ride-hailing service in Phoenix, Arizona , using Chrysler Pacifica minivans with no driver behind the wheel. \nWaymo is a subsidiary of Alphabet and began as a project within Google.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T17:21:39.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
