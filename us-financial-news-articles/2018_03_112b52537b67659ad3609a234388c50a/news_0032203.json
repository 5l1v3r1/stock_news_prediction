Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain gravely ill after being found slumped on a park bench in the English city of Salisbury earlier this month. The U.S., France and Germany have joined the U.K. in blaming Moscow for the attack, which also injured a police officer. \nIn a statement, Britain’s Foreign Office said its information indicates that Russia has been producing and stockpiling Novichok “within the last decade” as part of a program to develop ways of using nerve agents in assassinations, in a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It didn’t elaborate on the nature of its intelligence or where it came from. Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, on Sunday said Russia had nothing to do with the events in Salisbury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T22:54:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
