St. Louis was so punchless that it couldn’t even generate any pressure after icing a sixth attacker for most of the final two minutes.\nGoalie Jake Allen played a good game for St. Louis and made 34 saves, but it wasn’t enough to give the Blues their second victory since Feb. 9. The Blues were in contention for the Central Division title at that point but have fallen all the way to sixth place and are presently out of the playoff picture.\nEntering the game with eight losses in nine contests, St. Louis got another helping of bad news during the morning skate. Scheduled starting goalie Carter Hutton injured his neck and had to be scratched in favor of the struggling Allen.\nAllen responded well to the last-minute call to start, standing up under steady San Jose pressure. He calmed the waters in the first 5 1/2 minutes, stoning Boedker’s backhander from the right circle to deny the Sharks an early goal.\nAllen kept his team in the game, but the Blues just couldn’t generate any pressure on Jones. They managed only four shots in the first period, and even though they stepped up the offense somewhat with 10 attempts on net in the second period, didn’t produce enough Grade A chances. It cost them in the end.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:02:12.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
