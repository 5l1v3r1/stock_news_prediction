According to Mike Khouw of Optimize Advisors, the move could be higher. \n\"Micron is a name that typically moves a decent amount on earnings, around 6 percent, but it's implying a larger move than that this time,\" Khouw said Wednesday on CNBC's \" Fast Money .\" \nKhouw noted there was a surge in bullish trading activity for the chip stock with call options quadrupling that of puts . A number of traders also bought the March weekly 63 calls for an average price of $1.50 per contract. These are bullish bets the stock will close the week above $64.50, or roughly 9 percent higher than where the stock is currently trading. Khouw noted some investors also bet on longer-term call spreads for Micron, which imply the stock could rally above $65 next month. \nShares of Micron have surged more than 48 percent since January and over 134 percent in the last 12 months. Also worth noting: 25 of the 31 FactSet-listed analysts rate the stock as a buy, with an average price target of $67.85. That would imply a 13 percent rally from current levels. \nLast month, Micron raised its earnings and revenue guidance for the second quarter resulting in a near 8 percent gain on the day. \nMicron was trading at $58.73 on Thursday morning, down 2.3 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T18:04:11.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
