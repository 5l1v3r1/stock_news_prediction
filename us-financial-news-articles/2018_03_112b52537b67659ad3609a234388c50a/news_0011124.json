Predators goalie Pekka Rinne stopped 34 shots for the win, his team’s season-high sixth consecutive victory, and was perfect after the Oilers staked themselves to a 2-0 first period lead.\nConnor McDavid opened the scoring at 11:01 of the first period with his 29th goal of the season and 14th in the last 15 games. McDavid got away with one when he slashed the stick out of the hands of Predators defenseman Mattias Ekholm a few moments before getting the puck in the slot then deking Rinne and depositing the puck in the cage.\nLeon Draisaitl doubled the lead with just 52.2 seconds remaining in the opening frame. Draisaitl took the feed at the blueline as the Oilers rushed into the zone and from the left face-off dot ripped a top-corner shot. It was Edmonton’s first power-play goal in 12 games, having failed to score on 19 chances over 11 outings.\nHowever, the Central Division-leading Preds drew even by the second intermission with Scott Hartnell putting the Predators on the board at 16:28 of the second period. A pair of Oilers, Andrej Sekera and Ryan Strome, were guilty of making soft passes in their own zone and soon after Nick Bonino set up Hartnell for his 12th marker of the campaign.\nThen Arvidsson scored with 9.2 seconds remaining in the middle frame to tie the affair 2-2. A poor decision by Oilers defenseman Ethan Bear at the offensive blueline in his NHL debut proved costly, as Arvidsson converted on a two-on-one rush with Forsberg.\nCam Talbot made 38 saves for the Oilers, who have lost 12 straight games against the Predators.\nThe win was record-breaking for Nashville general manager David Poile. It’s the 1,320th win his team has collected as GM, most in league history, moving him ahead of the mark set by former Oilers and New York Rangers GM Glen Sather.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:05:50.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
