REUTERS/Akhtar Soomro Karachi’s population has skyrocketed to nearly 17 million people in 2017 from an estimated 400,000 at independence, and every inch of the city has become a valuable commodity for developers building homes or drafting plans to alter the city’s skyline with new skyscrapers.\nJahangir Kothari Parade promenade, once an imposing British heritage site, is now obscured by a maze of overpasses and the shadow of Pakistan’s tallest building.\nSlideshow (18 Images) The promenade is part of a handful of buildings, along with the colonial-era Imperial Customs House, which have been restored to their former grandeur, but such projects are rare when the focus is on tearing down old and building new.\nRapid urbanization has ensured large-scale destruction, particularly in the old city areas, where more profitable multi-story residential buildings have sprung up.\nBut amid the new concrete, remnants of the colonial legacy can still be seen, often recognizable by their state of neglect.\nThe Saddar neighborhood of Karachi has perhaps the largest concentration of British architectural history, while in the city’s eastern district, the iconic old colonial jail has been declared a heritage site by Sindh province’s antiquities department.\nSo far more than 1,700 premises have been listed as heritage sites by the antiquities department and the process continues.\nThe Sindh Cultural Heritage Preservation Act, introduced in 1994, has helped provide legal protection for structures of historical significance. But courts are also busy with cases of developers trying to circumvent such protection.\nEditing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T10:27:45.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
