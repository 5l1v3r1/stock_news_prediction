See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results\" elsewhere in this earnings release.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nNet revenues were $140.8 million, compared with $108.5 million for 2016.

The case remains under investigation. The police have published a report rejecting as rumors certain allegations against RYB that had circulated on internet. Nonetheless, in the wake of the Xintiandi incident, the Company has redoubled its efforts to raise quality standards on the security and safety of its facilities and the management of its faculty and staff. The Company has taken steps to implement more stringent teacher recruitment requirements, by, among other things, improving teacher training, raising teacher compensation, and more closely monitoring and providing support to its staff. In addition, the Company has taken measures to improve its security monitoring and management system. The Company has invited parents to participate in open classes and other efforts aiming to make its facilities more safe and transparent. While the aforementioned actions are expected to increase the Company's operating costs in the near term, they are also expected to help set a strong foundation for a stable high-quality teaching team; create a warm, secure and harmonious environment for its students and their parents and enable the Company to continue delivering high-quality education. These efforts are also expected to help build long-term growth prospects and sustain healthy financial performance.\nAbout RYB Education, Inc.\nFounded on the core values of ''Care'' and ''Responsibility,'' RYB Education, Inc. is a leading early childhood education service provider in China.
