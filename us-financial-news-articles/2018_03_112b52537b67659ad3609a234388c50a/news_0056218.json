Suzuki will supply its Baleno hatchback and Vitara Brezza compact SUV to Toyota, while Toyota will produce the Corolla sedan for Suzuki.\nToyota and Suzuki will produce the models for each other as original equipment manufacturers, and these will be included into each othersâ€™ branded offerings, the companies said.\nThe agreement deepens a partnership announced by the two Japanese automakers a year ago, under which they will share expertise on new technologies and parts supply. In November, Toyota and Suzuki said they would cooperate in selling electric cars in India from around 2020.\nReporting by Naomi Tajitsu; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:50:05.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
