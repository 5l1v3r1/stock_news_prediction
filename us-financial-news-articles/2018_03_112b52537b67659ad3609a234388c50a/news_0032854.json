It's a maximum-security facility where he has witnessed violence and has become concerned about his personal safety. \nMatsumoto asked Brafman at the sentencing if he planned to request that she void her finding that Shkreli represented a public danger. Brafman said he would be doing so. \nIf Shkreli does not win such a request, he risks going to tougher prison, such as the high-security facility at Canaan, which houses nearly 1,500 inmates. The prison has had four slayings since 2010, with victims including a prison guard and a Mafia associate who was stabbed 92 times. \nThe high-security facility was also the scene of an outbreak of salmonella that sickened 300 or so inmates who had eaten tainted chicken. \nBrafman did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday from CNBC. \nShkreli was convicted in August of several scams related to two hedge funds he ran, and a pharmaceuticals company he founded, Retrophin . \nShkreli repeatedly lied to investors in the funds about the strategy, oversight and performance of those funds. \nAnd then he used stock shares and cash in Retrophin to more than pay back the investors the money they had lost with his funds. He also manipulated Retrophin's stock illegally, a jury found. \nShkreli cried Friday in Brooklyn federal court as he asked Matsumoto not to give him a harsh prison sentence. \n\"The one person to blame for me being here today is me,\" Shkreli sobbed. \"Not the government. There is no conspiracy to take down Martin Shkreli.\" \n\"I took down Martin Shkreli with my disgraceful and shameful actions.\" \n\"This is my fault. I am no victim here,\" he said. \nIn issuing her sentence of seven years, Matsumoto effectively split the difference between the minimum 15 years that prosecutors wanted and the maximum 18 months requested by defense lawyers. \nWith credit for time served, as well as for good behavior in prison, Shkreli could be released in less than 5Â½ years. \nMatsumoto also has ordered that Shkreli forfeit nearly $7.4 million to the federal government and pay a $75,000 fine. \nTo secure the forfeiture amount, Matsumoto ordered Shkreli to give up his ownership rights to a group of assets that include $5 million in cash in an E-Trade brokerage account that previously had secured his release bond; his stake in the drug company Vyera Pharmaceuticals; the one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album \"Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\"; the Lil' Wayne album \"The Carter V\"; and a painting by Pablo Picasso. \nPrivately held Vyera was originally known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, which Shkreli founded in 2015. He gained notoriety that year for using Turing to buy the rights to the anti-parasite drug Daraprim, whose price he promptly hiked by more than 5,000 percent. \nThe crimes that Shkreli later was charged with were not related to his tenure at Turing. \nShkreli plans to appeal his conviction.
