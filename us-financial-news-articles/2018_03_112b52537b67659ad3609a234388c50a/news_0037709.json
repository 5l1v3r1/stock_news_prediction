The Trump administration has signaled that it's evaluating the accessibility of that option. A more open path to bankruptcy for student borrowers could also help the debt collectors , experts say. CNBC.com Getty Images \nDenise Sparks graduated from college in 1995 with $30,000 in debt. Then her life turned challenging. \nFirst, there was the divorce from her husband, which left her to raise two children on her own. Then she fell ill and had multiple operations. Along the way, a psychiatrist diagnosed her with depression, bipolar and post-traumatic stress disorder. \nShe often missed work and didn't have enough money to send in her student loan payments. Today her debt, with interest, penalties and fees, is more than $230,000. \n\"I can't plan for retirement,\" Sparks, 53, said. \"I'll die before this could ever get paid back.\" \nSparks reached out to a number of lawyers where she lives in Phoenix about filing for bankruptcy, but to no avail. \n\"One attorney just cut me off,\" she said. \"He didn't want anything to do with it.\" Source: Warren Clabuesch Denise Sparks in her home in Phoenix, Arizona. \nThat's likely in part because federal laws don't allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove that the debt poses an \"undue hardship.\" That term may sound relatively benign, but legally it's a high bar to meet: Borrowers often must exhibit a \" certainty of hopelessness .\" \nA recent development has made Sparks feel a little less hopeless. \nShe discovered, thanks to a post in a Facebook group, Student Loan Justice , that the Education Department was requesting public feedback on whether it's too difficult for Americans to erase their student debt in bankruptcy, signaling it may consider making the process easier.
