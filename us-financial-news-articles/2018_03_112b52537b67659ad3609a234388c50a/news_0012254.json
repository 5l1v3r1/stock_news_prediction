It also noted a “positive M&A read” to packaging peers DS Smith and Mondi.\nThe two groups, listed in London, rose 5.6 and 2.3 percent respectively and were among the session’s top gainers.\nTesting company Intertek Group also gained, closing up 4.6 percent after its results.\nHowever, Just Eat spooked investors by announcing an extra 50 million pounds of investments to stay ahead of food delivery rivals. Its shares sank 12.6 percent, their worst day in nearly three years.\n“If we were honest we did not expect a figure for total investment for 2018 to the magnitude of 50 million pounds,” Berenberg analysts said.\nThe sharp market reaction reflected “shock and concern that the move may in fact represent an admission that competition is intensifying for Just Eat”, said Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf.\nAnother loser was industrial equipment rental company Ashtead Group whose shares were down 5.5 percent after it released third quarter results.\nMeanwhile shares in Tesco gained 3.4 percent after data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel showed it was jointly the fastest growing of Britain’s big four supermarket groups alongside Morrisons.\nBroad-based strength in mining and energy stocks supported the FTSE 100 as commodity prices firmed.\nThe FTSE 250 gained 0.6 percent but some mid-cap stocks suffered falls after publishing results.\nRotork shares tumbled 7.6 percent after the industrial machinery firm’s earnings disappointed. The world’s largest temporary power provider Aggreko also fell 3.9 percent after results.
