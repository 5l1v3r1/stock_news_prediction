That puts the United States ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia pumps out more, at 11 million bpd.\nIn China, Shanghai crude oil futures opened Thursday's morning session down nearly 2 percent, pushing the new market near to parity with U.S. prices, before closing at 409.7 yuan ($65.18) per barrel at 0700 GMT.\nThe latest drop takes the fall since the contract's launch on Monday to 10 percent.\nDespite high volatility and lingering scepticism about Shanghai's trading hours, along with doubts about the process for physical delivery of crude under contract, most analysts expect the contract to establish itself as a third global oil price benchmark next to Brent and WTI.\nGoldman Sachs said in a note to clients that there was \"finally, an exchange traded price for Chinese crude oil.\"\nShanghai's \"start of trading was relatively successful (as)...it is the first onshore Chinese commodity contract that allows direct trading by foreign investors and is denominated in RMB (yuan), indirectly promoting the use of the Chinese currency,\" Goldman said.\nThe U.S. bank said Shanghai crude futures represented 3 percent of combined WTI and Brent trading volumes since its launch on March 26.
