Photo: friedemann vogel/EPA/Shutterstock In recent sessions, though, pushback to the planned tariffs from some senior Republicans has helped soothe investors’ nerves, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying Tuesday that the White House should take a “more surgical or more targeted” approach to trade policy.\n“Our view is that it’s going to be really difficult to institute this kind of steel tax in perpetuity without some adjustments,” said Jeff Mills, co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Services Group, who is advising clients not to alter their portfolios at this stage in light of trade developments.\nStill, investors are keeping in mind the impact of trade tariffs, as well as ongoing worries about inflation, said Kate Warne, investment strategist for Edward Jones.\n“I think tariffs will continue to be an issue for investors going forward because the major impact isn’t just what the U.S. does,” she said. The rest of the world’s response to U.S. tariffs is also something to think about, she added.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9 points, or less than 0.1%, to 24884, recouping losses after declining more than 150 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6%.\nGains were broad, with nine of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 posting advances for the day.\nShares of consumer discretionary companies rose 0.7% in the S&P 500, with Leggett & Platt rising 3.6% and Netflix rising 3.2%.\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 utilities sector fell 1.4%, among the biggest decliners in the broad index. Shares of FirstEnergy lost 2.4%, posting the steepest one-day percentage loss within the sector.\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 closed up 0.1% and Germany’s export-heavy DAX added 0.2%, lifted by gains in shares of auto makers.\nStocks and bonds in Italy rallied, with the benchmark FTSE MIB closing up 1.8%, more than reversing Monday’s decline.\nItaly entered a fresh period of political instability after weekend national elections boosted populists but failed to produce a winner with enough support to patch together a parliamentary majority.\n“It’s almost the worst outcome for markets that we could envisage: a long period of uncertainty ahead, and it’s hard to see how a stable government can be formed,” said Richard Turnill, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist.\nStill, there is limited scope for the results to spill over into other European assets, and investors are already very familiar with Italian political uncertainty, he said.\nIn Asian trading, shares of export-oriented companies climbed as trade tensions eased.\nHong Kong stocks led gains in Asia, with the Hang Seng Index up 2.1% after Monday’s 2.3% slide, led by index heavyweight Tencent and shares of banks that had fallen in the previous session.\nJapan’s Nikkei Stock Average was up as much as 2.4% before giving up some of the gains as Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda again touched on an eventual exit from the bank’s ultra-easy monetary policy. The Nikkei still ended up 1.8%, snapping a four-day losing streak.\nThe South Korean won rose 1.3% against the dollar after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting South Korean delegation that he was willing to hold talks with the U.S. about giving up nuclear weapons and normalizing relations with Washington, and would halt weapons tests during any negotiations, officials in Seoul said.\nSouth Korea’s Kospi Composite Index rose 1.5%, snapping a four-day losing streak.\n—Ese Erheriene contributed to this article.\nWrite to Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com and Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T03:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T03:24:36.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
