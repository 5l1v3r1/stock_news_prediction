Each member of the Class of 2018 is profiled in the March issue of the magazine at ProBuilder.com .\nIn her role as Vice President of Marketing, Eltringham applies her understanding of NEW HOME’s multi-dimensional housing markets, myriad of buyer profiles, design trends and other consumer demands across the company’s divisions in Southern California, Northern California and Arizona. While her day-to-day demands focus on strategically integrated, national award-winning marketing solutions – from traditional advertising and public relations to more cutting-edge interior merchandising and social media programs – her true passion lies in the development of communities that will enhance the lives of its future homebuyers.\nEltringham has more than 15 years of experience in the homebuilding industry and has served as President of the Greater Sales & Marketing Council (GSMC), Co-Chair of the Building Industry Association’s Next Generation Board of Directors and is a current executive member of the HomeAid Orange County Board of Directors and the Building Industry Association Board of Directors. She has been with NEW HOME since its inception in 2009. She has two young children and resides in Orange County with her husband.\nIn her eight years at NEW HOME, Andrews has overseen the purchasing and specifying of more than 50 projects. She currently manages more than 2,000 trade partner contracts exceeding $1 billion. She focuses on the selections and costs of model upgrades for dozens of current projects in Southern California and works closely with her options team and outside designers.\nAndrews recently worked with NEW HOME’s information technology team to implement an option software program called Design Studio Manager and she also spearheaded the launch of a Master Contracts program to help streamline relationships with trade partners which led to better efficiency and improved work flow.\nAfter starting in the homebuilding industry at the age of 21 as a designer, Andrews joined NEW HOME in March 2010 as Operations Coordinator. As the company started to grow, she received several promotions and in June of 2016, she was named Vice President of Purchasing. She resides in Orange County with her husband and two children.\n“Although Megan and Melanie are both clear leaders in their disciplines, they share a common desire to continue to learn and expand their horizons,” said NEW HOME Chief Executive Officer, H. Lawrence Webb. “Not only are they excelling in an industry traditionally dominated by men, but they are also constantly striving to improve in their respective fields. More importantly, they are always challenging others in our company to improve and grow. I love working with both women and am so proud that they have received this prestigious honor from Professional Builder.”\nAbout The New Home Company\nNEW HOME is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NWHM.” It is a new generation homebuilder focused on the design, construction and sale of innovative and consumer-driven homes in major metropolitan areas within select growth markets in California and Arizona, including coastal Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, metro Sacramento and Phoenix.
