The company has also been expanding its arsenal to genetic screenings for heart disease —including a new test announced Monday called the Hereditary Heart Health Test, which analyzes 30 genes that are among the biggest risk factors for eventual heart complications like abnormal cardiac rhythms that could turn deadly. \nAs both Giusti and Laraki highlighted, one of the biggest reasons genetic tests have become more popular is that they’ve plummeted in price. Once costing more than $5,000, companies like Color now offer their genomic services for around $250. \nThe ultimate hope is that a larger slice of the population will get their genes sequenced, too, whether to assist in drug research or alert them to possible health risks. But there are still some roadblocks. For instance, while 70 to 80-plus percent of many genetic testing firms’ customers consent to the use of their DNA data for research, the remaining 15% or 20% still have concerns about how that data will be utilized or how secure it is. And then there’s data hoarding, where this genetic information isn’t shared widely. “I belive [all that data should be liberated,” said Giusti. \nAs for the security concerns, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Vijay Pande says the issue is one of “information security in general.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": ["https://www.fortuneconferences.com/brainstorm-health-2018/2018-agenda-overview/"], "published": "2018-03-20T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T08:04:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
