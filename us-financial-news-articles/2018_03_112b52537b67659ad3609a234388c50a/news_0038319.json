As he has since 2014 , Warren Buffett offered $1 million every year for life to the person who could correctly predict the outcomes of all games through the Sweet 16 (this year the prize rose to $2 million if a Nebraska team took home the trophy).\nThere is a consolation prize though. The eight employees whose brackets stayed intact the longest will split $100,000. Sharing the prize this year are a diverse group representing the breadth of Berkshire Hathaway’s interests: Joseph Maciejko of General Reinsurance, Mike Bills of International Metalworking Companies, Keith Franks of Charter Brokerage, Kevin Hessel of the Nebraska Furniture Mart, Ed King of BNSF Railway, Adam Senese of Pampered Chef, Alexander Sorenson of Marmon Holdings, and Chad Yokoyama of BNSF.\nUMBC became the first-ever men's 16 seed to knock off a No. 1. They lost in the second round to Kansas State. Jared C. Tilton—Getty Images These weren’t the only eight brackets that busted on Friday night. The NCAA announced that the tens of millions of brackets submitted online through different websites were all broken when 16th-seeded University of Maryland-Baltimore County’s beat top-seeded Virginia.
