We can build up bigger stocks so that we are more flexible in production. It is a nightmare right now,” said board member Peter Schwarzenbauer.\nHonda’s European Government affairs manager, who told parliamentarians last year the Japanese carmaker would need to trigger its contingency plans this month, told Reuters the firm was awaiting further detail.\n“We are monitoring the situation as the negotiations unfold and look forward to receiving additional clarity at the March council,” said Patrick Keating.
