Some Democratic lawmakers from auto-producing states have praised Trump’s move, joining unions long skeptical of open trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA).\nAutomakers are reaching out to senators and governors and asking them to make the case against tariffs to the White House, officials said.\n“We have and will continue to do all we can to make these facts known to policymakers in the administration, on Capitol Hill, and in statehouses around the country,” said John Bozzella, president and chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and other automakers.\nManufacturers of metal-intensive products such as cars and airplanes already are wrestling with rising prices for steel and aluminum, in part because of tight production capacity.\nAdministration officials in TV interviews over the weekend downplayed the impact on automakers as adding only up to about $200 to the price of a vehicle — a fraction of the average $35,000 sales price. However, Goldman Sachs said in a research report on Sunday that the tariffs could depress General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co’s adjusted operating incomes by $1 billion each.\nGroups representing auto dealers weighed in to support the manufacturers. In a flattening auto market, headlines about trade wars and tariffs could cause Americans to put off buying new vehicles, said Cody Lusk, president and chief executive of the American International Automobile Dealers Association.\n“Everybody is reaching out to their allies on Capitol Hill just to make sure they are aware of what’s at stake,” Lusk said.\nFarm groups representing producers of wheat, corn and soybeans, the top U.S. crop exports valued at nearly $37 billion last year, joined criticism of the proposed tariffs on Monday. Farm groups had been among Trump’s core support group during the 2016 election.\nThe U.S. agriculture sector is worried that Trump will scrap key trade deals, including NAFTA, that benefit U.S. farmers. Grain buyers in Mexico, a top market for U.S. farm products, have accelerated corn purchases from Brazil amid concern that NAFTA negotiations could disrupt trade.
