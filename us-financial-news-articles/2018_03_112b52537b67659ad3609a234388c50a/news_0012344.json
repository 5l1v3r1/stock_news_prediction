She added that women must start supporting one another to achieve greater representation in their institutions.\nOne new initiative in Brussels strives to do just that. Launched this year, the Brussels Binder is a new online database of female policy experts.\nThe gender equality campaign group says the database should make it easier to find women speakers for conferences, putting pressure on organizers to do away with all-male panels.\nReporting by Samantha Koester; Editing by Alissa de Carbonnel and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T01:23:45.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
