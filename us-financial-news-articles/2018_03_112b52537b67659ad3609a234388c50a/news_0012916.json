Britain’s financial markets regulator on Friday placed Beaufort into insolvency amid concerns over its financial health and its alleged role in a U.S. criminal investigation into a more than $50 million stock fraud and laundering scheme. Administrators PwC also said in a statement they had ringfenced a further 50 million pounds in segregated client money accounts, cut Beaufort staff to 40 from 120 through redundancy and closed two offices. $1 = 0.7191 pounds Reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop, editing by Louise Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T15:20:10.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
