First, implement prudent monetary policy. Second, push forward financial reforms and opening up.\nThird, win the battle against financial risks,\" Yi said.\nChina's financial risks are reflected in its high leverage, Yi said, highlighting indebted state-owned enterprises, hidden local government debt and the relatively rapid growth in household leverage.\nA few \"rampantly expanding\" financial conglomerates also pose risks to the financial system, Yi said, without naming any.\nWhile safeguarding the bottom-line for the prevention of financial risks, China will step up credit support for weak links in the economy, including small firms and the rural sector.\nChina's economic performance in early 2018 has shown good momentum extending from last year, and the central bank will continue to implement prudent and neutral monetary policy, he said.\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept liquidity at a reasonable level, and has stabilised leverage.\n\"Monetary policy will not be too tight or too loose,\" Yi said, adding that growth in M2 money supply and total social financing — a broad measure of credit — will be at a reasonable pace this year.\nThe government hasn't set a target for M2 growth this year.\nThe central bank governor said he expects consumer inflation pressures to be mild this year, and that producer price increases will slow.\nThe Chinese yuan will be kept basically stable, Yi also said, reiterating PBOC's longstanding stance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T02:47:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
