Only this time, things are moving 15 times faster than they did in the mid-90s and early 2000s. \nHow similar are things, exactly? Since its creation, Bitcoin has seen four bear waves , where prices have dropped 45-50%, typically rebounding an average of 47% afterward. Nasdaq, starting in 2000, had five of those waves, averaging 44% declines, followed by 40% rebounds. \nTrading volume patterns are also eerily similar. \nOf course, as any broker will tell you, past performance is not indicative of future behavior. And while Nasdaq has rallied nicely from its low in 2002 (increasing six-fold), that’s no guarantee Bitcoin will do the same. \nBut try telling that to crypto enthusiasts.
