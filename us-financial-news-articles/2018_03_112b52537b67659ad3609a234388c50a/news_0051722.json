The company did not return calls from Reuters seeking further comment.\nThe copper smelter, run by Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper unit, is one of the India’s biggest and has been a target of protesters, who call it a major source of pollution and a risk to fisheries.\nThe plant was shut for more than two months in 2013 after residents complained about emissions. An environmental court later ruled the smelter could operate, but should take extra steps to prevent pollution.
