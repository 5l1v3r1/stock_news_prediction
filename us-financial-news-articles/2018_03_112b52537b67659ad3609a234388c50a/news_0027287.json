Our Company is in excellent financial shape, our growth strategy is clear and I feel confident about our strong positioning in the outdoor sporting goods niche. I am proud to have had the opportunity to lead this exceptional Company.”\nMr. Schaefer’s retirement represents the culmination of several years of transition planning. “We recruited Jon Barker as President and COO last March with the expectation that he would not only apply his expertise in heading up our growing e-commerce platform, but would also be prepared in time to be our next CEO,” Mr. Schaefer added. “The Board and I are all impressed by the significant contributions Jon has made over the last year. We are confident Jon is prepared to lead the Company’s next phase of growth by expanding its national retail footprint and accelerating its e-commerce capabilities as a full-fledged omni-channel retailer.”\nPrior to joining the Company in March 2017, Mr. Barker was VP Global Officer for Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. where he served in the dual roles of President and CEO of Hayneedle.com , a leading online home furnishings retailer, since 2013, and effective January 2017 as group leader for the Home and Outdoor furnishings categories for U.S. ecommerce across Walmart.com , Jet.com and Hayneedle.com .

John’s preparation over the last year for a smooth transition upon his planned retirement is just one example of his thoughtful leadership. We have equal confidence in Jon Barker and the rest of the executive team and expect Sportsman’s will continue to grow and evolve under their leadership in ways that will benefit our shareholders, our employees and our loyal customers.”\nJon Barker stated, “It is a privilege to be appointed as the next CEO for Sportsman’s Warehouse. I have enjoyed working directly with John over the past year and am grateful for his partnership, as well as the strong team he has built at the Company.
