Hundreds of thousands of people took part in March for Our Lives events nationwide Saturday to call for more action against gun violence. Ad Land got involved, too. Ad Age partnered with Outfront Media to showcase antigun violence artwork from the advertising community.\nHigh Tension Line From brand-safety scandals, to measurement mishaps and improper data sharing, Madison Avenue has had many reasons to grow frustrated with Google and Facebook over the past year or so. The Wall Street Journal’s Suzanne Vranica gives you a behind-the-scenes look at how marketers have aggressively pushed the duopoly for changes, including details of a tense standoff between Procter & Gamble’s Marc Pritchard and Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler at Google’s Mountain View, Calif., HQ. Procter & Gamble is returning to YouTube after last year’s brand-safety issues saw it pulling spend, but its new U.S. whitelist will consist of fewer than 10,000 channels, down from the 3 million its ads could appear on before. Meanwhile, Subway plans to pull back on Facebook spending this year over concerns about whether its ads are being viewed sufficiently. All that said, the tech giants have earned plaudits from marketers by allowing more of their data to be measured by third-party firms and for agreeing to Measurement Rating Council audits.\nWe Can’t Go on Together With Suspicious Minds Frustrated advertisers aren’t the only group of people tech giants need to keep at bay. Regulators are keeping an ever-watchful eye, too. And stricter regulation of tech companies could have an impact on advertisers’ ability to access data for targeting and measurement purposes. In an interview with the Telegraph, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, said she had “grave suspicions” about Google . You’ll remember the EU hit Google with a record €2.42 billion ($2.71 billion) fine in June for favoring its comparison-shopping service over competitor products in its search results (which the company is appealing). Two other EU antitrust cases remain outstanding, around AdSense and Android. Ms. Vestager also fired another warning shot in Google’s direction. Asked whether the only solution to Google’s dominance was to break up the company, she said, “I think it’s important to keep that question open and on the agenda.”\nIs It Too Late Now to Say Sorry Back to Facebook, then. Following the traditional marketer’s playbook in the arc of a crisis, the social network took out full-page ads in U.S. and U.K. newspapers over the weekend to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica snafu. Also this weekend, Facebook was on the defensive again after The Verge reported some Android users who downloaded the data the social network stores on them found details of their call and SMS history , dating back years. Facebook said that the logging is an opt-in feature for Messenger and Facebook Lite on Android users, that they can turn it off, and that this data was never sold to third parties. Not quite as clear in that response, however, was why call and text history is necessary “to help you find and stay connected with the people you care about.” Meanwhile, Suzanne Vranica and I reported for WSJ about the company’s efforts to quell marketers’ concerns about its platform . Expect more marketing, but this time about “all the millions of ways on a daily basis the platform is being used for good,” said Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, Carolyn Everson.\n—How’s This for Timing?—\nOne of the big concerns advertisers have in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal centers around whether their customer data, which they upload using Facebook’s Custom Audiences tool, might have been compromised. Facebook affirmed to ad agencies that it hadn’t been. Separate to the Cambridge Analytica fallout, Facebook said Friday that it would stop showing audience reach estimates in the Custom Audiences targeting tool after researchers from Northeastern University found an exploit where an advertiser could use it to infer the personal attributes of an individual user, Marketing Land reported. Facebook is investigating but says it hasn’t yet found any evidence the tool was used in this way.\nLet’s Get Quizzical From humble beginnings, HQ Trivia has become appointment viewing for hundreds of thousands of quiz fans who tune in to the app each day for the chance to win cash prizes by playing along with the live game. So far, the prize pool has been VC-funded, but now advertisers are getting involved. Ad Age’s Garett Sloane reports the app has bagged a $3 million advertising deal with Warner Bros. to promote three movies, starting with “Ready Player One.” Wednesday’s game will have a $250,000 prize pot and will feature questions related to the Steven Spielberg film, Ad Age’s sources say. The appeal for marketers is a captive audience, which reached 2.18 million players at its peak, on the night of the Oscars. Stay tuned! HQ Trivia has purchased billboards and is using its social media accounts to tease a collaboration with Nike set to launch Monday to coincide with the sportswear brand’s “Air Max Day.”\nBest of the rest In an interview, IAC Chairman Barry Diller discusses topics such as Silicon Valley taking on Hollywood to the #MeToo movement.
