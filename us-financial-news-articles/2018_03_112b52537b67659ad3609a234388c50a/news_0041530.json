That process can take 30 minutes or more, during which time the patient faces an increased risk of infection and negative effects of anesthesia, Eberlin said. \nThe team hopes to expand the pen's diagnostic capabilities to include all solid tumors. \nEberlin said the next step is to conduct clinical trials to test the pen during surgeries, with procedures expected to begin within two months. Adoption of the MasSpec Pen will likely hinge on whether the device gets FDA approval. \nCosts are also a big question for health-care providers. Although the pen itself is disposable and fairly cheap to make (it's 3-D printed), hospitals will need to make a big upfront investment in the mass spectrometer. \nResults of the study can be found in the journal Science of Translational Medicine .
