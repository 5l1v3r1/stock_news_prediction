(NYSE: CSRA) for $40.75 per share in cash. General Dynamics continues to believe that this combination creates a premier provider of high-tech IT solutions to the Government Technology Services market and that its proposed acquisition of CSRA offers superior value for CSRA's shareholders.\nOn February 12, 2018, General Dynamics and CSRA announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement under which General Dynamics would acquire CSRA for approximately $9.6 billion in cash, including the assumption of $2.8 billion in CSRA debt. The tender offer for CSRA shares commenced on March 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on April 2, 2018, at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, with the acquisition of CSRA expected to close shortly thereafter. As previously disclosed, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act with respect to the tender offer has expired.\nOn March 18, 2018, CACI International Inc announced an unsolicited offer proposing to acquire CSRA for a combination of CACI common stock based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.184 shares of CACI stock for each share of CSRA common stock and $15.00 per share of cash. The offer implies current CSRA shareholders will own approximately 55 percent of the resulting entity.\nGeneral Dynamics believes strongly that its proposed acquisition of CSRA offers both superior and certain value for the CSRA shareholders for the following reasons:\nWe believe the nominal price of CACI's offer to CSRA overstates the real value to the CSRA shareholders and understates the risk attendant to it. CACI's offer is comprised of $15.00 per share of cash, less than 35 percent of the purported value. Over 65 percent of CACI's proposed consideration consists of a fixed exchange ratio of CACI stock, which is subject to daily market fluctuations and an estimated four-month delay at a minimum before its real value can be ascertained with certainty. CACI's nominal $44.00 per share offer depends upon the all-time closing high share price of CACI's volatile common stock. We believe that CACI's proposal would burden the resulting entity with approximately $6.8 billion of debt, which would result in leverage of approximately 5.7x debt to EBITDA, one of the highest in the Government Technology Services sector. CACI's proposed offer would appear to be approximately 25 percent dilutive to CACI's GAAP earnings on a pro forma basis pre-synergies and also dilutive to CACI's GAAP earnings on a pro forma basis even assuming the elevated level of CACI's estimated cost synergies. CACI's estimated synergies are, we believe, aggressive at best. With CSRA shareholders owning 55 percent of the combined company, CSRA will bear the burden of 55 percent of the termination fee payable to General Dynamics as well as 55 percent of the transaction expenses, which we estimate for CSRA alone at a total potential after-tax cost of approximately $0.66 per share for each CSRA share. Assuming CACI's transaction expenses approximate CSRA's, the estimated total potential after-tax cost could be approximately $0.82 per share for each CSRA share. Based on CACI's statement that it could close the acquisition of CSRA by July 31, 2018, the time value of money for an investor between early April and the closing of a CACI/CSRA combination would represent a significant opportunity cost. Using the average trading price of CACI's stock over the past 30 trading days and taking into account the 55 percent of the transaction expenses and termination fee to be borne by the CSRA shareholders and the time value of money opportunity cost due to the significant delay in the closing of a proposed CACI transaction, we estimate the value of CACI's unsolicited offer to be less than the General Dynamics offer. On this basis, we believe the CACI offer is inferior to our cash offer of $40.75 per share even prior to factoring in the significant market risk associated with a CACI transaction closing many months in the future with a fixed exchange ratio.\nGeneral Dynamics has a long history of successfully executing acquisitions in a timely and efficient manner and firmly believes that its offer is in the best interest of CSRA's shareholders, employees and customers.\nAbout General Dynamics\nHeadquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) is a global aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapon systems and munitions; C4ISR and IT solutions; and shipbuilding.
