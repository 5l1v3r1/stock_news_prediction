The raid comes as the government continues to grapple with how to regulate virtual currencies in one of the world’s most frenetic crypto markets. \nRead: Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on Twitter: The most important people to follow \n“It’s unclear yet whether the transactions can be seen as embezzlement,” Jeong said.
