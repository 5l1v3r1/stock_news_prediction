Bringing more countries on board to the TPP will grow that value,\" he said, pointing to how the agreement would set rules for the region's trading system in the future.\nThe CPTPP will generate $147 billion in income, according to simulations conducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In comparison, the original TPP would have resulted in $492 billion in global income benefits, the think tank said.\n'Tariff roulette' Meanwhile, the steel and aluminum tariffs were seen by some as less severe than previously expected, as Canada and Mexico were exempt. The proclamation signed by Trump also noted that countries with a \"security relationship\" with the U.S. will be given the chance to make their case for exemption.\nshow chapters 'Nothing's ever decided' until it comes to force with the US administration 17 Hours Ago | 03:00 But the nature of that potential exemption was \"less clear,\" one expert told CNBC.\n\"Think of it almost perhaps as a tariff roulette. You spin the wheel and you see whether maybe there's something else you can do to persuade the U.S. not to impose steel with respect to goods from your country,\" said Miriam Sapiro, a former deputy and acting U.S. trade representative.\nStill, countries such as Australia would likely qualify under that criteria to make its case for exemption, given its military ties with the U.S., said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, in a note.\nThe U.S. also runs a trade surplus with Australia, Attrill pointed out. In 2017, that figure came in at $14.55 billion, according to U.S. census data.\n\"If you're open to being sympathetic to your close allies when it comes to national security, it would be hard to imagine a scenario where Australia wouldn't be exempted from that tariff,\" Baker said.\nBut he also noted that it seemed as though \"nothing's ever decided until it actually comes into force\" with the current U.S. administration.\nAnd while the fact that the U.S. should have a stable and secure supply of steel was something people understood, tariffs — which angered allies and could result in retaliatory actions from trading partners — were not the right tool, said Sapiro, who is currently the managing director of public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co.\n\"Using this particular tool, these tariffs, to try to address concerns about Chinese capacity and underselling just doesn't make sense,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T09:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T09:23:15.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
