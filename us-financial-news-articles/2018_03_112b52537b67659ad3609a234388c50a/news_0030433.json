We believe our focus on technology innovation and development of high-value products for our customers will position Everspin to benefit from the growing demand for persistent memory solutions.\n“To gain the necessary capital for executing this strategy, Everspin raised a net $24.5 million, after underwriter fees, through a secondary public stock offering in February.
