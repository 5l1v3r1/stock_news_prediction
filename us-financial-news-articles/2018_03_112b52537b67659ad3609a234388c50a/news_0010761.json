Please see “Non-IFRS supplemental measures” below. (2) These IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures were impacted by costs associated with the Asset Acquisition and Internalization and Proxy Matter (both defined below), both of which are further discussed in the REIT’s Management Discussion and Analysis for the three month period and year ended December 31, 2017 (the “MD&A”). Summary of Significant Events:\nFinancial Highlights\nFor the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the REIT achieved net income of $16,353, compared to net income of $23,965 for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. This represents a decrease in net income of $0.366 per Unit. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the REIT’s FFO and ACFO per Unit was negatively impacted by non-reoccurring expenses related to the Proxy Matter and the Asset Acquisition and Internalization, each of which are discussed further in the REIT’s the MD&A. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, FFO per Unit was negative $0.097 and ACFO per Unit was $0.104 compared to $0.312 and $0.261, respectively, for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. Excluding costs associated with the Proxy Matter and Asset Acquisition and Internalization, FFO and ACFO per Unit for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 would have been $0.312 and $0.260, respectively. For the three month period ended December 31, 2017, the REIT achieved AFFO per Unit of $0.262 compared to $0.266 for the three month period ended December 31, 2016. This represents a 1.5% decrease in AFFO per Unit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the REIT achieved net income of $52,643 compared to net income of $19,775 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This represents an increase in net income of $0.853 per Unit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the REIT achieved FFO per Unit and ACFO per Unit of $0.774 and $0.837, respectively, compared to $1.278 and $1.067, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. These decreases are primarily the result of non-reoccurring expenses related to the Proxy Matter and the Asset Acquisition and Internalization, each of which are discussed further in the MD&A. Excluding these costs, FFO per Unit and ACFO per Unit for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have been $1.208 and $1.009, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the REIT achieved AFFO per Unit of $1.033 compared to $1.076 for the year ended December 31, 2016. This represents a 4.0% decrease in AFFO per Unit. The REIT’s Payout Ratios for the three month period and year ended December 31, 2017 were 187% and 94%, respectively. The REIT’s Payout Ratio was significantly impacted by non-reoccurring expenses related to the Proxy Matter and the Asset Acquisition and Internalization, each of which are discussed further in the MD&A. Excluding these costs the REIT’s Payout Ratio for the three month period and year ended December 31, 2017 would have been 75% and 78%, respectively.\nOperational Highlights\nAs at January 1, 2018, the overall occupancy rate of the REIT’s portfolio was 95.7%, representing a slight decrease from the October 1, 2017 occupancy rate of 95.9%. This decrease was primarily the result of approximately 43,000 sqft of newly developed retail space being placed in service as of January 1, 2017. As at January 1, 2018 the retail space is approximately 7% occupied and the committed occupancy is approximately 53% with occupancy beginning throughout the first half of 2018. On each of January 11, 2017 and January 31, 2017, the REIT received full building permits for the development of the retail and parking facility and car dealership to be constructed at the REIT’s Consumers Road complex in Toronto, Ontario. The building permits are conditional on the REIT performing certain work described in the previously executed site plan and plan of subdivision. On February 27, 2017, the REIT closed a public offering of 4,807,000 Units at a price of $11.45 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $55,040, which included 437,000 Units issued pursuant to of the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The REIT used the net proceeds from the offering to repay approximately US$9.0 million of outstanding mortgage debt as well as certain indebtedness owing under the REIT's existing credit facilities with the remainder to be used to fund future acquisitions and for general business purposes. On March 31, 2017, the REIT repaid US$9.0 million of outstanding mortgage debt secured by the REIT’s Houston office properties with certain of the net proceeds from the February 27, 2017 public offering of Units. In conjunction with the repayment, the REIT extended the mortgage maturity dates to November 12, 2019. On April 18, 2017, the REIT made an indirect investment in a 410,000 sqft multi-tenanted distribution centre located in Tampa, Florida. The total purchase price of the property was approximately US$15.2 million (before closing costs) and was financed, in part, by a US$7.8 million first mortgage, which matures on May 1, 2027 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.40% per annum. The REIT purchased its 9% non-controlling interest through a strategic partnership with a private Canadian-based investor. The property was purchased by the partnership at a capitalization rate of 9.2%. The REIT expects to make further investments in other properties through this partnership, which is focussed on acquiring quality value-add industrial properties located in the U.S. that can generate superior cash flow and returns. On April 25, 2017, the REIT acquired an industrial distribution facility located in Flint, Michigan. The facility comprises approximately 400,000 sqft of GLA and was acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$16.0 million (before closing costs), representing a capitalization rate of approximately 12%. The facility is fully leased to General Motors LLC and was financed by drawing down funds under the REIT’s credit facility. On June 27, 2017, the REIT acquired eight industrial properties located throughout suburban Chicago, Illinois. The properties are comprised of approximately 314,000 sqft of GLA and were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$28.0 million (before closing costs), representing a capitalization rate of approximately 7.7%. The REIT financed the acquisition of the properties by drawing on its operating credit facility and obtaining a first mortgage. On July 28, 2017, the REIT received an occupancy permit from the City of Toronto and Porsche Cars Canada Ltd. took occupancy of the newly constructed premises at the REIT’s Consumers Road complex. The REIT is required to complete certain development work in accordance with the lease agreement with the tenant. On September 18, 2017, the REIT entered into an asset purchase agreement with ACPI to acquire substantially all of the assets of the REIT’s external manager and internalize the REIT’s asset management function (the “Asset Acquisition and Internalization”). On September 28, 2017 the REIT disposed of its interest in 165 Yorkland LP, a limited partnership established by the REIT to own a car dealership and corporate head office at its Consumers Road complex pursuant to a lease agreement with Porsche Cars Canada Ltd. The REIT disposed of its partnership interest for approximately $42,276 before transaction costs, working capital adjustments and holdbacks. Certain proceeds from the disposition were used to repay the REIT’s construction facility in respect of the project and the remaining proceeds will be used by the REIT to complete the development of a retail and parking facility servicing the REIT’s Consumers Road complex. On November 13, 2017, the REIT closed the Asset Acquisition and Internalization pursuant to an amended asset purchase agreement in respect thereof dated the same date. Upon closing of the Asset Acquisition and Internalization, a Canadian operating limited partnership of the REIT acquired all requisite assets of ACPI to internalize the REIT’s asset management function and all executives and other employees of ACPI became employees of the REIT or its subsidiaries. For further discussion regarding the Asset Acquisition and Internalization please refer to the MD&A. Also on November 13, 2017, the REIT announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with ELAD Canada Inc. and Sandpiper Group in respect of a potential proxy contest (the “Proxy Matter”). As part of the settlement agreement, Sandpiper Group withdrew its previously announced Unitholder meeting requisition and the REIT appointed Renzo Barazzuol, Dov Meyer, and Aida Tammer to the board of trustees of the REIT. For further discussion regarding the Proxy Matter please refer to the MD&A.\nSubsequent Events\nSubsequent to year end, on January 9, 2018 the REIT entered into an agreement to purchase a 58,000 square foot multi-tenant industrial property located in Laurel, Maryland. The property is currently 92% occupied by 6 tenants with a weighted average lease term of 4.6 years. The acquisition is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter of 2018 for U.S. $5,280, representing a capitalization rate of 8.1%. The REIT anticipates financing the transaction with funds from its credit facility. Subsequent to year end, on February 28, 2018 the REIT extended the maturity of the REIT’s credit facility and increased the maximum funds available thereunder. The credit facility now matures on January 25, 2020 and the maximum availability thereunder has been increased from $120.0 million to $140.0 million.\n“Operationally, it was an excellent year for us,” said Frank Camenzuli, Chief Executive Officer. “The average occupancy rate of the portfolio at year end was 95.7%, one of the highest levels ever reported by the REIT, we made excellent progress at Parkway Place, both in terms of leasing activity and completing our developments, we purchased an additional 800,000 sqft of industrial properties at favourable capitalization rates and, in the fourth quarter, we internalized management. As we look forward to 2018, we believe the REIT has many opportunities for growth and foresee further advancements on our strategic objectives as the year progresses.”\nThe REIT will hold a conference call to discuss the REIT’s financial performance for the three month period and year ended December 31, 2017 on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. (Toronto time).
