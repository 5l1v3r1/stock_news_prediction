South Carolina didn’t exactly light it up in the first half (37.0 percent) but made only 5 of its first 20 attempts in the second and shot only 31.4 percent the second period.\nAuburn shot only 27.6 percent in the first 20 minutes, 50 percent in the second.\nAuburn trailed 25-11 midway through the first period. At one point the Tigers were only 3-of-22 from the field, but they closed by making five of their last seven shots to get back into the game.\nA 10-0 run helped the Tigers outscore the Gamecocks 16-3 over a six-minute span to cut the gap to 28-27 with 3:25 left in the half. The Tigers fell behind again 32-27 but fought back and took their first lead since a 5-4 advantage in the early minutes on guard Mustapha Heron’s two free throws that put them up 35-34 with 36.8 seconds left in the period.\nBooker’s 3-pointer in the closing seconds gave the Gamecocks a 37-35 advantage at the break.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:56:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
