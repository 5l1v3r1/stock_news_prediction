North Korea had a hard line stance on its nuclear program. The market is still not fully convinced that discussion will go smoothly...”\nFriday’s winners included such large cap stocks as Fast Retailing, rising 1.5 percent, SoftBank, up 1.6 percent, and Daikin Industries, up 2.3 percent.\nInsurers were also bought, with T&D Holdings up 1.6 percent and Sompo Holdings rising 2.3 percent.\nOn the other hand, defense equipment maker Ishikawa Seisakusho tumbled 11 percent, firearm maker Howa Machinery sank 11 percent and health protection devices maker Shigematsu Works fell 8.8 percent.\nThe broader Topix rose 0.6 percent to 1,719.97.
