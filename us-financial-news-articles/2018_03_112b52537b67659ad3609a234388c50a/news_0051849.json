Detroit has won back-to-back games for the first time since February.\nJack Eichel, Ryan O’Reilly and Evan Rodrigues scored for Buffalo, which has lost five of its past six games.\nDetroit goaltender Jimmy Howard stopped 29 of 32 shots for his 21st win of the season and the 220th win of his career.

Frans Nielsen set up Joe Hicketts for a one-timer, and Mantha punched in the loose puck near the crease.\nA remarkable no-look, backhand pass from Justin Abdelkader set up Athanasiou’s goal to make it 4-2 in the first two minutes of the third period. Athanasiou grinned at the delivery after potting his 15th goal.\nBuffalo climbed within 4-3 when Rodrigues scored with 15:09 to play in the third period.\nDetroit regained a two-goal lead midway through the third period on DeKeyser’s first goal in 17 games.\nSvechnikov finished the scoring for the Red Wings with 3:01 to play.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:49:42.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
