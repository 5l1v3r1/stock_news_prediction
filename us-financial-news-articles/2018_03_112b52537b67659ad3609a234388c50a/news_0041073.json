Nadda said on Thursday, labelling it the largest such scheme in the world. Health Minister J.P. Nadda speaks to the media at his office in New Delhi January 14, 2015. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/Files Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which has dubbed the scheme “Modicare”, announced in February the programme would provide 100 million families, or about 500 million poor people, with health cover of 500,000 rupees per year for treatment of serious ailments. The union budget had made an allocation of 20 billion rupees for the scheme for 2018-19, but officials had said more funds would be made available as the programme was rolled out. Health Ministry officials said the government has allocated 100 billion rupees ($1.54 billion) for the “National Health Protection Mission” for 2018/19 and 2019/20.

The measures are Modi’s latest attempt to reform a public health system that faces a shortage of hospitals and doctors. The government has also in recent years capped prices of critical drugs and medical devices and increased health funding.
