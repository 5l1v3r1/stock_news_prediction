Michael Coates, who joined the company in January 2015, is quitting to start his own company, sources said. Coates announced the move internally about three weeks ago, sources said, but had not announced the move externally.\nTwitter declined to comment.\nNews of Coates' departure comes on the same day that Michael Zelewski, director of information security engineering at Google, announced his departure from that company after 11 years. And it comes two days after reports that Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, plans to leave the company in August . The departures come at a time when tech companies are under mounting pressure to prevent their platforms from being misused by foreign governments and other bad actors ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\nAt Twitter, Coates' interim replacement is Joseph Camilleri, a senior manager for information security and risk, sources said. Camilleri previously filled in for Coates last year when the latter was on paternity leave.\nRead more from The Verge:\nToxic management cost an award-winning game studio its best developers\nHow to use Facebook while giving it the minimum amount of personal data\nWhat happens when an algorithm cuts your health care\nWATCH: Dorsey says bitcoin will become 'world's currency' show chapters Jack Dorsey says bitcoin will eventually become the world’s ‘single currency’ 20 Hours Ago | 00:38", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T01:06:51.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
