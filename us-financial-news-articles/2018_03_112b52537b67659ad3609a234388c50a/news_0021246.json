Virginia defeated visiting North Carolina 61-49 in the lone regular-season meeting between the teams on Jan. 6.\nFreshman guard Gary Trent Jr.’s 20 points paced Duke (26-7), while freshman star forward Marvin Bagley III had 19 points, senior guard Grayson Allen scored 16 and freshman forward Wendell Carter Jr. had 14 points. Defending champion Duke was the No. 2 seed.\nThis was the rubber match between Duke and North Carolina after Duke won the regular-season finale 74-64 last Saturday.\nThese teams also met in last year’s ACC tournament semifinal round, with Duke winning that game and North Carolina later going on to win the national championship.\nNorth Carolina built a 62-48 lead with less than 10 minutes to play, continuing to slice through the Duke defense.\nThen North Carolina had late-game possessions that included two offensive rebounds, helping the Tar Heels cut almost a minute off the clock.\nYet Allen’s 3-pointer as part of a 10-0 run cut the lead to 72-66 with 1:47 to play. The Tar Heels missed seven straight shots down the stretch, though an offensive rebound on the seventh of those meant Duke didn’t regain possession until a turnover that led to Trent Jr.’s 3-pointer with 50 seconds left.\nAnother turnover gave Duke a chance, but Allen was called for charging. Another North Carolina turnover allowed Duke another chance with 11 seconds remaining and Allen missed on a 3 before senior forward Theo Pinson’s free throws clinched it.\nNorth Carolina led 36-31 at halftime, aided by 10 Duke turnovers.\nBagley III and Trent Jr. combined for 21 first-half points for the Blue Devils.\nNorth Carolina broke out to a 16-3 lead, with Duke committing six turnovers by that stage seven minutes into the game.\nDuke countered with a 14-4 run, eventually going up 27-26 with two minutes left in the half.\nWith 52.7 seconds remaining before the break, Allen was assessed a flagrant foul for a hip check on North Carolina’s Brooks.\nWith Friday night’s result, Duke and North Carolina are both 100-45 all-time in ACC Tournament play.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T12:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:16:55.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
