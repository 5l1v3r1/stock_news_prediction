Suppliers and manufacturers from the food industry to automobile parts makers are examining their sources and orders of raw materials as well as their sales commitments as they look at the possible impact of the Trump administration’s plan for 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% on aluminum. The WSJ’s Andrew Tangel and Mike Colias report the tariffs raise the specter of price spikes, supply shortages and retaliatory trade barriers, bringing new uncertainty to businesses that had been growing more confident through an industrial rebound. Many U.S. parts-makers worry that the plans could send business to overseas competitors, if tariffs drive up domestic prices. Still, some suppliers say the tariffs could help them compete with overseas companies that ship cheaper parts into the U.S. And steel makers discount the idea of shortages, saying they’ll ramp up production if higher prices make the investment worthwhile.\nThe fallout from new U.S. trade barriers may reach far beyond steel mills. Officials from Europe, Canada and Japan were among leaders raising alarms over the Trump administration’s planned import curbs, and the WSJ’s Ben Leubsdorf and Rebecca Baullhaus write that goods including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans could be targeted under retaliatory actions. President Donald Trump has upped the ante, saying the U.S. could respond with new tariffs on European car exports. That would hit even more U.S. operations that depend on U.S. trade: German’s BMW AG makes vehicles in South Carolina and it exported more than 200,000 of them through the state’s Port of Charleston last year. Agriculture exports may face the biggest worries in a trade war, however. The U.S. exported some $12.4 billion in soybeans to China last year, and shipments of dairy, almonds, blueberries, apples, beef and pork also could suffer if countries retaliate against the new U.S. levies.\nCSX Corp. believes a streamlined freight rail network will get shipments moving faster and with more certainty. Chief Executive James Foote is putting more details to investors and shipping customers on his plans for the carrier since taking over after the death of leader Hunter Harrison in December, and he’s describing a business that will be leaner, more profitable and more focused on service. The WSJ’s Paul Ziobro and Jennifer Smith report that CSX plans to cut its annual capital spending by about 20% as the railroad pushes to drop real estate and streamline operations to eliminate “tens of thousands of touches” of the carloads and intermodal volumes on its network. That would keep the network flowing more smoothly, but the smaller footprint also could mean relying more on regional railroads and third-party providers to get loads in place to connect with CSX’s main routes.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES A Salzgitter AG steel plant in Germany. Photo: European Pressphoto Agency The growth of online commerce for luxury goods is raising the stakes for high-end retailers. Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. is using visibility technology to try to take the pain out of the delivery for customers and the company, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, as growing online sales push more big, bulky items through distribution channels. Experts say at least one in 10 “white glove” deliveries by retailers faces a delivery problem, such as an incorrect address or phone number, or a scheduling conflict. That’s pressing logistics companies and shippers to come up with more tailored services outside their usual industrial networks. In this case, Neiman started using a cloud-based platform from Convey Software Inc. to flag potential delays in its bulkiest, most complex deliveries. It’s one sign of a new eco-system of tech and services being built as changing consumer tastes stretch the limits of traditional delivery operations.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ It’s going to bring a dynamic of risk and volatility that we haven’t had to deal with in a while. ’\n—Jason Andringa, chief executive of Vermeer Corp., an Iowa maker of construction and agricultural equipment, on steel and aluminum tariffs.\nNumber of the Day 16,047 Number of vehicles exported from South Carolina’s Port of Charleston in January.\nIN OTHER NEWS Canada’s economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in the fourth quarter despite growing business investment .
