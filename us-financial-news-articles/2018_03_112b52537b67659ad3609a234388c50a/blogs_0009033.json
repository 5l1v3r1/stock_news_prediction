The bank is considering divesting its stakes in the companies at least partially, the source added, asking for anonymity because discussions are still private. \nThe source said the bank could use cash raised from the merger to fund an expected rise in demand for its loans next year. \nAccording to the paper, which cited unnamed sources close to the companies, Suzano would buy out most of the 29.5 percent stake that industrial conglomerate Votorantim Participações SA has in Fibria. \nSuzano is structuring the offer in a way that avoids triggering a poison pill in Fibria's bylaws, the paper added. According to those rules, if Votorantim sells a stake higher than 25 percent, there would be a mandatory offering to all shareholders. \nShares of both companies rose about 5 percent in early afternoon trading in Sao Paulo following the report. \nContacted by Reuters, representatives for Fibria, Suzano and Votorantim did not immediately comment on the report. \n(Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer in Sao Paulo and Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro Editing by Frances Kerry and Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T11:30:21.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
