However, Kraton didnâ€™t mention that certain customers had already rejected its Brazilian-produced Cariflex. On February 21, 2018, Kraton revealed that some of its customers experienced processing issues with its Brazilian-produced Cariflex during the fourth quarter of 2017, and that in certain cases the material was returned to Kraton for evaluation. Kraton further admitted that the resulting negative financial impact to its fourth quarter 2017 operating income including its Adjusted EBITDA was $7.6 million. On this news, Kraton's stock fell $7.69 per share, or over 15%, to close at $43.10 per share on February 21, 2018.\nKraton Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
