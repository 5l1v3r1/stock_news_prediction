(\"MCHP\") (NASDAQ: MCHP) in a transaction valued at approximately $8.35 billion. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, MSCC shareholders will receive $68.78 in cash for each MSCC share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether MSCC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $72.00, or approximately $3.25 above the per-share offer. Further, according to an analyst, the transaction will improve MCHP's accretion potential, driving it to exceed its guidance. It is also projected that this deal could boost MCHP's earnings by 20%-30%.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether MSCC's Board acted in the best interests of MSCC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own MSCC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases.
