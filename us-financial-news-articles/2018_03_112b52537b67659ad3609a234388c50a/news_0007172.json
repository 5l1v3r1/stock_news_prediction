(NASDAQ:OPK) reports business highlights and financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Highlights\nRAYALDEE total prescriptions reported by IMS increased 47% in Q4 2017 compared with Q3 2017 : Total prescriptions were more than 3,900 during the three months ended December 31, 2017. As of January 1, 2018, more than 79% of patients have access to RAYALDEE under their insurance plans.\n4Kscore® utilization increased 15% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016 : OPKO has undertaken a number of initiatives to drive utilization of the 4Kscore test, the Company’s blood test that gives a man with elevated prostate specific androgen (PSA) levels a personalized prediction of his chance of having or developing an aggressive form of prostate cancer. OPKO launched regional television ads in the Northeast for the 4Kscore test on November 21, 2017 and expanded the television ads to Florida in February 2018. Premarket Approval (PMA) application for Claros ® point-of-care (POC) PSA test submitted to FDA : On November 6, 2017, OPKO submitted a PMA for a PSA test utilizing the Claros 1 immunoassay analyzer, a novel diagnostic instrument that can provide rapid, quantitative blood test results in 10 minutes in the physician’s office with only a finger stick drop of whole blood. A second product on the same platform for testosterone is advancing toward a 510(k) submission to the FDA later this year. Global and Japan Phase 3 and registration studies for hGH-CTP in pediatric growth hormone deficient children are making good progress in enrolling patients : The global pediatric study is a pivotal, non-inferiority design comparing a single weekly administration of hGH-CTP with daily injections of a currently marketed growth hormone product. This study is expected to complete enrollment this year. The global and Japanese pediatric studies utilize the pen device and formulation that will be launched commercially upon approval. The pediatric segment represents more than 80% of the commercial market for treatment of hGH deficiency.\nInitiated a Phase 2b clinical trial for OPK88004, an orally administered selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) : In November 2017, OPKO initiated a Phase 2b dose-ranging study for the treatment of men with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), or enlarged prostate. OPK88004 is expected to improve the symptoms of BPH by reducing prostate size and, on the basis of data from a previous trial in 350 men, increase muscle mass and bone strength and decrease fat mass. BPH affects approximately 50 million men in the U.S.\nInitiation of four Phase 2 clinical trials anticipated in 2018 : RAYALDEE line extension in dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) : Together with its partners Vifor Fresenius and Japan Tobacco, OPKO is developing RAYALDEE for Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with SHPT undergoing dialysis and anticipates initiating a global Phase 2 trial in dialysis centers in the second quarter of this year. OPK88003, a once-weekly oxyntomodulin dual GLP1-Glucagon agonist for type 2 diabetes and obesity : OPKO expects to initiate a Phase 2b dose-escalation study with OPK88003 in the second quarter of this year. In a 420-patient Phase 2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes, OPK88003 reduced HbA1c levels similar to exenatide extended-release (Ex ER). The drug also showed statistically significantly greater weight loss and lowering of total cholesterol and triglycerides compared to once-weekly Ex ER, with a good safety profile. OPK88002, an NK-1 antagonist to treat pruritus (itching) in Stage 5 CKD patients undergoing dialysis : An Investigational New Drug application was submitted to the FDA and plans are being finalized to begin a single-dose Phase 2a trial of OPK88002 in dialysis patients to treat severe itching. Approximately 50% of renal dialysis patients experience difficult to control pruritus. OPK88001 for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome: Three clinical research centers in the United States are expected to participate in this first in human clinical study of the AntagoNAT for treatment of Dravet Syndrome.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet loss of $213.9 during the three months ended December 31, 2017 included $147.7 million of non-recurring or non-cash items consisting of: $73.3 million of revenue adjustments $13.2 million of intangible impairment related to VARUBI™ $61.2 million Income tax provision Consolidated revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $193.7 million compared to $275.5 million for the comparable period of 2016.
