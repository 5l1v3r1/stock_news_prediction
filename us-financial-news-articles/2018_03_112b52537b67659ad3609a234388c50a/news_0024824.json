I still expect prices to go towards $1,300.\"\nIn other precious metals, silver rose 0.5 percent to $16.57 an ounce. Net long positions in U.S. silver futures increased for the first time since January, UBS analyst Joni Teves said in a note.\n\"Silver has been such an underperformer of late and one of the few positive factors currently is that net length is very lean. Despite recent gains, net speculative positions in silver are still only 18 percent of the record.\"\nPlatinum rose 0.54 percent to $967.80 an ounce, while palladium climbed 1.52 percent to $992.50.\nING analyst Oliver Nugent said in a note that the platinum price will struggle to move back above palladium.\n\"Based on our own forecasts, we don't think such a move will happen for the next few years due to platinum's weaker fundamentals with the palladium backwardation actually making it more expensive for investors to short the ratio.\"\nThe platinum/palladium ratio was at 0.978, up from 0.943 in late February and 0.85 in mid-December. Palladium flipped to a premium over platinum last September for the first time since 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T05:39:39.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
