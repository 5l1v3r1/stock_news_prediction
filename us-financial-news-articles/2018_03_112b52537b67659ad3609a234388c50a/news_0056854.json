Support for the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), his ally, fell 12 percentage points over one month in a poll published on Thursday. \n“One has to remember that a president who wants to win in the first or second round has to win much more votes than the ruling party in a general election,” Rafal Chwedoruk, a political scientist from Warsaw University, said.

The number of PiS voters from villages and small towns accepted the decision on imposing martial law,” Chwedoruk said. \nThe PiS has made much of its efforts to erase the legacy of four decades of post-war Soviet-dominated communist rule and restore what it considers to be Poland’s true identity - even though some leading PiS figures are former communists. \nThe law would demote to the rank of private members of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON), led by the late generals Wojciech Jaruzelski and Czeslaw Kiszczak. \nBut it would also demote 77-year-old Miroslaw Hermaszewski, Poland’s only astronaut, one of the few WRON members still alive, who was drafted onto the council in 1981 without his knowledge or consent, and discharged from it after two weeks. \nHermaszewski spent almost eight days on board the Soviet Salyut space station in 1978, and is still seen as a national hero, also by PiS voters.
