Ladbrokes is what we wanted, we got them and we are biggest in the UK when the deal closes so we don’t need anything more here,” the Scot added.\nHowever GVC, the owner of the Sportingbet and Foxy Bingo brands, would still explore M&A opportunity beyond Britain, Alexander added.\nAlexander has built GVC through a series of increasingly ambitious deals, including the 1.1 billion pound reverse takeover of bwin.party, growing it into a FTSE 250 business.\nThe Ladbrokes deal gives it a portfolio of retail betting shops to add to its online operations.\nFor GVC, gains made from bwin.party deal help it post net gaming revenue of 925.6 million euros ($1.14 billion) last year compared with 794.3 million euros in 2016.\nIt acquired bwin.party for 1.1 billion pounds in 2015 after a prolonged bidding with online rival 888 Holdings.\nNet gaming revenue from its sports division rose 19 percent to 331.2 million euros with amounts wagered up 2 percent despite the absence of a major international soccer tournament from last year’s calendar, a year after Euro 2016.\nThe company said full-year clean EBITDA - its preferred metric for core earnings - rose 40 percent to 239.5 million euros.\nShares in the company were up 3.9 percent and among the top gainer on FTSE 250 Index at 1030 GMT.
