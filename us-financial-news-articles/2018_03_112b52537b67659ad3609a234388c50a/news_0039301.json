It will also divest its vegetable seeds business to BASF.\nThe Commission is due to decide on the BASF deal by April 16. China has given conditional approval to the Bayer and Monsanto deal, which has won the green light in Brazil. It is currently being reviewed by U.S. and Russia antitrust authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T12:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T12:51:19.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
