(OTCQB:CRTN), a leading provider of consulting services and managed solutions to the global telecom, media and technology industries (the “Company”), today announced that its Strategic Review Committee and Board of Directors unanimously approved the Company entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to be acquired by an affiliate of Blackstreet Capital Holdings (“Blackstreet”), a Chevy Chase, MD-based private, diversified holding company, that will result in Cartesian becoming a privately held company when the merger is completed.\nCartesian Executive Chairman Donald J. Tringali said, “For several months, the Strategic Review Committee of the Board and its financial advisors have been seeking strategic alternatives for the Company. We view this announcement as good news for our employees, good news for our customers, and good news for our shareholders.”\nBlackstreet’s Founder and CEO Murry Gunty added, “We are pleased to have the opportunity to work with the Cartesian team to serve its world class customer base going forward. We look forward to the completion of the transaction and providing a long-term home for the business.”\nThe initial step in the transaction is a tender offer under which an affiliate of Blackstreet, the acquiror, will offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Cartesian, Inc. for $0.40 per share, a premium of 137% percent over the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 21, 2018.\nUpon successful acquisition of at least a majority, but less than 90%, of the outstanding shares by Acquiror, the Company will seek a shareholder vote approving a merger of the Company with a subsidiary of Acquiror, under which each Cartesian shareholder who did not tender shares will receive $0.40 per share. The Company anticipates that the shareholder meeting will take place, if at all, within 60-90 days following the expiration of the Tender Offer.\nBecause Cartesian’s stock is no longer listed on a stock exchange, it is not eligible to use the procedure under Delaware law that permits a merger to occur without a shareholder vote if more than a majority of the outstanding shares are purchased in the first-step tender offer. If 90% or more of the outstanding shares are tendered in the tender offer, the merger may be effected by a resolution adopted by the acquiror’s board of directors.\nCompletion of the merger is not subject to a financing condition but is subject to shareholder approval (if needed to approve the merger) and other customary closing conditions for a transaction of this type. Assuming satisfaction of those conditions, the Company expects the merger to close as soon as possible after shareholder approval (if needed to approve the merger), most likely in June or July, 2018.\nConsummation of the merger will result in all outstanding shares of Cartesian common stock being converted into $0.40 per share in cash. The Company’s shares of common stock will then be deregistered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act); Cartesian will no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act; and the shares of its common stock will no longer trade on any market.\nArmory Securities, LLC served as financial advisor to the Strategic Review Committee and Stinson Leonard Street as legal counsel. Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP served as legal counsel to Blackstreet Capital Holdings.\nFurther details of the Merger Agreement are contained in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout Cartesian, Inc.\nCartesian, Inc. (OTC:CRTN) is a specialist provider of consulting services and managed solutions to leaders in the global communications, technology and digital media industries.
