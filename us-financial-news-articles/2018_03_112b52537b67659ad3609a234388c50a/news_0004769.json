The figure beat estimates for a net profit of 203 million euros in a Reuters poll.\nRevenue increased 3 percent to 6.057 billion euros, better than the 6.01 billion euros expected in the poll. The increase when adjusted for trading days and currency effects was 7 percent, but slowed to a 5 percent rise in January and February, the Swiss company said.\nIt proposed a dividend of 2.50 Swiss francs, up from 2.40 francs a year earlier.
