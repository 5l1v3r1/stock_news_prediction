However, Deutsche Post could reap business opportunities from Britain’s departure from the European Union, an executive told Reuters in an interview. \n“The main issue for us is changes to customs regulations,” Tim Scharwath, head of the group’s global forwarding and freight division, said. “But as a logistics expert, that could also present us with opportunities and we will invest in staff and systems if we need to.” \nThe group is not yet seeing any impact on its freight business from global trade tensions. \n“A trade war between the EU and the U.S. would not be good for anyone, a dispute between the U.S. and China would also be bad. But until now we have not seen any effect from the debate on trade restrictions,” Scharwath said. \nHis comments echo those of Lufthansa’s air freight arm, Lufthansa Cargo, which saw profits jump last year and said it was optimistic for 2018. \nScharwath said 2017 was the best year for air freight since 2010. \n“We are confident that this trend will continue in 2018. The development of ocean freight is harder to predict,” he said. \nDeutsche Post’s freight division experienced difficulties over the last couple of years due to a failed IT restructuring and Scharwath, a former manager at Kuehne + Nagel, was brought in to improve the unit’s fortunes. \nHe said he was concentrating on improving volumes, and profit margins on existing volumes. \n“When global economies are doing well, it’s easier, but you can also grow when the market drops,” he said.
