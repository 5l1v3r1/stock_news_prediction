He will also get to pick two more directors to stand for election at the meeting, subject to the current board's approval.\nStarboard, which owns about 4.5 percent of Newell, wants to replace CEO Michael Polk and the company's entire board, arguing that Newell has been performing poorly since buying Jarden in 2016.\nThe Jeffrey Smith-led hedge fund had nominated a 12-member slate that included former Newell directors to replace the current nine-member board.\nStarboard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.\nIcahn is known for going up against other high-profile activist investors, famously taking on Pershing Square Capital Management's Bill Ackman more than four years ago over his bet against Herbalife .\n\"Icahn is an unusual white knight, whose arrival might save (Newell's management) from losing all the board positions to Starboard,\" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.\n\"Management clearly expected to lose to Starboard and welcomed Icahn to save them,\" he added.\nNewell said Icahn's views on strategy aligned with those of the company. It said last week that Starboard had not bothered to approach its management or the board to better understand its performance.\nIcahn's designated directors include his son Brett, Andrew Langham, Courtney Mather and Patrick Campbell, who was also named Newell's non-executive chairman.\nNewell's shares, which have fallen 3 percent since Starboard launched its proxy fight, rose 5 percent to $29.95 in premarket trading on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T13:12:21.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
