His range of responsibilities included fundraising, corporate finance/governance, legal and HR functions, transatlantic M&A, business development and dealmaking for strategic planning.\nAmong others, his CFO duties included the fundraising and company development strategy of ESBATech AG, a Zurich-based biotechnology company, that resulted in the uplift to the Nr. 1 position of Switzerland's 2006 list of “Top 50 Growth Companies” and the closing of a large Preferred Series B round led by a reknowned U.S. syndicate. Further, the execution of a transatlantic company development strategy resulted in the acquisition of the Company's ophthalmology portfolio by Alcon, Inc., in 2009 and the demerger of all other assets into Delenex Therapeutics AG, that in 2017 were acquired by Cell Medica Ltd.\nOrigenis' CEO Michael Almstetter commented: “We are delighted to expand our executive management team with Thomas. With his proven track record in fundraising, M&A and exits, he brings in a sound understanding of capital markets and an established network of high caliber relationships with institutional investors and investment banks, particularly in the U.S. As we have an upcoming financing round ahead of us, we are very confident that Thomas will help us to steer Origenis in a successful direction.”\nNotes\nOrigenis GmbH ( www.origenis.com ) is a privately-held German biopharmaceutical company developing brain-penetrating highly selective small molecule medicines and diagnostics for a variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases.\nOrigenis leverages its unique capabilities in drug design, compound synthesis and characterization to engineer a continuous stream of proprietary IP-protected new chemical entities capable of permeating the blood-brain barrier. Origenis’ approach has been validated by multiple partners resulting in a significant IP and R&D portfolio that ensures strong patent protection until at least 2032.\nOrigenis’ lead product candidates address novel, clinically-validated targets Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) and Death Associated Kinase 1 (DAPK1), both of which are associated with neurodegeneration in a variety of chronic and acute brain diseases, including Parkinson‘s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and traumatic brain injury, among others.\nThese two internal therapeutic key pipeline programs are complemented by Origenis' proprietary PET tracer programs, that enable a precision medicine approach, open new avenues towards innovative, robust and shortened clinical development pathways with potential for conditional approval after Phase II, and represent a diagnostic tool on its own to enhance drug development and increase overall probability of success.\nThe combination of its therapeutic with the proprietary PET tracer programs not only forms a sound basis for further clinical development, but also differentiates Origenis from all of its competitors.\nOrigenis is seeking to raise USD 30 mill. in a Preferred Series A Equity Financing to advance its internal key pipeline candidates towards IND and clinical Phase I and is looking forward to building a transatlantic syndicate of institutional investors.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005684/en/\nOrigenis GmbH\nMichael Almstetter, +49 (0)89 7801 676 0\nCEO\nmichael.almstetter@origenis.com\nSource: Origenis GmbH", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005684/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.origenis.com&esheet=51773606&newsitemid=20180315005684&lan=en-US&anchor=www.origenis.com&index=1&md5=ede542b651aaa50fc3dea02b4d2c31ea"], "published": "2018-03-15T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T17:27:10.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
