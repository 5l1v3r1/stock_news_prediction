Not good for the stock market,\" he said. \"But when the piece ran, there was no tape. It was kind of just a really embarrassing story. [...] The bears needed a tape. They didn't get one.\"\nThe shorts Cramer compared the major averages' positions on Friday to \"a coiled spring, ready to jump higher\" because of how oversold the market was before the weekend.\nHe argued that Monday's rally was sparked by traders starting to \"cover\" their short positions, or buy back borrowed shares of stocks in order to unravel their shorts.\n\"Remember, though, almost all rallies begin with short-covering,\" the \"Mad Money\" host noted.\nFacebook The last thing that contributed to the resurgence was that the market's worst-acting stocks stocks — namely Facebook — started to stabilize, Cramer said.\n\"The privacy issue caused the stock to fall at one point [on Monday] to levels hit by the stock of Wells Fargo after its cross-selling scandal and Target ... after its data breach,\" he said.\nFacebook's stock is now factoring in almost no growth, trading at a discount to the average stock in the S&P 500 based on 2018 earnings estimates. But given that the company put up 40 percent growth in 2017, Cramer wasn't necessarily worried.\n\"Sure, there will be people who de-friend the social media titan, but advertisers still love it,\" he said. \"If this rally is going to continue, Facebook needs to bring in an outside investigator whom the feds trust to determine what went wrong and tell them what they need to change. Doing that would send the stock up a quick $10. That would reverberate through the rest of the market.\"\nFinal thoughts \"My advice here is to go over your portfolio,\" Cramer said. \"If you own a stock that didn't go up today, you've got a real problem on your hands. If your stocks did go up, maybe let them run a bit, but don't get greedy. We're not out of the woods yet and it's very important that the Chinese decide to give Apple, Intel and Boeing a pass on their tariff hit list. Even so, things look a heck of a lot better than they did a few days ago.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's recipe for the market recovery show chapters Cramer pinpoints what sparked the rally: China, 60 Minutes, short-covering and Facebook 19 Hours Ago | 12:20 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple and Facebook.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
