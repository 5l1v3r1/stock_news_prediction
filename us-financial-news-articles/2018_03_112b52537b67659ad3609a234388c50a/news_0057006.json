He posted the third-most points scored in a game this season while adding 15 rebounds and four assists.\nAndrew Wiggins had 17 points, and Nemanja Bjelica finished with 14 for the Timberwolves, who on Monday were upset by the struggling Memphis Grizzlies.\nTowns scored from the inside and outside. He hit 19 of 32 shots, including six 3-point attempts. He threw down a one-handed dunk midway through the third quarter, and Jeff Teague followed with a 3-pointer that pushed Minnesota’s lead to 86-74.\nThe Timberwolves took a 98-88 lead into the fourth, and Towns opened the quarter with a 3-pointer as Minnesota tried to put away the Hawks.\nHowever, Atlanta’s Mike Muscala, who scored a career-high 24 points, hit a 3-pointer from the corner that trimmed the Timberwolves’ lead to 110-104 with 4:31 to play.\nTowns answered with five straight points to help Minnesota hold off Atlanta and maintain its playoff position. Towns had 17 points in the fourth quarter.\nThe Timberwolves moved from eighth place to seventh place in the Western Conference thanks to the Wednesday results. Minnesota leads the eighth-place Utah Jazz by a half-game and the ninth-place Los Angeles Clippers by 1 1/2 games.\nMinnesota remains without All-Star Jimmy Butler, who injured his knee in late February. Coach Tom Thibodeau told reporters Tuesday that Butler is improving rapidly but has not been cleared for contact. No timetable has been set for Butler’s return.\nTaurean Prince scored 21 points, and Isaiah Taylor finished with 20 points for the Hawks, who went 1-5 on their six-game road trip. Atlanta returns home to host the playoff-bound Philadelphia 76ers on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:06:55.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
