(NYSE: ATV) (\"Acorn\" or the \"Company\"), today announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The Company is completing its final audited financial statements which will be filed with its Annual Report on Form 20-F.\nIn 2017, Acorn experienced a moderate year-over-year decline in revenues as the Company continued to streamline its business operations. In August 2017, the Company announced the partial divestiture of its HJX electronic learning products business, which reduced revenues but allowed the Company to lower operating expenses, increase margins and focus on expanding its already profitable businesses and brands.\nAcorn placed a strong emphasis on the e-commerce channel in 2017 with positive results, primarily due to growing momentum in sales of its proprietary Babaka posture correction products throughout the year, despite some choppiness at the end of the year. This drove an improvement in gross margin to 62.1%, as compared to 51.2% in 2016. Total operating expenses decreased 2.9% in 2017 compared with 2016 despite a $6.0 million gain on the sale of non-core real estate assets in 2016 which offset operating expenses in the year ago period. Operating loss improved to $7.3 million compared to an operating loss of $9.3 million in 2016.\nDuring 2017, the Company received dividends from and recorded gains from the sale of shares of Yimeng Software Technology Co., Ltd. (\"Yimeng\"), a publicly traded company in China and recorded other income of approximately $12.2 million. The Company recorded a net profit of $4.9 million and closed the year with a cash position of $21.1 million.\nAcorn anticipates further liquidation of non-core assets, including a potential sale or other liquidity generating transaction involving non-core real property in Shanghai, which has a carrying value of approximately $16.5 million. The Company may also sell additional shares of Yimeng from time to time or sell out its position in Yimeng based on market factors and its other investment and capital requirements.\nIn 2018 and beyond, Acorn will continue to emphasize the e-commerce channel and plans to introduce new products and product line extensions, as well as incubate new businesses within the Group. The Company continually evaluates new business opportunities and is also exploring several other new areas of potential growth.\nPreliminary Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017:\nTotal net revenues were $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, down 8.5% from $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the partial exit from the HJX electronic learning device business, partially offset by an increase in e-commerce sales of posture correction and other products.\nCost of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.1 million, down 29.8% from $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.5 million, up 11.8% from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, despite the lower total net revenues for the period. Gross margin was 62.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 51.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in gross margin was due to a larger proportion of higher margin e-commerce sales and products in the product mix.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.4 million, down 49.1% from $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower selling and marketing expenses associated with the exit from the HJX business as well as a reduction in general and administrative expenses due to lower labor expenses and stock based compensation.\nLoss from operations was $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to loss from operations of $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOther expense was $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to other income of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company recorded an income tax benefit of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to income tax benefit of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income was $23,071 in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to net loss of $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Acorn's cash and cash equivalents, with restricted cash, totaled $21.1 million, as compared to $25.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had repurchased 1,162 ADSs at an average price $16.84 per ADS under its share repurchase program, which was approved by the Board of Directors on December 8, 2017.\nPreliminary Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal net revenues were $22.3 million in 2017, down 9.1% from $24.5 million in 2016. The decrease in revenues was largely attributable to the partial exit from the HJX electronic learning device business announced in the third quarter of 2017.\nCost of sales in 2017 was $8.4 million, down 29.5% from $12.0 million in 2016.\nGross profit in 2017 was $13.9 million, up 10.3% from $12.6 million in 2016. Gross margin was 62.1% in 2017, up from 51.2% in 2016. The increase in gross profit was largely attributable to a larger proportion of higher margin e-commerce sales and products in the product mix.\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 were $21.2 million, down slightly from operating expenses of $21.8 million in 2016. Operating expenses for 2016 were reduced by the impact of a $6.0 million gain from the sale of non-core real estate assets, which partially offset operating expense for the period. There was no such gain in 2017.\nLoss from operations was $7.3 million in 2017, as compared to a loss from operations of $9.3 million in 2016. The loss from operations for 2016 benefited from the $6.0 million gain from the sale of real estate assets.\nShare-based compensation was $25,000 in 2017, as compared to $658,000 in 2016.\nOther income was $12.2 million in 2017, primarily due to dividends and gains from sales of Yimeng shares. This compares to other income of $18.1 million in 2016, which was also primarily attributable to gains from sales of Yimeng shares.\nNet income was $4.9 million in 2017 as compared to net income of $3.4 million in 2016.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET (5:30 a.m. PT), March 7, 2018, to discuss financial results.
