It aims to supply 10 percent of the world’s lithium in four years.\nPrices for lithium have more than doubled in the past two years on forecasts for massive demand from the electric vehicle industry. That has sparked work on a flurry of new mines and expansion plans for existing ones.\nPLATINUM PENALTY Zimbabwean Vice President Constantino Chiwenga told the conference Zimbabwe will impose a 15 percent penalty tax from Jan 1, 2019, on exports of platinum producers who do not build refining facilities in the southern African country.\nThe tax has been mooted since 2013 and been delayed a number of times to provide producers with time to comply.\nHis presentation showed that the tax would eventually fall to 5 percent without giving a specific timeframe, while companies could also qualify for a lower tax depending on how much product they were refining domestically.\nZimbabwe has some of the world’s largest platinum reserves but is keen to industrialise an economy that is still largely reliant on primary commodity production focused on agriculture and mineral extraction.\nPlatinum producers in Zimbabwe include Zimplats, a unit of South Africa’s Impala Platinum, Anglo American Platinum and Sibanye-Stillwater.\nAmplats in December said it was nearing completion of a platinum group metal smelter at its Unki mine in Zimbabwe.\nImplats said last year that “neither the smelter nor the export levy is affordable” and could result in the closure of its Mimosa mine.
