The Company is extending the expiration date and increasing the amount of shares authorized for repurchase as part of its continued efforts to further improve total shareholder return, and expects repurchases may offset the distribution of shares related to the termination of the BankFinancial National Association Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Pursuant to this extended and increased share repurchase authorization, there are 665,476 shares of common stock authorized for repurchase through April 30, 2019.\nThe authorization permits shares to be repurchased in open market or negotiated transactions, and pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The authorization will be utilized at management’s discretion, subject to price, volume and other internal limitations that will be established by the Company’s Board of Directors, and to the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other applicable legal requirements. Share repurchases will be funded from available working capital.\nThe authorization does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares at any given price per share at any time. The authorization may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors, as well as internal restrictions on trading in the Company's shares during specific time periods, may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases.\nBankFinancial Corporation is the holding company for BankFinancial, NA, a full-service, community-oriented bank providing financial services to individuals, families and businesses through 19 full-service banking offices, located in Cook, DuPage, Lake and Will Counties, Illinois.
