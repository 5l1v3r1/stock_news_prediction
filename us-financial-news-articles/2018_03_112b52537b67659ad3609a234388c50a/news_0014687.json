(IAR) that is published today, together with the Annual Report of ING Bank N.V..\nThe title reflects ING's purpose of empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. In 2017, we again saw rapid growth in interactions with customers through mobile devices. With our Customer Promise to be clear and easy, available anytime and anywhere, to empower and to keep getting better, we've established ourselves as a leader in digital banking.\nIn Retail Banking, the overall number of customers increased to 37.4 million in 2017, up more than four million since the launch of the Think Forward strategy in 2014. The number of primary relationships - customers with a current account with recurring income and at least one other product - grew to 10.8 million. We're on track to meet our ambition of 14 million primary customers by 2020. Based on a rolling average, we were rated number one in terms of NPS in seven of our 13 retail markets in 2017.\nING Wholesale Banking's solid performance demonstrated the skills that differentiate us in the market, including our strong sector expertise in industry lending and capabilities in areas like payments and cash management, working capital solutions and financial markets. We'll further develop Wholesale Banking as a client focused franchise that offers a consistent experience across borders.\nAt the same time that we transform ING and prepare for the future, we must also ensure that our day-to-day operations meet the highest standards and that we continue to live up to the expectations of customers and society. This includes ensuring that critical non-financial risk areas, such as customer due diligence and anti-money laundering measures, stay top of mind and are supported by a structural approach and strong foundations.\nOur sustainability information is also provided in the IAR as sustainability is embedded in ING's purpose and strategy. In 2017 we decided to focus our sustainability efforts on contributing to a low-carbon and self-reliant society as we think this will have the most impact both for our customers and society. For businesses, this includes increasing financing for responsible companies while reducing financing for carbon-intensive sectors, continuing our involvement in the circular economy and increasing financing aimed at promoting social progress. For customers, our approach to promoting a self-reliant society includes providing them with tools and insights that improve their financial decision-making and resilience.\nThe IAR and the Annual Report of ING Bank N.V., are available on a special annual report landing page on ING's website ing.com . This page includes all relevant downloads, and an accessible and engaging overview of the key figures and highlights of the year.\nING today also published the proxy materials for its annual General Meeting (AGM), to be held on Monday, 23 April 2018, in Amsterdam. The proxy materials, including the agenda for the AGM, will be available as of 3 pm CET at www.ing.com/agm . The agenda includes a proposal to the AGM to amend the Executive Board remuneration policy and to re-appoint Eric Boyer de la Giroday as a member of the Supervisory Board. The reappointment will be effective immediately at the end of the Annual General Meeting of 23 April 2018. As announced in 2017, Jeroen van der Veer will step down from the Supervisory Board as per the end of the AGM in 2018. He has been a member of the Supervisory Board since 2009 and was reappointed for a period of one year in 2017. As announced earlier it is the intention of the Supervisory Board to elect Hans Wijers as its chairman to succeed Jeroen van der Veer in that capacity per the end of the AGM 2018.\nING will also file today its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2017 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
