All three were sent home from South Africa.\nMagellan has not put a price on the sponsorship deal and did not immediately return calls seeking more details, but Australian media reported it was worth about A$20 million ($15.30 million).\nThe relatively low profile company’s 2017 annual report said it struck the Cricket Australia deal to improve its familiarity with Australians and forecast a “material increase in its currently modest marketing expenditure” in part because of the sponsorship.\nRelated Coverage Cricket: Warner apologises for 'my part' in tampering scandal Cricket: Bancroft sorry for sticky tape lie Cricket: Ball-tampering punishments don't fit the crime - Warne Moral clauses are commonplace in sports sponsorship deals, allowing both parties to exit if the other engages in conduct that might negatively impact on the image, goodwill and reputation of their partner.\n“Any celebrity must be aware that large corporates will not tolerate conduct which might damage their brand,” said Andy Brian from UK law firm Gordons.\n“We have seen this many times before... I would not be surprised to see more action by other sponsors in the coming days and weeks.”\nMore than 52 percent of Australians thought suspending players for a season was the most appropriate punishment for ball tampering, a poll by Australian cable television network Sky News found. Nearly a third supported a lifetime ban.\nINDIVIDUAL SPONSORS ALSO WALK Commonwealth Bank, Australia’s biggest lender, said it was dumping captain Smith as an ambassador “in light of recent circumstances”. It also did not disclose the price of that relationship.\nBreakfast cereal maker Sanitarium Australia, which is owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, also fired Smith as a “Weet-Bix brand ambassador”.\nAxed Australian cricket captain Steve Smith is escorted by Police officers as he leaves the O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko “Weet-Bix ambassadors represent our brand values of trust and integrity, and they speak to everything that is good about being Australian,” said Sanitarium executive general manager Todd Saunders.\n“Based on the ball tampering incident and the findings of Cricket Australia’s investigation, we are unable to continue our relationship with Steve Smith,” Saunders added.\nASICS cancelled sponsorship deals with both vice-captain Warner and Bancroft, describing their actions as “not something that ASICS tolerates and are contrary to the values the company stands for”.\nASICS was the second sponsor to abandon Warner in two days, after electronics maker LG scrapped a newly-inked sponsorship deal with the 31-year-old.\nSpecsavers, a Cricket Australia sponsor, said it was “shocked and disappointed” and “in no way condones the behaviour of those involved”, but did not comment on its future with a sport seen by most Australians as the embodiment of fairness.\nThe ball-tampering incident occurred at the climax of talks about a five-year broadcast rights deal with Australian television networks.\nAustralia’s Channel 9, which holds the broadcast contract, won the rights to the Australian Open tennis grand slam on Thursday, raising questions as to whether it will have the money - or inclination - to compete.\nOther Cricket Australia sponsors stood by the organisation.\nA spokesman for Yum! Brands Inc, owner of fast food chain KFC, a Cricket Australia sponsor, said it was “pleased that Cricket Australia has dealt with this incident swiftly for the benefit of the game and its fans” without commenting further.\nSlideshow (2 Images) A spokesperson for Toyota Corp said the carmaker supported “Cricket Australia’s decision to initiate an independent review into the conduct and culture of the Australian men’s teams”.\n($1 = 1.3075 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Byron Kaye and Nick Mulvenney in SYDNEY, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T04:28:47.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
