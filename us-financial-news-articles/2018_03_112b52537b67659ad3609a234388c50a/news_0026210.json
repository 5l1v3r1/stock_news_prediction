It also said its day-to-day operations would continue as usual during the restructuring process. \niHeartMedia said it believes its cash on hand, together with cash generated from continuing operations, will be sufficient to fund and support the business during the bankruptcy proceedings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T12:37:55.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
