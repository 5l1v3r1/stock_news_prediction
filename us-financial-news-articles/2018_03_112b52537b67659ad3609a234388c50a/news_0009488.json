REUTERS/Joseph White Uber’s trucks are being operated through “Uber Freight,” a shipping-on-demand app.\nIn a YouTube clip released Tuesday, Uber said it would integrate manual trucking with self-driving trucks by deploying the former for short hauls and the latter for longer distances. bit.ly/2I3SQGl\nSelf-driving trucks will also require the “hands-on work that only truckers can do,” the video added.\nThe Uber logo is seen on a screen in Singapore August 4, 2017.
