DST Global, which is headquartered in Hong Kong, did not immediately return a request for comment. \nA $5.6 billion valuation would more than quadruple Robinhood's size and make the start-up worth just over a third of online brokerage E*Trade . In April 2017, DST led a $110 million funding round in Robinhood that valued the company at $1.3 billion. \nRobinhood launched its commission-free stock trading app about three years ago.
