Law experts see the Austrian case as potentially having implications for other major infrastructure projects.\nAustrian Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache also welcomed the court ruling. “This could save and create tens of thousands of jobs,” he said in a statement.\nVienna Airport, which handled 24 million passengers last year and can currently deal with 30 million per year, says it needs the third runway to handle a further increase in passenger numbers, ensure Austrian businesses’ competitiveness and cope with rival foreign airports in Munich, Zurich and Bratislava.\nSeveral airlines, including Ryanair, British Airways owner IAG’s low cost unit Vueling, and Easyjet have announced expansion plans for Vienna in recent months.\nThe administrative court was not immediately available for comment.
