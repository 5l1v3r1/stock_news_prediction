The court will be closed to the public when witnesses give testimony and are questioned.\nThe number and nature of the charges, which involve multiple complainants and are alleged to have occurred in Australia decades ago, haven’t been disclosed. Mr. Pell, the highest-level Vatican official to face charges in sexual-abuse scandals that have beset the Catholic Church globally, has denied any wrongdoing.\nOn the opening day of the hearing, Robert Richter, a lawyer for the 76-year-old cardinal, said the defense will argue that correct guidelines weren’t followed during the investigation.\nRelated \nVatican Finance Chief George Pell Faces March Hearing Over Sex-Abuse Charges (Oct. 5, 2017) George Pell, Vatican Finance Chief, Will Plead Not Guilty to Sex-Abuse Charges (July 26, 2017) George Pell, Vatican Finance Chief, Charged With Sexual Abuse (June 29, 2017) Mr. Richter questioned police processes, asking whether there was a presumption of guilt in the investigation into the alleged offenses. He told the court that there was protocol for the police when interviewing high-profile people, but it “was not followed.”\nCardinal Pell was granted a leave of absence from his job as is the Vatican’s finance chief by Pope Francis after police in June brought charges against him . Mr. Richter last year said the cardinal will plead not guilty to all charges if the matter proceeds to trial. One charge has been withdrawn, prosecutor Mark Gibson told the court Monday.\nAs the hearing began in the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court, Cardinal Pell sat behind his defense team as lawyers and judge Belinda Wallington went through about 30 minutes of procedural matters. \nBorn in 1941 in the historic gold-rush town of Ballarat, northwest of Melbourne, Cardinal Pell studied for the priesthood in Australia and Rome. In late 1966 he was ordained a priest for the diocese of Ballarat, then rose through the church’s ranks in Australia, working in parishes in the Melbourne region and in senior roles in Catholic education.\nIn 1987, he was ordained as auxiliary bishop of Melbourne’s archdiocese, before being appointed as the seventh metropolitan archbishop by Pope John Paul II in 1996, and then archbishop of Sydney five years later.\nIn February 2014, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Pell prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy at the Vatican. He was also appointed to the international, nine-member Council of Cardinals, which advises the pope on overhauling the Vatican and governance of the church world-wide.\nWrite to Robb M.
