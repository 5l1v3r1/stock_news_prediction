Mike Myatt, Chairman of N2Growth said, \"Landelahni has developed a reputation among clients for its results-driven executive search, leadership development, and diversified consulting services. With the acquisition of an interest in Landelahni, N2Growth gains a talented team of professionals who all have deep operating experience across multiple industries.\"\nMyatt additionally noted, \"...perhaps the most critical aspect of this deal is its structure.\" Effective immediately, Landelahni will operate as N2Growth Africa which will preserve Landelahni's BBBEE Level 1 status as a Black Owned African firm, which makes N2Growth the only major multinational professional services firm to hold this status.\nSandra Burmeister, CEO and Co-Founder of Landelahni, (who will now serve as N2Growth's Regional President covering Africa) said, \"We are thrilled to have found a global partner that mirrors our culture and values. The synergies between both businesses were so clear from the outset that it was a natural evolution for Landelahni to merge with N2Growth. Many firms come to Africa with a buyers mindset, and what we truly appreciated about N2Growth is their nuanced understanding of how to blend geo-politics and business acumen to bring their formidable global presence to Africa in a way that truly benefits local ownership and local markets.\"\nMike Kerouac, N2Growth's CEO said, \"Landelahni's deep history, phenomenal track record and strong reputation across the entire continent is well known. It is also an opportunity for us to add value to Landelahni's client relationships by providing them access to our global platform and innovative technology. We share a deep commitment to Africa and look forward to a long and successful collaboration\" said Kerouac.\n\"We have always believed that a global perspective with a local footprint was the right approach for us to provide our clients with a customized holistic suite of search and consulting services. I am very proud to announce the acquisition of Landelahni Group, which provides N2Growth a dominant local presence across sub-Saharan Africa with their offices in Johannesburg, Lagos, and Nairobi. This further expands our presence in EMEAA,\" said Jaco Erasmus, N2Growth's EMEAA CEO.\nAbout N2Growth\nN2Growth is a global leadership consultancy with practice areas in executive search, culture shaping, leadership development, strategy, organizational design, risk, digital transformation and executive coaching.
