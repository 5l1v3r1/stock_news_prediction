Malmström also noted that, if Trump follows through with his steel tariff threat, the EU will strike back with tariffs on U.S. products including bourbon, orange juice, cranberries and peanut butter. Fortune \nShoe Tariffs \nThe Trump administration is considering new tariffs on imports of shoes, clothing and consumer electronics from China. Suppliers there are warning that this may have a ripple effect on U.S. multinationals such as Nike and Walmart. “I hope Trump realizes that everything has a price. Americans also have things they need to sell to China and the world, so he should think of the consequences,” said glass lampshade entrepreneur Eric Li, who supplies Home Depot and Lowe’s. Bloomberg \nBlackBerry Sues Facebook \nBlackBerry has sued Facebook, claiming that the company’s WhatsApp and Instagram services infringe on BlackBerry patents covering security and user interfaces. The Canadian firm claims that time-stamps on messages and the tagging of people in photographs are covered by its patents, as is functionality designed to protect users from being inundated with notifications. BlackBerry wants a jury trial. Wall Street Journal \nWeinstein Deal Collapses Again \nThe Weinstein Company’s rescue deal has fallen through yet again, after prospective buyers, led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, found the disgraced movie mogul’s firm was at least $50 million more in debt than it had let on. “After signing and entering into the confirmatory diligence phase, we have received disappointing information about the viability of completing this transaction. As a result, we have decided to terminate this transaction,” Contreras-Sweet said. Guardian Advertisement Around the Water Cooler \nTrump Sues California \nThe Trump administration has sued California over laws that protect undocumented immigrants from federal agents. Administration officials said other states could face similar action if they follow California’s lead. The laws stop employers from helping federal agents detain undocumented workers, stop local law enforcements from telling the feds when detainees are released from custody, and set up an inspection program for federal immigration detention centers. L.A. Times \nStormy Sues Trump \nAdult film star Stormy Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, has sued President Trump, claiming that her notorious nondisclosure agreement with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is invalid because Trump never signed it. Daniels says she and Trump had an affair that ran from 2006 through 2007. She also says Cohen has recently been trying to stop her from speaking out about the alleged affair, “surreptitiously” initiating a “bogus arbitration proceeding” against the actress. NBC \nChina Insurance \nChina’s insurance regulator, which recently seized Anbang Insurance Group as part of a risk-reduction drive, has drastically lengthened the list of rules governing insurance firms in the country. The new rules mandate that insurers must have clear shareholding structures and must tell the China Insurance Regulatory Commission who the controlling entity is. The regulator claims it currently has trouble authenticating fund sources. CNBC \nTrade Wars Aren’t Good \nAlthough President Trump seems to think trade wars are a good thing, history suggests otherwise. As political science professor Mary Anne Madeira writes for Fortune , the last full-blown trade war was a result of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which aimed to protect American agriculture from outside competition. It arguably helped precipitate the Second World War. Fortune \nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer . Find previous editions here , and sign up for other Fortune newsletters here .
