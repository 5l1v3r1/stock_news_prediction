The charter term will be seven years from delivery, with subsequent purchase obligations by the charterer. Delivery of the vessels is expected in April and their aggregate EBITDA contribution is estimated to be approximately $20 million per year.\nConcurrently, the Company has agreed to sell the 1,700 TEU container vessel SFL Avon to an unrelated third party. This vessel has been operated in the short term charter market and net sales proceeds will be approximately $12.5 million. Delivery to the new owner is expected in April 2018, and we expect a minor book gain in connection with the sale.\nOle B. Hjertaker, CEO of Ship Finance Management AS, said in a comment: \"We are very pleased to continue building our relationship with one of the world's leading container lines. This transaction offers an attractive cash flow from a strong counterpart and with limited downside risk. The SFL Avon was our only container vessel operated in the short term charter market, and in light of the recent upswing in values in the sector we have decided to sell the vessel as we evaluate various growth prospects. We are seeing increasing opportunities to deploy capital in 2018 and we remain focused on growing our fleet and charter backlog.\"\nMarch 14, 2018\nThe Board of Directors\nShip Finance International Limited\nHamilton, Bermuda\nQuestions can be directed to Ship Finance Management AS:\nInvestor and Analyst Contacts:\nHarald Gurvin, Chief Financial Officer, Ship Finance Management AS\n+47 23 11 40 09\nAndr√© Reppen, Senior Vice President, Ship Finance Management AS\n+47 23 11 40 55\nMedia Contact:\nOle B.

These statements are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including Ship Finance management's examination of historical operating trends. Although Ship Finance believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, Ship Finance cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. Important factors that, in the Company's view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this presentation include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions including fluctuations in charter hire rates and vessel values, changes in demand in the tanker market as a result of changes in OPEC's petroleum production levels and worldwide oil consumption and storage, changes in the Company's operating expenses including bunker prices, dry-docking and insurance costs, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSource:Ship Finance International Limited", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T18:01:35.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
