(on behalf of Slate Canadian Real Estate Opportunity Fund I L.P. (“SCREO”)) and Cominar. The purchase price was partially satisfied from the proceeds of the sale of 12,778,800 subscription receipts of the REIT (the “Subscription Receipts”) at a price of $8.10 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of approximately $103.5 million, which closed on January 26, 2018.\nThe Acquisition Properties are strategically located in markets where the REIT has an existing presence and total 995,091 square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), increasing the REIT’s total GLA to 7.4 million square feet. The Acquisition Properties are 93% occupied, including a vendor lease from Cominar, and have a weighted average lease term of 4.8 years.\n“The purchase of the Acquisition Properties is an off-market transaction that provides a number of benefits to unitholders, including attractive economics at $192 per square foot and immediate earnings accretion,” said Scott Antoniak, the REIT’s Chief Executive Officer. “This acquisition further strengthens and diversifies the REIT’s tenant credit profile with significant high quality tenants, including Canadian governments and multinational corporations.”\nSummary of the Acquisitions\nAsset Location GLA (square feet) Occupancy (1) 81 Albert Street Moncton, NB 64,954 100 % 84-86 Chain Lake Drive Halifax, NS 77,666 97 % 570 Queen Street Fredericton, NB 69,708 87 % 225 Duncan Mill Road Toronto, ON 155,872 89 % 105 Moatfield Toronto, ON 248,981 100 % 95 Moatfield Toronto, ON 156,426 100 % 5500 North Service Road Burlington, ON 221,484 80 % Total/weighted average 995,091 93 % (1) Includes the impact of a head-lease arrangement for 109,930 square feet of GLA at 225 Duncan Mill Road\nSubscription Receipts\nAs a result of the completion of the Acquisitions, each of the 12,778,800 outstanding Subscription Receipts will automatically be exchanged for one Unit and a cash distribution equivalent payment of $0.125 (being equal to the aggregate amount of distributions paid by the REIT per Unit for which record dates have occurred since the closing of the Subscription Receipt offering), less any applicable withholding taxes. Trading in the Subscription Receipts has been halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the REIT expects that the Subscription Receipts will be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange after the close of markets today and that the Units issued in exchange for the Subscription Receipts will immediately commence trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nThe REIT further expects that in the upcoming days, holders of Subscription Receipts will receive the Units and the distribution equivalent payment to which they are entitled.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain information herein constitutes “forward-looking information” as defined under Canadian securities laws which reflect management’s expectations regarding objectives, plans, goals, strategies, future growth, results of operations, performance, business prospects and opportunities of the REIT.
