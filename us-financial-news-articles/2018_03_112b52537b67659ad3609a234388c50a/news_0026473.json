The government has also developed interest in the emerging blockchain technologies that support cryptocurrency transactions, prompting steps to reverse measures taken to crackdown on cryptocurrencies , which are extremely popular in South Korea\nFor more on cryptocurrencies in South Korea, watch Fortune’s video:\nKang Young-soo, head of the FSC’s cryptocurrency division, acknowledged that the country’s financial regulator had engaged a “third party view” but declined to confirm on the specifics of the policy. He also admitted that the FSC was exploring plans to “advance blockchain-related technologies and effectively regulate crypto-trading” at a recent industry forum.\nICOs are a form fundraising that allows investors to purchase stakes in a new startup in cryptocurrency, often in digital tokens related to the company’s services, rather than in traditional currency. But initial ICO investors are often individuals rather than corporate institutional investors, as in traditional initial public offerings, while the recent proliferation of ICOs has increased the risk of fraud , according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ICOs are also banned in China .\nA potential new ICO policy follows other steps to loosen South Korea’s tight restrictions on trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Last month, the government announced it was considering a formal licensing system to help regulate the country’s virtual currency exchanges, which it had last year entertained shuttering outright over fears that the overheated market was also being used to launder money and evade taxes .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T08:40:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
