However, only three bodies have been recovered,” Allman said.\nHe did not say whether the three missing children could have survived the crash.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol crash investigators were trying to determine what caused the car to veer off the road in good weather, Allman said, and coroner’s investigators were conducting autopsies on the remains that had been recovered.\nThe sheriff said the crash scene was unusual because the Yukon had traveled some 75 feet (23 meters )along a dirt pullout before plummeting off the cliff and no skid marks or brake marks were found.\nHe asked that anyone who had contact with the family in the days before the incident contact law enforcement.\nReporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T06:31:23.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
