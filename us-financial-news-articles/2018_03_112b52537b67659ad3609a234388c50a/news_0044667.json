The dollar was up 0.35 percent against the Japanese currency.\nThe dollar's strength against the yen was also due to Japanese factors such as growing views that a political scandal in Tokyo could deepen, with a figure in a cronyism controversy surrounding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe due to testify in parliament on Tuesday.\nThe euro rose 0.76 percent against the greenback, with the latest comments from Jens Weidmann, Germany's likely candidate to become the European Central Bank's next president, also offering some support.\nWeidmann said market expectations of a rate hike towards the middle of next year were \"not completely unrealistic\", a view shared by the broader market, although some expect a rate hike by the first quarter of 2019.\nTraders in the currency market were also braced for a flood of Treasury issuance this week.\n\"That's pushing short-term rates up and forcing traders into sort of a wait-and-see mode, because we are not really sure how much that will impact the market more generally,\" said Schamotta.\nThe British pound rose 0.63 percent against the dollar as investors became more convinced that the Bank of England would raise interest rates in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T06:14:07.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
