Forester said the company is unable to pay to plug and abandon its wells, three of which are on state land, making the state financially responsible for cleaning them up.\n\"Aurora Gas doesn't exist anymore, we cannot go back to Aurora gas and ask them for the money to (plug and abandon) those wells,\" she said. \"It ain't going to happen.\"\nFoerster says her agency has the authority to increase bond amounts, but Foerster argued the Legislature should also act.\nOne idea she floated is to update the law so the state can require former operators to pay to clean up abandoned oil wells.\n\"Don't we want to have the ability to go back on BP, Exxon and Conoco and say, 'You guys made a boatload of money off of this, and you drilled these wells, now get back up here and clean them up.' We need you guys to take care of that,\" Forester said.\nFoerster said California and Kansas have passed similar laws.\nInformation from: KTOO-FM, http://www.ktoo.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T16:08:32.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
