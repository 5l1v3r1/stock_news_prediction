That client is typically around the age of 37 and has roughly $40,000 invested with Betterment. \n“The vast majority of our clients still make their investments based on our recommendations and our smart defaults,” said Stein, referring to the firm’s signature robo-adviser service. \nOne of the earliest and largest U.S. robo-adviser startups, Betterment had roughly 270,000 customers and $10 billion in assets under management as of July 2017. \nThe firm has continued to add services that break out from its original model, including the move last year to add human financial advisors who work alongside the firm’s investing algorithms.
