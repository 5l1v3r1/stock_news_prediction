(Nasdaq: EXAS) today announced that Paul J. Limburg, M.D., M.P.H., has been appointed the company's co-chief medical officer. Dr. Limburg is a gastroenterologist and a professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic. He is also a co-leader of the Cancer Prevention and Control program within Mayo Clinic Cancer Center.\n\"We are delighted to welcome Dr. Limburg and believe he'll play a critical leadership role in our mission to eradicate colon cancer,\" said Kevin T. Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. \"Dr. Limburg's valuable mix of cancer prevention experience in both the clinical and scientific research arenas will provide a great advantage to our company. He'll also guide the expansion of our relationships with key opinion leaders and institutions in the cancer community.\"\nWhile at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Limburg has served as medical director of Mayo Clinic Global Business Solutions (GBS), which delivers products and services that extend Mayo Clinic's specialized clinical knowledge and expertise worldwide. Dr. Limburg also served as medical director of several of Mayo Clinic's health and well-being programs.\nDr. Limburg's extensive research and clinical experience with gastrointestinal cancer makes him well suited to advise Exact Sciences where he will assess research opportunities to inform, expand and accelerate the adoption of effective colon cancer screening options such as Cologuard. He will continue to serve as a gastroenterologist with Mayo Clinic's Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, co-leader of the Cancer Prevention and Control program within Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, and principal investigator for the NCI-funded cancer prevention network clinical trials consortium. He is a medical advisory board member of Fight Colorectal Cancer, a patient education and advocacy group.\n\"I am excited to join the outstanding team at Exact Sciences that is already making extraordinary progress toward its mission of fighting colon cancer through early detection,\" Dr. Limburg said. \"Colorectal cancer is highly preventable with proper screening, yet millions of adult Americans are not being screened as recommended. As a result, colon cancer has remained the second leading cancer killer in the U.S. The company's Cologuard colon cancer screening test was developed in collaboration with Mayo Clinic and has built a strong reputation in both the patient and healthcare provider communities because of its simplicity, accuracy and effectiveness. I look forward to working with the team at Exact Sciences to continue to expand the adoption of Cologuard and to offer guidance in building out the company's cancer detection test portfolio.\"\nDr. Limburg earned a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from Augustana College, a Doctor of Medicine from Mayo Medical School, and Master of Public Health from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. He completed his internal medicine residency and gastroenterology and hepatology fellowship training at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine. Dr. Limburg also completed an advanced fellowship in preventive oncology at the National Cancer Institute.\nMayo Clinic and Dr. Limburg have a financial interest in the technology referenced in this news release. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.\nAbout Cologuard\nCologuard was approved by the FDA in August 2014 and results from Exact Sciences' prospective 90-site, point-in-time, 10,000-patient pivotal trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March 2014. Cologuard is included in the American Cancer Society's (2014) colorectal cancer screening guidelines and the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Cologuard is indicated to screen adults of either sex, 50 years or older, who are at average risk for colorectal cancer. Cologuard is not for everyone and is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high-risk individuals. False positives and false negatives do occur. Any positive test result should be followed by a diagnostic colonoscopy. Following a negative result, patients should continue participating in a screening program at an interval and with a method appropriate for the individual patient. Cologuard performance when used for repeat testing has not been evaluated or established. For more information about Cologuard, visit www.cologuardtest.com . Rx Only.\nAbout Exact Sciences Corp.\nExact Sciences Corp. is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of the deadliest forms of cancer. The company has exclusive intellectual property protecting its non-invasive, molecular screening technology for the detection of colorectal cancer.
