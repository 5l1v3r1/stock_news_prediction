We are providing clinically-proven monitoring to support patients in adopting their physicians’ guidance into their daily lives, and so close the gap between science and real-world care.”\nThe next generation Smartinhaler sensor records the date and precise time the inhaler is used and automatically transmits this to an app on the patient’s phone or tablet. Smartinhaler technology stores the history of patient medication usage patterns, allowing physicians to review and help make evidence-based decisions. The sensor design includes three buttons that help patients easily access the audio visual-reminders, battery monitoring, and Bluetooth® wireless technology.\nAdherium’s 510(k) OTC clearance paves the way for the Company’s pending consumer launch and allows for greater support of AstraZeneca’s Symbicort in the U.S.\nAbout Adherium\nAdherium is a provider of digital health solutions and a global leader in connected respiratory medical devices, with over 100,000 distributed globally.
