Uncertainty about whether that is feasible has weighed on the pound since the EU published its guidelines that same day.\n“The front end remains 80 percent priced for a May rate rise but Brexit issues are already apparent and that may weigh on the currency,” Societe Generale strategists wrote in a note.\nSterling slid nearly a third of a percent on Thursday to $1.3861. Against the euro, it was broadly flat on the day ahead of a European Central Bank policy decision due later on Thursday.\nThe pound hit a 1-1/2 month low of $1.3712 last week and was trading just 1 percent above those levels.\nAnalysts said sterling was also struggling due to a risk-off mood across markets on the back of worries about a trade war led by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, and on concerns about the effect such a trade war might have on Britain.\nA Reuters poll of analysts on Wednesday found sterling is set to trade slightly higher in a year’s time, near the $1.41 level, less than a month before Britain is formally due to leave the EU, indicating currency strategists remain optimistic London and Brussels can manage a smooth exit and transition deal.\nUnlike substantial positions underpinning the euro, speculators have trimmed bets in favour of sterling in recent weeks, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
