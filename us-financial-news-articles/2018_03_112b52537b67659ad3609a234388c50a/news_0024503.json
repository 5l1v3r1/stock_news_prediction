Since 2006 he's been integrating enterprise software systems for clients in oil and gas, manufacturing and other industrial sectors. He recently led a project that streamlined $1 billion of annual capital budget approval, enabling the process to be completed in six weeks rather than three months. This saved the manufacturer money, enabled plant improvement projects sooner and offered better ongoing visibility into capital spending. He has worked on various projects related to strategic planning, setting IT investment road maps, and implementing business process improvements focused on maximizing IT investments in project-driven organizations.\nAt Burns & McDonnell, he adds his experience to a team already skilled in technology consulting and other software solutions. Enterprise systems integration allows clients to accelerate deployment of capital, drive organizational efficiency and optimize process systems, facilities and operations.\n\"I enjoy the challenge,\" says Sinha, who works nationwide from the Houston office of Burns & McDonnell. \"This is a great opportunity to make a difference, to apply my best practices knowledge across multiple industries and to optimize IT/OT investments for clients by delivering integrated system solutions.\"\nFor photos and support materials, please visit our MEDIA KIT .\nAbout Burns & McDonnell\nBurns & McDonnell is a family of companies made up of more than 6,000 engineers, architects, construction professionals, scientists, consultants and entrepreneurs with offices across the country and throughout the world.
