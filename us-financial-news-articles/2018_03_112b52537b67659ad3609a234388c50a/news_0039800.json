And when it did, the social media company removed his app and asked that Kogan delete the data. Kogan insists he did.\nKogan's assertions directly contradict those of Facebook executives, who insist he \"lied\" in passing the data along to Cambridge Analytica.\nA Facebook representative forwarded to CNBC a statement that it claims Kogan made to the company in 2014:\n\"This app is part of a research program in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge. We are using this app for research purposes — learning about how people's Facebook behaviour can be used to better understand their psychological traits, well-being, health, etc and overcome classic problems in social science. Users of the app will be presented with a description of the types of data we gather and the scientific purpose of the data. Users will be informed that the data will be carefully protected and never used for commercial purposes .\" (The underline was made by Facebook.)\nFacebook has come under fire this week after reports emerged that political data analytics company Cambridge Analytica accessed the data of over 50 million users of the social media network without their permission. Facebook knew about the data leak back in 2015, but the public only learned after reports in the New York Times and Observer over the weekend.\nRead more about Aleksandr Kogan's email on Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T05:56:38.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
