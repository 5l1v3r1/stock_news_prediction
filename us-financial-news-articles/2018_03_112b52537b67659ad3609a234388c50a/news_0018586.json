The rules, published by the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, came a week after China’s stock regulator said the bourses should bear more responsibility in delisting enforcement. According to the draft rules, violations that could trigger a delisting include fraudulent initial public offerings, serious information distortion in financial disclosures and grave illegal activities in daily operations. China set up a delisting mechanism in 2014, but tougher delisting rules are needed to keep the stock market healthy and protect small investors’ interests, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said in a statement on Friday.
