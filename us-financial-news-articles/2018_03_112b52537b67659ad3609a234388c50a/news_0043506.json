The move tracked a surge in global appetite for high-risk assets in the wake of a Wall Street Journal report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering a visit to Beijing to begin negotiations. Currencies in Latin America followed along, with Mexico's peso hitting a six-month high against the U.S. dollar on hopes that the United States could also strike a more constructive tone in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Mexican peso closed the session up more than 1 percent, while the Brazilian real gained nearly 0.5 percent. \"The market believes that the so-called trade war is all bark and no bite,\" economists at Continuum Economics wrote in a client note. \"The mood regarding NAFTA should brighten again.\" However, analysts also warned that significant advances will be necessary in the eighth round of NAFTA talks scheduled for April for the peso to hold its gains. Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index rose 0.74 percent, largely pushed by retail giant Wal-Mart de Mexico, whose shares rose nearly 3 percent. Brazil's Bovespa climbed nearly 1 percent. Miners and steelmakers ranked among the largest gainers, with Brazil's Gerdau SA and Usinas Sider√∫rgicas de Minas Gerais SA both rising. Shares in mining giant Vale <VALE3.SA increased nearly 1 percent despite a decline in China-listed iron ore futures, largely boosting the index.
