April's forecast got a boost from upward revisions to EIA's projections for previous months.\nThe Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico will see production jump by 80,000 barrels a day, according to EIA's outlook. The basin remains the biggest driver of a recovery in U.S. shale output that began in late 2016.\nThe Eagle Ford shale, also in Texas, is seen kicking in 23,000 barrels a day towards the regions' growth. Meanwhile, North Dakota's Bakken shale and the Niobrara region in Colorado and surrounding states will each grow output by 12,000 barrels a day, EIA projects.\nDrillers across these regions use advanced technology like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to fracture rock formations and extract oil and gas from the basins.\nU.S. shale regions, source: EIA\nJust how much U.S. shale oil output can grow was a topic of debate throughout last week's CERAWeek in Houston, one of the world's biggest energy conferences.\nMany executives said the industry is on the cusp of another leap forward as producers and service companies adopt a new generation of technologies like predictive analytics and machine learning.\nTimothy Dove, president and CEO of Permian driller Pioneer Natural Resources , said the industry is at a technological \"tipping point\" that could lead to higher efficiency in the oil patch.\n\"We have the golden goose right before us, and it's our job as operators to perform at a very high level of efficiency to bring this to bear,\" he told an audience at CERAWeek.\nBut CERAWeek also brought out some naysayers, including shale drilling pioneer Mark Papa, who presided over a period of innovation as the head of EOG Resources . Papa warned that frackers have burned through the best wells in the Bakken and Eagle Ford, and it will become increasingly difficult to drill profitably there.\n\"Frankly, my sense is that the amount of total U.S. oil production growth is likely to disappoint over the next three or four years and come in below most people's expectations,\" Papa, now CEO of Centennial Resource Development , said during another CERAWeek panel.\nIn the short term, shale drillers are challenged by competition for the crews that perform hydraulic fracturing and other services as Permian business booms. Shareholder demands for frackers to rein in spending and start returning cash to investors are also seen potentially capping U.S. production growth in the medium term.\nMore from CERAWeek:\nPipeline companies develop new battle plan for environmental activists\nTrump's steel tariffs hit raw nerve in oil pipeline country\nGM's Barra says transition to EVs won't take decades\nWatch: Chevron CEO calls it 'early innings' in shale performance show chapters We're in early innings in terms of shale performance: Chevron CEO 9:16 AM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 06:44", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T15:22:08.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
