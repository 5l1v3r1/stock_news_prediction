They recorded their first monthly fall in six months, pushing the annual growth rate to a six-month low of 2.2 percent.\nBut the BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 67,478 in January from a one-year low of 61,692 in December, the sharpest monthly rise since April 2015 and far above economists’ average forecast of 62,000 in a Reuters poll.
