REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo “What are we here for? To make money,” Foote told investors at a conference in New York. “What are we trying to do? Drive efficiency, improve the network, improve the quality of our service, which will reduce our costs.”\nThe Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad, the third-largest in the U.S., said it would cut an estimated 2,200 jobs by the end of 2018 and another 4,000 in 2020.\nIt also plans to decrease locomotives in service by up to 20 percent by 2020, while also reducing the number of rail cars it uses by more than 20 percent in the same time period.\nSeveral shippers have told Reuters that service has been steadily improving from a nadir last summer, although companies such as U.S. agricultural firm Cargill Inc and coal company Murray Energy Corp are still struggling with crew and rail car shortages.\nCSX said it expects compound annual revenue growth of 4 percent in 2019 and 2020, driven by rising freight volumes and higher pricing.\nCSX also said it could raise $800 million from selling off rail lines and real estate and would spend $4.8 billion on capital like infrastructure and technology from 2018 through 2020.\nReporting by Eric M.
