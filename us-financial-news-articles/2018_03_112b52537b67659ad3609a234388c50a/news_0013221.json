A spokesman for Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn 2016, Ammeraal Beltech’s global turnover was 368 million euros. Advent acquired the company, which has 2,500 employees, in 2015, without disclosing how much it paid for it.\nSources at the time of the transaction said they believed it to be worth around 500 million euros. Advent bought it from Gilde Buy Out Partners and Parcom Capital Management which delisted the firm from Euronext Amsterdam in 2011.\nThe company was founded by Dutchman Thomas Ammeraal, who in 1950 invented a woven conveyor belt for the biscuit industry.\nHeadquartered in the town of Alkmaar, north of Amsterdam, the company merged with Germany’s Verseidag Beltech in 2000 and now produces belting systems for markets including food, airports and mail offices.\nUnder Advent’s ownership, the firm acquired belting distributors Europe-based Fogarty Belting and B&H Precision Belting in 2017, and Australian distribution partner Rydell Industrial in 2016.\nAdvent was founded in 1984, initiated its private equity strategy five years later and as of September 30 2017 was managing $42 billion in assets.\nLast week Advent agreed to buy British electronics and technology business Laird ( LRD.L ), valuing it at around 1.2 billion pounds including debt.\nIn 2016 Advent raised $13 billion for its latest fund focusing on business and financial services, healthcare, industrial, retail and consumer, and technology, media and telecommunications.\n($1 = 0.7222 pounds)\n($1 = 0.8056 euros)\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva and Clara Denina; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:48:57.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
