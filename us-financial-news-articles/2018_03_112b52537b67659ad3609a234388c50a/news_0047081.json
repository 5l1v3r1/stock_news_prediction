Return schemes usually work with consumers paying an \"upfront deposit\" when they purchase a beverage. They are then reimbursed when they return their drinks container. The government said that deposits ranged from 8p (11 cents) in Sweden to 22p in Germany.\nThe government added that a variant on the scheme could include \"cash rewards\" for returning drinks without the need for an upfront deposit. It did not announce how much the deposit would be for consumers in England.\n\"We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment – killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats,\" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said in a statement Wednesday. \"It is absolutely vital we act now to tackle this threat and curb the millions of plastic bottles a day that go unrecycled,\" he added.\nBill Bryson, the Iowa-born author and former president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, welcomed the news. \"Future generations will look back on this decision as a piece of supremely enlightened policymaking, and one that raises the prospect of the world's most beautiful country becoming free from drinks container litter at last,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T15:41:00.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
