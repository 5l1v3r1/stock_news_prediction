That's one hell of a multiple compression.\" \nDuring this pullback, he recommended three sectors to buy on the dip: Financials, industrials and tech. \n\"In the last three cycles, those are the three sectors that outperformed both cycles when you're flattening the curve to this current degree,\" he said. \n\"You want to buy dips,\" Dwyer said. \"Markets are not based on time. They're based on Fed policy.\" \nIn January, the analyst accurately predicted another pullback , and also said it was a good buying opportunity. \nOn Monday, all major indexes fell , sending market watchers into a panic and sparking mass sell-offs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 482 points at its low, closing 335.60 points lower at 24,610.91. The S&P 500 declined 1.4 percent to 2,712.92. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8 percent to 7,344.24 â€” its worst day since Feb. 8. \nFacebook shares fell after reports surfaced that the tech giant was able to collect data from 50 million user profiles without consent. \nBut Dwyer said since the indices are market cap-weighted, the biggest stocks have the biggest impact, and called today's market movement a \"whoosh.\" \n\"You cannot have tech be the solution and the reason that we're going to go and rip to new highs one week and then the next week because of a bad day, we're going to be the reason we break to new lows and keep going lower,\" he said. \nUncertainty is the new norm, Dwyer said, with developments such as the appointment of new U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell , and anticipation over the number of interest rate hikes this year. \n\" Volatility is the buy word for the first half of this year, followed by our ramp toward the target based on earnings,\" he said. \"All of this stuff creates opportunities.\" Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Related Securities ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T04:06:45.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
