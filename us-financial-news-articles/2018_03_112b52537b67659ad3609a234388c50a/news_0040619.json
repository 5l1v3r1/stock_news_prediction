Orders at Chinese shipyards soared in January and February, the WSJ’s Costas Paris reports, with dry bulk leading the ordering spree, followed by tankers and container ships. The renewed buying is welcome news for big shipbuilders in China—and likely those in South Korea and Japan—that are still reeling from the downturn that sent demand for new ships plummeting over the past three years. The plump order books may cast new clouds over broader shipping operations, however, if deliveries get too far ahead of trade expansion and send freight rates into decline. Alphatanker analysts says energy markets already have “too many vessels chasing too few cargoes.” Container shipping lines are looking at pulling back capacity by operating ships at slower speeds and cutting some port calls. Prices there are weak and research group SeaIntel is forecasting a big surge of capacity steaming into the market this year.\nSoutheast Asia is shaping up as a major battleground for e-commerce. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is investing another $2 billion in e-commerce subsidiary Lazada Group and sending in Lucy Peng, a longtime confidante of Executive Chairman Jack Ma, as chief executive of the Singapore-based group. The WSJ’s Liza Lin and Newley Purnell report the moves show the importance of Southeast Asia to Alibaba, which has been expanding there as growth slows at home. The region is home to about 600 million people, and is attracting greater interest from global e-commerce companies eager to get a foothold as more people get internet access and shop online. Amazon.com Inc., China’s JD.com and Tencent Holdings Ltd. -backed Sea Holdings Ltd. also operate e-commerce platforms or have joint ventures in the region. Southeast Asia’s e-commerce market has been growing at a 40% annual rate, and one report forecasts it will reach $88.1 billion by 2025.\nThe U.S. may be about to see an explosion in the number of drones in the skies. U.S. regulators are forecasting the number of commercial drones and people flying them will quadruple over the next five years, the WSJ’s Andy Pasztor reports, an expansion calling for more skilled pilots to manage the devices and new infrastructure to handle the operations . Under what the Federal Aviation Administration considers the most likely scenario, the number of commercial drones and their pilots are anticipated to substantially exceed totals for private aviators and manned aircraft. The agency says package delivery and other models have “enormous potential” that could boost cumulative annual growth rates close to 50%. FAA leaders are pledging to exemptions to speed along drone applications, and one official says the agency wants to break a regulatory logjam blocking package delivery and other prospective uses.\nCOMMODITIES The China State Shipbuilding Corp. shipyard in Jiangying, China. Photo: Bloomberg News The rebound in commodity markets is getting nuttier. Just look at the Australian state of New South Wales, where Harvard University’s endowment fund is building a dam, ploughing up more than 1,400 acres of potato fields and planting trees that will take three years to yield their first crop of … almonds. The WSJ’s Lucy Craymer reports the nut is turning into a lucrative endeavor for institutions with long-term investment horizons as rising global demand and higher prices are leading to new production, new distribution channels and new competition. California ships around 80% of the world’s almonds, but volatile weather has led to weaker production forecasts and led to more interest from investors in farms in Australia that are suitable for the nut. Family-owned farms are giving way to industrial-scale agriculture operations that are looking to crack into increasingly global almond supply chains.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ “At a time of record industry production, it is critically important that we have business arrangements with all of our suppliers that drive increased focus on meeting their cost, schedule and quality commitments. ’\n—Boeing Co., dropping its opposition to United Technologies Corp.’s plan to buy Rockwell Collins Inc.\nNumber of the Day 88% Driver turnover rate at large truckload fleets in the last quarter of 2017, a decline of seven percentage points from the previous quarter, according to the American Trucking Associations.\nIN OTHER NEWS A package exploded at a FedEx Corp. distribution center in Texas today and authorities are investigating a possible link to recent bombings in Austin.
