The sixth-seeded Tar Heels (25-10) were hoping to become the second team in as many years to win four games in four days in the ACC Tournament after Duke did it last March.\nVirginia built a 48-39 advantage early in the second half. The Tar Heels responded with a 7-0 run before Guy sank a jumper.\nNorth Carolina went more than 4 1/2 minutes without a scoring, but empty possessions from Virginia kept it interesting.\nIt was 58-49 after Hunter’s short jumper beat the shot clock for Virginia. At the other end, Maye scored his first points of the second half on a 3-pointer with 3:17 to play.\nVirginia’s Jerome and North Carolina’s Berry II traded 3-pointers before the Cavaliers put it away.\nVirginia led 34-30 at halftime after North Carolina posted the final six points of the first half.\nThe Cavaliers built an early seven-point lead and later were up 34-24 for their largest lead.\nMaye poured in 15 in the first half. Virginia reserve Nigel Johnson had eight points in the first 12 minutes but didn’t score again.\nBoth teams had six 3-pointers among their 10 first-half field goals. Four of Virginia’s first six field goals were 3-pointers. Overall, the Cavaliers were 9 of 17 from beyond the arc while the Tar Heels were 10 of 25.\nThis was a repeat of the 2016 ACC title game, which was won by North Carolina in Washington.\nThis season, Virginia won at home in the only regular-season meeting with North Carolina, in January.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T11:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:15:22.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
