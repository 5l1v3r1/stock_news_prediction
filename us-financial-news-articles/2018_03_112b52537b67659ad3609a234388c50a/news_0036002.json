REUTERS/Vincent Kessler Instead of a traditional IPO, Spotify plans a direct listing, which will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering. Spotify is valued at roughly $19 billion on the private markets but has not set an opening share price for its direct listing. The company has hired Morgan Stanley & Co ( MS.N ) to help evaluate buy and sell orders on the NYSE to help set an opening price. But the company disclosed for the first time how many shares Ek, its 35-year-old chief executive, will sell. The stake is worth between $775 million to $2 billion at the most recent private market prices, which ranged from $48.93 to $131.88 for the month of March, according to Spotifyâ€™s updated filing.
