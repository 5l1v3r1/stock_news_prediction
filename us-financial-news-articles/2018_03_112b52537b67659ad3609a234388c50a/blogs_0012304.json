USCIS is not accepting requests from individuals who have not previously been granted deferred action under DACA.\" \nHe noted that a DACA designation is generally valid for two years and added that most DACA recipients \"are not a priority or target group for arrest or removal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T21:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:41:00.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
