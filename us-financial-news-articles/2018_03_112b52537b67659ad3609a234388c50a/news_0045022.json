Even when I do my own valuations, Murray & Roberts should actually be trading at probably 19 rand,” said an analyst who did not want to be named.\nThe offer is subject to regulatory approval and ATON securing acceptances from investors holding at least 50 percent plus one share.\nMurray & Roberts said in a separate statement that at the time of the announcement on Monday morning, no offer had been made by ATON.\n($1 = 11.6556 rand)\nAdditional reporting Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T09:41:19.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
