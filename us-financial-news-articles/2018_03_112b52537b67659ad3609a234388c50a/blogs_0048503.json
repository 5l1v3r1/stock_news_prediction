Its stock is down more than 13 percent in March, making it the third-worst performer on the Nasdaq 100.\nFor market technician Ari Wald, the string of sell-offs in its shares has tripped a few technical warning levels.\n\"The damage has already been done,\" Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said on \"Trading Nation\" on Monday.\n\"The breach of $169, in particular, broke the sequence of higher lows that the stock had been in for a number of years,\" said Wald. \"Coming into support at around $145 could possibly be framing the lower end of that range.\"\nFacebook broke meaningfully below the $169 level on March 20. Its shares had briefly dipped below that level in intraday trading during the market-wide Feb. 9 sell-off. Before last week, it had not closed below $169 since October.\n\"Given weakness versus the overall sector, breaking down versus the tech sector … we just see more attractive opportunities on what we think is going to be a market-wide bounce elsewhere in that group,\" said Wald.\n\nFacebook has lost 16.5 percent of its share value since a March 17 expose kicked off a scandal over privacy rights. The social platform is facing regulatory scrutiny after data firm Cambridge Analytica accessed personal information from more than 50 million users in its role with President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.\nSince March 16, the XLK Technology ETF has dropped 5.5 percent. The S&P 500 has declined 3 percent.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
