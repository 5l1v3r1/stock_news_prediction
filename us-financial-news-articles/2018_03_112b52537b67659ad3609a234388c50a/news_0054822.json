FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Premier League - Chelsea vs Brighton & Hove Albion - Stamford Bridge, London, Britain - December 26, 2017 Chelsea's Alvaro Morata shakes the hand of Chelsea manager Antonio Conte as he is substituted off Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley \nMorata made a brisk start after signing from Real Madrid in the close season but has gone off the boil in recent weeks. He scored the last of his 10 league goals in this campaign in December as Chelsea beat Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0. \nThe 25-year-old was left out of Julen Lopetegui’s Spain squad for last week’s international friendlies against Germany and Argentina but Conte said Morata had used the time during his enforced break to raise the level of his game. \n“He has been working very well, and he needed to work hard. Now he is really fit and is ready to have an important end to the season for Chelsea,” Conte told reporters on Thursday. \nA win for fifth-placed Chelsea in Sunday’s London derby will take them to 59 points, two points behind Tottenham in fourth. \nThe defending champions are looking to overtake Mauricio Pochettino’s side and seal a top-four finish that will ensure Champions League action next season. \nChelsea are also in the semi-finals of the FA Cup where they take on Southampton and Conte is aware of the need to ensure a strong finish to a difficult season. \n“These are our targets. Sunday is an important game because if we win we go very close – otherwise we continue to stay not so close and with seven games to go it will be difficult to take a place in the Champions League.” \nGoalkeeper Thibaut Courtois could miss the game after picking up a hamstring injury on international duty with Belgium while defender David Luiz is still battling a knee injury.
