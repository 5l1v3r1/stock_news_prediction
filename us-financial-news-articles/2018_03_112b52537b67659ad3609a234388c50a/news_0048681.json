That drag is very, very hard to understand and to predict,” he said.\nAnyone lucky enough to be looking at the right part of the sky when Tiangong-1 starts its fiery descent will likely see a glowing object moving for several minutes, like a shooting star but slower.\nThe craft is expected to hit speeds of 27,000 km (16,777 miles) per hour and partly burn up during re-entry. The rest will break up into fragments that could cover thousands of square kilometres, though the risk to people will be very small, experts promise.\n“There have been 13,000 tonnes of space hardware coming down in the whole history of space flight and there has not been a single casualty reported,” Krag said.\nThe 10.4-metre-long (34.1-foot) Tiangong-1, or “Heavenly Palace 1”, China’s first space lab, was launched into orbit in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments as part of China’s ambitious space program, which aims to place a permanent station in orbit by 2023.\nIt was originally set to be decommissioned in 2013 but China has repeatedly extended the length of its mission, leading some scientists to believe that it has gone out of control.\nIt will come down somewhere between the 43rd north and south parallels, roughly between the latitudes of London in Britain and Wellington in New Zealand, but it is impossible to be any more specific, ESA’s Krag said.\nAdvancing China’s space program is a priority for President Xi Jinping, who has called for Beijing to become a global space power with both advanced civilian space flight and capabilities that strengthen national security.\nReporting by Reuters TV; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T17:26:21.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
