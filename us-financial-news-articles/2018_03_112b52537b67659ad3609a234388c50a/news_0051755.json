Ivory Coast authorities want the port to become a regional hub.\n“We start in June or July 2019,” he told Reuters. “It’s a question of building a platform and setting up the port equipment.”\nHe said the project would be financed in part by partner Maersk and in part by Bollore, and the new terminal would be operational from June 2020.\nPort authorities were, with Chinese help, already widening the canal leading to the port to reach a 16 metre depth that would enable larger ships to dock, he said.\nThey aimed to boost terminal capacity by around 15 percent from its current roughly 1.2 million TEU (20-foot container units).
