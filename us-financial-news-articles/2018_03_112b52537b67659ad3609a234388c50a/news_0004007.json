Would be even cooler if it was their whole range rather than just a few select pieces”.\nBrands including Coca-Cola Co, Nike Inc and Procter & Gamble Co have previously taken steps to accelerate the use of sustainably-sourced plastic made from plant materials.\nReporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
