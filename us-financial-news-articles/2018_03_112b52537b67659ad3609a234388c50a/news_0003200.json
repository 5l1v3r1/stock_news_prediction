REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo Led by National People’s Congress (NPC) delegate Ma Huateng, chairman of tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, with a net worth of 295 billion yuan (33.4 billion pounds), the top 100 representatives had a total net worth of 3.91 trillion yuan, the Shanghai-based Hurun Report said on Friday. Their total wealth rose by one-third over the 12 months to Jan. 31, according to Reuters’ calculations based on Hurun’s data. While Chinese President Xi Jinping has led a crackdown on corruption and made the fight against poverty a priority, representatives of the NPC and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body for the government, include some of the communist-ruled country’s wealthiest businessmen. Hurun identified 153 delegates as each being worth 2 billion yuan or more, the lowest number in five years. But although the total numbers of the super-rich in the two government bodies was down, their combined wealth at 4.12 trillion yuan was nearly 18 percent higher than the total wealth of rich lawmakers last year.

Those making their first appearance as CPPCC delegates include the leaders of some of China’s big internet firms such as Netease Chief Executive William Ding, JD.com Chairman Richard Liu, and security software company Qihoo’s CEO, Zhou Hongyi. The CPPCC opens on Saturday and the NPC begins its annual session in Beijing on Monday. While all Chinese over the age of 18 are technically allowed to vote for delegates and stand for election to the NPC, most delegates are hand-picked by local-level officials.
