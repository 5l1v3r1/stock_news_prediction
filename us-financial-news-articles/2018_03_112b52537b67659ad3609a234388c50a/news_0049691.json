ISS articulated that the Board of a timber company should not be controlled by financial engineers, saying 1 :\n“[Cornwall’s] plan, should it win control of the board, is not sufficiently robust to demonstrate that the risks of unintended consequences from majority change have been addressed.” “The dissident's plan appears light on those kinds of details, talking in generalities about increasing harvest rates, aligning compensation with long-term objectives, and reducing costs…These appear to be solid objectives, but they are not an operational plan which describes how these objectives would be achieved or what would happen should top management leave.” “As the board has pointed out, the dissident's nominees lack experience in the timber industry. And it may be accurate that the dissident's initial estimate of Keweenaw's land value was wildly optimistic.”\nBrian Glodowski, President and CEO of Keweenaw, said, “We agree with the recommendation from ISS that Keweenaw shareholders should refrain from giving Cornwall control of the Board. However, while we respect ISS’ views, we do not believe it is in the best interest of Keweenaw shareholders to elect Cornwall’s nominees and disagree with ISS’ conclusion on our other highly-qualified nominees. With our collective knowledge of the timber industry and our track record of working to enhance shareholder value, Mr. Frederick J. Weyerhaeuser, Mr. James G. Angelakis and I are well-positioned to continue executing on the Company’s current strategy and deliver long-term value for all shareholders. We remain fully committed to seeking the full election of your Company’s slate, and we look forward to continuing to make our case to shareholders in advance of the Annual Meeting.”\nKeweenaw believes shareholders should seriously consider the numerous oversights in ISS’ recommendation when voting. Unlike Cornwall, your board has a specific plan to bring shareholder value, some of which is already in motion:\nREIT Conversion – The Company elected to convert to a REIT for 2018. This eliminates the double taxation of timber income, brings a return of the dividend to shareholders and eliminates the built in gains on the timberlands over the next five years. Driving value from land acquisitions – Land acquisitions allow for increased harvest levels and cash flow without increasing operating expenses by monetizing the bare land value though the sale of conservation easements. Harvest levels – Harvest levels have increased 32% since 2014 and are projected to increase by an additional 20% in 2018. Minerals – The Company is working collaboratively with Highland Copper to ensure the Copperwood project moves forward and begins generating royalty income to the Company. Cost containment – The Board is working to contain costs, but operating expenses have risen BECAUSE of Cornwall’s activist involvement on the Board and these higher costs have driven profitability lower. Director expenses have nearly doubled since Cornwall representatives joined the Board.\nThe choice is clear. Your board is best suited to move the Company forward and continue executing on its strategic initiatives. In contrast to the current board, Cornwall’s nominees have never set foot on a single acre of Keweenaw’s timberland. Your board has improved the overall quality and quantity of the standing timber in an environmentally responsible manner and understands both the opportunities and challenges of running a timberland company.\nAs such, the Company recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of ALL of the Company’s Board of Directors nominees on the GREEN proxy card at the 2018 Annual Meeting.\nIf you have any questions, or need assistance voting\nyour GREEN proxy card, please contact:\nOkapi Partners LLC\n1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24th Floor New York, NY 10036 Telephone for Banks, Brokers, and International Shareholders: +1 212-297-0720 Shareholders may call toll-free (from the U.S. and Canada): 877-796-5274 Email: info@okapipartners.com\nAbout Keweenaw Land Association, Limited\nKeweenaw is a forest products and land management company located in Ironwood, Michigan.
