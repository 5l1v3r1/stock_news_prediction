The two remaining seats remain to be filled.\nSurveyor Edward Yiu, 53, who was stripped of his seat last July over an invalid oath of office, surprised some by failing to regain his public office in a closely fought vote in the Kowloon West district, losing out to the pro-establishment Vincent Cheng by a slim margin.\nThe voter turnout was 43 percent, far lower than 58 percent at the last full legislative council elections in 2016.
