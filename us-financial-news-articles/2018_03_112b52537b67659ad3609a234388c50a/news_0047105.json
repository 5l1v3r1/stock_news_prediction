According to the details of the agreement, Mega Fluid Systems will operate as a Kinetics company, but will maintain its brand and product line. The acquisition marks another strategic decision in the latest string of investments to strengthen the Kinetics global footprint and position it as a leader in critical process facilities systems services, advanced process equipment and facility management solutions.\nKinetics, now in its 45 th year, and Mega share a long legacy, as Mega was originally spun out of Kinetics in 2004. The reacquisition brings the story full circle, and allows Kinetics to offer a comprehensive range of equipment solutions that cover the scope of service and provide global turnkey solutions from feasibility studies through design, construction, construction management, commissioning and closeout.\n“We are excited to welcome Mega Fluid Systems home to the Kinetics family,” said Peter Maris, president and CEO of Kinetics. “Adding the Mega portfolio of chemical and slurry delivery systems not only extends our process tool offering, it broadens our global reach and allows us to better serve our customers from R&D to volume manufacturing. Together, with the addition of Wafab and Mega, we are now operating from 20 offices with 1,800 employees worldwide.”\nThe Mega Fluid Systems product line includes leading-edge chemical, slurry and slurry-blend delivery systems, as well the supporting slurry filtration, metrology and world-class control and SCADA systems.\n“As an independent brand for over 20 years, Mega established itself as a trusted supplier of high-performance blend and delivery systems, and built our reputation on innovation and ingenuity,” said Delton Hyatt, president, Mega Fluid Systems. “We are proud to bring that reputation home and be reunited with Kinetics. Together, we are a powerhouse of innovative process and mechanical solutions.”\n“The Mega product line is a welcome addition to our existing portfolio of legacy process media distribution systems,” said Steve McGuigan, executive VP and general manager of Kinetics Equipment Solutions Group. “Combined with our chemical process systems and other offerings of facility management and high-purity installation capabilities, this strengthens Kinetics’ ability to serve our customers’ needs globally.”\nAbout Kinetic Systems Inc.\nFounded in 1973, Kinetics is a full-service process and mechanical contractor specializing in the design and installation of process, mechanical, plumbing and HVAC systems.
