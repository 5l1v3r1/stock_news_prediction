Today it’s the other way around,” Sarasin, who resigned as deputy CEO of J. Safra Sarasin in 2014 and now sits on a family office board and manages technology assets and private equity, said.\nSWISS CHANGING Founded by a real estate investor looking for neutral investment advice following a “major liquidity event”, TIGER 21 counts 600 members, most of them based in the United States, who manage a combined $60 billion in personal assets, or around $100 million each.\nThe Swiss chapter marks the group’s second foray outside North America after one opened in 2016 in London, and its first push onto continental Europe.\n“Americans are much more open about their business activities, about their financials, than the Swiss are. But it is changing,” Sarasin said.\nHe hopes to recruit a group ranging in age from 30 to 70 or older, and has so far met with individuals working in real estate, asset management, hedge funds and industry.\nReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T17:25:57.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
