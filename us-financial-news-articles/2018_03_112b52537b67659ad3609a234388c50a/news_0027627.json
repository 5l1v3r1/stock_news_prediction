This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of these notes, except as required by law, nor shall there be any offer or sale of the notes in any state, or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain information included herein is forward-looking within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
