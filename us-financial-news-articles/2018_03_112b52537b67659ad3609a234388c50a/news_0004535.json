The Japanese yen firmed 0.58 percent versus the greenback at 106.70 per dollar.\nWorld stocks were set to snap a record 15-month long winning streak, pulled lower by mining heavyweights Rio Tinto and Glencore after weak factory data from China and a slide in Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings.\nSingapore-based Sea Ltd, an online gaming and e-commerce firm that counts Tencent as its biggest shareholder, posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and the departure of its president - the public face of its U.S. listing last year. Sea Limited was down 9.95 percent.\nBusiness disruption due to Lunar New Year holidays and curbs to factory output from tougher pollution rules drove the weakness, but there are worries of a bigger loss in momentum.\nRio Tinto fell 3.0 percent and Glencore slid 2.56 percent, helping pull the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares down 0.65 percent to a provisional close of 1,488.26.\nMiners were some of the biggest decliners in London after growth in China’s manufacturing sector in February cooled to the weakest in more than 1-1/2 years.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.13 points, or 0.13 percent, to 25,375.9. The S&P 500 lost 1.14 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,743.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.61 points, or 0.01 percent, to 7,330.96.\nLonger-dated yields slipped on expectations that a faster pace of Fed rate increases would cool U.S. inflation and economic growth.\nU.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years drew in imports and depleted inventories.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 8/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8806 percent.\nEuro zone bond yields held near recent lows as inflation in the bloc slowed, potentially complicating the European Central Bank’s plan to remove monetary stimulus and move towards raising rates.\nOil prices fell almost 2 percent and gasoline futures tumbled after the U.S. government said crude inventories rose more than expected while gasoline stocks posted a big build instead of the draw that was forecast.\nU.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels for the week ending Feb. 23, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels.\nU.S. crude fell $1.18 to $61.83 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.53, down $1.10 on the day.\nReporting by Herbert Lash Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:21:27.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
