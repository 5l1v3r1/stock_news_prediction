Barcelona is no exception.\"\nChief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in January he was focused on \"responsible growth\" as he seeks to put an end to the take-no-prisoners culture he inherited upon joining the pioneer of ride-hailing services last year. (http://reut.rs/2HsKVRQ)\nTwo years ago, Uber re-introduced UberX using professional drivers in Madrid. In December 2014, a judge had ordered all Uber services to be shut down in Spain's capital city.\nDecrying Uber's return as unfair competition to their livelihoods, taxi drivers have mounted a series of 24-hour strikes in Madrid, Barcelona and other Spanish cities over the past year.\n\"We are fully committed to working with the entire sector - including taxis - to improve mobility in Barcelona together,\" said Lloret.\nSan Francisco-based Uber pre-emptively closed its services in Barcelona in December 2014 as local officials geared up to pass legislation against the UberPop service, which city authorities legally barred the following year.\nProtests by taxi associations over the past year against Uber have also targeted Madrid-based Cabify, a rival founded in 2012 that operates in Spain, Portugal and Latin America.\nUber operates a range of ride-hailing services in more than 600 cities around the world.\n(Reporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T03:37:34.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
