The Navy said in a statement the pilot and weapons systems officer were recovered from the water and declared dead after the two-seater jet crashed on its final approach to Naval Air Station Key West. The incident is under investigation, it said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a statement posted on Twitter early Thursday: “Please join me with your thoughts and prayers for both aviators, their families and our incredible @USNavy.” A Navy spokesperson also said in a statement that the names of the aviators are being withheld pending notifications of their families. “Their families are in our prayers,” the statement said.
