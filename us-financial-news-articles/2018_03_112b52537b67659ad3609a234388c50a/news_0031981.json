(NASDAQ:NVLN), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing therapies for individuals living with rare diseases (“Novelion” or the “Company”), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an overview of recent business activities.\nChief Operating Officer Jeff Hackman said, “We are focused on executing near-term plans that we believe will position our company for sustainable future growth. These priorities include cost control and expense management, reviewing our holding and capital structure with a view toward optimizing our assets for shareholders, advancing the metreleptin development program, and continuing to provide important therapies to our patients.”\nBusiness Update\nJUXTAPID : Novelion reported net revenues of JUXTAPID of $20.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, $14.2 million, or 71%, of which were from prescriptions written in the U.S.\nMYALEPT : Novelion reported net revenues of MYALEPT of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, $13.3 million, or 71%, of which were from prescriptions written in the U.S.\nNovelion reported total consolidated net revenues of $138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNovelion ended 2017 with $55.4 million in unrestricted cash, compared with $70.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017.\nAs announced separately today, subsidiary Aegerion Pharmaceuticals entered into a new secured financing facility with affiliates of Sarissa Capital Management and Broadfin Capital LLC providing for a $20 million term loan to Aegerion, strengthening Aegerion's balance sheet and liquidity, and positioning the Company for ongoing capital structure review.\nIn January 2018, Novelion undertook significant cost reduction plans as it continues to manage its limited cash resources.\nWith respect to its European application to register metreleptin for marketing authorization, after taking into account the results of an oral hearing of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), which occurred in February 2018, the Company expects the opinion of the CHMP in the second quarter of 2018 and the European Commission’s approval decision in mid-2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nOn November 29, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Aegerion”). The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination in which Novelion was considered the acquirer of Aegerion. As such, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the financial statements of Novelion are treated as the historical financial statements of the consolidated companies, with the results of Aegerion being included from November 29, 2016. This release also includes pro forma adjusted non-GAAP financial information showing pro forma results of operations of Novelion as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2016. Reconciliation of the financial results on a GAAP versus non-GAAP basis are provided below the financial information that follows.\nGAAP total net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $38.9 million compared to the prior year’s fourth quarter net revenues of $13.6 million. GAAP net revenues for JUXTAPID in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $20.1 million compared to $8.6 million in the prior year. GAAP net revenues for MYALEPT in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $18.8 million compared to $5.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nGAAP total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $35.9 million compared to total operating expenses of $22.0 million for the same period in 2016. GAAP SG&A expenses were $24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $16.0 million for the same period in 2016. GAAP R&D expenses were $11.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $6.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nOn a pro forma basis, during the fourth quarter of 2017, SG&A expenses were $22.5 million compared to $55.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in pro forma SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 was primarily related to a reduction in headcount and legal and consulting fees.\nOn a pro forma basis, during the fourth quarter of 2017, R&D expenses were $11.6 million compared to $14.2 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in pro forma R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 was primarily related to a reduction in headcount and the timing of vendor related activities.\nGAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.6 million compared to GAAP net loss of $19.9 million during the same period in 2016.\nOn a pro forma basis, net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.3 million, compared to $20.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nGAAP total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $138.4 million compared to $13.6 million in 2016. GAAP net revenues for JUXTAPID for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $72.1 million compared to $8.6 million in 2016. GAAP net revenues for MYALEPT for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $66.3 million compared to $5.0 million in 2016.\nGAAP total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $148.0 million compared to total operating expenses of $44.3 million in 2016. GAAP SG&A expenses were $96.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $29.5 million in 2016. GAAP R&D expenses were $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $14.8 million in 2016.\nCost of product sales were $77.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Cost of product sales in the current year includes $18.8 million reserves recorded for excess and obsolete inventory, which are derived from projected sales activities, respective product shelf-life and their respective fair value. Additionally, cost of product sales was also comprised of the cost of inventory sold, amortization of acquired product rights, which resulted from the acquisition of Aegerion, and estimated royalties payable related to the sales of lomitapide and metreleptin. We expect cost of product sales for metreleptin to increase in 2018 and for the next several years, due primarily to an increasing time-based royalty rate on net sales of metreleptin in the U.S.\nOn a pro forma basis, for the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A expenses were $90.7 million compared to $200.1 million in 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, R&D expenses on a pro forma basis were $48.2 million compared to $52.1 million in 2016.\nGAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $126.7 million compared to GAAP net loss of $52.9 million in 2016.\nOn a pro forma basis, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $30.0 million, compared to $136.0 million in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s consolidated unrestricted cash balance was $55.4 million, compared to $70.5 million at September 30, 2017 and $108.9 million at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, there were 18.7 million shares outstanding. At December 31, 2017, total debt principal was $325 million, reflecting the principal amount of convertible debt, before discount, issued by Aegerion and consolidated as a result of the acquisition.\nAbout Novelion Therapeutics\nNovelion Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing new standards of care for individuals living with rare diseases.

In particular, management believes that the pro forma financial information facilitates the evaluation of the impact of Novelion’s acquisition of Aegerion on the business and performance of the Company. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, and to manage the Company's business and evaluate its performance. The non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” of Novelion within the meaning of applicable laws and regulations and constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
