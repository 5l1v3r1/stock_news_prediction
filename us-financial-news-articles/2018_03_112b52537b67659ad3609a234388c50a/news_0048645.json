That puts the United States ahead in output of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia pumps out more, at 11 million bpd.\nIn China, Shanghai crude oil futures opened Thursday's morning session down nearly 2 percent, pushing the new market to parity with U.S. prices.\nThat implies a disconnect between financial and physical crude markets, as U.S. crude has been exported to China profitably for the last two years.\nThe latest drop takes the fall since the contract's launch on Monday to 10 percent.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Aaron Sheldrick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:44:55.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
