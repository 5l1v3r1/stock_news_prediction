We saw only the flags of Russia and the flags of Bulgaria, and ... the enthusiasm of Bulgarian people.”\nBulgaria has long been an anomaly in Europe, a country inside the European Union and NATO military alliance, yet which feels close to Russia.\nThe Balkan state’s relationship with its communist-era masters contrasts with much of the former Soviet bloc, which saw Moscow as an occupier, not a friend.\nBulgarians, feeling historical gratitude after Russia liberated them from Ottoman rule, share with Russians a similar language and the Cyrillic alphabet.\nUnlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland, Bulgarians did not see Russian military force used against them and many did not develop a deep resentment to Russians.\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T01:44:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
