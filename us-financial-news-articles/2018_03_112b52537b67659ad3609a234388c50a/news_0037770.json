(NYSE: FDX) today reported the following consolidated results for the third quarter ended February 28 (adjusted measures exclude the items listed below for the applicable fiscal year):\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\nAs Reported (GAAP)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP)\nAs Reported (GAAP)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP)\nRevenue $16.5 billion $16.5 billion $15.0 billion $15.0 billion Operating income $1.00 billion\n$1.11 billion\n$1.03 billion\n$1.10 billion\nOperating margin 6.1%\n6.7%\n6.8%\n7.4%\nNet income $2.07 billion $1.02 billion $562 million $625 million Diluted EPS $7.59 $3.72 $2.07 $2.30 This year’s quarterly consolidated earnings have been adjusted to exclude the benefit of an estimated $1.15 billion reduction in the company’s net U.S. deferred tax liability attributable to the lower statutory rate enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Additionally, this year’s and last year’s quarterly consolidated earnings have been adjusted for TNT Express integration expenses. The adjustments are as follows:\nImpact per diluted share\nThird Quarter\nFiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Net U.S. deferred tax liability remeasurement ($4.21)\n—\nTNT Express integration expenses 0.34 0.23 “Execution of our long-term growth strategies, customer demand for the unique value of our broad portfolio of solutions and healthy growth in the global economy are driving our performance,” said Frederick W. Smith, FedEx Corp. chairman and chief executive officer. “We expect strong operating performance in each of our transportation segments in the fourth quarter.”\nOperating results benefited from higher base rates, increased volume at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and a favorable net impact from fuel. Results were negatively affected by significantly higher variable compensation accruals, increased peak-related costs at FedEx Express and the impact of adverse weather. Variable compensation increased in connection with the company’s pay actions that were announced following the passage of the TCJA. These variable compensation accruals include the year-to-date impact of the announced changes. TNT Express integration expenses were also higher.\nNet results include a tax benefit of $1.53 billion ($5.60 per diluted share) attributable to the TCJA, which has three primary components:\nA provisional benefit of $1.15 billion ($4.21 per diluted share) from the remeasurement of the company’s net U.S. deferred tax liability for lower tax rates; A benefit of approximately $200 million ($0.75 per diluted share) from an incremental pension contribution made in February and deductible against the company’s prior year taxes at 35%; and A benefit of approximately $170 million ($0.60 per diluted share) attributable to the phase-in of the reduced tax rate applied to the company’s year-to-date earnings.\nOutlook\nFedEx is unable to forecast the fiscal 2018 year-end mark-to-market (MTM) pension accounting adjustments. As a result, the company is unable to provide fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share guidance or projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income or margin on a GAAP basis.\nBefore year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments, earnings are now projected to be $17.90 to $18.30 per diluted share for fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2018 earnings forecast before year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments and excluding the estimate of the remeasurement of the company’s net U.S. deferred tax liability, expenses related to TNT Express integration and certain first quarter FedEx Trade Networks legal matters is now $15.00 to $15.40 per diluted share.\nBefore year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments, fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income and margin are projected to be $1.84 billion to $1.94 billion and 10.4% to 11.1%, respectively. Excluding year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments and TNT Express integration expenses, fourth quarter consolidated operating income and margin are projected to be $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion and 11.0% to 11.8%, respectively.\nThe projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 operating margin for each transportation segment is as follows (the adjusted operating margin for the FedEx Express segment excludes TNT Express integration expenses):\nProjected Fourth Quarter\nOperating Margin\nAs Reported (GAAP)\nAdjusted (Non-GAAP)\nFedEx Express segment 9.1% to 9.6% 9.9% to 10.4% FedEx Ground segment 17.0% to 17.5% N/A FedEx Freight segment 8.0% to 9.0% N/A These margin forecasts reflect the March 1, 2018 realignment of the company’s specialty logistics and e-commerce solutions into a new organizational structure within the FedEx Express segment. All of the above forecasts assume moderate economic growth.\nThe capital spending forecast for fiscal 2018 is now $5.8 billion, down $100 million from the prior forecast.\n“We are increasing our fiscal 2018 earnings outlook due to foreign tax benefits from our international corporate structure, the benefits from U.S. tax reform and improved operating performance,” said Alan B. Graf, Jr., FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. “We remain committed to improving operating income at the FedEx Express segment by $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017.”\nFedEx Express Segment\nFor the third quarter, the FedEx Express segment reported (adjusted measures exclude TNT Express integration expenses):\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\nAs Reported (GAAP)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP)\nAs Reported (GAAP)\nAdjusted (non-GAAP)\nRevenue $9.37 billion $9.37 billion $8.57 billion $8.57 billion Operating income $424 million $510 million $557 million $610 million Operating income YOY change % (24%)\n(16%)\nOperating margin 4.5% 5.4% 6.5% 7.1% Revenue increased due to improved base rates, currency exchange rates and higher fuel surcharges, despite a lingering impact from the June cyberattack affecting TNT Express. Total package volume declined 1%, as lower international domestic and U.S. domestic volumes offset international export package volume growth of 1%. Average daily freight pounds increased 3% on higher volume in both international and U.S. freight services.\nAs-reported results during the quarter were primarily affected by the estimated impacts of:\nHigher variable compensation accruals Increased peak-related costs Higher TNT Express integration expenses Adverse weather Unfavorable currency exchange rates Favorable net fuel\nCombined, these six factors negatively affected the segment’s year-over-year results by approximately $170 million.\nFedEx Ground Segment\nFor the third quarter, the FedEx Ground segment reported:\nFiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Change Revenue $5.22 billion $4.69 billion 11% Operating income $634 million $515 million 23% Operating margin 12.1% 11.0% 1.1 pts Strong revenue growth was driven by average daily package volume growth of 6% and higher base rates. During peak season, record volume was delivered with exceptional service through FedEx Ground’s highly automated and flexible network.\nOperating results improved due to the benefits from strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management, partially offset by increased purchased transportation, seasonal staffing and network expansion costs as well as higher variable compensation accruals.\nFedEx Freight Segment\nFor the third quarter, the FedEx Freight segment reported:\nFiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Change Revenue $1.69 billion $1.49 billion 14% Operating income $55 million $41 million 34% Operating margin 3.2% 2.7% 0.5 pts Revenue increased due to less-than truckload (LTL) revenue per shipment growth of 8% and average daily LTL shipment growth of 6%.\nOperating results improved primarily due to the benefit from higher LTL revenue per shipment, partially offset by higher variable compensation accruals.\nCorporate Overview\nFedEx Corp.

We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or “adjusted”) financial measures, including our adjusted third quarter fiscal 2018 and 2017 consolidated operating income and margin, net income and diluted earnings per share, and adjusted third quarter fiscal 2018 and 2017 FedEx Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the impact of the following items (as applicable):\nNet U.S. deferred tax liability remeasurement; and TNT Express integration expenses.\nThe provisional benefit from the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability is excluded from our third quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated non-GAAP financial measures because it results from the non-recurring impact of a significant change in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA. The adjustment to our third quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated financial measures includes only this transitional impact. This provisional benefit is an estimate subject to adjustment during a 12-month measurement period.\nWe expect to incur significant expenses over the next few years in connection with our integration of TNT Express. We have adjusted our third quarter fiscal 2018 and 2017 consolidated financial measures and the FedEx Express segment third quarter fiscal 2018 and 2017 financial measures to exclude TNT Express integration expenses because we generally would not incur such expenses as part of our continuing operations. The integration expenses are incremental costs directly associated with the integration of TNT Express, including professional and legal fees, salaries and wages, advertising expenses and travel. Internal salaries and wages are included only to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration activities. The integration expenses also include any restructuring charges at TNT Express.\nWe believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company’s and our business segments’ core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company’s and each business segment’s ongoing performance.\nOur non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFiscal 2018 Earnings-Per-Share Guidance and Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Operating Income and Margin Projections\nOur fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share (“EPS”) guidance is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the fiscal 2018 year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments, the provisional benefit from the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability, projected fiscal 2018 TNT Express integration expenses (which include any restructuring charges at TNT Express), and charges related to certain first quarter FedEx Trade Networks legal matters.\nOur projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income and margin are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude the fiscal 2018 year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments and projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 TNT Express integration expenses. Our projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 FedEx Express segment operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 TNT Express integration expenses.\nWe have provided fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance, projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP consolidated operating income and margin and projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP FedEx Express segment operating margin for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. The fiscal 2018 year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments are excluded from our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance and projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income and margin because these non-cash items are unrelated to our core operating performance. Similarly, charges related to certain first quarter FedEx Trade Networks legal matters are excluded from our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying business. The provisional benefit from the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability is excluded from our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance for the same reason described above for historical non-GAAP measures. Projected fiscal 2018 TNT Express integration expenses are excluded from our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance, projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP consolidated operating income and margin and FedEx Express segment operating margin for the same reasons described above for historical non-GAAP measures.\nWe are unable to predict the amount of the year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments, as they are significantly impacted by changes in interest rates and the financial markets, so such adjustments are not included in our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance or projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated operating income or margin. For this reason, a full reconciliation of our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance and projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP consolidated operating income and margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is impracticable. It is reasonably possible, however, that our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 MTM pension accounting adjustments could have a material impact on our full-year and fourth quarter fiscal 2018 consolidated financial results. The tables included below titled “Fiscal 2018 Earnings-Per-Share Outlook” and “Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook—FedEx Corporation” outline the impact of the items that are excluded from our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS guidance and projected fourth quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP consolidated operating income and margin, other than the year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018\nFedEx Corporation\nDollars in millions, except EPS\nOperating\nIncome\nNet\nDiluted\nEarnings\nIncome\nMargin\nTaxes 1\nIncome 2\nPer Share\nGAAP measure $ 1,001 6.1 % ($1,200 ) $ 2,074 $ 7.59 Net U.S. deferred tax liability remeasurement —\n—\n1,150\n(1,150\n)\n(4.21\n)\nTNT Express integration expenses 3 106\n0.6\n%\n14\n92\n0.34\nNon-GAAP measure $ 1,107 6.7 % ($36 ) $ 1,016 $ 3.72 FedEx Express Segment\nDollars in millions\nOperating\nIncome\nMargin\nGAAP measure $ 424 4.5 % TNT Express integration expenses 86 0.9 % Non-GAAP measure $ 510 5.4 % Third Quarter Fiscal 2017\nFedEx Corporation\nDollars in millions, except EPS\nOperating\nIncome\nNet\nDiluted\nEarnings\nIncome\nMargin\nTaxes 1\nIncome 2\nPer Share\nGAAP measure $ 1,025 6.8 % $ 337 $ 562 $ 2.07 TNT Express integration expenses 3 78\n0.6\n%\n15\n63\n0.23\nNon-GAAP measure $ 1,103 7.4 % $ 352 $ 625 $ 2.30 FedEx Express Segment\nDollars in millions\nOperating\nIncome\nMargin\nGAAP measure $ 557 6.5 % TNT Express integration expenses 53 0.6 % Non-GAAP measure $ 610 7.1 % Fiscal 2018 Earnings-Per-Share Outlook\nDollars in millions, except EPS Adjustments\nDiluted Earnings\nPer Share\nEarnings per diluted share before MTM pension accounting adjustments (non-GAAP) 4\n$17.90 to $18.30\nNet U.S. deferred tax liability remeasurement 1 ($1,150)\n(4.21)\nTNT Express integration expenses $450 Income tax effect 1\n(100) Net of tax effect $350 1.29 FedEx Trade Networks legal matters $ 7\nIncome tax effect 1\n(2) Net of tax effect $ 5\n0.02 Earnings per diluted share with adjustments (non-GAAP) 4\n$15.00 to $15.40\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Outlook\nFedEx Corporation\nDollars in millions\nOperating\nIncome\nMargin\nOperating results before MTM pension accounting adjustments (non-GAAP) 4 $1,840 to $1,940\n10.4% to 11.1%\nTNT Express integration expenses 3 110 0.6% to 0.7% Operating results excluding TNT Express integration expenses (non-GAAP) 4 $1,950 to $2,050\n11.0% to 11.8%\nFedEx Express Segment\nOperating Margin GAAP measure 9.1% to 9.6% TNT Express integration expenses 0.8% Non-GAAP measure 9.9% to 10.4% Notes: 1 – Income taxes are based on the company’s approximate statutory tax rates, and for fiscal 2018, give consideration to the effects of the TCJA on the fiscal 2018 rates. 2 – Effect of “Total other (expense) income” on net income amount not shown. 3 – These expenses are recognized at FedEx Corporate and FedEx Express. 4 – The year-end MTM pension accounting adjustments, which are impracticable to calculate at this time, are excluded.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180320006301/en/\nFedEx Corp.\nMedia Contact:\nJess Bunn, 901-818-7463\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nMickey Foster, 901-818-7468\nHome Page: fedex.com\nSource: FedEx Corp.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.van.fedex.com%2F&esheet=51776144&newsitemid=20180320006301&lan=en-US&anchor=about.fedex.com&index=1&md5=ace11aa629baa743605d0500628deaca", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.fedex.com%2Finvestor-home%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=51776144&newsitemid=20180320006301&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.fedex.com&index=4&md5=28a683d3b5cb48507209222e2810de66", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fedex.com%2F&esheet=51776144&lan=en-US&anchor=fedex.com&index=5&md5=70edea86aa227bd26953d960f4b9f099", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.fedex.com%2Finvestor-home%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=51776144&newsitemid=20180320006301&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.fedex.com&index=3&md5=6ec2280879e405a2d08fe8d0d2942f36", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180320006301/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.fedex.com%2Finvestor-home%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=51776144&newsitemid=20180320006301&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.fedex.com&index=2&md5=fedef83a97fc5a765144006cfce7e944"], "published": "2018-03-20T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T01:58:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
