StonerDays’ channels and e-commerce platform has over eight hundred SKU’s and receives over four million weekly impressions.\nAndy Bertino, President of StonerDays, states, “We are very excited to join the CannCo Brands & Development team. The strategy they’re implementing in the cannabis sector is second to none. Marcus and his team not only understand the granular level of our sector, but also comprehend the macro, worldwide appeal. Their contacts in the industry have already helped us grow. We are looking forward to expanding our wholesale business, which will likely eclipse our direct-to-consumer business in 2018.”\nMarcus Laun, CEO of Geopulse, states, “We’ve been extremely fortunate to work with Andy and his team over the past several years on various cannabis related projects.

We plan on having the StonerDays’ team at the core of our marketing and design as we expand our branding. ”\nAbout StonerDays\nwww.stonerdays.com specializes in providing cannabis consumers with a social media experience that includes a wide range of cannabis related apparel, recipes, references, events, radio, video, blogs and more.
