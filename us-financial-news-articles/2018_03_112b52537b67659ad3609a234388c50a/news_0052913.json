They also extended their Metropolitan Division lead over the Pittsburgh Penguins to five points — 97 to 92 — with six games remaining for both teams.\nIn addition, this was the second straight game where Washington has scored at least three goals in the first period.\nA member of the team’s web site tweeted that, per Elias Sports, this was the second time in franchise history Washington has scored at least three goals in the first period of consecutive road games — the last time coming on Oct. 25-27, 1985.\nWashington also got one goal apiece from Matt Niskanen and T.J. Oshie in that first period. Nicklas Backstrom had four assists in the team’s last game and added two more in this one.\nWashington goalie Philipp Grubauer played well again, making 28 saves in the victory.\nThe Capitals scored four goals in a stretch of just under 14 minutes in the first period, chasing starting goalie Alexandar Georgiev after the third one, and taking a 4-0 lead after one.\nOshie, Niskanen and then Ovechkin (goal No. 45) each scored in a span of 6:04 in the first period. The final one was an Ovechkin power-play goal just 8:54 into the game, ending Georgiev’s night after three goals on six shots.\nWashington defenseman John Carlson got his 49th assist on that play.\nOndrej Pavelec took over in net but Kuznetsov beat him on a short-handed goal from in front with 3:21 left in the period for the 4-0 lead.\nOne of the few positives for New York came when Lias Andersson scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game. The No. 7 pick in last year’s draft cut the lead to 4-1 in the second period.\nMats Zuccarello made it 4-2 in the third period, but the Rangers could do no more.\nThis was the first part of a home-and-home set between the two teams. New York comes to Washington Wednesday night.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:59:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
