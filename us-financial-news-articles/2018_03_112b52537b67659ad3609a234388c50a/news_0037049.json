Lawmakers aim to pass legislation to fund the government through the end of September . But familiar political fights like immigration and health care threaten to hold up a budget deal Congress reached last month. \nMeanwhile, Illinois will hold its primary elections on Tuesday. One notable incumbent House Democrat in the state is vulnerable to a primary challenger. Illinois voters will also choose Democratic challengers for Republican-held seats the minority party hopes to flip later this year. \nHere's what to watch in the battle for Congress this week. Spending fight Getty Images The U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. \nCongress likely wants to avoid the year's third shutdown embarrassment as lawmakers try to turn their attention to the campaign trail. As of now, Congress could be forced to approve its sixth short-term funding bill of the fiscal year if leaders cannot release and pass spending legislation by Friday. \nLast month, lawmakers approved a bill that would allow them to bust through spending caps and boost military and domestic spending by about $300 billion over two years. Domestic money would go to things such as improving infrastructure and fighting the opioid crisis. \nCongress had another six weeks to write the \"omnibus\" spending bill that would actually determine which agencies and programs got the money. Familiar political fights have slowed progress toward passing the bill this week. \nSome in the GOP want the legislation to include more money for immigration enforcement. Others want to allow the Trump administration to take funding away from so-called sanctuary cities. Democrats are unlikely to support either measure. \nThe Affordable Care Act also is a point of contention. Some Democrats and Republicans aim to include provisions to help reduce health-care premium costs on Obamacare exchanges. \nConservatives have pushed back, arguing that they do not want to prop up the health-care law. Some Republicans also oppose subsidies for insurers who cover abortion. \nTrump also has reportedly opposed a plan to put $900 million toward a rail tunnel project under the Hudson River. House Republicans in both New Jersey and New York could hesitate to support the spending legislation if it does not include the money meant to improve transportation into New York City. Illinois primary \nIllinois will hold primary elections on Tuesday. The state has a few compelling House races that will help to determine control of the chamber in November. Neither of the Democratic senators from Illinois face re-election this year. \nOne primary battle Tuesday holds immediate stakes for the soul of the Democratic Party. Moderate Democratic Rep. Daniel Lipinski faces a primary challenge in the suburban Chicago 3rd District, which he has represented since 2005. \nMarketing executive Marie Newman has cast herself as a more progressive option than Lipinski, who co-chairs the Blue Dog Coalition of House Democrats, who portray themselves as moderates. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have both backed Newman. Sanders and Gillibrand are often mentioned as potential Democratic candidates for president in 2020. \nNewman has attacked the incumbent Lipinski for opposing abortion rights and not taking a strong enough stance to support LGBTQ rights. House Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has not outwardly endorsed Lipinski. \nArthur Jones is running unopposed on the Republican side of the race. He is a Holocaust denier whom the state's Republican Party has disavowed. \nAt least two Republican-held House seats in the state are on Democrats' radar as the party tries to flip the 24 districts needed to take a majority in the chamber. Illinois' 12th District, represented by Republican Rep. Mike Bost, is a high priority for House Democrats' campaign arm. \nBost will likely win a primary challenge Tuesday from 27-year-old Libertarian candidate Preston Nelson. On the Democratic side, the DCCC has endorsed Brendan Kelly, a prosecutor in the state's St. Clair County and a U.S. Navy veteran. \nBost has represented the district in the southwest corner of Illinois since 2015. Democrats see a pickup opportunity because former President Barack Obama won the area twice before President Donald Trump carried it in 2016. \nElections analysis websites Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball both rate it as a \"toss-up.\" \nA crowded field of Democrats is vying to determine who will take on Republican Rep. Peter Roskam in Illinois' 6th District, which sits in Chicago's suburbs. Among the candidates is attorney Amanda Howland, who won the 2016 Democratic primary but lost to Roskam by nearly 20 percentage points. \nCandidates Sean Casten and Kelly Mazeski, both scientists, lead the fundraising race on the Democratic side. \nThe Cook Political Report rates Roskam's seat as a \"toss-up,\" while Sabato's Crystal Ball says it \"leans Republican.\" WATCH: This is what happens when the U.S. government shuts down show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T16:12:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
