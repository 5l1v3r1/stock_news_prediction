During the 2010 peak in staff, approximately 1 in 90 individuals were audited by the agency, as compared to only 1 in 160 for the fiscal year that ended Sep. 30. That amounts to an audit of only 0.62% of individual tax returns.\nBeside the dramatic drop in individual audits more broadly, the audit rate appears to have declined most significantly for one group in particular: high-income households. According to IRS figures obtained by WSJ , 4.37% of households with an income of $1 million or higher were audited in 2017—less than half of the 9.55% rate in 2015.\nBusiness audit rates also dropped, from a high of 0.71% in 2012, to just 0.44% last year. While audit rates also declined for other income groups, they were not as significant.", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-irs-is-auditing-a-lot-fewer-americans-1522315800"], "published": "2018-03-29T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T20:17:47.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
