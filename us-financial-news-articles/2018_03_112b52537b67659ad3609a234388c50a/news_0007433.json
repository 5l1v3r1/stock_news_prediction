With the blockchain application used by the banks the settlement is instantaneous, the companies said.\n“The platform gives us an opportunity to make balance sheet and capital usage much more efficient and timely,” Emmanuel Aidoo, head of distributed ledger and blockchain strategy at Credit Suisse, said in an interview.\nBanks have been joining forces and joining consortia to experiment with blockchain.\nNew York-based R3 is one of the largest consortia in blockchain, with a network of more than 100 financial institutions. It developed a type of blockchain designed for financial transactions called Corda, which was used to build the securities lending application.\nReporting by Anna Irrera, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T11:24:00.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
