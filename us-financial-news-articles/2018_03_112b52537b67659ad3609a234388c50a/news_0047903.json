AIA is the only wholly owned foreign insurance firm in China as its operations were set up before the restrictions were introduced.\nBeijing said last year it planned to lift the ownership cap to 51 percent for foreign insurance joint ventures in 2020 and remove the limit completely two years later, which would allow for further expansion.\nâ€”Reuters contributed to this story. \nCorrection: This article has been updated to reflect in how many markets Manulife operates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T06:43:28.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
