The device, which was not used in that massacre, enables a standard firearm to operate the way a machine gun does. \nThe Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms had previously determined that it did not have the authority to regulate bump stocks because they were merely an accessory for guns, and not an actual weapon. \nThe bump stock ban, once it is enacted, will be the most significant new federal gun control measure in recent memory. But unlike other recent gun control proposals, regulations for bump stocks have the backing of the National Rifle Association, the country's largest gun-rights lobbying group. \nFollowing the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, in Las Vegas in October, the NRA quickly issued a statement saying that \"devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.\" The gunman used a bump sotck in killing 58 people.\nCorrection: An earlier version misstated the month of the Las Vegas massacre. It was in October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T20:01:41.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
