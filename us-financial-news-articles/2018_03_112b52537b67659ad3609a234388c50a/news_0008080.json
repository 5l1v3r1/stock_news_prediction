industry as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash flow provided by operating activities. In addition, since discretionary cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, it might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nFor further information, contact: Matt Quantz, Manager - Corporate Communications (337) 232-7028, www.petroquest.com\nSource:PetroQuest Energy, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f4de7bdf-d193-4348-b345-819d987337ce"], "published": "2018-03-06T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T01:21:25.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
