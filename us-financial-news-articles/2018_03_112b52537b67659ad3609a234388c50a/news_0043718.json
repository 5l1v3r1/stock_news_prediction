He will undergo an MRI exam Saturday, the Warriors announced.\nCurry scored 11 of his points in a 13-4 Warriors run in the third quarter that turned a 60-53 deficit into a 66-64 lead.\nHis four-point play — a 3-pointer on which he was fouled — put the Warriors in front for the first time since the first quarter.\nThe Hawks, who led by as many as 15 in the first half, hung within 90-86 on a free throw by Dewayne Dedmon with 5:45 to play.\nHowever, Atlanta missed its next two shots and two free throws, allowing the Warriors to pull away on 3-pointers by Andre Iguodala and Nick Young that created a 12-point cushion.\nCurry connected on 10 of his 18 shots, including three 3-pointers, to pace the Warriors, who were without injured All-Stars Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson.\nYoung, starting in place of Thompson, hit six 3-pointers.\nQuinn Cook added 13 points and Jordan Bell 12 for the Warriors, who improved to 24-3 in games against Eastern Conference teams this season.\nCook, coming off the bench with the return of Curry, also contributed eight rebounds and six assists to the Warriors’ seventh straight win over the Hawks.\nThe victory was Golden State’s 312th in the past five seasons, breaking the record of 311 set by the Boston Celtics from 1982-86.\nTaurean Prince scored a team-high 20 points for the Hawks, who fell to 1-3 on their six-game trip.\nDennis Schroder (16 points), Tyler Dorsey (13), Mike Muscala (11) and Damion Lee (10) also scored in double figures for Atlanta. Dedmon collected a game-high 11 rebounds to go with nine points.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:46:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
