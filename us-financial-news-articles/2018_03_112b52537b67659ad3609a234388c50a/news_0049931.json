He will be replaced by the head of the National Transport Infrastructure Department, Valter Silveira, another government source said. \nThe ministers of mines and energy, communications, education, environment, tourism, sports, social development and national integration will all leave by April 7, the deadline to quit government posts to be able to run in the election. \nThe head of the National Development Bank BNDES, Paulo Rabello, has also announced his departure \nTemer, 77, who came to power in 2016 when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, has to decide by a party convention in June whether he is a viable contender to keep the top job. \nIf Temer’s approval ratings does not improve by then, former banking executive and central bank governor Meirelles would be the government’s presidential candidate, the two Temer aides told Reuters. \nThey both said Deputy Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia was the most likely pick to replace Meirelles.
