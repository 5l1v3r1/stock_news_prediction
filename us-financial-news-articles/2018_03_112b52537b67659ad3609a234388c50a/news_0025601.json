The initial capitalization rate for the acquisition was 6.98%, with an average capitalization rate of 7.62%.\nThe property is a build-to-suit for Truck and Wheel USA Corporation (“Truck and Wheel”) on a 10-year lease that commenced January 1, 2018. The property is used primarily for Truck and Wheel to assemble and make deliveries of wheels and tires to the nearby Mercedes Benz plant. Truck and Wheel has invested $35 million in an automated assembly system for this just-in-time manufacturing facility. The acquisition of the industrial property is consistent with Gladstone Commercial’s growth strategy of acquiring high-quality assets in growth regions with credit-worthy tenants.\n“The acquisition of the Truck and Wheel property marks our second in the Vance, AL market. The strong fundamentals of the market due to the nearby Mercedes Benz plant and Truck and Wheel’s dedication to the property through the company’s $35 million investment make this investment a great addition to the Gladstone portfolio,” said Buzz Cooper, Southwest Regional Senior Managing Director of Gladstone Commercial.\nThe property was purchased from an affiliate of Graham & Company. Graham & Company is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, and offers full-service real estate solutions – development, leasing, brokerage, appraisal and property management – across the Southeast.
