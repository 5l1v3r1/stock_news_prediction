REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has led opinion polls by a wide margin for weeks, has gradually moderated his rhetoric and his leading advisers have sought to reassure investors that he will not be an economic liability as president.\nHowever, his threats to scrap a new Mexico City airport already under construction and review oil and gas exploration and production contracts issued under a 2013-14 energy reform still worry some investors.\n“As we’ve said, you can’t ask the private sector to take part in building a better country at the same time as undermining certainty and the rule of law as conditions for fostering investment,” Juan Pablo Castanon, president of the CCE lobby, an umbrella group for business groups, said at an event in Mexico City.\n“For this reason, we business folk demand guarantees that the contracts awarded under the energy reform and for the new airport will be respected,” he added. “In a country governed by the rule of law, contracts are honored, and cannot be subject to the will or interpretation of a sitting government.”\nOn Monday, Lopez Obrador said he still planned to scrap the new airport, but added he was not going to ignore contracts awarded and bonds issued for the project.\nFILE PHOTO: Juan Pablo Castanon, president of the Business Coordinating Council (CCE), looks on during a conference at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM) in Mexico City, Mexico January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo “We will respect construction contracts. Those that have those contracts don’t have to worry,” he said. “We will respect the bonds ... we’re going to solve the problem without affecting investments.”\nLopez Obrador’s energy adviser has said that while publicly available versions of the energy contracts appear to be without problems, further investigation was needed to ensure corruption had not tainted the awarding process.\nThe business community was also worried there were candidates and campaign teams already casting doubt on the validity of the election “depending on who the winner is,” Castanon said, without mentioning Lopez Obrador or his MORENA party.\nCastanon’s comments follow a speech by Lopez Obrador last week, in which he stuck to promises to not build the airport at the current construction site and warned there could be protests if he lost by fraud.\nThe former mayor of Mexico City, who was runner-up in the previous two elections, organized massive protests when he was narrowly beaten in 2006.\nTwo polls published last week showed him with a lead of more than 13 percentage points over his nearest rival.\nReporting by Josue Gonzalez; Writing by Dave Graham; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-13T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T23:51:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
