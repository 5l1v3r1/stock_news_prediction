But the biggest single party by far is the anti-system 5-Star Movement - an outcome that offers little prospect of a return to mainstream government.\n“Italy is far from having sorted its long-standing problems, and now it will have new ones,” Lorenzo Codogno, founder of LC Macro Advisors, said. “Be prepared for long and complex negotiations that will take months.”\nConcerns that any coalition emerging from negotiations could be likely to weaken Italy’s fiscal stance are impinging on the country’s banks, which hold around 345 billion euros ($425 billion) of its debt and are considered a proxy for sovereign risk.\nItaly’s banking index recently hit a near two-year high after state rescues last year removed the threat of a systemic crisis and lenders started offloading debts that turned sour during a deep recession that ended in 2014.\nLeading losses with a 7 percent plunge on Monday was Banco BPM, Italy’s third-largest bank. Its business is domestically focused and it is burdened by a large pile of impaired loans.\nShares in UBI Banca <UBI.MI and BPER Banca, respectively the country’s fifth- and sixth-largest lenders, were 5 percent lower while heavyweights Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit lost just over 3 percent.\nThe 5-Star movement has pledged to compensate further small savers left out of pocket by a string of banking crises, and wants to split lenders’ commercial and investment banking businesses.\n“Although the season of bank bailouts is virtually over, Italy should not let its guard down,” Lazard’s Managing Director Massimo Pappone said. “Key issues are at stake: bank lending ... and the handling of so-called unlikely-to-pay loans (to borrowers in difficulty but not yet in default), which can be a lever to support the economy.”\nInvestors fear Rome may now row back on market-friendly reforms pushed through by the former centre-left government, hurting economic expansion.\n“The prospect of a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty risks weighing on the ongoing recovery,” said Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics.\nItaly needs to grow to sustain a public debt equivalent to more than 1.3 times the country’s output, a ratio surpassed only by Greece in the euro area.\nRome’s debt costs, which risked spiralling out of control during the sovereign debt crisis of 2011-2012, are set to rise as the European Central Bank starts unwinding its ultra-expansionary policies.\nThe yield premium Italian bonds pay over safer German peers rose to 1.54 percentage points, the highest since January. Bunds strengthened after Germany’s Social Democrats on Sunday backed another coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, clearing the way for a new government in the euro zone’s largest economy.\nAnother notable Italian loser, with shares dropping 5 percent, was broadcaster Mediaset, which is controlled by the Berlusconi family and is mired in a legal spat with French media group Vivendi over a derailed pay-TV deal.\nBerlusconi’s party’s poor results in the election are seen weakening Mediaset’s bargaining power in the row.\n$1 = 0.8118 euros Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni, Giulio Piovaccari and Andrea Mandala, editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:10:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
