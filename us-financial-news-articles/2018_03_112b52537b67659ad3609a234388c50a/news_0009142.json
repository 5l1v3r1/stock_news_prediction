Jim Justice.\nThe Republican-controlled House of Delegates voted in favor of the raise for the state’s 35,000 teachers Saturday. But the Republican-controlled state senate balked and offered a 4 percent raise, with an eye toward saving $17 million in the state’s budget.\nThe West Virginia Education Association, the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association and the American Federation of Teachers issued a joint statement Saturday that said they were“angry and disappointed” that an agreement hasn’t been reached.\nGovernor Justice said in a tweet on Saturday night,“We’ve got to get our kids back to school.” He added,“It’s time to quit playing politics.”\nNeither union representatives nor a spokesperson for the state Senate were immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Rich McKay; Editing by Alexander Smith and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T07:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T08:12:04.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
