More than 36 million people live where a warning, watch or advisory has been issued.\nThe combination of heavy snow and strong winds may lead to additional tree damage and power outages, the Weather Channel warned.\nRead more from USA Today:\nFrance to introduce 15 as legal age of consent for sex\nOregon governor signs 'boyfriend loophole' gun bill\n20-year-old sues Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart over new gun policies \nAccumulating snow is forecast to reach Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and even Boston, AccuWeather said. Heavy snow, enough to shovel and plow, is projected in a swath from northern Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania to metro New York City, central Connecticut and central Massachusetts.\nNorthern New England should see the heaviest snow, with up to 18 inches possible in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\nAirlines proactively made plans as the storm approached. Most big airlines enacted weather waivers that allow fliers to change plans without paying change fees or additional charges. The waivers issued as of Monday evening included airports from Pennsylvania and New Jersey north through New England.\nThe storm will dump 6 to 10 inches of snow to areas west of the major metro areas of the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, the weather service said.\nNWS Tweet \nLighter snowfall is forecast for the central Appalachians and back into the northern Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region.\nFortunately, though the storm will bring plenty of rain, snow and wind, it's not predicted to be as potent as the \"bomb cyclone\" that battered the region last week. For most people in the Northeast, especially in New England and the coastal Mid-Atlantic, this will be a more typical winter storm or nor'easter, Sosnowski said.\nThe Weather Channel named the storm Winter Storm Quinn.\nThe nor'easter will be fueled by energy from a blizzard that walloped the northern Plains and upper Midwest with heavy snow Monday, closing roads and schools in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Many spots picked up over a foot of snow.\nA 215-mile stretch of I-90 in southeastern South Dakota remained closed Tuesday morning, the AP said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T21:45:10.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
