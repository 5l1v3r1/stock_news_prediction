As a result we won’t be committing to sell into this price,” Brian Pyle, an analyst at Old Mutual’s equity investment arm, told Reuters. \nM&R has rejected ATON’s buyout offer as “opportunistic” and poor value for shareholders. \nATON responded by saying it would wait to hear from shareholders as the offer was “not subject to due diligence and its only condition is obtaining 50 percent plus one share.” \nShares in M&R weakened in early trade on Wednesday, extending losses to the second day after the company’s board rejected the offer from Germany’s ATON. \nATON said it has the backing of M&R’s third largest shareholder, Allan Gray, representing a stake of about 11 percent. \nThe Public Investment Corporation, the company’s second largest shareholder, said on Wednesday that it could not comment on the bid prior to voting. \n“The PIC’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) policy for listed investments prohibits us from publicly expressing a view before voting takes place,” Deon Botha, head of corporate affairs at the PIC, told Reuters. \nAt 1147 GMT, M&R was down 0.30 percent to 13.41 rand.
