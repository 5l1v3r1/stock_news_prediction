The offering is expected to close on March 23, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Partnership estimates that it will receive net proceeds of approximately $710.5 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts. The net proceeds from the offering, together with the net proceeds from a private placement of preferred units of the Partnership and borrowings under its asset-based revolving credit facility, will be used to fund the cash purchase price of the Partnership’s previously announced acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in CDM Resource Management LLC and CDM Environmental & Technical Services LLC from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.7 billion consisting of units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership and an amount in cash equal to $1.225 billion, subject to certain adjustments (the “CDM Acquisition”).\nThe notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Unless they are registered, the notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The offering may be made only by means of an offering memorandum.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this press release may be forward-looking statements as defined under federal law, including those related to the Partnership’s securities offering and the CDM Acquisition.
