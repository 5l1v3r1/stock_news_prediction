The move also prompted E.U. trade chiefs to weigh hitting a broad array of U.S. imports with a 25 percent tax, Reuters reported this week.\nGetty Images President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with leaders of the steel industry at the White House March 1, 2018 in Washington, DC. The president's full-throated backing of tariffs is in keeping with a campaign pledge to protect American workers from the vagaries of global trade. On Saturday, Trump renewed his criticism of U.S. trade policy, insisting that world leaders have \"taken advantage of\" the world's largest economy for years.\n\"The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our \"very stupid\" trade deals and policies,\" Trump tweeted.\n\"Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years,\" he said. \"They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!\"\nTrump's enthusiastic embrace of populist economic policy has set parts of his base against one another. Larry Kudlow, a former Reagan official and prominent Republican economist who is a regular CNBC contributor, blasted the tariff decision in an opinion piece published on Saturday.\nAccording to a report in The Wall Street Journal, White House e conomic advisor Gary Cohn has privately told confidantes that Trump's move against steel imports could prompt his resignation. The president's decision reportedly touched off an internecine battle among his aides, with Cohn's camp ending up on the losing end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T20:07:44.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
