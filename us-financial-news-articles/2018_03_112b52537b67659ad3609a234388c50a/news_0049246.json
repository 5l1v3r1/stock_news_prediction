(IAIC:OTCBB) today reported results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Revenues were up 58% to $10,641,000, compared to revenues of $6,729,000 for the same period in 2016. The information technology services company reported net income of $246,000, or $0.02 per share basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $554,000, or $(0.05) per share basic and diluted, reported for the comparable 2016 period.\n“In 2017, the Company continued its effort to focus on legacy system modernization,” said Sandor Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IAI. “This has driven a 48 per cent increase in professional services revenue. In addition, we are making investments in marketing and sales in both the commercial market as well as in the government sector. We have been aggressively pursuing new business opportunities through the bidding process for prime contracts and teaming with our partners. Recently, a federal government customer elected to proceed with a needed modernization effort that we have been pursuing for years with a key partner, and we have once again proven ourselves to be able to engineer substantial modernization efforts on time and within budget. We expect that effort to expand into other opportunities.\n“In recent months, several large companies have approached IAI to be part of their modernization teams due to IAI’s unique knowledge of legacy systems and unique tools to efficiently and cost-effectively modernize them.\n“We continue to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities.”\nAbout Information Analysis Incorporated\nInformation Analysis Incorporated ( www.infoa.com ), headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, is an information technology product and services company.
