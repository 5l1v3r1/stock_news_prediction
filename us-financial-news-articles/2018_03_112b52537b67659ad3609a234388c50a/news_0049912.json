That has come as volatility increased in emerging markets, with U.S. interest rate hikes and equity market sell-offs last month prompting a flight to safety.\nArgentine companies have found it harder to list shares abroad, with power company Central Puerto SA and airport operator Corporacion America Airports raising less than hoped, and biotechnology firm Bioceres postponing its initial public offering.\nInvestors are also attentive to Macri’s struggles to lower inflation and boost growth, Jacobs said. In December, the government loosened its inflation targets, sending the peso currency tumbling. Twelve-month inflation rose to 25.4 percent in February from 25 percent the month before.\nCentral bank chief Federico Sturzenegger said it would decelerate when utility price hikes, key to cutting the fiscal deficit, end.\nMacri has struggled to push his labor reform through congress, where his coalition is in the minority.\n“Some of his political momentum might be slowing down,” Jacobs said. “I don’t think (there are) red flags going off, but there’s been such a wave of positive news ... that this might just be a little bit of cooling off in the sentiment.”\nThe ETF tracks overseas-listed shares of companies with Argentina exposure. Its largest holding is online retailer Mercadolibre Inc, followed by steelmaker Tenaris and financial services company Grupo Financiero Galicia.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Christian Plumb and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T05:44:56.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
