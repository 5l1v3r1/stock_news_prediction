But these people should be in no doubt that we will use every capability at our disposal to defeat them.”\nBritain suffered five attacks in 2017 which the authorities described as terrorism, and police said they had thwarted another 14 since March last year.\nSince being appointed prime minister in 2016, May’s government has begun a review of Britain’s national security capabilities to look at the changing nature of threats and into everything from counter-terrorism to combating organized crime.\nThe Salisbury attack, which left Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in a critical condition, has made the report even more timely, a senior British official said, especially by underlining the importance of communications and soft power.\nShortly after London blamed Moscow, Russia started spreading different explanations for the attack, “disinformation” designed “to confuse the charge sheet, if you like, against Russia that the prime minister set out quite clearly”, the official said.\nThe official said that countering that narrative in public and diplomatically to convince other nations that there was no other plausible narrative had helped seal the “only collective expulsion of intelligence officers and other covert networks under diplomatic cover” from more than 20 countries.\nCombined with sharing intelligence with other nations and multi-national bodies, the new approach taken by Britain had brought swift results to punish Moscow, the official said.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:21:59.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
