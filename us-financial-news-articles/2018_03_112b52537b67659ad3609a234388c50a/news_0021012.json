With all the talk of consumer optimism and strong holiday sales, it seemed poised to build on those gains, but the stock lost some of its luster after Tuesday’s earnings miss. \nTarget reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.37 a share, lagging estimates of $1.38 a share. The stock had its biggest intraday tumble since a much more significant profit warning about the holiday season back in November.\nMore \nQualcomm’s Spending Buys the Right Friends March 6, 2018 Tax Cuts Fuel Biggest Merger Spree Since 2000 March 6, 2018 Why Spotify Won’t Be the Netflix of Music March 6, 2018 On other fronts, though, the company gave investors a lot to celebrate. Revenue for the quarter reached $22.8 billion, beating estimates of $22.5 billion, and comparable sales increased 3.6% from the same period a year ago. It wasn’t all confined to the holiday season either: strong sales continued into January, sending the company’s e-commerce sales for the quarter up 29%. That was the best in recent memory and was better than Walmart for the quarter. Target’s big-box rival had been increasing its online sales at a far more rapid clip in previous quarters but its e-commerce growth dipped to just 23% as it redirected its efforts from its Jet subsidiary to Walmart .

Photo: LM Otero/Associated Press Target’s profit miss was largely due to the cost of its own digital investments. Its gross margin fell to 26.2% for the quarter from 26.6% a year earlier. Citing “pressure from digital fulfillment costs,” Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell emphasized that the company is making careful, long-term investments to compete in the new retail world.\nIn December the company paid $550 million for Shipt, a same-day delivery startup—part of a three-year, $7 billion investment plan that includes launching private labels and remodeling stores to better handle pickup of online orders.\nThose investments may be costly in the short-term, but they are the right moves if Target is serious about surviving in the digital era. Optimism sent retail stocks too high; a reality check has brought them back to earth. But investors should be pleased with Target’s turnaround. Beating Walmart in digital sales growth is nothing to frown at.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:45:53.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
