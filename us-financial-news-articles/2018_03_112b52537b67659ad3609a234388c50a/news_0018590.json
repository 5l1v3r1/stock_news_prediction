The major indexes are off their record highs 6.4 percent and 4.6 percent respectively. \nThis chart from Leuthold Group shows where the Dow bull market stacks up since 1900. It's far and away the longest in modern financial times. In terms of percentage gains, it's third behind two bull markets pre-WWII. \nSource: Leuthold Group \nLPL chief investment strategist John Lynch, who measured the S&P 500, says the index is in the middle of its second-longest and second-greatest run ever. \nSource: John Lynch, LPL Financial \nThe S&P 500 posted a 418 percent gain from October 1990 through March 2000, well ahead of its current 302 percent climb as of Jan. 26 as technology stocks boosted the index more so than the Dow.
