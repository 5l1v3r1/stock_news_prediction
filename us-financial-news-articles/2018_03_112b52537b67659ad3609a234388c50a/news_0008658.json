Trump said he was not backing down on the plan, saying he did not think that there would be a trade war due to the tariffs.\n“There has been a lot of conflicting information in terms of (administration’s) plans and it’s leading to some back and forth movement in the market,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n“Nobody wants to take a big position to sell, only to find the administration change its mind.”\nThe global stocks also recovered to move higher, with oil prices rising on forecasts for robust demand growth and concerns that OPEC will not be able to increase its production capacity.\nTrump’s threat of tariffs had rattled investors, with global stock markets sliding since Thursday.\n“I think investors have stepped back from the immediate reaction,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, adding that Ryan’s comments were helping some gains.\nAt 12:56 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average was up 217.63 points, or 0.89 percent, at 24,755.69, the S&P 500 was up 24.08 points, or 0.89 percent, at 2,715.33.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was up 61.68 points, or 0.85 percent, at 7,319.54.\nShares of Clearside Biomedical jumped 37 percent after the drug developer’s eye drug met the main goal in a late-stage study, while Dermira plunged 64 percent after the company abandoned its acne drug.\nGeneral Electric shares rose 2.7 percent after brokerage William Blair’s bullish note.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,978 to 863.
