Two people were killed in the store, he said.\nA gunman claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group has allegedly fired shots and taken hostages at a supermarket in southwestern France. The minister praised a lieutenant-colonel in the national gendarmerie for an \"act of heroism\" in exchanging places with a hostage inside the supermarket, NBC News reported.\nThe Islamic State militant group (ISIS) later claimed responsibility for the attack, but provided no evidence, Reuters said.\nSpeaking in Brussels while the situation was ongoing, French President Emmanuel Macron said the situation appeared to be of a terrorist nature and that he was to return to Paris this afternoon.\nFrench media reported that the gunman had claimed allegiance to ISIS.\n- Graham Smith contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Place_Beauvau/status/977150299277287424"], "published": "2018-03-23T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T15:53:56.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
