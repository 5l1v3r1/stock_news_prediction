REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst South Korea has been kept on a Treasury currency “monitoring list” due to its large global current account surplus and U.S. trade surplus. The Treasury’s October report urged Korea to “to enhance the transparency of its exchange rate intervention.”\nSTEEL QUOTAS, TARIFFS The officials confirmed that South Korea agreed to cut its steel exports to the United States by about 30 percent in exchange for the rest being excluded from steel tariffs. Korean aluminum producers would still be subject to U.S. President Donald Trump’s 10 percent tariff on aluminum.\nOther countries also must agree to similar quotas to escape tariffs, but the size of the limits would vary. The United States is negotiating with Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the European Union, Australia and Argentina.\nOne official said it was “not a one-size fits all kind of thing” and added that the South Korean quota was agreed due to its “unique” position in steel exports. South Korea imports and processes significant amounts of Chinese-made steel, much of which is under anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs.\n“What will be the same for any country that is out from under the 232 tariff, like with Korea, there will be a hard quota,” the official added.\nSouth Korea also agreed to amend a government health program that pays premium prices to domestic drug companies in order to ensure a level playing field for U.S. pharmaceuticals producers, the U.S. officials said.\nFILE PHOTO - Rolled steel are seen at a Hyundai Steel plant in Dangjin, about 130 km (81 miles) southwest of Seoul June 15, 2011. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won In addition to the increased access for American vehicles that meet U.S. but not necessarily South Korean safety standards, the U.S. officials also said they won reductions in non-tariff barriers to U.S. vehicle sales, including elimination of duplicate environmental testing requirements and recognition of U.S. replacement parts standards.\nExtension of the phase-out period for U.S. pickup truck tariffs to 2041 would ensure that U.S. pickup truck production would not migrate to South Korea as some production moved to Mexico after the North American Free Trade Agreement eliminated the tariff, the officials said.\nReporting by Cynthia Kim, Shin-hyung Lee; Editing by James Dalgleish and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T05:23:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
