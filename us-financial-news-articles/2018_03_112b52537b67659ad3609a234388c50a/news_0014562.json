[nL4N1QQ1M8]\nMalmstrom said in a tweet: “The EU is a close ally of the U.S. and we continue to be of the view that the EU should be excluded from these measures.”\n“I will seek more clarity on this issue in the days to come. Looking forward to meeting USTR Lighthizer in Brussels on Sat to discuss.”\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who is set to handle negotiations with countries seeking an exemption, is due to meet Malmstrom and Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko in Brussels on Saturday to discuss steel overcapacity.
