Illegal political funding to candidates in local assembly elections in 2009 prompted the resignations of the then CEO and chairman.\nFor now, the data fraud scandal appears to have left Kobe Steel's finances unscathed. In February, the company reinstated a forecast for its first annual profit in three years for the year ending March 31, backed by strong profits in steel and machinery.\nBut the company is also undergoing a U.S. Justice Department probe, meaning it still faces legal and financial risk. A Japanese government-sanctioned seal of quality has been revoked on some of its product as well.\n\"There is a pending risk for Kobe Steel as customers at home or abroad may cancel their contracts and they may take legal actions, and the U.S. Justice Department may seek a penalty,\" said Makiko Yoshimura, director at S&P Global Rating Japan.\nIt is unclear how much a Justice Department fine would be. Last year, Japan's Takata Corp agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and pay $1 billion to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its airbag inflators that were linked to more than 20 deaths worldwide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T16:16:46.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
