The funds’ 20-year annualized return was 6.79 percent.\nEven so, the total funded ratio was just under 49 percent, according to the Treasury’s annual report for fiscal 2016, the most current such report available. A ratio of at least 80 percent is often considered healthy.\nReporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T02:07:11.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
