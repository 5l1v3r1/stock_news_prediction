Its total flights increased by 2.0 percent.\nThe airline said it flew 1.48 million passengers in the two month period compared to 1.32 million in Jan-Feb last year.\n“2018 started with positive signs as regards (passenger) traffic and load factors,” said the carrier’s CEO Dimitris Gerogiannis.\n“The initial indications of demand for the summer period are also positive despite increased capacity by the competition,” he said.\nThe carrier is adding 11 new routes this year, including Basel in Switzerland, Malaga in Spain and Palermo, Turin and Bologna in Italy.\nAegean plans to renew its fleet of mostly Airbus narrow body jets and is currently evaluating the new generation Airbus A320neo family and Boeing’s 737MAX.
