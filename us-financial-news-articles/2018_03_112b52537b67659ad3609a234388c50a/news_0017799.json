That slight rise came after a more than 2 percent fall the previous day.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.29 a barrel, up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent. WTI also fell by more than 2 percent the previous session.\nThe slight recovery on Thursday came amid a U.S. crude inventory build that was not as big as expected during the current seasonal demand lull at the end of winter, when many oil refineries shut down for maintenance.\n\"Oil prices bounced back immediately after the release of the weekly oil inventories data from the Energy Information Administration ...
