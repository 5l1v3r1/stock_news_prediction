Bayer has already pledged to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros (5.23 billion pounds) to BASF ( BASFn.DE ) to address EU regulatory concerns and has separately offered to sell its vegetable seeds business to BASF. “These divestments are covered by our agreement and the ongoing negotiations with BASF as previously communicated,” Bayer said in a statement.

Bayer has secured the go-ahead from Brazilian regulators, while people familiar with the matter told Reuters two weeks ago that Bayer was in the frame to win conditional antitrust approval from the European Union for the $62.5 billion deal. Bayer said at the time that the U.S. review was not as far advanced as EU’s, but it was confident it would make progress there over the next few weeks. In Russia, however, Bayer has taken the regulator to court to“safeguard its rights” in the review procedure.
