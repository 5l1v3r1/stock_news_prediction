Economists have projected China’s economic expansion to moderate to 6.5% this year, as the government continues to rein in risky lending practices and trade tensions with the U.S. rise .\nMr. Li didn’t announce any significant new initiatives and the stay-the-course tone of his report signaled that the focus of this year’s congress lies elsewhere. On Sunday, lawmakers are due to approve constitutional changes that scrap presidential term limits, allowing President Xi to stay in power indefinitely, and entrench the Communist Party’s leading role in governing China.\nThe National People’s Congress: In Depth \nREPORT ON THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT (Premier Li Keqiang) In English In Chinese NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND REFORM COMMISSION DRAFT PLAN FOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT In English In Chinese MINISTRY OF FINANCE BUDGET REPORT In English In Chinese The National People’s Congress will also fill senior government posts—with Xi allies likely to benefit—and review plans to overhaul the government bureaucracy that would give the party greater authority over decision-making, a key step in Mr. Xi’s plans to install himself at the center of Chinese political power.\nIn a policy blueprint Mr. Xi unveiled at a Communist Party congress last October, he demanded greater loyalty and commitment from his 89 million party members as a way of cutting through graft and bureaucratic inertia that has hampered his policy agenda.\nIn his speech, Premier Li suggested challenges from rising global protectionism but didn’t mention the threats of new trade sanctions from the U.S. Senior Chinese officials have mounted a big diplomatic offensive in the past month to seek to fend off such actions. Even so, President Donald Trump has announced plans for new steel and aluminum tariffs and White House officials are preparing broad trade and investment penalties against China.\n“Protectionism is mounting and geopolitical risks are on the ascent,” Mr. Li said. He pledged to step up efforts to invite in foreign capital and promised tax deferrals for profits reinvested in China. Western officials and industrial executives have largely treated such promises by Beijing with skepticism, pointing to a lack of implementation of them in practice.\nBeijing’s messages about its resolve to shift to higher-quality growth appeared mixed. Citing the good turn in the economy last year, Mr. Li’s report projected a fiscal deficit of 2.6% of economic output, lower than last year’s target of 3%. It highlighted the need to rein in rampant borrowing by local governments and eliminated a goal for fixed-assets investment. \nAt the same time, however, the report reiterated that the government needed to be “proactive,” a signal it may step up state investment, and didn’t single out debt reduction as an objective. Instead, the report calls for “reasonable” credit expansion in 2018 and said China’s overall debt levels will remain “basically steady.”\nSince late last year, the leadership has softened the goal to deleverage into a mission to control the rise of debt and defuse potential risks. The shift indicates a growing realization of how hard it is to reduce debt without significantly dragging down growth.\nThe government also reported Monday that China’s defense budget will grow by 8.1% this year to 1.11 trillion yuan ($175 billion), up from 7% in 2017 and reversing three years of slowing growth in planned military spending.\nUnder Mr. Xi, China has been pursuing sweeping military overhauls aimed at creating a modern fighting force capable of defending its expanding global interests. A congress spokesman said Sunday that Beijing’s military spending remained low relative to other major countries, when compared as a share of economic output, national fiscal spending, and on a per capita basis.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Li said China will continue to reduce excessive industrial overcapacity, slightly lowering targets for cuts in steel-production capacity to 30 million tons. China exceeded its goal for steel cuts last year by eliminating more than 50 million tons in capacity, official data show. Mr. Li said targeted coal-capacity cuts this year were unchanged at 150 million tons. \nRelated \nXi Jinping’s the Man in Beijing’s Policy Report Chinese Premier’s Economy Speech Offers Plenty for Critics to Dislike In his speech, the premier also talked up Mr. Xi’s Made in China 2025 plan aimed at upgrading the nation’s manufacturing capabilities. Many U.S. and other Western officials have expressed concerns over the policy, saying it encourages the government to further subsidize state firms and drive Chinese companies to force technology transfers from their foreign partners. \nIn his talks with U.S. officials in Washington the past week, Liu He, the top economic adviser to Mr. Xi , played down the importance of this plan in fostering Chinese growth, according to individuals with knowledge of the events.\nThe push-and-pull over economic policy exposes divisions within the government, according to China watchers. In the past five years, Mr. Xi has consolidated decision-making, including that involving the economy. His trusted adviser, Mr. Liu, is expected to be named as a vice premier in charge of a wide swath of the economy during the legislative session.\nIn his remarks Monday, Mr. Li also sought to make a stronger point about making China a country of innovators than he had in the past several years.\n“China is home to the biggest pool of human resources and talent in the world,” he said. “We will provide services that tick every box for inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs.”\nWrite to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com and Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T05:41:00.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
