We need certainty, in terms of decision-making, we need certainty for investment climate, because altogether, I think the underlying demand is there on the consumer side.\"\nMarket watchers have previously warned that worsening trade tensions between the U.S. and China could lead to a all-out trade war — that, in turn, could trigger a recession . In a recent CNBC survey, business leaders said that a trade war between the two major economic powerhouses will have a negative impact on both the U.S. and Chinese economies .\nBeijing last week said it may target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion in response to President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month that imposed broad duties on foreign aluminum and steel imports.\nThe U.S. president had also announced tariff plans for up to $60 billion in Chinese imports , although China didn't officially connected its Friday threats of retaliation to that White House action.\nSpiesshofer explained that ABB invested about $13 billion in the U.S. in the past and that it was making a lot of \"significant investments to put ABB strong on the map.\" He added that the company was also investing heavily in China and had picked up about 30 local firms under the ABB umbrella.\n\"So we invest our money wisely in the key market opportunities. China is a very important one, and so is the U.S.,\" he said.\nABB operates in areas of utility, industry, transport and infrastructure in about 100 countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T08:23:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
