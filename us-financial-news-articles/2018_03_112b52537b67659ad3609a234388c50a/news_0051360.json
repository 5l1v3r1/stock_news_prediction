DuPree brings 20 years of experience with him, having served in various leadership roles for several national public homebuilders across the country, most recently as Division President of CalAtlantic Homes’ Charlotte division. Additionally, DuPree’s resume includes five years of experience in the Colorado market, having worked as the East Region and Colorado President of Richmond American Homes. He began his career with Deloitte and Touche in Atlanta as a Public Accountant and Management Consultant serving primarily real estate clients.\nDuPree brings 20 years experience to his new role as president of the homebuilder's Colorado division\n“We are fortunate to have Darren take on this leadership role for our Colorado division,” said Tom Mitchell, Chief Operating Officer and President of TRI Pointe Group. “His comprehensive understanding of homebuilding and his experience in the Colorado market greatly positions him to lead the growth of TRI Pointe Homes Colorado. We’re thrilled to welcome him to the team.”\nDenver can generally be categorized as having strong sales fueled in part by limited inventory (less than one month’s worth of resale home supply), and a low unemployment rate of 2.9 percent. And, despite some moderating, home price growth is projected through 2021, according to Kenneth S. Perlman, Principal at John Burns Real Estate Consulting.\n“TRI Pointe Homes Colorado will respond to Denver’s regional growth by continuing to focus on purchasing land and building in both self-developed infill locations and master-planned communities,” said DuPree. “We plan to expand the company’s footprint across a variety of price points and market segments, including first-time buyers, move-up/luxury buyers, and age-targeted communities. I couldn’t be more excited to be joining the TRI Pointe team during this period of growth.”\nContributing to the region’s growth and increased demand, TRI Pointe Homes has recently opened two new communities: The Prelude Collection and the Debut Collection in Ravenwood Village at Terrain. Priced in the high $300,000s, the Prelude Collection features two-story single-family homes ranging from 2,059 to 2,788 square feet with 3 to 5 bedrooms and 2.5 to 4 bathrooms. Priced in the low $400,000s, the Debut Collection features ranch and two-story single-family homes ranging from 2,018 to 3,139 square feet with 2 to 5 bedrooms and 2.5 to 5.5 bathrooms. An additional community, Crescendo Collection at Crown Point, is slated to open in fall 2018.\nUnder DuPree’s direction, the company will continue to build upon the strong relationships established with existing trade partners and the Denver area community. “TRI Pointe Homes Colorado was honored by the Home Building Association of Denver’s Homebuilder & Associates in Partnership Award for Best National Production Builder in 2017 for the third consecutive year. This is not only recognition that the TRI Pointe Homes Colorado team is honored to receive, but also a core value that we aim to demonstrate day in and day out,” said DuPree. The customer experience is also top of mind for the company which was the recipient of Eliant Homebuyers’ Choice Awards in four categories in 2017 and 2018 including First-Year Customer Experience, Design Experience, Construction Experience, and Purchase Experience. “We are committed to improving the customer experience and providing Colorado homebuyers with a superior level of service for years to come.”\nAbout TRI Pointe Homes ® Colorado\nBased in Denver, Colorado, TRI Pointe Homes Colorado designs, constructs, and sells innovative single-family homes.
