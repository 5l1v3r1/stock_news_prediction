French Connection, which made a name for itself selling FCUK branded clothes, has been struggling to fend off competition from fast-fashion rivals such as ASOS Plc ( ASOS.L ), Forever 21 and Inditex’s ( ITX.MC ) Zara. It has closed stores and hired new management and design teams as it tries to turn the corner. The company, which also owns the Great Plains and YMC brands, said on Tuesday it closed an additional 11 non-contributing locations during the year. “While it is clear that the retail market in which we are operating in the UK is unlikely to improve in the near future, we have clear visibility on the benefits we will obtain from the ongoing portfolio rationalisation,” Chief Executive Officer Stephen Marks said. The company said its underlying operating loss for the year ended Jan. 31 came in at 0.6 million pounds, compared with a loss of 3.7 million pounds in the prior year. Revenue rose 0.5 percent to 154 million pounds.
