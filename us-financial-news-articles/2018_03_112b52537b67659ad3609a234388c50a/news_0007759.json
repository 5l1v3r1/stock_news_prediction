Australia celebrates the wicket of South Africa's AB de Villiers. REUTERS/Rogan Ward South Africa were 293-9 at the close of the fourth day, still 123 runs adrift of Australia, who will return on Monday to wrap up what appears an almost inevitable victory and a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.\nSouth Africa’s opener Aiden Markram provided some stout resistance, scoring 143 runs, while Quinton de Kock’s unbeaten 81 also helped frustrate the visitors as South Africa recovered from a horrid start to their second innings.\nAustralia looked to be heading to an easy win when they set South Africa 417 for victory before taking four key home wickets for just 49 runs before lunch as they devastated the home team’s top order.\nDean Elgar was the first to go for nine before Josh Hazlewood claimed the wicket of Hashim Amla — the sixth time he has done so in the last four tests between the two countries.\nAB de Villiers was run out after facing a single ball and then captain Faf du Plessis scored only four before having his stumps knocked out of the ground by Pat Cummins.\nCricket - South Africa vs Australia - First Test Match - Kingsmead Stadium, Durban, South Africa - March 4, 2018.
