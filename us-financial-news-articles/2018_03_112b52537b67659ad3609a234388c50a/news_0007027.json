For the week, they are down 2.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively.\nShares in Asian steelmakers slid, with South Korea’s Posco falling 3.3 percent and Japan’s Nippon Steel down 3.8 percent.\nToyota Motor shares were down 2.4 percent after the automaker said the planned tariffs would substantially raise the production costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in America.\nIn China, Shanghai composite index dropped 0.6 percent.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 on Thursday, coming a day after investors sold off heavily on worries the Federal Reserve might increase rates more than expected this year.\nTrump’s latest trade salvo comes after Washington slapped steep tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines in January, prompting China to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into imports of sorghum from the United States.\nThe anxiety over tit-for-tat moves was underscored by Canada’s quick response, with officials in Ottawa saying they will retaliate against any U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium products.\nMarkets are already fretting about the tempo of U.S. rate hikes this year, and now added to that is the fear escalating trade protectionism could dent global growth and corporate earnings - key drivers of last year’s rally in equities .\nConcerns over a harmful trade war eclipsed upbeat U.S. economic data published on Thursday, including a rise in the manufacturing index to 14-year highs and another showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits hitting a 48-year low.\nU.S. Treasury yields fell as the risk of a trade war appeared to push aside considerations of inflation, a major theme that spooked global financial markets earlier this year.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.811 percent, hitting its lowest level in three weeks and further extending the distance from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb 21.\nSome say, on the other hand, markets may be over-reacting.\n“Trump has been repeatedly boasting about the rise in share prices. If this is going to lead to a sustained drop in share prices, I’ll bet he is likely to change his stance,” said Nobuyuki Kashihara, head of research at Asset Management One.\nIn the currency market, the dollar’s rebound following the bullish comments on the U.S. economy from new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday lost momentum.\nThe euro jumped back to $1.2271, after having hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 on Thursday.\nThe yen got an additional boost when Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he would mull an exit from the BOJ’s current stimulus regime if the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target is achieved in 2019.\nThe dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 105.79 yen, edging back towards its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16.\nThe dollar index is down 2.1 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump administration prefers a weaker dollar to help narrow the United States’s yawning trade deficit.\nWorries that Trump’s big tax cuts and spending plans will ramp up fiscal deficits to the extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt have also hurt the greenback.\nOil prices were also under pressure, having fallen more than 1 percent the previous day on trade friction fears.\nU.S. crude was little changed in late Asian trade at $60.93 per barrel, having fallen to two-week low of $60.18 on Thursday. It is down 3.7 percent so far this week.\nBrent futures traded at $63.85 per barrel after having hit a two-week low of $63.19.\nEditing by Sam Holmes and Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T15:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:04:19.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
