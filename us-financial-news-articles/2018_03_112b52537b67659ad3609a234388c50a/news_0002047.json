(NYSE: FL), the New York-based specialty athletic retailer, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year. The Company's fiscal 2017 ended on February 3, 2018, reflecting a 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week year, compared to the 13-week and 52-week periods in fiscal 2016. The additional week is not included in comparable-store sales results for the quarter or the year.\n- Fourth quarter net loss was $49 Million, or 40 cents per share\n- Excluding charges and adjustments, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.26\n- Fourth quarter comparable-store sales decreased 3.7 percent\n\"The dramatic shifts influencing the expectations and behaviors of our customers continued to affect our business in the fourth quarter, just as they have throughout 2017,\" said Richard Johnson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. \"That said, we remained a highly profitable company in 2017, even though our sales and profit results were not what we planned for going into the year. Looking ahead, with the product and other strategic initiatives we have underway, we believe we are positioned well, both organizationally and financially, to successfully transform our business to continue inspiring and serving an exceptionally dynamic youth culture, for generations to come.\"\nFourth Quarter Results\nThe Company reported a net loss of $49 million, or $0.40 per share, for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2018, compared to net income of $189 million, or $1.42 per share in the same period of fiscal 2016. With the benefit of the extra week, total fourth quarter sales increased 4.6 percent, to $2,210 million this year, compared to sales of $2,113 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, total sales for the quarter increased 2.0 percent. Fourth quarter comparable-store sales decreased 3.7 percent.\nOn a 14-week basis, the Company's gross margin rate decreased to 31.4 percent from 33.7 percent a year ago, reflecting the continuation of a highly promotional marketplace environment, and its SG&A expense rate increased to 19.1 percent from 18.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nThe quarterly results this year included several one-time charges, all of which are detailed below in the accompanying reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. The two most significant adjustments were (1) $99 million of incremental tax expense, or $0.81 per share, due to the recently-enacted reform of the U.S. tax code, virtually all of which related to the levy for the deemed repatriation of offshore earnings and (2) a $128 million charge, pre-tax, or $0.66 per share after tax, related to the Company's ongoing pension litigation. This incremental litigation charge brings the total liability recorded for this matter to $278 million. In the prior year period, the Company's tax expense was affected by two non-recurring items, which together increased reported earnings by five cents per share. These prior year items are also noted in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation below.\nExcluding the charges and adjustments in both years, fourth quarter non-GAAP net income was $155 million, or $1.26 per share, versus $1.37 in 2016. The extra week in this year's fourth quarter results contributed $16 million to net income, or $0.12 per share. Excluding this benefit as well, non-GAAP net income was $1.14 per share.\nFiscal Year Results\nSales for 2017 were $7,782 million, an increase of 0.2 percent compared to sales of $7,766 million in fiscal 2016 and the most in the Company's history as an athletic business. Full-year comparable-store sales decreased 3.1 percent. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, total sales decreased 0.5 percent.\nThe Company's net income decreased to $284 million in 2017, or $2.22 per share, compared to net income of $664 million, or $4.91 per share in 2016. On a non-GAAP, 52-week basis, earnings per share totaled $3.99 in 2017, a 17 percent decrease over last year's non-GAAP earnings of $4.82.\n\"The efforts, passion, and intensity of our global team of associates was every bit as strong this year as it was in recent years of record financial performance --- perhaps even more so,\" continued Mr. Johnson, \"and I cannot thank them enough for their work this year. We believe we are well positioned to engage with our customers in ways they find meaningful as they seek to express their passion for the people, experiences, and products that are important to them.\"\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company currently expects a flat to up low single-digit comparable-store sales performance for fiscal 2018 and gross margins to begin recovering from 2017's 31.6 percent rate, which fell 2.3 percent from the gross margin rate in fiscal 2016. Including the effect of elevated and accelerated digital investments, the Company's SG&A rate is expected to be approximately 100 basis points higher in 2018.\n\"The first quarter of 2018 will likely see the continuation of sales and margins in line with trends in the second half of 2017,\" said Lauren Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"However, we are confident that we will inflect back to positive comparable-store sales by the middle of 2018, with the pace of sales continuing to gradually strengthen in the second half of the year based on the improving depth and variety of premium products we see coming from our key vendors. We also expect a double-digit percentage increase in annual earnings per share, with an effective tax rate in the 27 to 28 percent range and a lower share count both contributing to this performance.\"\nFinancial Position\nAt February 3, 2018, the Company's merchandise inventories were $1,278 million, 2.2 percent lower than at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Using constant currencies, inventory decreased 5.2 percent.\n\"The very strong inventory management performance by the Company caused our inventory turns to improve for the full year despite top line pressures, and allows us the flexibility going forward to flow in the exciting product assortments we expect will fuel our business as 2018 unfolds,\" added Ms. Peters.\nThe Company spent $105 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares during the quarter and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. For the full year, the Company returned $624 million to shareholders through its share repurchase program and dividends, spending $467 million to repurchase 12.4 million shares, and paying $157 million in dividends. In addition, the Company invested approximately $270 million in its store fleet, its digital platform, logistics capabilities, and infrastructure.\nThe Company's cash totaled $849 million, while the debt on its balance sheet was $125 million. The Company's total cash position, net of debt, was $195 million lower than at the same time last year. The reduction in cash was largely due to the pre-funding of $150 million of the pension litigation liability just before the end of the year. This restricted cash is now reflected in Other Assets on the balance sheet.\n\"Our financial position remains strong, as are our connections to youth culture,\" concluded Ms. Peters. \"We announced last week that our Board of Directors has authorized another double-digit percentage increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.345 per share, and approved a $230 million capital expenditures program for 2018, both of which actions reflect the Board's confidence in our ability to fund and execute the initiatives necessary to transform the business while also continuing to return cash to shareholders.\"\nStore Base Update\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company opened 28 new stores, remodeled or relocated 45 stores, and closed 67 stores. As of February 3, 2018, the Company operated 3,310 stores in 24 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In addition, 98 franchised Foot Locker stores were operating in the Middle East, as well as 14 franchised Runners Point stores in Germany.\nThe Company is hosting a live conference call at 9:00 a.m. (EST) today, March 2, 2018, to review these results and discuss the outlook for fiscal 2018.

In the following tables, we have presented certain financial measures identified as non-GAAP, such as adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business or which affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives.\nThe various non-GAAP adjustments are summarized on the following tables. In addition, fiscal year 2017 represents the fourteen and fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018. Accordingly, non-GAAP results have also been adjusted to exclude the effects of the 53rd week. We estimate the tax effect of all non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal tax rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period.\nThe non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(unaudited)\nPeriods ended February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results:\nFourth Quarter\nFiscal Year\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nSales\n$\n2,210\n$\n2,113\n$\n7,782\n$\n7,766\n53rd week\n95\n—\n95\n—\nSales excluding 53rd week (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,115\n$\n2,113\n$\n7,687\n$\n7,766\nPre-tax income:\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n80\n$\n281\n$\n578\n$\n1,004\nPre-tax adjustments excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation and other charges (1)\n148\n—\n211\n6\n53rd week\n(25)\n—\n(25)\n—\nAdjusted income before income taxes (non-GAAP)\n$\n203\n$\n281\n$\n764\n$\n1,010\nAfter-tax income:\nNet (loss)/income\n$\n(49)\n$\n189\n$\n284\n$\n664\nAfter-tax adjustments excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation and other charges, net of income tax benefit of $53, $-, $78,\nand $1 million, respectively (1)\n95\n—\n133\n5\nU.S. tax reform (2)\n99\n—\n99\n—\nIncome tax valuation allowances (3)\n8\n—\n8\n—\nTax expense related to French tax rate change (4)\n2\n2\n2\n2\nTax benefit related to enacted change in foreign branch currency\nregulations (5)\n—\n(9)\n—\n(9)\nTax benefit related to intellectual property reassessment (6)\n—\n—\n—\n(10)\n53rd week, net of income tax expense of $9 million\n(16)\n—\n(16)\n—\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP)\n$\n139\n$\n182\n$\n510\n$\n652\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(unaudited)\nPeriods ended February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, continued:\nFourth Quarter\nFiscal Year\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nEarnings per share:\nDiluted EPS\n$\n(0.40)\n$\n1.42\n$\n2.22\n$\n4.91\nDiluted EPS amounts excluded from GAAP:\nLitigation and other charges (1)\n0.76\n—\n1.02\n0.03\nU.S. tax reform (2)\n0.81\n—\n0.78\n—\nIncome tax valuation allowances (3)\n0.07\n—\n0.07\n—\nTax expense related to French tax rate change (4)\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\nTax benefit related to enacted change in foreign branch currency\nregulations (5)\n—\n(0.07)\n—\n(0.07)\nTax benefit related to intellectual property reassessment (6)\n—\n—\n—\n(0.07)\nAdjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP), including 53rd week\n$\n1.26\n$\n1.37\n$\n4.11\n$\n4.82\n53rd week\n(0.12)\n—\n(0.12)\n—\nAdjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP)\n$\n1.14\n$\n1.37\n$\n3.99\n$\n4.82\nNotes on Non-GAAP Adjustments:\n(1)\nLitigation and other charges for 2017 includes a pension litigation charge ($178 million, or $111 million after-tax), severance and related costs ($13 million, or $8 million after-tax), and impairment charges ($20 million, or $14 million after-tax). The 2016 amount represents impairment charges of $6 million, or $5 million after-tax.\nPension litigation - The Company recorded pre-tax charges of $50 million and $128 million in connection with its U.S. retirement plan litigation during the second and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. The Company had previously recorded a pre-tax charge for $100 million during 2015. These charges reflect the Company's revised estimate of its exposure for this matter, bringing the total pre-tax amount accrued to $278 million. The Company has exhausted its legal remedies and will reform the pension plan as required by the court rulings.\nSeverance and related costs – The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $13 million during the third quarter of 2017 associated with the reorganization and the reduction of staff taken to improve efficiency.\nImpairment charges – The Company recognized pre-tax impairment charges totaling $20 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. These charges were associated with our SIX:02, Runners Point, and Sidestep businesses and primarily represented the write-down of store fixtures and leasehold improvements. The 2016 amount related to Runners Point and Sidestep.\n(2)\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. The recognized charge was based on current interpretation of the tax law changes and includes a $99 million tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings and a corresponding change in our permanent reinvestment assertion under ASC 740-30. The tax effect of remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities was not significant. Our accounting for the new legislation is not complete and we have made reasonable estimates for some tax provisions. We exclude the discrete U.S. tax reform effect from our Adjusted diluted EPS as it does not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform.\n(3)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company determined that certain valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets associated with the Runners Point and Sidestep stores and e-commerce businesses.\n(4)\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized tax expense of $2 million in both periods in connection to two separate tax rate reductions in France.\n(5)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the U.S. Treasury issued regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987, which required us to change our method for determining the tax effects of foreign currency translation gains and losses for our foreign businesses that are operated as branches and are reported in a currency other than the currency of their parent. This change resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our income tax provision in the amount of $9 million.\n(6)\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, we performed a scheduled reassessment of the value of the intellectual property provided to our European business by Foot Locker in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012. The new, higher valuation resulted in catch-up deductions that reduced tax expense by $10 million.\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(unaudited)\n(In millions)\nFebruary 3,\nJanuary 28,\n2018\n2017\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n849\n$\n1,046\nMerchandise inventories\n1,278\n1,307\nOther current assets\n424\n280\n2,551\n2,633\nProperty and equipment, net\n866\n765\nDeferred taxes\n48\n161\nOther assets\n496\n281\n$\n3,961\n$\n3,840\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n258\n$\n249\nAccrued and other liabilities\n358\n363\n616\n612\nLong-term debt and obligations under capital leases\n125\n127\nOther liabilities\n701\n391\nTotal liabilities\n1,442\n1,130\nTotal shareholders' equity\n2,519\n2,710\n$\n3,961\n$\n3,840\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nStore and Square Footage\n(unaudited)\nStore activity is as follows:\nJanuary 28,\nFebruary 3,\nRelocations/\n2017\nOpened\nClosed\n2018\nRemodels\nFoot Locker US\n948\n4\n42\n910\n44\nFoot Locker Europe\n622\n24\n10\n636\n47\nFoot Locker Canada\n119\n1\n9\n111\n6\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\n95\n5\n2\n98\n9\nKids Foot Locker\n411\n39\n14\n436\n25\nLady Foot Locker\n124\n—\n39\n85\n—\nChamps Sports\n545\n4\n8\n541\n24\nFootaction\n261\n13\n14\n260\n22\nRunners Point\n122\n1\n5\n118\n7\nSidestep\n86\n—\n3\n83\n1\nSIX:02\n30\n3\n1\n32\n—\nTotal\n3,363\n94\n147\n3,310\n185\nSelling and gross square footage are as follows:\nJanuary 28, 2017\nFebruary 3, 2018\n(in thousands)\nSelling\nGross\nSelling\nGross\nFoot Locker US\n2,453\n4,250\n2,430\n4,225\nFoot Locker Europe\n907\n1,971\n957\n2,071\nFoot Locker Canada\n265\n432\n264\n431\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\n134\n220\n140\n230\nKids Foot Locker\n688\n1,175\n747\n1,285\nLady Foot Locker\n167\n280\n115\n195\nChamps Sports\n1,930\n2,978\n1,934\n2,994\nFootaction\n786\n1,309\n829\n1,374\nRunners Point\n162\n267\n150\n258\nSidestep\n81\n135\n76\n131\nSIX:02\n61\n101\n65\n109\nTotal\n7,634\n13,118\n7,707\n13,303\nFoot Locker, Inc.\nKey Performance Indicators\n(unaudited)\nThe change in comparable-store sales for the 13 week period ended January 27, 2018 was:\nChange in Comparable Sales *\nFoot Locker US\nDown Low-Single Digits\nFoot Locker Europe\nDown Low-Double Digits\nFoot Locker Canada\nDown Mid-Single Digits\nFoot Locker Asia Pacific\nDown Mid-Single Digits\nKids Foot Locker\nDown Low-Single Digits\nChamps Sports\nDown Low-Single Digits\nFootaction\nDown High-Single Digits\nRunners Point\nUp Low-Single Digits\nSidestep\nUp Low-Single Digits\nSIX:02\nDown Double Digits\nTotal Store Divisions\n-5.1%\nEastbay\nUp High-Single Digits\nU.S. Banners\nUp Low-Single Digits\nEurope\nUp High-Single Digits\nCanada\nUp Double Digits\nTotal Direct-to-Customer\n4.3%\nThe change in store traffic was as follows:\nChange in Traffic *\nU.S. store traffic\nFlat\nInternational store traffic\nDown Low-Single Digits\n* The descriptions indicated represent a range of percentage changes for the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2018 compared to\nthe 13 weeks ended January 28, 2017.\nContact:\nJohn A.
