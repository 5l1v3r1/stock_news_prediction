The U.S. already passed top exporter Saudi Arabia late last year.\nFor 2019, the EIA forecast a crude production increase of 570,000 bpd to 11.27 million bpd.\n\"There appears to be nothing in the (API and EIA) data to push oil prices upwards for now,\" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford and Christian Schmollinger)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T23:31:21.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
