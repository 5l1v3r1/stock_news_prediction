LOUIS and BALTIMORE, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bandura Systems , which pioneered the threat intelligence gateway (TIG) in part with the U.S. Department of Defense, announced today it has appointed Ian Dix as its Chief Revenue Officer. Dix will report to Chris Fedde, recently appointed Chief Executive Officer of Bandura Systems, and will be responsible for driving sales and revenue for the leader in Threat Intelligence Gateways.\nTIGs are stand-alone threat prevention appliances that can process millions more threat indicators than traditional network security enforcement approaches. They help protect corporate networks by more effectively blocking known threats and making threat intelligence actionable. TIGs also complement and improve the performance of existing security solutions like firewalls and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) software reducing the number of events that need detection and response, making employees more effective.\nDix joins Bandura from CenturyLink, where he served as both vice president of field marketing and vice president of product marketing for CenturyLink’s $8 billion Business Markets division. He has an extensive background in driving revenue for cybersecurity and networking technology companies, having served as the Chief Marketing Officer for SafeNet, Qwest and Broadwing Communications. Dix also has significant experience in startup and growth-oriented companies, having served as the original Chief Marketing Officer of Virtela which NTT Communications bought for $500 million, and Vice President of Marketing for XLConnect which had a successful IPO and Xerox bought for $400 million.\n“Building revenue quickly in this market that's so ready to put threat intelligence to work calls for a unique person with a wide range of proven skills,\" said Fedde who served as CEO at SafeNet during Dix’s tenure there. \"Ian's experiences and passion for hands-on growth acceleration make him ideal for Bandura's size and extensive opportunities. He brings an energizing team leadership, extensive relationships throughout the security and network industries and market-based approach to selling. The whole team looks forward to Ian's contributions to Bandura.”\n“Bandura has pioneered the next generation of threat protection,” Dix said. “Adding a successful industry veteran like Chris Fedde to the team made this a very exciting opportunity for me. Chris and I have had success before and I know his high expectations for this role. I will use my background in marketing to take a digital approach to our sales efforts and will utilize my many relationships in the industry to quickly accelerate adoption of the incredible, patented global security solution that Bandura has created. You get a chance to be the leader in an emerging market only a very few times in your career, and that makes my motivation for success even stronger.”\nFor more about Dix and the rest of Bandura Systems’ Executive Team, go here .\nAbout Bandura Systems\nBandura Systems pioneered the Threat Intelligence Gateway (TIG) in part with the U.S. Department of Defense.
