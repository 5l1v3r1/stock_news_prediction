REUTERS/Eric Vidal The officials said all EU countries, including Britain which is leaving the EU, were behind the Commission, which handles trade issues for the 28 governments.\n90 DAYS European Commissioner Malmstrom, who coordinates policy for the 28-nation EU, the world’s biggest trading bloc, said she stood ready to go to the WTO, the international trade arbiter, to impose the bloc’s own safeguards within 90 days.\n“We have been very clear that (the U.S. decision) is not in compliance with the WTO,” she said. “We will have to protect our industry with rebalancing measures, safeguards.”\nSafeguards are temporary tariffs. Under WTO rules, the EU can retaliate in a proportionate manner if they do not receive compensation for new trade restrictions within 90 days.\nEuropean industry associations called on Malmstrom to respond if the EU was subjected to the tariffs, saying they would hit the steel and aluminum sectors hard.\n“The loss of exports to the U.S., combined with an expected massive import surge in the EU, could cost tens of thousands of jobs in the EU steel industry and related sectors,” said Axel Eggert, head of steel association EUROFER.\nAluminum producers’ association European Aluminum called for an “immediate” implementation of measures if necessary.\nReporting by Robin Emmott and Alissa de Carbonnel; Writing by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:36:36.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
