(“TIP Inc.”) (TSX:TRL), an international wireless and fixed broadband telecommunications operator, today announced its unaudited financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“We made continued progress on our 2017 strategic objectives of expanding LTE network coverage in both operating markets, growing data revenue and increasing our postpaid subscriber penetration in New Zealand,” said Brad Horwitz, President and CEO. “At the end of the year, over 80% of our consolidated cell sites were optimized for LTE. Wireless Data ARPU, excluding SMS, increased 12%. Our New Zealand operations added nearly 24 thousand postpaid subscribers in 2017, which now make up 28% of our New Zealand base. In Bolivia, we regained our competitive footing in the fourth quarter, adding over 92 thousand prepaid subscribers.”\n“Although we made progress on our strategic objectives, the year was challenging as we faced increasing competitive pressure in the Bolivian prepaid space, and a wide range of issues impacting our customers following the transition to our new IT business support system in New Zealand.”\n“These issues severely impacted subscriber growth, revenue and operating expenses. While we have stabilized subscriber activation in both of our markets, customer churn, although improving, remains higher than targeted levels, particularly in New Zealand. Looking to 2018, we are extremely focused on improving the customer experience, reducing churn, growing data revenue on our enhanced networks and improving EBITDA.”\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended December 31\n(unaudited) Twelve Months Ended December 31 (US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted) 2017 2016 % Chg 2017 2016 % Chg Total revenues 201.9 213.0 (5 %) 776.8 763.4 2 % Service revenues 143.0 154.1 (7 %) 598.0 584.6 2 % Loss from continuing operations (2.4 ) (0.0 ) n.m (30.1 ) (40.6 ) 26 % Adjusted EBITDA (1) 32.4 46.8 (31 %) 148.3 153.1 (3 %) Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) 22.6 % 30.4 % (26 %) 24.8 % 26.2 % (5 %) n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) These are Non-GAAP measures and do not have standardized meanings under GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA margin excluding these costs would have been 26.5% and 26.3% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. (2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service Revenues. (3) Represents purchases of property and equipment, excluding capital expenditures acquired through vendor-backed financing and capital lease arrangements. (4) Includes deactivations of 1.9 thousand relating to liquidation of a significant business customer. On an adjusted basis, Q4 2017 churn would have been 1.9% and 1.7% for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nRevenues\nNew Zealand’s total revenues were flat for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The conversion to a new IT business support system in the first quarter negatively impacted subscriber acquisition and churn for most of the year. This was partially offset by improving subscriber acquisition levels late in the year.\nPostpaid revenues increased by $0.6 million, or 1%, driven by a 6% increase in the postpaid subscriber base due to improved consumer plans and the continued market shift to postpaid, partially offset by declines in postpaid ARPU due to increased promotional activity; Prepaid revenues decreased by $2.2 million, or 8%, due to competitive activity, resulting in a 7% decline in prepaid ARPU; and Wireline service revenues increased by $1.5 million, or 12%, due to a 23% growth in the wireline customer base, partially offset by a 12% decline in residential wireline ARPU.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nNew Zealand’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 17% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from an increase in operating expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $4.6 million, or 31%, largely due to the new business operating system conversion. This increase was primarily comprised of additional headcount expense in customer care to manage customer issues, increased bad debt attributable to billing issues from prior quarters, along with increased computer hardware and software maintenance costs attributable to refining the new operating system. Cost of service decreased by $1.4 million, or 5%, primarily due to a reduction in third-party network maintenance fees, partially offset by higher broadband transmission expenses associated with the growth of the broadband business.\nFourth quarter results in New Zealand were also affected by a 2% strengthening of the New Zealand Dollar as compared to the U.S. Dollar.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe $4.7 million, or 42%, increase in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, was the result of continued investment and timing relating to LTE network expansion projects. At December 31, 2017, 93% of our New Zealand network was overlaid with LTE and our network covered 97% of New Zealand’s population.\nBolivia\nFinancial Results\nThree Months Ended December 31\n(unaudited) Twelve Months Ended December 31 (US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted) 2017 2016 % Chg 2017 2016 % Chg Revenues Wireless service revenue 58.1 68.3 (15 %) 252.0 265.5 (5 %) Non-subscriber ILD and other revenues 0.5 0.9 (42 %) 2.7 4.4 (39 %) Service revenue 58.6 69.3 (15 %) 254.7 269.9 (6 %) Equipment sales 0.6 1.2 (50 %) 3.7 5.6 (33 %) Total revenues 59.2 70.4 (16 %) 258.4 275.5 (6 %) Adjusted EBITDA 15.4 23.7 (35 %) 76.5 81.6 (6 %) Adjusted EBITDA margin (1) 26.3 % 34.2 % (23 %) 30.0 % 30.2 % (1 %) Capital expenditures (2) 19.9 16.5 21 % 37.2 56.3 (34 %) Capital Intensity 34 % 24 % 42 % 15 % 21 % (30 %) Subscriber Results Three Months Ended December 31\n(unaudited) Twelve Months Ended December 31 (Thousands unless otherwise noted) 2017 2016 % Chg 2017 2016 % Chg Postpaid Gross additions 9.4 14.6 (36 %) 50.2 63.0 (20 %) Net additions (losses) (2.1 ) 4.9 (143 %) (3.8 ) 21.7 (117 %) Total postpaid subscribers 340.9 344.6 (1 %) 340.9 344.6 (1 %) Prepaid Net additions (losses) 92.4 (1.3 ) n.m (10.2 ) (165.5 ) 94 % Total prepaid subscribers 1,798.7 1,808.9 (1 %) 1,798.7 1,808.9 (1 %) Total Wireless Subscribers (3) 2,200.8 2,217.4 (1 %) 2,200.8 2,217.4 (1 %) Monthly blended wireless ARPU ($, not rounded) 8.98 10.28 (13 %) 9.51 9.65 (1 %) Monthly postpaid wireless ARPU ($, not rounded) 22.38 23.09 (3 %) 23.28 22.57 3 % Blended wireless churn 6.1 % 5.7 % 7 % 6.0 % 6.0 % (0 %) Postpaid Churn 1.6 % 1.4 % 11 % 1.7 % 1.6 % 4 % n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service Revenues.

Data revenues were also impacted by lower data consumption due to a temporary change to a popular smartphone app. In addition, an internal IT system configuration issue, which was identified and resolved, resulted in additional promotional data granted to customers. The decline in service revenues was partially offset by the continued increase in LTE adoption with 33.7 thousand LTE users added during the quarter, an increase of 91% compared to the same period in 2016. LTE subscribers represented 19% of the customer base at December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nBolivia’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 35% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease of $11.2 million in total revenues, partially offset by $2.9 million of lower operating expenses.\nSales and marketing decreased by $1.1 million, or 11%, primarily due to a decrease in costs relating to advertising, promotions, and customer loyalty program resulting from a shift to a more digital-focused marketing strategy; and Cost of equipment sales decreased by $1.8 million, or 42%, mainly due to higher handset subsidies and promotions in 2016, coupled with a reduction in postpaid subsidies in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures increased $3.4 million, or 21%, in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the timing of the investment in LTE coverage and network expansion projects. At December 31, 2017, 70% of our network was overlaid with LTE.\nReview of Consolidated Performance\nThree Months Ended December 31\n(unaudited) Twelve Months Ended December 31 (US dollars in millions except per unit data) 2017 2016 % Chg 2017 2016 % Chg Consolidated adjusted EBITDA (1) 32.4 46.8 (31 %) 148.3 153.1 (3 %) Consolidated adjusted EBITDA Margin (1) 22.6 % 30.4 % (26 %) 24.8 % 26.2 % (5 %) (Deduct) add: Finance costs (2) (11.1 ) (18.3 ) (40 %) (66.4 ) (72.9 ) (9 %) Change in fair value of warrant liability 5.6 - n.m 9.1 - n.m Depreciation, amortization and accretion (27.1 ) (27.7 ) (2 %) (106.9 ) (105.5 ) 1 % Income tax expense (1.0 ) (0.1 ) n.m (8.2 ) (7.6 ) 7 % Other (3) (1.1 ) (0.8 ) 37 % (5.9 ) (7.7 ) (23 %) Loss from continuing operations (2.4 ) (0.0 ) n.m (30.1 ) (40.6 ) 26 % n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) These are Non-GAAP measures and do not have standardized meanings under GAAP.

Further, a decline in cash paid for income and withholding taxes also contributed to increase in cash flow provided by operating activities.\nInvesting activities\nCash flow used in investing activities increased by $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of Trilogy Dominicana of $28.7 million in 2016. Additionally, cash used to purchase short-term investments, net of sales, increased by $24.2 million contributing to the increase of cash used in investing activities. These changes were partially offset by a lower amount of capital expenditure in Bolivia as network expansion and LTE buildout were more significant during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFinancing activities\nCash flow provided by financing activities increased by $99.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This change is primarily due to the proceeds from the equity issuance that occurred on February 7, 2017, in connection with the completion of the Arrangement with Alignvest, partially offset by the refinancing of the Trilogy LLC 13.375% Notes due in 2019 and the related costs incurred of $9.1 million.\nCapital Structure\nIn December 2017, NuevaTel entered into a $7.0 million debt facility (the “Bolivian Bank Loan”) with Banco BISA S.A. This loan has a five year term and is required to be repaid in quarterly installments commencing in 2019 through 2022, with 25% of the principal amount to be repaid each year. Interest on the Bolivian Bank Loan accrues at a fixed rate of 6.0% and is payable quarterly. This loan will be used to fund capital expenditures as NuevaTel continues to expand its LTE coverage. The total outstanding debt in Bolivia is $27.7 million.\nIn March 2018, 2degrees entered into an amendment of its Senior Facilities Agreement with existing syndicate members representing $190 million NZD to extend the maturity date from January 2019 to January 2020. Borrowings totaling $10 million NZD will retain the January 2019 maturity date. Terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, as amended, including interest rates and financial covenants are generally consistent with the prior agreement. Distributions will continue to be subject to free cash flow tests and 2degrees may be required to make certain prepayments of principal to the syndicate members.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following table presents the company’s full-year 2018 guidance.\n(US dollars in millions) 2017\nActual 2018 Guidance Service Revenues New Zealand (1) 342.9 Increase of 5.0 % to 7.0 % Bolivia 254.7 Increase of 1.0 % to 3.0 % Adjusted EBITDA New Zealand (1) 83.2 Increase of 8.0 % to 10.0 % Bolivia 76.5 Increase of 7.0 % to 9.0 % (1) Assumed 2018 foreign exchange rate for New Zealand is NZD/USD = $0.73.\nConsolidated Capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2017 investment levels.\nThe above information outlines guidance ranges for selected full year 2018 consolidated financial metrics. These ranges take into consideration our current outlook and our actual results for 2017. The purpose of the financial outlook is to assist investors, shareholders, and others in understanding certain financial metrics relating to expected 2018 financial results for evaluating the performance of our business. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Information about our guidance, including the various assumptions underlying it, is forward-looking and should be read in conjunction with \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in the 2017 TIP Inc. MD&A and in the TIP Inc. AIF, and the related disclosure and information about various economic, competitive, and regulatory assumptions, factors, and risks that may cause our actual future financial and operating results to differ from what we currently expect.\nWe provide annual guidance ranges on a full year basis, which are consistent with annual full year TIP Inc. Board of Director approved plans. Any updates to our full year financial guidance over the course of the year would only be made to the guidance ranges that appear above.\nNon-GAAP Measures and Other Financial Measures; Basis of Presentation\nIn managing our business and assessing our financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP with several customer-focused performance metrics and non-GAAP financial measures which are utilized by our management to evaluate our performance. Although we believe these measures are widely used in the wireless industry, some may not be defined by us in precisely the same way as by other companies in the wireless industry, so there may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents Loss from continuing operations (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) excluding amounts for: income tax expense; interest expense; depreciation, amortization and accretion; equity-based compensation (recorded as a component of General and administrative expense); (gain) loss on disposal and abandonment of assets; and all other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Service Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are common measures of operating performance in the telecommunications industry. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are helpful measures because they allow us to evaluate our performance by removing from our operating results items that do not relate to our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies unless the definition is the same.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin\nThree Months Ended December 31\n(unaudited) Twelve Months Ended December 31 (US dollars in millions) 2017 2016 % Chg 2017 2016 % Chg Loss from continuing operations (2.4 ) (0.0 ) n.m (30.1 ) (40.6 ) 26 % Add: Interest expense 11.1 18.3 (40 %) 59.8 69.1 (13 %) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 27.1 27.7 (2 %) 106.9 105.5 1 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs - - n.m 6.7 3.8 76 % Change in fair value of warrant liability (5.6 ) - n.m (9.1 ) - n.m Income tax expense 1.0 0.1 n.m 8.2 7.6 7 % Other, net (1.0 ) (2.8 ) (63 %) (3.4 ) 0.1 n.m Equity-based compensation 0.9 1.5 (38 %) 2.9 2.7 5 % Loss on disposal and abandonment of assets 0.1 0.0 65 % 0.7 0.6 12 % Acquisition and other nonrecurring costs (1) 1.1 2.1 (46 %) 5.8 4.2 36 % Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (2) 32.4 46.8 (31 %) 148.3 153.1 (3 %) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA Margin 22.6 % 30.4 % (26 %) 24.8 % 26.2 % (5 %) n.m - not meaningful Notes: (1) Includes costs related to the Company’s initial compliance and preparation expenses incurred in connection with the Arrangement and becoming a publically traded entity, as well as non-cash expense associated with the Company’s restricted share program. (2) In July 2013, Trilogy LLC sold to Salamanca Holding Company, a Delaware limited liability company, 80% of its interest in its wholly owned subsidiary Salamanca Solutions International LLC (“SSI”). Although Trilogy LLC holds a 20% equity interest in SSI, due to the fact that NuevaTel is SSI’s primary customer, Trilogy LLC is considered SSI’s primary beneficiary, and as such, the Company consolidates 100% of SSI’s net losses. The impact on the Company's consolidated results of the 80% that Trilogy LLC does not own was to increase (decrease) Adjusted EBITDA by $(0.4) million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOther Information\nConsolidated financial results – quarterly summary\nTIP Inc.’s operating results may vary from quarter to quarter because of changes in general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations, among other things, in each of TIP Inc.’s operations and business segments. Different products and subscribers have unique seasonal and behavioral features. Accordingly, one quarter’s results are not predictive of future performance.\nFluctuations in net income (loss) from quarter to quarter can result from events that are unique or that occur irregularly, such as losses or gains on the refinance of debt, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, impairment of assets, and changes in income taxes.\nThe following table shows selected quarterly financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFor the Quarter Ended\n(US dollars in millions unless otherwise noted) 2017\n2016\nQ4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Service revenues 143.0 152.5 150.8 151.7 154.1 150.3 143.0 137.3 Equipment sales 58.9 38.8 42.1 39.0 58.8 41.2 40.2 38.6 Total revenues 201.9 191.3 192.9 190.7 213.0 191.5 183.2 175.8 Operating expenses (198.8 ) (184.1 ) (182.3 ) (179.5 ) (197.4 ) (179.8 ) (175.1 ) (171.1 ) Operating income 3.1 7.2 10.6 11.2 15.5 11.7 8.0 4.8 Interest expense (11.1 ) (11.2 ) (18.5 ) (19.0 ) (18.3 ) (18.4 ) (17.0 ) (15.3 ) Change in fair value of warrant liability 5.6 (0.0 ) 3.5 - - - - - Debt modification and extinguishment costs - - (6.7 ) - - - (3.8 ) - Other, net 1.0 0.9 2.2 (0.8 ) 2.8 (2.0 ) 0.9 (1.8 ) Gain (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (1.3 ) (3.0 ) (8.9 ) (8.6 ) 0.1 (8.7 ) (11.9 ) (12.4 ) Income tax expense (1.0 ) (2.6 ) (1.8 ) (2.7 ) (0.1 ) (3.0 ) (2.5 ) (2.1 ) Loss from continuing operations (2.4 ) (5.6 ) (10.8 ) (11.3 ) (0.0 ) (11.7 ) (14.4 ) (14.5 ) Gain on discontinued operations, net of taxes - - - - - - 0.0 50.3 Net income (loss) (2.4 ) (5.6 ) (10.8 ) (11.3 ) (0.0 ) (11.8 ) (14.3 ) 35.9 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and prior controlling interest 2.6 1.4 5.2 5.4 0.0 11.8 14.3 (35.9 ) Net income (loss) attributable to TIP Inc. 0.3 (4.1 ) (5.5 ) (5.9 ) - - - - Net income (loss) attributable to TIP Inc. per share: (1) Basic 0.01 (0.10 ) (0.13 ) (0.14) (2) Diluted (0.03 ) (0.10 ) (0.16 ) (0.14) (2) (1) Earnings per share amounts have not been presented for any period prior to the consummation of the Arrangement, as the total net income (loss) of Trilogy LLC prior to February 7, 2017, was attributable to noncontrolling interests or prior controlling interest.
