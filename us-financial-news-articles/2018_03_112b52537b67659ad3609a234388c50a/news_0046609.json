(NYSE American:CTO) (the “Company”) today announced the closing of the sale of its four self-developed properties located in Daytona Beach, Florida for approximately $11.43 million, or $168 per square foot (the “Self-Developed Properties Sale”). The sale included the approximately 20,000 square foot Concierge multi-tenant office building, the approximately 30,720 square foot two-building multi-tenant Mason Commerce Center and the 15,360 square foot multi-tenant Williamson Business Park office building. The estimated gain on the Self-Developed Properties Sale totals approximately $3.65 million, or approximately $0.49 per share, after tax. The Company intends to utilize the proceeds from the Self-Developed Properties Sale to fund a portion of the previously acquired income property located near Portland, Oregon leased to Wells Fargo, through a reverse 1031 like-kind exchange structure.\nAs part of the transaction, the Company entered into a lease of its approximately 7,600 square foot current office space in Williamson Business Park for approximately 5 years at a market rental rate.\nThe Self-Developed Properties Sale is our most recent step in the process of transitioning the focus of our income property portfolio solely to single-tenant. The disposition yield was favorable to the range of target disposition yields provided in our 2018 guidance.\nAbout Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co.\nConsolidated-Tomoka Land Co. is a Florida-based publicly traded real estate company, which owns a portfolio of income investments in diversified markets in the United States including approximately 2.1 million square feet of income properties, as well as nearly 8,100 acres of land in the Daytona Beach area.
