None of these heard any discriminatory words,” UEFA said in a statement. “Mironov was also interviewed by the inspector and stated that he indeed swore at Brewster, but he unreservedly denied using any discriminatory language.” UEFA said that the inspector believed England under-17 international Brewster’s allegations were made in good faith before closing the disciplinary proceedings. Liverpool acknowledged UEFA’s findings and said they had accepted their decision. “We would like to place on record our admiration for the courage shown by Rhian Brewster throughout this process and commend his exemplary conduct,” a Liverpool spokesperson said. “The club is very proud of the maturity, dignity and leadership Rhian has displayed in bringing focus to this issue and he will continue to receive our full support.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T12:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T13:30:37.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
