Backed by the science of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), Orangetheory's heart-rate-monitored workouts are designed to get participants within the target-training zone of 84 percent to 91 percent of their maximum heart rate, which greatly stimulates metabolism and increases energy. Led by highly skilled coaches, each Orangetheory Fitness workout incorporates endurance, strength and power elements through a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing machines, TRX® suspension training and free weights. The end result is more energy, visible toning and the 'Orange Effect' – where participants keep burning calories for up to 36 hours post-workout (the Orangetheory Fitness 'afterburn') for an average of 500+ total calories burned per every 60-minute workout. The company was ranked #1 on Franchise Times' 2018 Fast & Serious list, #60 in Inc. magazine's Fastest Growing Private Companies list, #11 on Entrepreneur magazine's Fastest Growing Franchises list and #48 in Entrepreneur's 2018 Franchise 500® list of the top franchises in the world.
