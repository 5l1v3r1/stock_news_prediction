Dos Santos’ passport has been seized and he is forbidden from leaving the country.\nValter Filipe da Silva, former governor of the central bank, has also been charged with fraud in relation to the case, prosecutors said in comments transmitted by state radio. Da Silva could not be contacted for comment.\nProsecutors said the alleged fraud does not fall under any of Angola’s amnesty for financial wrongdoing or repatriation of overseas funds and the crime would not be pardoned.\n“A pardon will not work...This case will run to its final outcome,” said Luis Benza Zanga, vice prosecutor general and head of the National Directorate for Criminal Investigations.\nReporting by Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Joe Brock/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T16:00:31.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
