He added that the ESM, which has experience on the issue of debt sustainability and is also very active in the market, could play the role of “neutral negotiation moderator”. Regling said it was important to put the emphasis on the word negotiations “because I’m sceptical about the proposal of automatic maturity extensions”. The German government believes that if a country asks for a bailout in future because it has lost market access, that country’s debt should be automatically restructured. But others, like the highly indebted Italy, are strongly against that idea, saying that passing such a rule could create market panic and cause serious trouble for them now. Regling said he feared the prospect of an automatic maturity extension could be procyclical and accelerate a crisis that could perhaps have been prevented otherwise. He said the ESM could in future provide shorter-term loans with looser conditions to stabilise the economy. Regling also said the ESM should be integrated into the European Treaty. Turning to Greece, Regling said it would not need a debt haircut - or value reduction - and if Athens continued to implement reforms, it should be possible for Greece to regularly finance itself via the markets.
