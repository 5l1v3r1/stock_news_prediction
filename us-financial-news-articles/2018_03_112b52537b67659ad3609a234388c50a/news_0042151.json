The company said Axel Springer’s investment, which included a 100 million pounds subscription for new shares, would be used for further expansion in the United States, support entry into new markets and widen Purplebricks’ service offering. However, Purplebricks warned its group revenues for the year ending April 31 would be around 5 percent lower than its consensus of 98 million pounds due to weak market conditions in the UK, which has been worsened by poor weather. Both Australia and the U.S. are on track to at least meet its full-year revenue expectations, the company said. $1 = 0.7036 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T13:47:07.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
