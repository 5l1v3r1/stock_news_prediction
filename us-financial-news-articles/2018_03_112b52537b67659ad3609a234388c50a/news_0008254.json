It said that its Melbourne unit had recently provided a detailed submission of its position to the commission.\nA spokesperson from the Victorian Commission said it was currently considering information provided by Crown to determine whether there were grounds for disciplinary action.\nCrown, controlled by billionaire James Packer, has battled several unproven claims of poker machine fixing and encouraging problem gambling at its flagship Melbourne casino, although it was acquitted in December of allegations that it gave gamblers misleading odds.\nThe company was also slapped with a class action lawsuit in December for allegedly failing to inform shareholders of a marketing campaign in China that resulted in staff arrests and a slump in the share price.\nShares of the company fell about 0.9 percent in afternoon trade, compared to a 0.6 percent decline in the broader market .
