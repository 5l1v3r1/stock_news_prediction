(OTCQB: BABB) , today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution of one cent ($0.01) per share, payable on April 13, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 27, 2018.\nThe Company believes it is possible for tax purposes, a portion of the distribution and any future distributions that the Board may declare in 2018 (collectively, the “Distributions”) may be treated as a return of capital to shareholders to the extent of each shareholder’s basis, while the remaining portion of the Distributions may be treated as a dividend.\nThe portion of the April 13, 2018 distribution that will be treated as a dividend will not be determined until January 2019, as that portion is dependent upon the Company’s earnings for tax purposes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 2018. The final determination will be reported to recipients of the Distributions on a tax information return in early 2019.\nBAB, Inc. franchises and licenses Big Apple Bagels®, My Favorite Muffin®, SweetDuet® and Brewster’s® coffee.
