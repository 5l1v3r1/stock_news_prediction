Net income for 2017 was approximately $12,100 compared to $52,400 in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2017 decreased to $8.74 million from the 2016 year-end balance of $9.22 million.\nJerry Flum, CEO, said, “We did not see significant results yet from our new Financial Statement Sourcing (launched 4Q 2017) or PAYCE™ (launched 1Q 2018) products, or from our other new marketing efforts, but we’re committed to continue investing in new products and marketing infrastructure. There is a natural lag on these expenses and the impact on revenue. The Company is still debt-free and our strong cash position allows us to continue to undertake these initiatives.”\nCREDITRISKMONITOR.COM, INC.
