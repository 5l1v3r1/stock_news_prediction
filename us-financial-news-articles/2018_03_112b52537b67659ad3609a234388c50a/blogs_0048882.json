They include expulsion of the equivalent number of diplomats and they include our decision to withdraw our agreement to allow the United States' general consulate to operate in St. Petersburg,\" Lavrov told a briefing.\nThe attack on 66-year-old Skripal and his daughter, which Britain has blamed on Russian President Vladimir Putin and says was caused by a Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok left on the door of their home in England, has driven relations between Russia and the West to a new post-Cold War low.\nRussia has denied involvement in the attack on the Skripals and says it suspects the British secret services are trying to frame Russia to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.\nSkripal, a former Russian military intelligence who betrayed Russian agents to Britain and then was exchanged in a spy swap deal, is still in a critical condition from the attack.\nHis 33-year-old daughter was also in a critical condition though the English hospital where she was being treated said on Thursday that her condition had improved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T21:52:31.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
