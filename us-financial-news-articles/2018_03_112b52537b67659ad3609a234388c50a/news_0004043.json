One economist was very optimistic while the remaining one was pessimistic.\n“Both business and consumer confidence is likely to be boosted by the election of Cyril Ramaphosa to President of the Republic and the cabinet reshuffle that (followed),” said Jeffrey Schultz, economist at BNP Paribas in Johannesburg.\nSouth Africa’s business confidence rose for a third month in a row in January to its highest since late 2015, on expectations the new leadership of the ruling party would stabilize economic policy, a survey showed last month.\n“President Ramaphosa clearly has his sights set on improving the domestic business climate and promoting more public-private sector participation,” said Schultz.\nGross domestic fixed investment - normally capital spending, such as buying new machinery for future production - fell into a recession in 2016, recovering only slightly early last year before hitting another slump in the second quarter.\nThe private sector makes up nearly two-thirds of the gross domestic fixed investment contribution to GDP, although it has played a smaller role in recent years, with government pushing infrastructure projects to raise jobs.\nSchultz added that it would take some time for the trust between business and the government to be rebuilt, but it was clear the new government has realized it needs business sector buy-in to get growth and reduce unemployment.\nUnemployment was at just over 20 percent a decade ago and now more than a quarter of South Africa’s labor force is jobless.\nOLD TRUSTED HANDS BACK AT HELM Ramaphosa appointed Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister on Monday and Pravin Gordhan as public enterprise minister. All but one of the 20 economists polled singled out these two National Executive appointments as most likely to inspire economic confidence.\nBoth Nene and Gordhan served as finance ministers in the last administration but were unceremoniously sacked by former President Jacob Zuma.\nA poll last month suggested South Africa’s new leadership would need to be prudent and creative in managing the economy to avoid a credit rating downgrade, by raising taxes without suffocating a chance for growth.\nMoody’s is due to publish a review later this month, which economists said in February would offer the country a reprieve.\nEditing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T10:22:14.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
