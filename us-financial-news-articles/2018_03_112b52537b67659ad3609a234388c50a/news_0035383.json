Everson reiterated that Facebook is conducting a \"deep audit\" to \"understand what happened.\" In the wake of the revelations, media and users have criticized Facebook for being lax about securing user information and for its top executives' lack of leadership in publicly addressing the situation. The company's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, previously posted a string of tweets about how the incident didn't constitute a \"data breach\" and then deleted them.
