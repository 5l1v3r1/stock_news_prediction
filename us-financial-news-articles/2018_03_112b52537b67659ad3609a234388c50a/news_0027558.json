(“Superior” or the “Company”) (NYSE:SUP) , one of the world’s leading aluminum wheel suppliers for OEMs and the European aftermarket, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nSUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Today, Superior is more diversified, by geography, customer and product, and is leveraging a common culture of innovation to capitalize on attractive secular trends,” commented Don Stebbins, President and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2017, we increased Value-Added Sales by 51% and Adjusted EBITDA by 58% year-over-year. As we look forward, we see significant improvement opportunities ahead of us. We continue to make strides in building a best-in-class organization with a commitment to operational excellence and ongoing investment in new technology and capabilities in anticipation of our customers’ needs. We believe we are well positioned to drive increased value for all of our stakeholders.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, Superior owned approximately 94.1% of UNIWHEELS’ outstanding shares of common stock. The Company’s results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 are presented in accordance with GAAP and consolidate UNIWHEELS’ operations since June 1, 2017.\nWheel unit shipments were 5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus 3.1 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was driven by the addition of the Company’s European operations, partially offset by softness in the North American market compared to the prior year period.\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $361.8 million, compared to net sales of $188.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Value-Added Sales, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net sales less pass-through charges, primarily for the value of aluminum, were $203.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus Value-Added Sales of $106.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Value-Added Sales were favorably impacted by the addition of Superior’s European operations, partially offset by lower unit volumes in North America. In addition, for the fourth quarter of 2017, Value-Added Sales per wheel increased to $37.94 from $34.36 in the prior year period. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below and the reconciliation of consolidated net sales to Value-Added Sales in this press release.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $39.7 million, compared to $18.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the addition of the Company’s European operations, offset slightly by the non-recurring effects of purchase accounting adjustments of $1.3 million related to the acquisition of UNIWHEELS as well as ongoing amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $25.9 million compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. The increase is due to the inclusion of Superior’s European operations, as well as costs related to the acquisition and integration totaling $7.2 million, and higher compensation expense in North America during the quarter.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.8 million, which compares to income from operations of $11.1 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of acquisition and integration costs, fourth quarter 2017 income from operations would have been $22.3 million.\nThe provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $11.7 million, which compares to a provision in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $3.8 million. The income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects the impact of the acquisition-related costs, blend of earnings and losses in various jurisdictions, and the negative impact from recent tax reform legislation of approximately $16.6 million.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported a net loss attributable to Superior of $4.6 million. Earnings per diluted share, which includes the impact of preferred dividends and the ongoing accretion of the preferred shares, was ($0.50) for the fourth quarter. Net income for the quarter includes after-tax expense of $5.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, resulting from acquisition related items as well as a $16.6 million, or $0.67 per share, impact related to U.S. tax reform. Also, included in the impact of acquisition related items is the change in fair value of an embedded option related to the preferred shares. This embedded option is revalued on a quarterly basis and the change in value impacts net income. These results for the fourth quarter compare to $7.8 million of net income, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in net income is primarily due to increased interest and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $48.9 million, or 24.0% of Value-Added Sales, for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compares to $18.7 million, or 17.6% of Value-Added Sales, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Value-Added Sales was driven by the inclusion of the Company’s European operations in the quarter and better year-over-year performance in our North American operations. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below and the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA in this press release.\nFourth Quarter Financial Position and Cash Flow\nThe Company reported cash generated from operating activities of $46.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $39.2 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by working capital improvements and the addition of the Company’s European operations, partially offset by costs related to the acquisition.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Superior acquired additional UNIWHEELS shares for $5.5 million, increasing the Company’s ownership of UNIWHEELS from 93.5% to 94.1%.\nAlso, during the quarter, the Company paid cash dividends totaling $6.1 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nWheel unit shipments were 17.0 million for 2017, compared to unit shipments of 12.3 million in 2016.\nNet sales for 2017 were $1,108.1 million, compared to net sales of $732.7 million in 2016. Value-Added Sales were $616.8 million for 2017 versus Value-Added Sales of $408.7 million in 2016. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below and the reconciliation of consolidated net sales to Value-Added Sales in this press release.\nGross profit for 2017 was $102.9 million compared to $86.2 million in the prior year. The increase in gross profit was driven by the addition of the Company’s European operations, offset partially by the non-recurring effects of purchase accounting adjustments of $12.1 million related to the acquisition of UNIWHEELS as well as ongoing amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 were $81.4 million compared to $31.6 million in the prior year period. The increase is due to the inclusion of seven months of Superior’s European operations, as well as costs related to the acquisition and integration totaling $32.1 million. Excluding the acquisition and integration costs, selling, general and administrative expenses would have been 4.4% of net sales in 2017, which compares to 4.3% in the prior year.\nIncome from operations for 2017 was $21.5 million compared to income from operations of $54.6 million in the prior year. Excluding the previously mentioned acquisition-related impacts on gross profit and selling, general, and administrative expense, income from operations for 2017 would have been $65.7 million.\nThe income tax provision for 2017 was $6.9 million. This compares to a provision for income taxes of $13.3 million for the prior year. The income tax expense in the year reflects the impact of the acquisition-related costs, blend of earnings and losses in various jurisdictions, and the negative impact from recent tax reform legislation of approximately $16.6 million.\nFor 2017, the Company reported a net loss attributable to Superior of $6.2 million. Earnings per diluted share, which includes the impact of preferred dividends and the ongoing accretion of the preferred shares, was ($1.01) for 2017. Net income for the year includes after-tax expense of $35.9 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, related to acquisition related items, as well as a $16.6 million, or $0.67 per share, impact related to U.S. tax reform. Included in the impact of acquisition related items is the change in fair value of an embedded option related to the preferred shares as discussed above. These results compare to $41.4 million of net income, or $1.62 per diluted share, in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $140.1 million, or 22.7% of Value-Added Sales, in 2017, which compares to $88.5 million, or 21.7% of Value-Added Sales, in 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Value-Added Sales was driven by the addition of the Company’s European operations. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below and the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA in this press release.\n2018 Outlook\nBased on current economic trends and industry outlook, Superior is reaffirming its full year 2018 Outlook provided on January 17, 2018 as follows:\nSuperior expects net sales to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion, driven by unit shipments of 21.25 million to 21.6 million. Value-Added Sales is expected to be in the range of $800 million to $835 million. Value-Added Sales are defined as net sales less pass-through charges, primarily for the value of aluminum. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $185 million to $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $95 million. Cash flow from operations is expected to be between $160 million and $180 million. Effective Tax Rate is expected to be between 10% to 15%.\nValue-Added Sales and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information.” In reliance on the safe harbor provided under Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, Superior has not quantitatively reconciled differences between Adjusted EBITDA presented in the 2018 Outlook to net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, as Superior is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in net income without unreasonable efforts and due to the inherent uncertainty regarding such variables. Superior also believes that such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could potentially be confusing or misleading to investors. However, the magnitude of these amounts may be material.\nConference Call\nSuperior will host a conference call beginning at 8:00 AM ET on Thursday, March 15, 2018. The conference call may be accessed by dialing (888) 882-4478 for participants in the U.S./Canada or +1 (323) 701-0226 for participants outside the U.S./Canada using the required conference ID 2730969.

For more information, please visit www.supind.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP included throughout this earnings release, this release refers to “Adjusted EBITDA,” which Superior has defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring charges, plant closure costs, acquisition and integration costs, and impairments of long-lived assets and investments, and “Value-Added Sales,” which Superior defines as net sales less pass-through charges primarily for the value of aluminum. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Value-Added Sales is a key measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Value-Added Sales is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Value-Added Sales. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of the financial tables in this press release for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Value-Added Sales for the most comparable GAAP measures.\nManagement believes the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release are useful to management and may be useful to investors in their analysis of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Further, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting future periods. This non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information for investors and is not in accordance with or an alternative to GAAP.

Value-Added Sales represent net sales less the value of aluminum and services provided by outside service providers (OSPs) that are included in net sales. Arrangements with our customers allow us to pass on changes in aluminum prices and OSP costs; therefore, fluctuations in the underlying aluminum price and the use of OSPs generally do not directly impact our profitability. Accordingly, Value-Added Sales is worthy of being highlighted for the benefit of readers of our financial statements. Our intent is to allow readers of the financial statements to consider our net sales information both with and without the aluminum and OSP cost components thereof.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition support costs, closure costs and impairments of long-lived assets and investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is used in our internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe the Adjusted EBITDA financial measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our business, to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL, INC.
