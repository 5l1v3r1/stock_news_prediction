Soccer Football - Champions League - Chelsea Training - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - March 13, 2018 Chelsea's N'Golo Kante during training Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith Kante was instrumental to Leicester City’s league triumph in the 2015/16 season before he moved to London and helped Chelsea do the same the following year. “I am at home. It is my club, I am a Chelsea player,” Kante, who has been linked with a move to Paris St Germain, was quoted as saying by the Evening Standard. “This is my second year at Chelsea. After what happened last season, it was a very good one for us because we got to celebrate winning the title. “In the second season, I have got to play in the Champions League ... We will fight until the end to finish in the top four and to get in a Champions League position.” Chelsea, who face Southampton in the FA Cup semi-finals next month, are fifth in the league, five points behind Tottenham Hotspur with eight matches left to play. “We also have the FA Cup to play for - it is a good competition. Last season we failed in the final,” added Kante. “It is the only trophy we can win this season, so we have to give everything to get to the final and win it.” The 26-year-old has been named in the France squad for friendlies against Colombia on Friday and Russia on March 27.
