Unlike the Washington state assembly lines, the plant, which has about 7,000 workers, is not unionized.\nThe aircraft, which sells for $326 million at list prices, completes a line-up of three models starting with the 787-8 which debuted in 2011. All boast carbon-composite fabrication materials, fuel efficiency and new state-of-the-air filtration systems with higher levels of humidity in the air for long-distance flight.\nThe 787-10's range is 6,430 nautical miles (11,910 kilometers).\nAt 223 feet long (68 meters), the aircraft is 18 feet (5.5 meters) longer than the 787-9 and seats around 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8.\nEurope's Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, an upgraded version of its most-sold wide-body aircraft with fuel-efficient engines and a new cabin.\nBoth jets are designed for shorter flights compared with other mid-size wide-body planes, tapping into the rapid growth of trade within Asia as well as across other regions.\nBut after brisk initial sales, orders for both models have slowed, with Airbus selling 214 of its A330neo.\nThe 787-10 has 171 orders, about 13 percent of the total of firm orders for the 787.\nThe mid-sized 787-9 is the most popular variant and competes mainly with Airbus's new-generation carbon-composite A350.\nThe 787 and A330neo are locked in a fierce battle for sales and profits in the market for jets with around 300 seats.\nBoeing looks poised to win a hotly contested order from American Airlines ( AAL.O ), beating competition from the A330neo, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AAL.O"], "published": "2018-03-26T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T13:52:54.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
