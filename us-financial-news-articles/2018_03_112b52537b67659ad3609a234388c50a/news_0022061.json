Retaliatory tariffs placed on U.S. products could impact 11 states where exports account for more than 10 percent of gross domestic product.\nThe tariffs have worried Wisconsin’s Republican Governor Scott Walker, who last week urged Trump to reconsider.\nCities could face similar problems if they are heavily dependent on exports or if their economies rely on cheaper steel and aluminum prices.\n“In smaller cities where export-heavy manufacturing can dwarf other sectors, a shift in the pace of exports creates greater potential for economic disruption and credit deterioration,” S&P said without naming any cities.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T03:44:15.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
