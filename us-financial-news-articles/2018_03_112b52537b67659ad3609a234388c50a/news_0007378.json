Speaking on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference, he noted it was something that the country must address itself.\nOPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo and other OPEC officials are expected to hold a dinner on Monday with U.S. shale firms on the sidelines of the conference.\nSuhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the United Arab Emirates oil minister and OPEC's current president, said on Sunday that the cartel had not discussed rolling over production cuts next year.\n\"We feel there is still market overhang,\" Al Mazrouei said, adding \"there are no talks about (extending cuts into 2019) at this stage.\"\nOPEC and other major producers agreed last year to cut combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day to drain a global oil glut. The agreement began in January 2017 and runs through the end of this year.\nAlso on Monday, the International Energy Agency, which advises industrialized nations on energy policies, said it expects oil demand growth to average a fairly robust 1.1 percent a year to 2023 and noted that OPEC would fail to significantly increase its production capacity.\n\"One thing hasn't changed over the past year ... Upstream investment shows little sign of recovering from its plunge in 2015-2016, which raises concerns about whether adequate supply will be available to offset natural field declines and meet robust demand growth after 2020,\" IEA said.\n(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov in London, Jane Chung in Seoul and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by Louise Heavens and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T19:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T20:00:30.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
