It emerged from recession last year, mainly as a result of higher crude prices, and is trying to raise non-oil revenues.\nIn addition to a 20 percent tax on tobacco, the government will add an extra fixed tax per cigarette. A percentage tax on alcoholic beverages will be replaced by taxes of fixed amounts based on volume.\nThe finance ministry said the changes will take effect from June 4 this year.\nThe move would have “a dual benefit of raising the government’s fiscal revenues and reducing the health hazards associated with tobacco-related diseases and alcohol abuse,” it said in its statement.\nThe ministry said the new regime was in line with a directive from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) regional bloc on the harmonisation of member-states’ legislation on excise duties.\nRaising duties in Nigeria for alcohol could further hit consumer demand amid fragile growth.\nAnheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev), the world’s largest beer maker, expects its new $250 million brewery being built in Sagamu, Nigeria, to start production in the middle of this year, its head of Africa head has said.
