Approximately $8 million and $40 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to the Liberty SiriusXM Group in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % Change amounts in millions amounts in millions Liberty SiriusXM Group Revenue SiriusXM $ 1,303 $ 1,404 8 % $ 5,014 $ 5,425 8 % Total Liberty SiriusXM Group $ 1,303 $ 1,404 8 % $ 5,014 $ 5,425 8 % Operating Income (Loss) SiriusXM 319 384 20 % 1,386 1,588 15 % Corporate and other (13 ) (9 ) 31 % (34 ) (41 ) (21 ) % Total Liberty SiriusXM Group $ 306 $ 375 23 % $ 1,352 $ 1,547 14 % Adjusted OIBDA SiriusXM 473 541 14 % 1,853 2,109 14 % Corporate and other (6 ) (2 ) 67 % (15 ) (15 ) — % Total Liberty SiriusXM Group $ 467 $ 539 15 % $ 1,838 $ 2,094 14 % The increases in Liberty SiriusXM Group revenue, operating income and adjusted OIBDA (2) in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 were primarily attributable to an increase in SiriusXM’s daily weighted average number of subscribers and an increase in SiriusXM’s average monthly revenue per subscriber due to certain rate increases.\nSiriusXM is a separate publicly traded company and additional information about SiriusXM can be obtained through its website and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. SiriusXM reported its stand-alone fourth quarter and year end results on January 31, 2018. For additional detail on SiriusXM’s fourth quarter and year end financial results, please see SiriusXM’s earnings release posted to their Investor Relations website. For presentation purposes on page one of this release, we include the results of SiriusXM, as reported by SiriusXM, without regard to the purchase accounting adjustments applied by us for purposes of our financial statements. Liberty Media believes the presentation of financial results as reported by SiriusXM is useful to investors as the comparability of those results is best understood in the context of SiriusXM's historical financial presentation. For a reconciliation of revenue, adjusted OIBDA (as defined by Liberty Media) and operating income for SiriusXM's stand-alone operating results as reported by SiriusXM to those results as reported by Liberty Media, see Liberty Media's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe businesses and assets attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s interest in SiriusXM.\nFORMULA ONE GROUP – The following table provides the financial results attributed to the Formula One Group for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Approximately $13 million and $49 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to the Formula One Group in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.\n“The 2017 season was successful in increasing viewers across TV and digital platforms,” said Chase Carey, Formula 1 Chairman and CEO. “In 2018, we continue to focus on fan engagement through increasing carriage on linear and digital platforms, enhancing the race excitement, hosting more F1 Live events and collaborating with our partners. We look forward to the start of the season later this month in Melbourne.”\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 amounts in millions amounts in millions Formula One Group Revenue Formula 1 $ NA $ 570 $ NA $ 1,783 Total Formula One Group $ — $ 570 $ — $ 1,783 Operating Income (Loss) Formula 1 $ NA $ 39 $ NA $ 17 Corporate and other (17 ) (15 ) 443 (57 ) Total Formula One Group $ (17 ) $ 24 $ 443 $ (40 ) Adjusted OIBDA Formula 1 $ NA $ 150 $ NA $ 438 Corporate and other (13 ) (12 ) (45 ) (41 ) Total Formula One Group $ (13 ) $ 138 $ (45 ) $ 397 Liberty completed the acquisition of F1 on January 23, 2017.

F1 held 20 races in the 2017 season compared to 21 in the 2016 season.\nRace promotion revenue decreased in the fourth quarter, primarily due to legacy contractual terms of one Grand Prix event, which provided for a one time material step down in the promotion fee effective after the 2016 season and carrying through the remaining term of the contract through 2020. This agreement was entered into by previous management and is atypical and not reflective of terms carried in F1’s other promotion agreements. For the full year 2017, race promotion revenue decreased due to one less event being held, the aforementioned reduction in one promotion fee, as well as a contract amendment discussed in the second quarter that provided for a decrease in promotion revenue which was partly offset by the impact of increases in other revenue streams. The reduction in race promotion revenue for the fourth quarter and full year was partially offset by the impact of other contractual increases.\nBroadcast revenue increased in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 due to the impact of certain contractual rate increases. The increase in the fourth quarter was also driven by the pro-rata recognition of broadcast revenue across the season, as 6/20 of the full year fees were recognized compared to 6/21 in the prior year. The increase in the full year was partially offset by the adverse impact of weaker prevailing foreign currency exchange rates used to translate a small number of Pound and Euro-denominated contracts into US dollars.\nAdvertising and sponsorship revenue decreased in the fourth quarter primarily due to the prior year recognition of a proportion of two non-renewed sponsorship agreements, partially offset by revenue from one new sponsorship contract. For the full year, advertising and sponsorship revenue increased as higher fees and growth in certain contractual arrangements plus revenue from new sponsors more than offset the aforementioned two non-renewed agreements.\nOther F1 revenue increased modestly in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, primarily due to higher logistics and digital media revenue, contributions from broadcasting in Ultra High-Definition and higher hospitality revenue, partially offset by lower spend by competing teams in the GP3 series due to it being the second year of the GP3 vehicle cycle.\nOperating income decreased in the fourth quarter and operating loss increased for the full year 2017. Adjusted OIBDA decreased in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in revenue and increased costs. Cost of F1 revenue increased primarily due to spend on fan engagement, filming in Ultra High-Definition and higher freight costs, which more than offset reduced team payments. Selling, general and administrative expense also increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 as a result of additional headcount and new corporate offices. Additionally, stock-based compensation increased related to awards granted to members of F1 management.\nOn January 22, 2018, Liberty provided revised expectations regarding certain F1 tax considerations. Liberty now expects a mid- to -high-single-digit effective cash tax rate on UK EBITDA for the F1 business. This update is due to the cumulative impact of changes in UK tax law, conclusions reached by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs regarding the future treatment under UK tax law of certain historic transactions and the effects of an F1 corporate restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2017. F1’s adjusted OIBDA (as reported) less stock-based compensation is a reasonable proxy for UK EBITDA for this purpose.\nF1’s total net debt to covenant OIBDA ratio, as defined in F1’s credit facilities for covenant calculations, was approximately 7.1x as of December 31, 2017, as compared to a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 8.75x.\nThe businesses and assets attributed to the Formula One Group consist of all of Liberty Media’s businesses and assets other than those attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and the Braves Group, including Liberty Media’s subsidiary F1, its interest in Live Nation, minority equity investments and an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. There are approximately 9.1 million notional shares of the Braves Group underlying the Formula One Group’s 15.1% intergroup interest as of January 31, 2018.\nBRAVES GROUP - The following table provides the financial results attributed to the Braves Group for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Approximately $3 million and $7 million of corporate level selling, general and administrative expense (including stock-based compensation expense) was allocated to the Braves Group in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2017 2016 2017 amounts in millions amounts in millions Braves Group Revenue Corporate and other $ 18 $ 20 $ 262 $ 386 Total Braves Group $ 18 $ 20 $ 262 $ 386 Operating Income (Loss) Corporate and other (16 ) (68 ) (61 ) (113 ) Total Braves Group $ (16 ) $ (68 ) $ (61 ) $ (113 ) Adjusted OIBDA Corporate and other (12 ) (44 ) (20 ) 2 Total Braves Group $ (12 ) $ (44 ) $ (20 ) $ 2 The following table provides the operating results of Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves”).\nBraves Operating Results\nThree months ended Twelve months ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2017 % Change 2016 2017 % Change amounts in millions Total revenue $ 18 $ 20 11 % $ 262 $ 386 47 % Operating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation included below): Other operating expenses (16 ) (29 ) (81 ) % (224 ) (281 ) (25 ) % Selling, general and administrative expenses (12 ) (33 ) (175 ) % (54 ) (98 ) (81 ) % Adjusted OIBDA $ (10 ) $ (42 ) (320 ) % $ (16 ) $ 7 144 % Stock-based compensation (3 ) (6 ) (100 ) % (9 ) (46 ) (411 ) % Depreciation and Amortization (2 ) (17 ) (750 ) % (32 ) (67 ) (109 ) % Operating income (loss) $ (15 ) $ (65 ) (333 ) % $ (57 ) $ (106 ) (86 ) % Number of home game openings in period 2 0 81 81 Braves revenue increased in the fourth quarter, primarily due to revenue generated at the Braves mixed-use facility, which more than offset the decline in baseball related revenue due to zero home games being played in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus two in the prior year. Braves revenue increased for the full year 2017, primarily attributable to an increase in ballpark operations revenue driven by the move to the new Braves ballpark, SunTrust Park. Ticket sales, concessions, corporate sales, suites and premium seat fees all increased for the full year 2017 compared to the prior year.\nOperating loss increased in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of increased depreciation and amortization expense due to the depreciation of assets associated with the Braves mixed-use facility and SunTrust Park. Operating loss increased for the full year 2017 primarily as a result of increased stock-based compensation expense due to an increase in the estimated value of the Braves, combined with the continued vesting of outstanding awards, which resulted in a higher accrual for Braves’ equity compensation, as well as the aforementioned increase in depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted OIBDA decreased in the fourth quarter primarily due to increased costs associated with the new ballpark and the mixed-use facility. In addition, the Braves recognized a $13 million write-off of certain contractual rights in 2017 related to international players, the majority of which was recognized in the fourth quarter. Adjusted OIBDA increased for the full year 2017, primarily due to the increase in ballpark operations revenue as discussed above, partially offset by increased costs associated with baseball and ballpark operations and the mixed-use facility and the aforementioned write-off.\nThe Formula One Group holds an approximate 15.1% intergroup interest in the Braves Group as of January 31, 2018. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying the intergroup interest held by the Formula One Group, the Braves Group outstanding share count as of January 31, 2018 would have been 60 million.\nThe businesses and assets attributed to the Braves Group consist primarily of Liberty Media’s subsidiary the Braves, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves major league baseball club, five minor league baseball clubs and certain assets and liabilities associated with its ballpark and mixed-use development project.\nShare Repurchases\nThere were no repurchases of Series A or Series C Liberty SiriusXM common stock, Series A or Series C Liberty Formula One common stock or Series A or Series C Liberty Braves common stock from November 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018. The total remaining repurchase authorization for Liberty Media is approximately $1.3 billion and can be applied to repurchases of Series A and Series C shares of any of the Liberty Media Corporation tracking stocks.\nFOOTNOTES\n1) Liberty Media's President and CEO, Greg Maffei, will discuss these highlights and other matters in Liberty Media's earnings conference call which will begin at 12:15 p.m. (E.S.T.) on March 1, 2018.

(5) Face amount of the cash convertible notes and exchangeable debentures with no fair market value adjustment. (6) Includes Atlanta National League Baseball Club, LLC borrowings, Braves Stadium Company, LLC debt to fund the new ballpark and drawdowns under various credit facilities to fund development costs for the mixed-use development. Total cash and liquid investments attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group increased $381 million during the fourth quarter. Additional borrowing at Liberty SiriusXM combined with cash from operations at SiriusXM more than offset SiriusXM’s stock repurchases and dividend payment as well as investments at Liberty SiriusXM. Included in the cash and liquid investments balance attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group at December 31, 2017 is $69 million at SiriusXM. Although SiriusXM is a consolidated subsidiary, it is a separate public company with a significant non-controlling interest, therefore Liberty Media does not have ready access to SiriusXM’s cash balance.\nTotal debt attributed to Liberty SiriusXM Group increased $512 million during the fourth quarter primarily as a result of increased borrowings under Liberty’s SIRI margin loan to fund investing activities and general corporate purposes.\nTotal cash and liquid investments attributed to Formula One Group decreased $138 million during the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of a reduction in operating cash flows due to normal timing fluctuations combined with interest payments.\nTotal debt attributed to Formula One Group decreased $27 million during the quarter. In November, the remaining Delta Topco exchangeable notes issued to the F1 selling shareholders in connection with the F1 acquisition were exchanged for 1.2 million FWONK shares.\nSubsequent to quarter end, on January 31, 2018, Liberty Media announced the closing of the refinancing of F1’s first lien term loan. Concurrent with the refinancing, F1 repaid $400 million of the first lien term loan using a combination of $150 million of excess cash on the balance sheet and $250 million of loans under the first lien revolving credit facility, reducing the first lien term loan from $3.3 billion to $2.9 billion. Following the refinancing, the margin on the first lien term loan was reduced from 3.00% to 2.50%. The transaction was net leverage neutral and the refinanced term loan remains non-recourse to Liberty Media.\nTotal cash and liquid investments attributed to the Braves Group was flat in the quarter as capital expenditures related to the mixed-use development and new spring training facility were offset by net cash from operations and additional borrowings.\nTotal debt attributed to Braves Group increased by $82 million during the fourth quarter primarily as a result of additional borrowings, net of repayments, for funding the Braves’ mixed-use development and new spring training facility in Sarasota, Florida. The total cost of construction for the spring training facility is estimated to be approximately $125 million, of which the Braves are contributing approximately $55 million using debt and cash on hand, and the remaining funding is coming from municipal and private entities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, construction of the Braves new ballpark was completed on-budget and materially all associated costs have been incurred. The total cost of the project was approximately $722 million, of which approximately $392 million of funding was provided by Cobb County and related entities and approximately $330 million provided by the Braves. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $419 million had been spent on the mixed-use development. The Braves have provided $388 million of this funding, of which approximately $188 million was contributed in equity and approximately $200 million in debt.\nImportant Notice: Liberty Media Corporation (Nasdaq: LSXMA, LSXMB, LSXMK, BATRA, BATRK, FWONA, FWONK) President and CEO, Greg Maffei, will discuss Liberty Media's earnings release in a conference call which will begin at 12:15 p.m. (E.S.T.) on March 1, 2018.

562 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nSCHEDULE 1\nThis press release includes a presentation of adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the Liberty SiriusXM Group, the Braves Group and the Formula One Group, together with reconciliations to operating income, as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding all stock based compensation, and excludes from that definition depreciation and amortization, restructuring and impairment charges and separately reported legal settlements that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP.\nLiberty Media believes adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses, including each business' ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Media's management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months and years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nQUARTERLY SUMMARY\n(amounts in millions) 4Q16 4Q17 Liberty SiriusXM Group Revenue $ 1,303 $ 1,404 Adjusted OIBDA 467 539 Depreciation and amortization (77 ) (82 ) Stock compensation expense (38 ) (37 ) Legal settlements and reserves (1) (46 ) (45 ) Operating income $ 306 $ 375 Formula One Group Revenue $ — $ 570 Adjusted OIBDA (13 ) 138 Depreciation and amortization (3 ) (110 ) Stock compensation expense (1 ) (4 ) Operating income (loss) $ (17 ) $ 24 Braves Group Revenue $ 18 $ 20 Adjusted OIBDA (12 ) (44 ) Depreciation and amortization (2 ) (17 ) Stock compensation expense (2 ) (7 ) Operating income (loss) $ (16 ) $ (68 ) Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated) Revenue $ 1,321 $ 1,994 Adjusted OIBDA 442 633 Depreciation and amortization (82 ) (209 ) Stock compensation expense (41 ) (48 ) Legal settlements and reserves (1) (46 ) (45 ) Operating income $ 273 $ 331\n(1) During the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, SiriusXM recorded expenses of $46 million and $45 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. These expenses are included in the revenue share and royalties line item in SiriusXM’s consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as part of SiriusXM’s normal operations for the periods, and the lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\nANNUAL SUMMARY\n(amounts in millions) 2016 2017 Liberty SiriusXM Group Revenue $ 5,014 $ 5,425 Adjusted OIBDA 1,838 2,094 Depreciation and amortization (312 ) (352 ) Stock compensation expense (128 ) (150 ) Legal settlements and reserves (1) (46 ) (45 ) Operating income $ 1,352 $ 1,547 Formula One Group Revenue $ — $ 1,783 Adjusted OIBDA (45 ) 397 Depreciation and amortization (10 ) (405 ) Stock compensation expense (13 ) (32 ) Legal settlement (2) 511 — Operating income (loss) $ 443 $ (40 ) Braves Group Revenue $ 262 $ 386 Adjusted OIBDA (20 ) 2 Depreciation and amortization (32 ) (67 ) Stock compensation expense (9 ) (48 ) Operating income (loss) $ (61 ) $ (113 ) Liberty Media Corporation (Consolidated) Revenue $ 5,276 $ 7,594 Adjusted OIBDA 1,773 2,493 Depreciation and amortization (354 ) (824 ) Stock compensation expense (150 ) (230 ) Legal settlements and reserves (1)(2) 465 (45 ) Operating income $ 1,734 $ 1,394", "external_links": ["http://www.libertymedia.com/events", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertymedia.com%2Fevents&esheet=51766691&newsitemid=20180301005491&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertymedia.com%2Fevents&index=1&md5=26f84e8aa05d3462e3e33c0a1ce9f62f"], "published": "2018-03-01T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:36:05.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
