Zuckerberg remains fourth on Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index and sixth on a similar list by Forbes.\nBut Facebook as a whole has still taken a financial hit as a result of the reports, losing $35 billion in market value, Fortune reported earlier Monday. The company’s shares dropped by 6% for a market capitalization of roughly $502.6 billion.\nOn Friday, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories from the platform. Facebook says that contrary to reports, “the claim that this is a data breach is completely false” and that “no systems were infiltrated.” Zuckerberg has yet to personally address the reports.", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/19/facebooks-slide-cost-mark-zuckerberg-6-point-06-billion-in-one-day.html"], "published": "2018-03-20T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T08:05:09.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
