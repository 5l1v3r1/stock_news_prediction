Chief Executive Borje Ekholm, told reporters on Wednesday the company would reach that “well on time”.\nCevian wants Ericsson to hit its margin targets ahead of schedule. The company has set a goal for an operating margin of at least 10 percent by 2020 and at least 12 percent beyond 2020.\nCevian’s portfolio also includes large positions in European blue-chips such as ABB and Thyssenkrupp. It recently took a stake worth around $850 million in Swedish airbag and seat belt maker Autoliv.\nEkholm said Ericsson, which is waiting for demand for next-generation mobile networks to increase, was well-placed, having won up to 50 percent of 5G contracts worldwide so far.\n“We see a much faster acceleration for 5G than we thought earlier. Maybe not as fast in Europe, but incredibly fast in North America and Asia,” he said.\nThe former boss of high-flying mining gear maker Atlas Copco , Ronnie Leten, is due to take up his post as Ericsson’s chairman on Wednesday. The appointment of Leten, who succeeds Leif Johansson, has boosted investors’ hopes of a recovery at the company.\nEkholm said the incoming chairman favoured decentralisation, clear accountability, and would aim to simplify how the company works.\n“He is a great industry leader who will add a new approach to the firm,” Ekholm said.\nThe fourth quarter of last year was Ericsson’s fifth straight quarter of operating losses. It said in January the cost-cutting programme was saving around 6 billion crowns on an annual basis at that time.\nThe company has also pledged to deliver a gross margin of 37-39 percent. Its fourth quarter gross margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 30 percent, roughly unchanged from the third quarter.\n$1 = 8.2887 Swedish crowns Editing by Niklas Pollard and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:59:38.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
