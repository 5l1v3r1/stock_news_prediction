Disney's cable packages range from $80 to $100 a month, far higher than Netflix's $13.99 premium package, the most expensive the company offers.\nThe key is to shake up the old business model, Greenfield said.\n\"They should be launching day and date with all of their best content,\" he said. \"Not trying to create incremental content.\"\n\"Going for it means disrupting earnings and taking a step down in earnings,\" Greenfield said.\nBut the analyst predicts Disney won't, because \"they basically want their cake and to eat it too.\"\n\"They don't want to disrupt their legacy businesses while they build the new business,\" Greenfield said. Disney has a market cap of more than $150 billion. \nMeanwhile, competition looms from other media companies, most notably Netflix.\nThe streaming giant has become a powerhouse of its own, with a market cap exceeding $130 billion. So far this year shares of Netflix stock are up 64 percent compared with the broader S&P 500's 2 percent increase. Even price increases last October for new customers, the first time in two years, didn't deter new customers. Netflix added 24 million members in 2017, 8.33 million in the fourth quarter alone.\nGreenfield pointed out that the biggest criticism of Netflix is that the company doesn't make any money, with a $2 billion negative cash flow.\nBut \"that's the pushback. Disney would have to meaningfully step back in earnings,\" he said, in order to grow with current consumer trends.\nInstead, he said, Disney has focused too much of its energy on acquiring existing media companies , such as Twenty-First Century Fox .\nBut acquiring a legacy media company, Greenfield warned, comes with problems of its own, such as other distribution deals that are already in motion.\n\"If I'm Disney, what should I be doing with $80 billion of capital?\" said Greenfield, who called Disney \"the best content creator on the planet.\" \"I should be investing in the future. If they want to put money to work they should be building.\"\n\n\"If Disney just spent and created its new content directly for the consumer, they could win,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T02:56:21.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
