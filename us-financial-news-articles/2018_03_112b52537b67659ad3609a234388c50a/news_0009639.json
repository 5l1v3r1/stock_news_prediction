BRF did not have an immediate comment on the matter.\n“The fraud had the intention to cheat inspection services so as to prevent the agriculture ministry from controlling the quality of the industrial process of the company under investigation,” the police said in a statement, adding they would serve 11 temporary arrest warrants and 53 search and seizure warrants.
