Trier was reinstated by the NCAA after serving a two-game suspension when trace elements of a banned performance-enhancing substance was found last week.\nReid Travis had 23 points and 10 rebounds, Dorian Pickens had 11 points and Daejon Davis had 10 for Stanford (16-14, 10-7), which had a three-game winning streak broken.\nArizona had a 38-29 rebounding edge and shot 52.8 percent from the field while holding Stanford to 40.7 percent.\nAyton’s layup gave Arizona a 50-41 lead with 13 1/2 minutes remaining.\nStanford closed to within five at 69-64 with 1:04 remaining on Davis’ driving dunk before Trier made two free throws with 42.4 seconds remaining, enough of a cushion.\nAyton played the final 3:11 attempting to stop the bleeding from his lower lip after being hit in the mouth by Travis’ left hand on a follow-through of a missed field goal attempt.\nRistic made 10 of 15 field goal attempts and was two points short of his career high. Ayton made 4 of 6 shots. Ristic has scored in double figures in 12 of his last 13 games.\nStanford, UCLA, USC and Washington are tied for third place in the Pac-12 with one game remaining. The third- and fourth-place teams receive a bye in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:40:00.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
