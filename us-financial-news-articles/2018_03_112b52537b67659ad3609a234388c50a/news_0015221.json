While 45 percent of millennials reported making an offer on a house they hadn't visited in person, only 28 percent of Gen-Xers and 6 percent of boomers took the risk. show chapters 2:06 PM ET Thu, 7 Sept 2017 | 00:48 \nRedfin speculates that a prevalence of foreign investors could account for the nearly 60 percent of purchasers who bought properties blind in L.A. and other California cities. \nBut while homeowners might score a deal by jumping on a home before visiting, they could also be setting themselves up for disappointment. A report from Trulia found that the No. 1 mistake buyers say they made is choosing a home that turned out to feel like it was the wrong size. Almost half, or 42 percent of those polled by the real estate site, say that they picked a place to live that was either too large (9 percent) or too small (33 percent). \nMore than a quarter of homeowners (26 percent) also wish they had done more or less remodeling. \nYou can't return a home like you can return a shirt to the mall. And remodeling to suit your taste isn't easy, either. Major changes take time, money and effort.

Buying a home for the money isn't a smart choice, says Eric Roberge, a CFP and founder of Beyond Your Hammock . \n\"A single family home is not an investment,\" Roberge tells CNBC Make It . \"It may gain money over time, but if you're looking to invest, buying a single family home and then living in that home is not the place to do it.\" \nBecoming a homeowner is a major commitment, both of your time and finances. Don't hand over a down payment until you've taken the time to consider why you want the place. Are you planning to start a family and looking for a space you can grow into? Or are you just trying to score a good deal? ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T16:13:22.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
