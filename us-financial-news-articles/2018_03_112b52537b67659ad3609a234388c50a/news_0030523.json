The Company intends to file its audited financials and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission after close of market on Friday, March 16, 2018.\n2017 Highlights:\nCrude sales volumes of more than 1.8 million net barrels of oil; $101.2 million in revenue, a 30% increase over 2016; Total production of approximately 1.7 million net barrels of oil; Spudded successful Miocene exploration well offshore Nigeria.\n“During 2017, we produced approximately 1.7 million net barrels of oil and generated revenues of more than $101 million,” said Femi Ayoade, Chief Executive Officer. “2017 had its challenges for our industry and our company, but Erin Energy’s perseverance and some stabilization of the commodity price, allowed for good progress in many of our efforts.”\nAyoade continued, “The most exciting accomplishments were the farm out to FAR, and more recently PETRONAS, to our offshore blocks in The Gambia and our Miocene discovery with the Oyo-NW well.”\nOperational Update\nAverage net daily production for 2017 was approximately 4,900 bopd compared to approximately 4,800 bopd for 2016. For the fourth quarter 2017, net daily production was approximately 4,000 bopd compared with 5,800 for the comparative period in 2016. The average price received for 2017 was $54.84 per barrel compared to $45.45 in 2016.\nNet production volumes for the year were approximately 1.7 million net barrels of oil compared to approximately 1.8 million net barrels in 2016. The Company’s crude oil inventory was approximately $3.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company announced early this year that it had successfully completed the drilling of the Oyo-NW exploration well and that it had discovered hydrocarbons in the Miocene Formation. The well is located approximately 9.5 kilometers northwest of the Oyo Central field on the Company’s offshore Nigeria block 120.\nOyo-NW was drilled to a total vertical depth subsea of 12,218 feet and penetrated multiple sand units with total gross thickness of 260 feet in the depth range from 7,052 - 10,873 feet TVDSS as interpreted from wireline log data including approximately 115.2 feet of gross hydrocarbons in the two Miocene targets, U7.0 and U8.0. (1)\nThe Company is now planning an appraisal of the discovery for the second-half of 2018, subject to the availability of capital and drilling services.\nIn The Gambia, the Company completed a farm-in agreement in early-2017 with FAR Ltd., an ASX listed company, which has seen successful offshore in Senegal with its SNE field discovery and subsequent appraisal program. The Company recently announced that a subsidiary of Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) has also farmed into The Gambia blocks and that the joint venture plans to drill the Samo-1 prospect, which as reported by our partner FAR is estimated to contain unrisked mean prospective resources of 825 million barrels of oil volume * .\nIn Ghana, Erin Energy announced that the Final Judgement was issued by the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea on Maritime Boundary Arbitration between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The maritime boundary delimited by the Special Chamber’s decision ruled in favor of Ghana and had no material impact on the Company’s Expanded Shallow Water Tano block.\nErin Energy has re-commenced work with the Government of Ghana and its joint venture partners to progress operational activities and is planning a 3D marine seismic survey acquisition later this year. We plan to tender the 3D seismic survey once we receive government approval.\nThe Company’s year-end 2017 SEC proved oil reserves were 7.1 million barrels (MMbbls).
