We also plan to begin clinical trials of CTX001 for sickle cell disease in the United States this year. Further, in immuno-oncology, an important area of focus for us, we expect to make substantial progress by filing an IND by the end of the year for CTX101, an allogeneic CRISPR-based CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19+ malignancies.”\nRecent Highlights and Outlook:\nInitiating Phase 1/2 trial of CTX001 in β-thalassemia in 2018. CRISPR, together with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, has filed clinical trial applications (CTAs) in various European countries to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial of CTX001, an autologous gene-edited hematopoietic stem cell therapy for patients suffering from severe hemoglobinopathies. CRISPR has received approval for the first of these CTAs and expects to initiate clinical trials in Europe in 2018. The Phase 1/2 trial of CTX001 is designed to assess its safety and efficacy in adult transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia patients. Additionally, the Company plans to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for CTX001 in SCD in the US in the first-half of 2018. Updated preclinical data for CTX001. CRISPR presented new data at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2017 demonstrating that its CRISPR gene-editing approach results in high editing efficiency, with >90% of the hematopoietic stem cells edited at the target site. The expression levels of fetal hemoglobin in these cells were above the level believed to be sufficient to ameliorate symptoms in patients with β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Initiated manufacturing and other IND-enabling activities for CTX101, an allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19+ malignancies. The Company presented in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity during a poster session at the Society for Immunotherapy in Cancer (SITC) 32nd Annual Meeting. The Company believes its allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies may have distinct advantages over the current generation of autologous cell therapies including greater access due to their “off-the-shelf” nature, and greater efficacy due to the homogeneity and consistency of the product. CRISPR plans to file an IND for CTX101 in the US by year-end 2018. Added two new candidates to the CRISPR-based allogeneic CAR-T portfolio. During a company-sponsored reception at the SITC 32nd Annual Meeting, CRISPR announced it will be advancing the next two candidates targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and CD70. The Company believes it has the necessary capabilities in place to rapidly advance these product candidates to the clinic. Continued advancement of the pipeline through collaborations with CureVac and StrideBio for in vivo programs. In November 2017, CRISPR entered into a collaboration with CureVac to develop novel Cas9 mRNA constructs with improved properties for gene editing applications that could include increased potency, decreased duration of expression and reduced potential for immunogenicity. The Company obtained an exclusive license to the improved constructs for use in three of their in vivo gene-editing programs in liver diseases. Additionally, CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a collaboration with StrideBio to develop AAV vectors with greater tissue specificity, and reduced immunogenicity. Continued organizational growth and senior leadership changes. CRISPR continues to recruit top talent across all functions as it evolves into a clinical-stage company. Notably, in 2017, the Company appointed Dr. Samarth Kulkarni as Chief Executive Officer and added key executives in positions including Head of Research and Development, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, each of whom bring an extensive track-record of success and leadership in biopharma. Completed an offering of 5,750,000 common shares . The offering, including full exercise of the overallotment at $22.75 per share, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of greater than $120 million.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 were $239.8 million, compared to $315.5 million as of December 31, 2016, a decrease of $75.7 million, which was primarily driven by expenditures on research and development. Additionally, on January 5, 2018, CRISPR announced a follow-on offering that raised $122.6 million of net proceeds that are not reflected in year-end cash. Combined with the 2017 year-end cash balance, CRISPR Therapeutics enters 2018 with more than $360 million available to advance its portfolio. Revenue: Total collaboration revenue was $32.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $2.3 million for fourth quarter of 2016, and $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in annual revenue is primarily attributable to deferred revenue recognized in conjunction with the execution of the Company’s collaboration agreement with Vertex. R&D Expenses: R&D expenses were $20.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $15.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $69.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expense was driven by greater investment in CRISPR’s lead hemoglobinopathies program partnered with Vertex, in addition to accelerating the Company’s wholly owned immuno-oncology and in vivo programs. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $11.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $12.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $35.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the year was driven by increases in employee-related costs associated with our growing organization. Net Income/Loss: Net income was $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and net loss was $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAbout CRISPR Therapeutics\nCRISPR Therapeutics is a leading gene editing company focused on developing transformative gene-based medicines for serious diseases using its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 platform.
