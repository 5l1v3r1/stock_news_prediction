(NYSE: RIV) (the “Fund”) announces that on March 20, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved a new investment advisory agreement with ALPS Advisors, Inc. (“ALPS Advisors”), the Fund’s investment adviser, and a new sub-advisory agreement with RiverNorth Capital Management, LLC (“RiverNorth”), the Fund’s investment sub-adviser, subject to approval of such agreements by stockholders of the Fund. The new investment advisory agreement and new sub-advisory agreement were considered in connection with the recently announced transaction in which DST Systems, Inc. (“DST”), the parent company of ALPS Advisors, has entered into a definitive agreement with SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (“SS&C”) wherein SS&C will acquire DST (the “Transaction”). The Transaction, when completed, will result in a change of control of ALPS Advisors, which may be deemed to result in an “assignment” of the Fund’s existing investment advisory agreement and sub-advisory agreement, resulting in their automatic termination. The Transaction is not expected to impact the day-to-day operations of the Fund and the portfolio managers of the Fund will remain the same. Except for the commencement dates, the new advisory and new sub-advisory agreements have materially the same terms as the corresponding currently effective agreements. Completion of the Transaction is subject to a number of conditions. DST and SS&C currently expect to complete the Transaction before the end of the second quarter of 2018.\nTo provide for continuity in the operation of the Fund following the completion of the Transaction, the Board also approved interim advisory agreements with respect to each of ALPS Advisors and RiverNorth that will allow the firms to continue to serve in their respective roles as the Fund’s adviser and sub-adviser for a period of up to 150 days, until the date that stockholder approval of the new agreements is received.\nAccordingly, stockholders of the Fund will be asked to approve the new investment advisory agreement and new sub-advisory agreement at a special meeting of stockholders to be held on May 31, 2018. The record date for the Fund’s special meeting of stockholders is April 2, 2018.\nRiverNorth Opportunities Fund, Inc.\nThe investment objective of the Fund is total return consisting of capital appreciation and current income. The Fund had approximately $116.0 million of total assets and 5.32 million common shares outstanding as of March 16, 2018.\nThe Fund is a closed-end fund and does not continuously issue stock for sale as open-end mutual funds do. The Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell stock need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market's value.\nALPS Advisors, Inc. is the investment adviser to the Fund.\nRiverNorth Capital Management, LLC is the investment sub-adviser to the Fund. RiverNorth is not affiliated with ALPS Advisors or any of its affiliates.\nAbout ALPS\nThrough its subsidiary companies, ALPS Holdings, Inc.
