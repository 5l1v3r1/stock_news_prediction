KCNA/via Reuters New Delhi has been cutting back on trade with North Korea but has maintained diplomatic links. It has given food aid in the past, but even that has been brought down to the minimum.\nThe new restrictions were mainly on “new or used vessels”, food and farm products, electrical equipment and wood, the government said in the statement.\nCurbs have also been toughened on the export of industrial machinery, transportation vehicles, iron, steel and other metals.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks during the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates February 11, 2018.

The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had imposed the new sanctions.\nTensions had risen to the highest level in years over North Korea’s weapons programs, which it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nNorth Korea has boasted of its plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the mainland United States. But fears of all-out war eased last month, coinciding with North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics in the South.\nNorth Korea seems “sincere” in its apparent willingness to halt nuclear tests if it holds denuclearization talks with the United States, Trump said on Tuesday, as U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials voiced scepticism.\nReporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2D6lgM6", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:09:40.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
