Paper Excellence had offered 71.50 reais per share. \nSuzano shares, after rising 24 percent at opening, were up 14.5 percent at 26.94 reais. Controlling shareholders Votorantim Participações SA and BNDESPar, the investment arm of Brazil's state development bank BNDES, said they agreed to a cash-and-share offer from Suzano worth 35 billion reais ($10.7 billion) at Thursday's closing price. As Suzano shares rose, the value of the deal reached 35.8 billion reais. \nThat proposal was still lower than a sweetened last-minute offer of nearly 40 billion reais in cash from Paper Excellence, according to a person with knowledge of the bid. \nBNDES director Eliane Lustosa, though, said Paper Excellence's bid was not firm. \"We saw it as an intention to present a proposal. Paper Excellence did not present financing for the bid or guarantees,\" Lustosa said. \n\"Suzano's proposal was the only one we had, with all banks' commitment,\" she added. BNDESpar will receive 8.5 billion in cash and a 11 percent stake in the new company. The cash payment represents the largest divestment in the bank's history. \nThe outcome underscored the continued influence of BNDES, a shareholder in both Fibria and Suzano, which has been used by Brazil's government in the past to engineer \"national champions\" a policy publicly disavowed by the bank in recent years. \nThe deal is still subject to antitrust approval in Brazil, the United States, the European Union and China, Fibria said. An escape clause in the deal would allow Suzano to call it off if regulators force the sale of more than 1.1 million tonnes of capacity. \nBNDESPar will receive 8.5 billion reais ($2.6 billion) in cash and stock in the new firm, it said in a separate statement. \nThe development bank had pressed Paper Excellence for bank documents proving that its bid had firm financing. \nPaper Excellence, controlled by the Wijaya family, which also owns Asia Pulp & Paper Company Ltd, offered to pay a $1.2 billion break-up fee if the deal failed to get funding, the source said, but it was not enough to sway the state bank. \n($1 = 3.28 reais) (Additional reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro and Alberto Alerigi Jr. in Sao Paulo Editing by Brad Haynes, Daniel Flynn and Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T04:19:21.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
