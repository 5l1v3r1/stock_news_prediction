The Ranbaxy case is unrelated to Fortis.\nReporting by Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/E85F5369_DC96_4DDB_B3F4_0514A54103C7_124835.pdf", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T18:21:38.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
