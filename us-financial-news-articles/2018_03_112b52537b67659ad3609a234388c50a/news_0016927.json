Their fresh perspectives will be instrumental as we build on Casey’s rich history and continue our efforts to position the Company for continued growth and value creation.”\nTerry W. Handley, President and Chief Executive Officer of Casey’s, said, “Our new directors join a Board and management team that are keenly focused on generating increased long-term value for shareholders through key initiatives - such as digital engagement and price optimization programs - to accelerate same-store sales growth and improve Casey’s financial and operational performance. We are confident that through these initiatives, as well as Casey’s new store construction and acquisition activity, Casey’s will be well-positioned to build on its strong track record and continue generating sustainable shareholder value for years to come.”\nMr. Handley added, “With today’s additions to our Board, Casey’s has the right team in place to provide the necessary oversight and governance to successfully embark on its next chapter.

If approved by shareholders, our adoption of majority voting for director elections will similarly increase shareholder access and input by providing shareholders with a stronger voice in director elections.”\nCasey’s will file a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that includes additional information about these changes.\nChairman and New Director Biographies\nH.
