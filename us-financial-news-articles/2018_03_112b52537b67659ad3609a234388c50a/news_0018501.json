Your work in those hours is unlikely to be your best and \"the light from the computer and stress will condition you to awaken.\" \nTry to realize the issues on your list that can be addressed, he said. \nIf you're worried that you might be fired, for example, have an updated resume that you are proud of along with a plan of action in your arsenal.\nMake time for co-workers if you feel those relationships could benefit from strengthening. \"If you have too much work,\" Winter said, \"tell your boss it's too much for one person.\" \nMore from Personal Finance:\nPutting bitcoin in your IRA can sink your retirement\n5 key differences between Roth and traditional IRAs\nThis rollover mistake can sink your retirement savings", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T20:01:12.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
