The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. \nStringer | Reuters Employees close a valve of a pipe at a PetroChina refinery in Lanzhou, Gansu province. The privately held Chinese firm, focused on energy and other investments abroad, has emerged from a role as niche fuel trader to become a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China's energy giants. It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft for $9.1 billion.\nCEFC China Energy did not respond to requests for comment on the probe into Ye, reported earlier on Thursday by Chinese magazine Caixin without citing sources.\nShares in the firm's listed subsidiary CEFC Anhui International Holding slumped as much as 10 percent, the maximum allowed, to their lowest since Sept. 2014, on the report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T05:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T05:49:28.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
