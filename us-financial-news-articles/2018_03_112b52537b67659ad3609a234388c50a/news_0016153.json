REUTERS/Mike Blake For the first time in its history, the company has flipped its ‘golden arches’ logo to show a ‘W’in honor of International Women’s Day on Thursday, according to restaurant officials. A McDonald’s in Lynwood, California, which is owned and operated by a woman, first flipped its ‘M’ at the sign in front of the restaurant to celebrate women everywhere, the company said in a statement. By Thursday, all of McDonald’s social media profiles, including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, were displaying an upside-down logo.

More than 62 percent of McDonald’s employees are women, including six out of 10 restaurant managers, Lewis said. About 100 restaurants across the country plan to participate in the gesture, and customers will also see the flipped logo on packaging and crew member’s hats and shirts, the company said in a statement.
