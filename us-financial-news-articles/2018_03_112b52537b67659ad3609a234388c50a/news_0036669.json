Apple was later added to make it, FAANG.) \n\"I think the trust feels like a lot of other people, which is: 'You know what, if I'm going to pay say 23 times this year's earnings or 19 times next year's, I don't want to get up in the morning'\" and see a bad headline every day, Cramer said. \nFacebook shares slid 4.3 percent at Monday's Wall Street open, after reports that Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Facebook ads for President Donald Trump , mined the data of more than 50 million users of the social network without their permission. \nThe Cambridge Analytica questions come on top of pressure last year after Facebook told lawmakers that Russia-based operatives published about 80,000 posts over a two-year period in an effort to sway U.S. politics. \nCramer added the continued bad headlines make the U.S. tech company seem \"naive.\" But asked whether he's surprised by the big move down in Facebook shares, Cramer said, \"Yes I am at this point.\" \n\"Why isn't Facebook more aware of the power it has?\" asked Cramer, host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\" \"They don't make you love them.\" \nHe added, at the moment, it's hard to find stocks that aren't \"controversial.\" \n\"I am stuck with the idea that this company had revenue growth of 47 percent [in the latest quarter], earnings per share growth of 57 percent. This stock is selling at 19 times earnings,\" Cramer said, which under normal circumstances would make it attractive.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nClarification: This story has been updated to reflect that Jim Cramer's chairtable trust sold shares before the news that Cambridge Analytica mined the data of more than 50 million users of Facebook without their permission. \nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
