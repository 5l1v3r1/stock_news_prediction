I deeply regret my lapse of judgment and I am sorry for the distress and embarrassment I have caused my family, friends, and colleagues.”\nThe 61-year-old Mr. Voge, known as Bill, took over as head of Latham in 2015 after a 20-year tenure by Robert Dell. The firm, founded in Los Angeles in 1934, grew under Mr. Dell’s leadership into a global powerhouse in litigation and deal work with more than 2,600 lawyers in 14 countries.\nIt became the highest-grossing U.S. law firm in 2014 and last year exceeded $3 billion in global revenue, the first firm to do so, according to legal trade publication the American Lawyer.\nMr. Voge, a project finance lawyer, served in several leadership roles before being elected managing partner and global chair of the firm in 2014. He beat out several other candidates in the election to replace Mr. Dell, including finance partner Jeffrey Greenberg in a final runoff.\nMr. Voge told the American Lawyer in 2014 that he planned to be candid and a quick decision-maker as firm leader. “I like to keep things moving,” he told the publication. “As I look at some of the great global service firms and some that are doing less well, the difference often comes down to a loss of ambition, and an increase in complacency. We can’t afford to be complacent.”\nFormer Latham employees and others in the legal industry expressed shock Tuesday, describing Mr. Voge as a well-respected lawyer who has made diversity and the advancement of women a hallmark of his leadership tenure.\nIn an essay on his commitment to diversity written last year for Huffington Post, Mr. Voge detailed his upbringing on an Iowa farm and how enlisting in the Army helped expand his worldview.\nAfter serving in the Army, he attended college at California State University, Fresno and received law and business degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. He joined Latham after graduating from Berkeley in 1983.\nLaw360 was first to report on Mr. Voge’s resignation Tuesday.\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T03:59:03.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
