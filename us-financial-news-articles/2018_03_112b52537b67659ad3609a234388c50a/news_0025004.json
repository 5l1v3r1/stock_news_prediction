Officials did not offer any details on who they believe was responsible.\nThe explosion injured at least 25 people, including U.S. tourists. It marked another blow to the reputation of Mexico’s tourism industry, as the country’s soaring crime and long-running battle with drug cartels have increasingly disrupted resort towns.\nShortly before spring break, when thousands of U.S. college students descend on Mexican beach towns, the U.S. government on Wednesday barred its employees from traveling to Playa del Carmen. It cited an unspecified “security threat” and mentioning the blast. The government later limited the ban to certain neighborhoods.\nFollowing the blast, the Mexico’s federal police will increase its deployment in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo on the Yucatan Peninsula which includes Cancun. It will prioritize areas frequented by tourists, Manelich Castilla, the top federal police chief, said at the news conference. He stressed that the Mexican government has the resources to keep the peace in tourist destinations.\n“Reservations have not been canceled, and the beaches are open, without incident,” he said.\nThe ferry at the center of the explosion was operated by Barcos Caribe, which is owned by the family of former Quintana Roo Governor Roberto Borge, local media reported. Borge was extradited from Panama to Mexico in January and has been jailed on corruption charges.\nBarcos Caribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nReporting by Julia Love and Noe Torres, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T21:51:38.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
