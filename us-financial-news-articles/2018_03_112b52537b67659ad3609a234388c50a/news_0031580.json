On Friday night, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel might make a run at Broadcom to battle the Qualcomm deal. \nBroadcom opened the week up 3 percent on that report, and spiked as much as 4 percent Tuesday. ( Intel CEO Brian Krzanich later bucked takeover rumors in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer.) \nThen, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump ordered the immediate and permanent end of merger talks . On Wednesday, Broadcom called off its bid, and the stock shed as much as 2 percent Wednesday following the announcement. \nOn Thursday evening, Broadcom announced first quarter earnings that beat estimates, but shares opened nearly 2 percent down Friday, and finished the day down almost 5 percent. \nThe stock is up nearly 15 percent in the last 12 months.
