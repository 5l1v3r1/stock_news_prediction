Mourners grieve next to the coffin of Jose Rivero, one of the inmates who died during a riot and a fire in the cells of the General Command of the Carabobo Police, during his funeral at the cemetery in Valencia, Venezuela March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Adriana Loureiro \n“The Bolivarian government of the Venezuelan republic ... sends its profound condolences to the relatives and loved ones of each of the people who died in this unfortunate incident,” the statement by the Foreign Ministry read. \nThe statement did not give any details on the cause of the disaster, which inmates’ relatives and a surviving prisoner told Reuters stemmed from a shootout with police in an overcrowded and lawless jail. Mourners grieve next to the coffin of Edgar Martinez, one of the inmates who died during a riot and a fire in the cells of the General Command of the Carabobo Police, during his funeral at a cemetery in Valencia, Venezuela, March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Adriana Loureiro \nVenezuela’s opposition says leftist president Nicolas Maduro’s response to the 68 deaths in Valencia has been woefully insufficient. Maduro has yet to personally speak about the incident and has instead been tweeting about Easter holidays, a visit by Hollywood actor Danny Glover, and the upcoming presidential election.

Chavez once described the problem as the world’s most “savage” and promised to clean it up. \nBut opposition politicians said the Valencia disaster was another sign of the ruling socialists’ incompetence in a country that is deep in economic crisis and is plagued with food shortages, hyperinflation, and rampant crime. \n“While in Venezuela all sorts of human rights violations are going on, Maduro is busy with ... increasing his levels of corruption and showing that he is an incapable leader who has the people going without food and medicine,” said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarez from Carabobo state, where the jail riot occurred.
