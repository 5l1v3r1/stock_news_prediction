More than 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by an app for data, which passed the information onto London-based elections consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\n\"While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook,\" the social media giant said in a statement Wednesday.\nIn announcement after the end of the trading day, Facebook said it informed Acxiom that the Facebook Partner Categories will be discontinued over the next several months. While Acxiom's guidance for this year won't change, the Arkansas-based company lowered its 2019 fiscal guidance and said total revenue and profitability could take as much as a $25 million hit.\nAcxiom provides data for \"people-based\" marketing, according to its website. The stock was down 19 percent as of 2:30 p.m. New York time.\nThe allegations about Cambridge Analytica have drawn concern concern over whether Facebook data were used to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit vote.\nShares of Facebook have also taken a hit since the news came out, and were down 13 percent for the month as of early Thursday. Dring the regular trading session, they moved 3.5 percent higher.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted an explanation online last week.\n\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,\" Zuckerberg said on his Facebook page.\nWATCH: Here's how to download a copy of everything Facebook knows about you show chapters Here's how to download a copy of everything Facebook knows about you 5:49 PM ET Tue, 27 March 2018 | 01:00 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:11:01.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
