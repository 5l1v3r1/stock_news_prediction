Vulin heeded the ban and did not show up at the border.\nTwenty years after the ethnic Albanian uprising that eventually led to Kosovo’s statehood, some 50,000 Serbs have clung to homes in territory that remains politically loyal to Serbia and is largely in the grip of Serb criminal gangs.\nSerbia does not recognize the independence of Kosovo but is under pressure to normalize relations before it completes accession talks with the EU. But tensions remain high.\nOn Friday, Serbia cited security reasons in scrapping an international women’s handball match between that would have been the first between Serbia and Kosovo.\nKosovo won independence after NATO bombed Serbian security forces to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the region in a counter-insurgency campaign.\nThe landlocked country of 1.8 million people is recognized by 116 nations but is not a United Nations member because of objections from Serbia, some EU states, Russia and China.\nReporting by Fatos Bytyci and Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Ivana Sekularac and Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:43:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
