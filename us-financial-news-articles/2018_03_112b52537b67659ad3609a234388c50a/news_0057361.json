In December 2016, Qatar Airways acquired 10 percent of the company in a transaction worth $608 million.\nLATAM operates in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.\nReporting by Antonio De la Jara; Writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Bill Trott and Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T19:12:20.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
