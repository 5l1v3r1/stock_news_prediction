The tobacco industry knew for years and years and years and decades, that smoking would kill people, would harm people and create cancer, and were hiding that fact from the people and denied it,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"Then eventually they were taken to court and had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars because of that.\"\nHe argues that every gas station, car and product with fossil fuels should have a warning label on it. He hopes that this will raise awareness about cleaner cars and alternative fuels.\n\"We're going to go after them, and we're going to be in there like an Alabama tick. Because to me it's absolutely irresponsible to know that your product is killing people and not have a warning label on it, like tobacco,\" he said.\nWATCH: How Schwarzenegger made his first million show chapters The unexpected way Arnold Schwarzenegger made his first million 2:56 PM ET Mon, 6 Feb 2017 | 00:55", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T00:12:33.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
