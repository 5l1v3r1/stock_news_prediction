The company will file a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows the company to extend the deadline to file its Form 10-K. The company now plans to hold its fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call and file its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, on Wednesday, March 14, 2018.\nThe company noted the delay in filing is related to accounting for revenue and costs related to product warranties. While completing its technical accounting analysis related to implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), the company concluded additional examination is required. Based on preliminary analysis, the company believes that any financial impact resulting from this review is accounted for within the company’s preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2017 results described below. The delayed filing has no impact on 3D Systems’ customers or the operations of the business.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the company anticipates revenue will be in the range of $176 million to $178 million, approximately six to seven percent growth from $165.9 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The company expects to report a fourth quarter GAAP loss in the range of $0.08 to $0.10 per share compared to earnings of $0.05 per share in the prior year, and expects non-GAAP earnings of $0.03 to $0.05 per share compared to non-GAAP earnings of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n“We are pleased with the growth in revenue driven by healthcare, materials, software and on demand manufacturing, as well as more balanced regional execution experienced in the fourth quarter,” commented Vyomesh Joshi (VJ), chief executive officer, 3D Systems.\nFor the full year 2017, the company expects to report a revenue increase of approximately two percent with revenue in the range of $645 million to $647 million compared to $633.0 million in 2016. The company expects to report a GAAP loss in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 per share for the full year 2017 compared to a loss of $0.35 per share in the prior year, and expects to report a non-GAAP loss in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 per share for the full year 2017 compared to a non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 per share in 2016.\n“While we still have work to do, we made significant progress in 2017 to stabilize and turn around the company. We believe our investments in go-to-market combined with improved processes and better execution have started to show returns, and I look forward to discussing our progress and our significant opportunity going forward on our conference call in a couple of weeks,” concluded Joshi.\nIn connection with the extension for its Form 10-K filing, the company will postpone its previously announced February 28, 2018 conference call and webcast to discuss fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. The company now plans to hold its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results conference call and webcast and file its Form 10-K on Wednesday, March 14, 2018 after the market closes.\nThese are preliminary results and estimates based on current expectations and are subject to year-end closing adjustments and completion of auditing procedures related to accounting for revenue and costs related to product warranties.
