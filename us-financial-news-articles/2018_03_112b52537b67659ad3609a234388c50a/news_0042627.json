Hershey \nThe candy quickly gained status as a good luck charm for school exams, and then for occasions broadly. Nestlé, which owns the brand abroad (Hershey owns it in the U.S.), leaned into Kit Kat’s burgeoning popularity, fueled by Japan’s prominent gift-giving culture, and introduced more flavors, like Mini Rum Raisin (with local Tokyo ingredients), and Purple Sweet Potato (an Okinawa specialty). \nIt’s not the only U.S. treat to adapt overseas. (China has green-tea ice cream Oreos, and Hershey bars are sweeter in Canada, less sweet in China, and slightly smoky in Brazil.) But it may be the most innovative.
