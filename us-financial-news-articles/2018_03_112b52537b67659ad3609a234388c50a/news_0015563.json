Additionally, the company announced the appointment of Meg Woods to head of culture and people and Catherine Monaghan to head of clinical development operations.\n“Christina and Tony have been crucial members of the Magenta team since its early days. They have both played an integral role in building Magenta into a clinical-stage company with a broad portfolio of therapeutics aimed at allowing more patients to benefit from the curative power of a bone marrow transplant,” said Jason Gardner, D.Phil., chief executive officer, president and co-founder, Magenta Therapeutics. “As we continue to grow as a company and progress our pipeline, we are pleased to welcome Meg and Catherine to the Magenta leadership team. We believe that Meg’s background in building and enabling employee cultures focused on innovation and Catherine’s significant experience in planning, executing and overseeing clinical trials will be invaluable as we work to build what we expect to be the world’s leading transplant medicine company.”\nChristina Isacson has over 13 years of experience in senior business development in biotechnology companies and in company creation.

A bone marrow transplant is a process to replace unhealthy bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells. Bone marrow transplant can save the lives of patients with blood cancers and genetic diseases and is a potential cure for patients with severe refractory autoimmune diseases. Currently bone marrow transplant is still associated with risk, toxic side effects, and complexity for patients that could benefit from the procedure. Magenta is working to address these challenges through its integrated portfolio of therapeutics.\nAbout Magenta Therapeutics\nMagenta Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing therapeutics to revolutionize bone marrow transplant for patients with autoimmune diseases, blood cancers and genetic diseases. By creating a platform focused on critical areas of unmet need, Magenta Therapeutics is pioneering an integrated approach to extend the curative power of bone marrow transplant to more patients, by making the process more effective, safer, and easier. Founded by internationally recognized leaders in bone marrow transplant medicine, Magenta Therapeutics was launched in 2016 by Third Rock Ventures and Atlas Venture and is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
