Yields on the bonds of investment grade tech firms - yields move inverse to prices - hit the highest in 8 years, however.\nThe big losses for stocks came from Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which suffered their second biggest outflows ever, hemorrhaging $18.6 billion.\nSafe-haven bonds saw small inflows of $1.8 billion which hinted the market had reached “peak yields”, BAML said, while precious metals, which are another traditionally safety-play, saw “meaty” inflows for the sector of $1.5 billion.\nReporting by Marc Jones and Helen Reid; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-23T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:41:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
