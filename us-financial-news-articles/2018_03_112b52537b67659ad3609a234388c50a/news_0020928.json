Cramer said some of the blame fell on the company itself and some on the market's overblown worries about tariffs.\nFirst, Brown-Forman CFO Jane Morreau said on the post-earnings conference call that U.S. growth was slower due to a competitive environment â€” concerning commentary from a company posting double-digit gains.\nThe European Union's threat to place retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods like bourbon didn't exactly help Brown-Forman's stock, either, Cramer said.\nBut the \"Mad Money\" host argued that the wind is still very much at Brown-Forman's back.\n\"You rarely get much of a chance to buy this stock at a discount. Brown-Forman has a great growth story,\" he said.\nThe company's brand development, pricing strategy, millennial appeal and industry-leading operating margins only support the bull case, Cramer continued.\nCramer admitted that Europe, where Brown-Forman does 25 percent of its business, could be a pain point if tariffs are implemented. But he asked investors to recall when Russian authorities cracked down on bourbon sales there in 2014, a moment of tension for Brown-Forman that turned out to be a great buying opportunity.\nSo for investors selling their shares in the liquor giant because of one-time European retaliation or slightly higher domestic competition, Cramer had to caution against their decision.\n\"The long-term prospects have never been brighter, and that's why I think the stock is such a bargain here at $53,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"In fact, I can only hope the stock goes down even more. Even if the EU really slaps a big import duty, say, on Jack Daniels, I bet it'll be a brief blip, and a few years down the road, you'll wonder how you ever got the stock of this iconic brand so cheaply.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's bull case for Brown-Forman show chapters Cramer: Buy Jack Daniels maker Brown-Forman on growth prospects, global appeal 17 Hours Ago | 04:25 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T03:10:41.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
