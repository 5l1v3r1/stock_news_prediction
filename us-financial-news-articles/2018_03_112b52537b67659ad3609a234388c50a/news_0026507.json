They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).\"\nShares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14. Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order.\n\"Broadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\" it said in a statement in response to the decision. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U.S. president himself stood next to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan at the White House, announcing the company's decision to move its headquarters to the United States and calling it \"one of the really great, great companies.\"\nThis is the fifth time a U.S. President has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office.\n\"The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,\" the presidential order released on Monday said.\nThe order issued by the White House cited \"credible evidence\" that led Trump to believe that Broadcom taking control of Qualcomm \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"\nTrump's move accelerated a decision that appeared likely after CFIUS told Broadcom in a letter on Sunday that its investigation \"so far confirmed the national security concerns.\"\nThe U.S. Treasury Department letter was \"obviously a poison pill,\" Jim Lewis, a CFIUS expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said before the Trump order. He described the CFIUS communication to Broadcom as \"unprecedented.\"\nBroadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.\nThe presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed. However, it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States.
