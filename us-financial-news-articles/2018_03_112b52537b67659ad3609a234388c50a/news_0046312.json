Leearne Hollowood/via REUTERS “There are some that are still alive but barely,” Lay said. “The last time it happened, none survived.”\nLocals and tourists were being warned to stay out of the water due to a likely increase in sharks attracted by the dead whales.\nSlideshow (3 Images) People there for the peak salmon fishing season were also advised to stay out of the shallows.\n“It is possible the dead and dying animals will act as an attractant, which could lead to sharks coming close into shore along this stretch of coast,” the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development said in a statement.\nThe largest mass stranding of whales in the state occurred in 1996 when 320 long-finned pilot whales stranded themselves just north of Hamelin Bay.\nShort-finned pilot whales are dark-coloured with pinkish-grey undersides, travel in large numbers and often get stranded en masse, the department said.\nReporting by Colin Packham and Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T06:56:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
