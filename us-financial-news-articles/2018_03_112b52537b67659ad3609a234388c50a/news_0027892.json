That was $40 billion, or 12%, higher compared with the same period a year earlier.\nThe deficit is expected to widen further this year because of the $1.5 trillion tax cut . \nGovernment spending increased 2% in February from the same month a year earlier.\nIn an estimate released ahead of Monday’s monthly budget statement , the Congressional Budget Office attributed the government’s higher spending in the first five months of the fiscal year to higher interest payments on public debt, largely due to rising inflation. \nMonday’s budget summary showed Treasury outlays for interest on the public debt increased 9% compared with February 2017.\nGovernment spending also rose for military programs, social security and housing and urban development. The Department of Homeland Security’s outlays jumped by $2 billion, or 44%, in February compared with the same month a year earlier.\nMore \nU.S. Consumer Prices Rose 0.2% in February Trade Conflicts Threaten Global Growth, Says OECD Sign Up: Real Time Economics newsletter —Nick Timiraos contributed to this article. \nWrite to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T07:05:30.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
