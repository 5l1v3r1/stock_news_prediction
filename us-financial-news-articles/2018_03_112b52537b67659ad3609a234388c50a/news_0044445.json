The police said that they had entered Rocinha to search for suspects in the killing of a police officer in the slum earlier in the week and that they recovered various weapons following the incident, including a pair of grenades.\nIn mid-February, Brazil’s federal government ordered the army to take command of security forces in Rio de Janeiro in a bid to curb violence driven by drug gangs.\nThe already violent city has seen an uptick in crime in recent years. Murders climbed 8 percent in 2017 from the year before and 26 percent over 2015. Shootouts are a daily occurrence in Rio’s poorer areas, and the violence has increasingly spilled into Rio’s more affluent neighborhoods.\nDrug trafficking in Rocinha is controlled by the Red Command, Rio’s most powerful drug gang.\nThe army takeover has not been without controversy. Last week, Marielle Franco, a prominent Rio city councilwoman was murdered in what many suspect was a political assassination, after she heavily criticized police violence in Rio, which many say has been worsened by the army takeover.\nReporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier; Writing by Gram Slattery, Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T08:43:09.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
