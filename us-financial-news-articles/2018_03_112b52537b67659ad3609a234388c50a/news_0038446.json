TM 0.44% said Tuesday it would suspend certain autonomous-vehicle testing operations on public roads after an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.\nThe Japanese auto maker said it has “decided to temporarily pause our Chauffeur mode testing on public roads” in California and Michigan, but the move doesn’t affect similar operations in Japan. The company said it is concerned that the Uber “incident may have an emotional effect on our test drivers.”\nUber has also suspended its autonomous-vehicle testing . Other auto companies aren’t appearing to follow suit.\nRead More\nUber Driverless-Vehicle Accident Complicates Push to Ease Rules Uber Suspends Driverless-Car Program After Pedestrian Is Killed Arizona, Site of Deadly Uber Crash, Pushed to Become Nation’s Test Lab for Driverless Cars “We do not have plans to change our testing operations at this point,” a Ford Motor Co. spokesman said. Detroit-based General Motors Co. didn’t comment on any plans to alter its testing procedures, and said it plans to “commercially launch” autonomous cars in dense urban environments next year.\nNissan Motor Co. declined to comment on its testing plans, but noted its “autonomous vehicle testing protocol includes a trained safety driver at the controls constantly engaged with the vehicle and a test engineer in the rear seat to operate the system.”\nArt Wheaton, an automotive expert with Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said he views Toyota’s decision as a “sign of respect” and taking time to examine the causes of the accident could lead to lessons learned to “avoid future loss of life.”\nWhile Toyota’s decision to temporarily suspend its autonomous-vehicle testing program on public roads may help its image and “the public opinion of autonomous vehicles,” ultimately, the best way auto makers test autonomous vehicles will be informed by real world experiences, Mr. Wheaton said.\n“Auto makers need to consider the safety of the public, driver and property when giving control to autonomous software,” he said.\nA Toyota spokesman didn’t disclose the size of the auto maker’s driverless-car test fleet , but said the fleet is “intentionally small to allow for flexibility as our technology and capability rapidly advances.”\n—Christina Rogers and Mike Colias contributed to this article.\nWrite to Adrienne Roberts at Adrienne.Roberts@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T23:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T00:32:45.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
