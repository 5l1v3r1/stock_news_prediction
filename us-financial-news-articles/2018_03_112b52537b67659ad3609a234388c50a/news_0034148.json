The entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.\" \nIt's not the first public response Facebook has made to the allegations. \nOn Monday night, the social media company's vice president of marketing, Carolyn Everson, said at a New York City conference that the alleged behavior was \" an incredible violation of everything that we stand for .\" \nFormer employees of Cambridge Analytica — a firm publicly associated with President Donald Trump 's campaign — said that Cambridge gathered private social media activity without users' permission. According to The New York Times , the firm paid to acquire the personal information through someone claiming to be an academic researcher. \nCambridge Analytica has said those allegations are \"false,\" and has denied further allegations in other reports. Cambridge Analytica's board said Tuesday it had suspended CEO Alexander Nix.
