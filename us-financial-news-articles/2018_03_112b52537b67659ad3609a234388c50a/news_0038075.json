The U.S. reportedly plans to impose new investment restrictions on China as well.\nChina responded in kind on Friday, announcing proposed tariffs on 128 U.S. products worth close to $3 billion. The goods include fresh and dried fruit, nuts, wine, ginseng, and steel pipes. Such items would be subject to a 15% tariff. Should the Chinese government deem it necessary, a second group of items, including pork, processed products, and recycled aluminum would draw a 25% tariff.\nThe government’s statement noted that such tariffs would only be levied should the two governments be unable to reach an agreement by the deadline (March 31, according to Bloomberg ). Additionally, the second group of tariffs would only be implemented “after further evaluating the impact of the U.S. measures on China.” Not explicitly mentioned in the Ministry’s statement is that many of the tariffs could especially hit agricultural producers in areas that voted for Trump.\nChina also intends to seek legal action against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.\nAfter China’s announcement, the White House declared a temporary exemption for the EU, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea on steel and aluminum tariffs, implicitly highlighting the focus on China.\nChina reportedly has plans to unveil additional measures against the U.S., targeting key items such as soybeans, cars, or cotton , and potentially even technology products that are manufactured in China. Singling out these products would put pressure on U.S. technology companies and could particularly hurt agricultural areas across the U.S. China is a key trade partner for U.S. agriculture—it purchased close to one-third of American soybeans last year .\nAsian and U.S. stock markets took a hit following the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping nearly 3% on Thursday and Japan’s Nikkei index dropping close to 4% Friday.", "external_links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/23/china-promises-to-hit-us-with-tariffs-as-stocks-plunge-amid-fear-of-trade-war", "http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/ae/ag/201803/20180302722664.shtml", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/trump-orders-50-billion-hit-on-china-goods-amid-trade-war-fears"], "published": "2018-03-23T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T20:11:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
