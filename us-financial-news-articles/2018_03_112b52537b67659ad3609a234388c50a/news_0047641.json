When the fire broke out and they tried to return to the children, they were not allowed up from the ground floor, Galina Stepanova, the school cook, said. \n“This isn’t a big village,” said Vladimir Yevdokimov, head of the local Osinogrivsky rural settlement. “These girls were visible everywhere, they went to school, they were in school clubs, they spoke to everyone. That’s why of course for us this brings us big grief.” \nThe fire has focussed attention on lax health and safety standards and stirred public anger over corruption, sentiment echoed by some residents in Treshchevsky. \n“Corruption is to blame for this, that’s all that I want to say,” said Maxim, a workman sitting on his haunches outside his workshop.“Innocent people suffer and we see this happening for many years. Everything is covered in corruption.” \nThe portraits of the six schoolgirls had been hung in a school hall in tribute. \n“Just last Saturday I set tables for them, I saw them,” said Stepanova, the school cook. “If we had known that we wouldn’t see them again after Sunday and that all this would happen, who would have let them go?” Editing by Alison Williams", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T20:54:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
