The Predators improved to 11-2-2 in March while playing before their 100th consecutive sellout at Bridgestone Arena.\nMikkel Boedker had a goal and an assist, and Logan Couture and Brenden Dillon also scored for San Jose, which remained five points behind the first-place Vegas Golden Knights in the Pacific Division. Martin Jones stopped 27 shots for the Sharks.\nSan Jose had a chance to tie it with 1:53 to go, but Saros made a stick save on Couture’s penalty shot after Nashville was called for delay of game for pushing the goal off its mooring during a goalmouth scramble.\nBonino sealed the outcome with an empty-net goal with 17 seconds to go.\nTurris buried a rebound of a P.K. Subban blast from the right point at the 5:26 mark to give Nashville a 1-0 lead and kick off a four-goal first period. Couture tied it 89 seconds later with a wrist shot off Brent Burns’ 52nd assist of the season. Couture matched a career high with his 32nd goal of the season.\nArvidsson then put the Predators up 2-1, converting a nice give-and-go with Filip Forsberg for his 29th goal of the season at 10:14. San Jose tied it again just 51 seconds later when Dillon’s shot from the right point beat Saros on the goalie’s stick side.\nSmith gave Nashville its third lead of the game midway through the second period with a rebound goal, but Boedker tied it with a rebound that went off Saros’ pad and the post early in the third period. Ellis gave the Predators a 4-3 lead with a blast from the top of the right circle off a long rebound at 10:06 of the third.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:52:11.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
