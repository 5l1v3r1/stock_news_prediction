Its 2018 EBITDA margin is expected to remain at around 14 percent.\nIn February, TMK’s U.S. subsidiary, IPSCO Tubulars, halted an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares in New York, just as a sharp global sell-off in shares gripped global markets.\nOn Thursday, TMK made no mention of whether IPSCO would come back to its share sale plan, but said that results at its U.S. division would improve in 2018 due to higher demand.\nTMK also expects improved results from its European assets in 2018 due to stable pipe demand, better product mix and pricing environment. In Russia, TMK believes consumption of seamless pipes for the oil and gas industry will remain strong in 2018 with some upside potential. (Reporting by Polina Devitt.
