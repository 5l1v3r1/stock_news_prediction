Published 48 Mins Ago Reuters Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump visits the Forbidden City with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing on November 8, 2017. \nThe administration of President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, a source who had discussed the issue with the White House said on Tuesday. \nPolitico reported earlier that Trump had rejected proposals for tariffs on $30 billion of Chinese imports. \nThe source said that the tariffs would not be limited to technology and telecommunications equipment. \nChina runs a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States and when President Xi Xinping's top economic adviser visited Washington recently, the administration pressed him to come up with a way of reducing that number. \nTrump came to office on a protectionist agenda and his first action as president was to pull the United States out of the 14-nation Pacific trade pact, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). \nHe has started talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and most recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. \nThis story is developing.
