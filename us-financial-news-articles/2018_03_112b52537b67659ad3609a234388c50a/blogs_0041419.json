Chinese hackers were believed to be behind the cyber intrusion.\nWhile the U.S.-made Lockheed jets are believed to have better computer software, sophisticated sensors and sensitive stealth coating, the theft of intellectual property gives adversaries the opportunity to avoid the expenses and delays involved with research and development.\nVCG | Getty Images Shenyang J-31 Gyrfalcon model exhibits on the Aviation Expo China. Meanwhile, China announced it was developing a fifth-generation fighter, as well. China's stealth Shenyang J-31 jet bears a remarkably striking resemblance to the F-35.\nBefore the J-31 and the F-35, however, there was curious case of the J-20 and the F-22.\nIn another instance of alleged industrial espionage , the prototypes of China's Chengdu J-20 stealth fighter jet looked suspiciously similar to the sleek design of Lockheed's F-22 Raptor.\nWATCH: F-35 well received by Australia, South Korea and Japan show chapters The F-35 has been well received in Asia by Australia, South Korea and Japan      3:08 AM ET Tue, 6 Feb 2018 | 03:44", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T22:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T23:11:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
