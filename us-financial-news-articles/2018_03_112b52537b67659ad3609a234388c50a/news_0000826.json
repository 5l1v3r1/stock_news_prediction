(NASDAQ:ATXI) (“Avenue”), a company focused on the development and commercialization of intravenous (IV) tramadol, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“2017 was a transformative year for Avenue, as we completed our initial public offering, raising $38.0 million in gross proceeds, and commenced our pivotal Phase 3 development program for IV tramadol,” said Lucy Lu, M.D., Avenue’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe IV tramadol, which is widely used outside the U.S., has the potential to be a safe and effective postsurgical treatment option for patients, with less risk of abuse and dependence than conventional narcotics. We are committed to rapidly advancing our pivotal development program in 2018. We look forward to reporting topline data from our Phase 3 trial in patients following bunionectomy surgery in the second quarter, and to initiating a second Phase 3 trial in patients following abdominoplasty surgery in the third quarter of 2018.”\n2017 Corporate Highlights\nClinical Achievements:\nIn December 2017, Avenue dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 safety trial of IV tramadol for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain. This safety study is a key component of Avenue’s pivotal Phase 3 development program for IV tramadol. In September 2017, Avenue dosed the first patient in the pivotal Phase 3 trial of IV tramadol for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients following bunionectomy surgery. Topline data from the trial are expected in the second quarter of 2018.\nCorporate Achievements:\nIn August 2017, Avenue appointed Joseph Vazzano as Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. In June 2017, Avenue completed its initial public offering of 6,325,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $6.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $34.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In June 2017, Avenue announced Lucy Lu, M.D., as President and Chief Executive Officer, a position Dr. Lu held on an interim basis since the company’s inception. In May 2017, Avenue announced a Notice of Allowance from the USPTO for a new patent application (U.S. Application No. 15/163,111) titled \"Intravenous Administration of Tramadol.” The patent application describes and claims a dosing regimen of IV 50 mg tramadol, which provides certain pharmacokinetic parameters that are similar to those of 100 mg tramadol HCl administered orally every six hours at a steady state. The patent (U.S. Patent No. 9,693,949) was issued in July 2017. In February 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted Avenue two continuation patents covering methods of administration for IV tramadol for the treatment of acute pain.\nFinancial Results:\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results:\nCash Position: As of December 31, 2017, Avenue’s cash and short-term investments totaled $21.8 million, compared to $0.2 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $21.6 million as a result our initial public offering partially offset by repayments in full of our outstanding debt and current year cash burn. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the full year 2017 were $6.7 million, compared to $1.3 million in 2016. This increase of $5.4 million was primarily attributable to the initiation of the bunionectomy study in September 2017 and the initiation of the safety study in December 2017. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 were $3.6 million, compared to $1.0 million in 2016. This increase of $2.6 million was primarily attributable to non-cash expenses consisting of our financing fee due to Fortress in connection with our initial public offering and stock compensation. The increase was also attributable to increased personnel costs, market research costs and professional fees. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the full year 2017 was $12.3 million, or $1.85 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.2 million, or $1.11 per share, in 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Results:\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $4.1 million, compared to $0.2 million in 2016. This increase of $3.9 million was primarily attributable to the initiation of the bunionectomy study in September 2017 and the initiation of the safety study in December 2017. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.1 million, compared to $0.3 million in 2016. This increase of $0.8 million was primarily attributable to increases in non-cash stock compensation, personnel costs, market research costs and professional fees. Net Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.2 million, or $0.63 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or $0.27 per share, in 2016.\nAbout Avenue Therapeutics\nAvenue Therapeutics, Inc.
