Jarell Martin, JaMychal Green and Andrew Harrison each scored 11 points, and Mario Chalmers chipped in 10.\nJeff Teague notched a game-high 25 points and seven assists for Minnesota, which managed just 11 points in the fourth quarter. Andrew Wiggins and Taj Gibson each finished with 18 points, while Karl-Anthony Towns contributed 15 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. Jamal Crawford came off the bench to score 10 points.\nThe Timberwolves fell into the eighth playoff spot in the Western Conference, missing a chance to gain ground on idle Utah and Denver, which lost earlier Monday at Philadelphia. Minnesota sits a half-game back of Utah and a game and a half ahead of Denver.\nMemphis took the lead for good with 10:18 remaining on Green’s layup. It won despite making just one field goal in the last 3:57 — Selden’s dunk in the last 10 seconds after a Teague turnover.\nMemphis looked nothing like the team with the NBA’s worst record, matching a desperate opponent run-for-run. Gasol canned a pair of 3-pointers in the first five minutes to stake the Grizzlies to an 11-6 lead, and Chalmers’ layup gave them a 26-22 edge late in the first quarter.\nMemphis maintained a slim lead throughout a high-scoring second quarter. Chalmers, who played just seven first half minutes, still made an impact in limited time. His jumper and driving layup in the last 75 seconds of the half gave the Grizzlies a 59-55 lead before two Wolves buckets tied it at 59 before the break.\nMinnesota played its best quarter of the night in the third, holding Memphis to 17 points and making a late run to take its first lead since early in the first quarter. Teague’s two free throws and a floater keyed an 8-0 spurt that gave the Timberwolves an 82-78 lead going to the fourth quarter.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:57:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
