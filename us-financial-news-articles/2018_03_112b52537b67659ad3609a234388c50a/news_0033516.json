One of its investors SoftBank declined to comment. Walmart was also not immediately available for comment.\nThe move from Walmart could help Flipkart bolster its efforts to compete with Amazon , which has aggressively invested in the Indian market and made a lot of strides.\n\"In order to maintain the lead with Amazon, (Flipkart) need to expand into grocery and at the same time maintain the gap in fashion and other categories,\" Satish Meena, an analyst at research firm Forrester, told CNBC.
