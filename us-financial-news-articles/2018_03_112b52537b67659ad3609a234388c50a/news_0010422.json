The family still hopes to successfully take Nordstrom private this year. \nShares of Ascena Retail Group plunged more than 12 percent in extended trading. The retailer beat expectations on revenue but announced a loss that was wider than expected. Same-store sales were down 2 percent this quarter and guidance for the upcoming quarter was weak.\nAnalogic shares rose nearly 8 percent before settling after the bell.
