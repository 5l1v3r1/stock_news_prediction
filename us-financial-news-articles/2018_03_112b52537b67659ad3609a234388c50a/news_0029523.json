Ibrahim Kalin told state broadcaster TRT Haber that the agreement between Ankara and Washington on Manbij was binding, and that a change in the U.S. Secretary of State would not change the deal even if it leads to a 1-2 week delay. Kalin also said Turkey expected Turkish forces and its rebel allies to clear Syria’s Afrin town of militants “very soon” and added that Ankara had no intention of handing over the town to the Syrian government following the completion of its military offensive in the region.
