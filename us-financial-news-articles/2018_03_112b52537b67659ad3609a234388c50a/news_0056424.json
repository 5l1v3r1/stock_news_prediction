They are currently on 73. \nOne record they will find harder to break, though, is for goals scored, having found the back of the net 95 times while RCA Paris netted 118 times in the 1959-60 season. \nThe players, however, should still be motivated with the World Cup looming and victory on Saturday would earn PSG their 40th consecutive win in domestic cups going back to January, 2014. \n“Some of them could use the end of the season to gain confidence for the World Cup,” Fournier said. “Apart from that they should have fun.” Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T19:11:10.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
