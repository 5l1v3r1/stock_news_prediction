The acquisition of Cosmos Agencia Maritima, which also offers maritime services, gives it half-ownership of Euroandinos Port Terminals which operates the port of Paita. Dubai-owned DP World operates several ports in South America, including a container terminal in Peru’s Port Callao. DP World also said in a separate announcement that its joint venture with India’s National Infrastructure Investment Fund had bought a 90 percent stake in Mumbai-based logistics firm Continental Warehouse Corp. The acquisition was the first made by the joint venture which has said it plans to invest up to $3 billion in ports, logistics and related sectors. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The purchase consideration is less than 5 percent of DP World’s net asset value as of Dec. 31, 2017, it said. Last week, DP World reported 14.9 percent rise in 2017 profit to $1.18 billion.
