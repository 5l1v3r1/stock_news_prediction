Readings provided by some mobile phone applications gave figures as high as 2000.\nSandstorms register on the index as larger particles known as PM10.\nChina normally blames Mongolia’s Gobi desert for its annual sandstorms. Delegates from China’s arid, desertified Gansu region said in a proposal to China’s parliament earlier this month that more than half of the dust storms that descend on China each year come from abroad, mainly from southern Mongolia.\nBeijing has been planting millions of trees along its border in order to block out sandstorms, part of a project known as the “Great Green Wall”.\nThe notoriously polluted Chinese capital was a top performer in terms of smog reduction from October to February, according to Beijing’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment. But it was one of 34 cities in northern China to issue orange pollution alerts over the weekend, as industrial activity starts to ramp up again after winter curbs.\nReporting by Tom Daly; additional reporting by David Stanway in SHANGHAI Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:42:39.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
