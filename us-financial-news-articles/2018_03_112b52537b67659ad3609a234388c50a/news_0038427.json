(OTC Pink:GSRX) (“Green Spirit” or, the “Company”) announced today that it has acquired a majority stake in the California-based cannabinoid manufacturing company Spirulinex, LLC (“Spirulinex”). Spirulinex has developed a slate of cannabinoid ingestibles that include drinkable vials, gummies and other edibles, as well as the Company’s proprietary sublingual flakes product DragonGlass Flake and Bake™.\n“With our majority stake in Spirulinex, Green Spirit has now added a major link of the rapidly growing cannabis product supply chain to the Company’s portfolio of businesses,” said CEO Les Ball. “We anticipate tremendous synergy between Spirulinex and our previously announced Sunset Connect Oakland LLC joint venture ( Sunset Connect Joint Venture ) which will cultivate, grow and extract, while Spirulinex creates a wide variety of end-user products.”\nSpirulinex has developed an all-natural proprietary (patent-pending) method of suspending cannabinoids in water to create aqueous solutions, thereby eliminating the need for oils, butter or synthetic lipids, and will offer products in which cannabinoids are scientifically dosed for consistency and quality assurance.\nSpirulinex will continue to be managed by founders Ali Jamalian and Dr. Sarah Rodriguez, PhD. A former creative director who has championed brands that include Chivas, Pantene, Colgate and Harrod’s, among others, Jamalian brings a deep understanding of branding and marketing to the burgeoning cannabis industry, and he developed the industry brands Aqua Tetra Highdrate and Sunset Connect™. Dr. Rodriguez, Spirulinex’s Chief Scientist, is a leading researcher with experience in strain development and metabolic engineering for terpene production, restructuring of carbon metabolic fluxes, cellular metabolic analysis, bio-separation, and fermentation engineering. She holds a PhD from the University of California at Berkeley.\nAbout Green Spirit Industries Inc.\nGreen Spirit Industries Inc.
