REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol After March 31, McCartney has the right to sell her stake, according to company filings.\nThe label’s latest runway show - the first to mix men and women’s clothing - featured an edgy take on suits, with waistcoasts revealing a bare back, layered shorts over trousers cut from the same cloth, and linings worn as sleeves.\nSlideshow (6 Images) “The inside of things sometimes has a more sensual relationship with the wearer,” McCartney said of the looks, adding she had mixed pieces from men and women’s wardrobes.\n“The linings have so much character to them, you never seen them and they’re always so incredible,” the designer, who partly trained with a Savile Row tailor, added.\nLooks for next winter included knitwear, such as a chunky striped poncho with layers of different yarns, and dresses in stretchy velour etched with prints from 20th century British artist J.H. Lynch, known for his paintings of sultry women.\nThe brand does not publish earnings. Kering’s latest financial report said revenue growth at Stella McCartney - a much smaller contributor to its sales than Italy’s Gucci and French label Saint Laurent - was buoyant but had slowed in 2017 compared to previous years.\nReporting by Sarah White; Editing by Tom Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T20:47:31.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
