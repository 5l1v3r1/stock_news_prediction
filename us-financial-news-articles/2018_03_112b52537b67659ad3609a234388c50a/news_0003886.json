Based on a stronger start to the year, in both the Acetyl Chain and Advanced Engineered Materials (“AEM”) businesses, Celanese now expects adjusted earnings per share to grow 12-16 percent from 2017 levels.\n“Every business is performing better than we expected.

This measure is not recognized in accordance with US GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to US GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. The most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with US GAAP in our consolidated financial statements for adjusted earnings per share is earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation per common share-diluted.\nDefinitions of Non-US GAAP Financial Measure\n• Adjusted earnings per share is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation, adjusted for income tax (provision) benefit, Certain Items, and refinancing and related expenses, divided by the number of basic common shares and dilutive restricted stock units and stock options calculated using the treasury method.\nNote: The income tax expense (benefit) on Certain Items (\"Non-GAAP adjustments\") is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Non-GAAP adjustments occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit). The income tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share approximates the midpoint in a range of forecasted tax rates for the year. This range may include certain partial or full-year forecasted tax opportunities and related costs, where applicable, and specifically excludes changes in uncertain tax positions, discrete recognition of GAAP items on a quarterly basis, other pre-tax items adjusted out of our GAAP earnings for adjusted earnings per share purposes, and changes in management's assessments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets for GAAP. In determining the adjusted earnings per share tax rate, we reflect the impact of foreign tax credits when utilized, or expected to be utilized, absent discrete events impacting the timing of foreign tax credit utilization. We analyze this rate quarterly and adjust it if there is a material change in the range of forecasted tax rates; an updated forecast would not necessarily result in a change to our tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share. The adjusted tax rate is an estimate and may differ from the actual tax rate used for GAAP reporting in any given reporting period. Table 3a of our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document (referenced below) summarizes the reconciliation of our estimated GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate. The estimated GAAP rate excludes discrete recognition of GAAP items due to our inability to forecast such items. As part of the year-end reconciliation, we will update the reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate for actual results.\nReconciliation of Non-US GAAP Financial Measures\nWe are unable to reconcile forecasted adjusted earnings per share growth to US GAAP diluted earnings per share without unreasonable efforts because a forecast of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains/losses, is not practical.\nFor additional information about the Company’s Non-GAAP financial measures, please see our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on or about January 25, 2018 and also available on our website at www.celanese.com under Financial Information, Non-GAAP Financial Measures, or at this link: http://investors.celanese.com/interactive/lookandfeel/4103411/Non-GAAP.PDF .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006582/en/\nCelanese Corporation\nInvestor Relations\nSurabhi Varshney, +1-972-443-3078\nSurabhi.Varshney@celanese.com\nor\nMedia Relations - Global\nTravis Jacobsen, +1-972-443-3750\nWilliam.Jacobsen@celanese.com\nSource: Celanese Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celaneseblog.com&esheet=51766381&newsitemid=20180228006582&lan=en-US&anchor=www.celaneseblog.com&index=2&md5=638a0c99b4a217dd03e477a363fd1f99", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006582/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celanese.com&esheet=51766381&newsitemid=20180228006582&lan=en-US&anchor=www.celanese.com&index=1&md5=f111261d712e8cc6aa7b3704b1cb0318", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celanese.com&esheet=51766381&newsitemid=20180228006582&lan=en-US&anchor=www.celanese.com&index=3&md5=a163a4a957aa88e2be056f1422a5e6f2", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.celanese.com%2Finteractive%2Flookandfeel%2F4103411%2FNon-GAAP.PDF&esheet=51766381&newsitemid=20180228006582&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.celanese.com%2Finteractive%2Flookandfeel%2F4103411%2FNon-GAAP.PDF&index=4&md5=ff1bd0a629f614b2c993ef93712a39c7", "http://investors.celanese.com/interactive/lookandfeel/4103411/Non-GAAP.PDF"], "published": "2018-03-01T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T01:16:48.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
