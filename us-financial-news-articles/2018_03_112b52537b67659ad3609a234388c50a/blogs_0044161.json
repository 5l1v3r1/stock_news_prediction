Amazon sends the customer the locker number and a unique code to open it and collect their package.\nThe firm studied 98 stores in the New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Philadelphia , Dallas-Fort Worth , San Francisco , Washington , Houston , Boston , and Atlanta metro areas. Some 76 stores, or about 16 percent the chain's 473 stores, had lockers.\nPeople who stop at Whole Foods to retrieve a package from an Amazon locker could be tempted to buy a drink, milk or a promoted item, said experts, who added that the trips are also a way for the retailer to keep shoppers abreast of changes at the chain.\n\"There's a serendipity and immediacy to the in-store experience,\" said Todd Dipaola, chief executive and founder of inMarket, which analyzes anonymous location data from the mobile devices of 50 million U.S. consumers.\n\"As good as delivery is getting - one-day delivery, sometimes one-hour delivery â€” that still can't compete with the one-second immediacy of being in store and picking up that avocado that I'm about to make guacamole out of because I thought about it in that moment,\" Dipaola said.\nMicro visits have accounted for about 9 percent of all visits to grocery sellers so far this year, with Whole Foods lagging at 6.5 percent, inMarket said.\nRepresentatives from Amazon and Whole Foods did not comment.\nWhole Foods can drive impulse sales by placing products adjacent to lockers and providing quick and easy payment options, such as self-checkout, said Stewart Samuel, program director for IGD Services. He added that the chain already has tested an impulse/food-to-go area within a larger store in New York.\n\"While this would be additional volume for Whole Foods Market, the impact on the convenience store channel overall would be negligible,\" Samuel said.\nAmazon has lockers in 7-Eleven convenience stores in more than 300 cities, according to published reports. Representatives from 7-Eleven did not comment for this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T16:44:19.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
