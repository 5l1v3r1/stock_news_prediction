Ukraine's acting central bank chief Yakiv Smoliy attends a parliament session in Kiev, Ukraine March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Smoliy was nominated by President Petro Poroshenko in January but has served as acting governor since his predecessor Valeriia Gontareva stepped down last May, warning the independence of the central bank (NBU) was at risk. The delayed appointment was among issues that prompted the IMF, which supports Ukraine with a $17.5 billion loan program, to warn Kiev not to backtrack on promises to modernize and improve transparency. Speaking ahead of the vote in parliament, Smoliy said he supported Western-backed reforms that include a banking sector clean-up and switching to a flexible exchange rate. “I unequivocally confirm the NBU’s commitment to reforms. Our goals remain unchanged,” he told lawmakers. “What is most important, however, is that the NBU must remain independent from political processes in the country.” Smoliy has 26 years of banking experience, including as deputy governor during the bank’s modernization drive following a pro-Europe uprising in 2013-14. In a statement, the IMF welcomed his appointment. “(We) look forward to working with him and the whole institution under his leadership,” IMF country head Gosta Ljungman said. Smoliy is seen as a safe pair of hands but his limited political experience could work against him as he tries to juggle commitments to external creditors while meeting opposition from populist factions in parliament. As Gontareva’s deputy, Smoliy witnessed the backlash she encountered from some lawmakers who disagreed with austerity measures and accused her of representing Poroshenko’s interests over the country’s. Opposition party leader Oleh Lyashko leveled similar criticism at Smoily ahead of the vote. “Smoliy is the same as Gontareva, but in trousers,” he said. “They’re the same. They are not going to change the policy of the central bank. They prioritize Poroshenko’s interests and their own.” The IMF and other financial backers had praised Gontareva’s policies as governor and called for the swift appointment of a successor who would continue them. Under Smoliy’s interim stewardship, the central bank has continued to insist on importance of Ukraine sticking with the IMF program, warning that economic stability depends on the country receiving long-delayed loan tranches. A key task for him as governor is to rein in stubbornly high inflation. Under his stewardship, the central bank has raised interest rates four times since October. He will also need to work with the finance ministry and international financial institutions to help formulate a strategy on reforming state-owned banks.
