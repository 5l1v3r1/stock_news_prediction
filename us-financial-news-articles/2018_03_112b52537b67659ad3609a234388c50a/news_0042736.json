It’s a dribbling drinks tube that ruins your entire race,” the former Williams and Mercedes driver told Sky.\n“I had the worst one, actually. There’s so many buttons on the steering wheel, I hit the wrong one. I wanted to hit something else and I hit the drinks button —in Monaco, in the tunnel,” added the German.\n“At the time, you had to push the tube into your mouth to drink. It wasn’t in and it (the water) went everywhere into the visor, at 320kph through the Monaco tunnel. I couldn’t see where I was going any more. That was a shocker.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:17:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
