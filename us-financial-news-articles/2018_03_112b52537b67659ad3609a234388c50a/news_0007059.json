Sunseap’s project consists of an array of solar panels on hundreds of rooftops across the city-state.\n“This deal is Microsoft’s first renewable energy deal in Asia, and is our third international clean energy announcement, following two wind deals announced in Ireland and the Netherlands in 2017,” said Christian Belady, general manager, cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture at Microsoft.\nMicrosoft said it is on track to exceed its goal of powering 50 percent of its global datacenter load with renewable energy this year.\n“Once operational, the new solar project will bring Microsoft’s total global direct procurement in renewable energy projects to 860 megawatts,” Belady said.\nThe solar project is under construction and will be operational by the end of the year, the companies said.\nReporting by Florence Tan; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T06:42:15.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
