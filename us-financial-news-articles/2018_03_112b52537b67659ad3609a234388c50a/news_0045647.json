Five members of Teruya’s family were killed in the fighting, including her father.\nAkihito and Empress Michiko laid flowers at a memorial in Itoman city, where one of the fiercest final battles took place, bowing deeply. On Wednesday, they will visit the island of Yonaguni, the westernmost point of Japan.\nOkinawa residents lived under U.S. rule for 27 years after the war. Today, it hosts nearly 75 percent of the U.S. military presence in Japan, a devil’s bargain that has brought jobs but has also worry about crime and military accidents.\nThe imperial couple first visited Okinawa in 1975, when painful memories of the war - fought in the name of Akihito’s father - were sharper and attitudes towards the imperial family complicated. He became the first Japanese monarch to visit in 1993 after assuming the throne in 1989.\nAkihito, 84, said in 2016 he feared age might make it hard for him to fulfil his duties. He will be succeeded by his heir, 58-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito.\nReporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T14:55:02.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
