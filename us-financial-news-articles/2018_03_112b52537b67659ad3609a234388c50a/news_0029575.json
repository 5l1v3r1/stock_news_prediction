Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday he “would not be comfortable” if President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and tapped a successor.\nAmid this week’s shakeup at the White House that included the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , the president has signaled he may seek to remove other officials, and he has been highly critical of Mr. Sessions, leading to speculation that the attorney general could be among the next targets.\nMr. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, would oversee the process for confirming any new attorney general, so his concern about a potential dismissal of Mr. Sessions is significant. Last July, faced with other rumblings about Mr. Sessions’ being fired, Mr. Grassley warned that the Senate wouldn’t move to confirm any successor.\nMr. Grassley has been at odds with Mr. Sessions over sentencing legislation backed by the senator that would, among other things, cut mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders. After Mr. Sessions attacked Mr. Grassley’s bill, Mr. Grassley said he didn’t appreciate that and noted that he came to Mr. Sessions’ defense when Mr. Trump first criticized him.\nThe relationship between Mr. Trump and his attorney general, himself a former Republican senator who was a top supporter during the campaign, has been even more difficult.\nMr. Trump has spent months criticizing Mr. Sessions’ recusal from an investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. That decision, plus Mr. Trump’s firing of James Comey as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, which has ensnared several top Trump campaign associates.\nOn Thursday, in response to a question about whether Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt could become Mr. Trump’s new attorney general nominee, a possibility that some have floated, Mr. Grassley said, “That’s speculation. I don’t even know whether that’s the real world.” He added that he had had no conversations with the White House about Mr. Pruitt.\nMr. Trump’s advisers have warned him for months against firing the attorney general, according to people familiar with the conversations.\nBecause Mr. Sessions has recused himself from that investigation, it is now being overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. If Mr. Sessions were replaced by an attorney general who hadn’t been part of a Trump campaign, that person would take over the oversight role.\nMr. Grassley’s comments come amid questions over the status of another top official at the agency. Andrew McCabe, who was told to leave his post as deputy director of the FBI earlier this year, may be fired in advance of his expected retirement from the bureau on Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. McCabe was meeting Thursday with staffers in Mr. Rosenstein’s office in a last-ditch attempt to avert his dismissal for allegedly not being forthcoming in an internal investigation, one of the people said.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday that decisions about Mr. McCabe’s status should be left to the Justice Department but that the White House did acknowledge “some cause for concern.”\n—Del Quentin Wilber contributed to this article.\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T22:38:56.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
