Specific transactions are detailed, and trends are analyzed across all sectors.\n\"Insurer mergers and acquisitions in 2017 centered around bolt-on property-casualty specialty acquisitions, run-off dispositions in both the life and property-casualty sectors, and vertical integration in the health/managed care sector,\" said Steve Webersen, Head of Insurance Research at Conning. \"Large-scale consolidations were conspicuously absent, and the recurring theme was tactically driven divestitures and acquisitions meant to reposition insurers to face the future. The repositioning was especially evident among life insurers exiting certain geographies, products and run-off businesses. Many of the buyers were newly formed firms, attracted to the asset management opportunities afforded by life insurer portfolios. Insurers actively exited underperforming lines and entered specialty segments offering healthier growth and margin prospects.\"\n\"Global Insurer Mergers & Acquisitions in 2017: Repositioning to Face the Future\" is available for purchase from Conning by calling (888) 707-1177 or by visiting www.conningresearch.com .\nABOUT CONNING Â®\nConning ( www.conning.com ) is a leading global investment management firm with approximately $121 billion in global assets under management as of December 31, 2017.* With a long history of serving the insurance industry, Conning supports institutional investors, including pension plans, with investment solutions and asset management offerings, award-winning risk modeling software, and industry research.
