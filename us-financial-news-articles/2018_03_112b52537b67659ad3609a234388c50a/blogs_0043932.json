Diplomats and other sources have said Kim Jong Il avoided flying for overseas trips due to security concerns.\nThe younger Kim, who was educated in Switzerland, is not known to have any fear of flying and state media have shown pictures of him aboard a plane. However, he is not known to have traveled outside the country since assuming power in late 2011 after his father's death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T17:20:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
