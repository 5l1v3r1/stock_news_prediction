The Ducks leapfrogged idle San Jose into second place in the Pacific Division with the victory.\nBraden Holtby allowed three goals on nine shots in net for Washington before being yanked in favor of Philipp Grubauer, who finished with eight saves. The Capitals snapped their two-game winning streak, but maintained a one-point lead over idle Pittsburgh atop the Metropolitan Division.\nWashington took its first meeting with Anaheim this season, with Alex Ovechkin scoring the overtime winner in a 3-2 decision at home on Dec. 16.\nHenrique’s power-play goal 1:24 into the game came after Tom Wilson’s interference penalty 36 seconds into the game. Henrique took a pass in the slot from Rakell and guided it past Holtby glove-side.\nLindholm struck to double Anaheim’s lead with 6:45 left in the period, sending his wrist shot near the blue line through a busy crease arena.\nRakell’s goal on a wrister from the left circle put the Ducks up three goals at 5:37 of the second and chased Holtby.\nRitchie’s empty-netter with just over 90 seconds remaining capped the scoring.\nJosh Manson and Ryan Getzlaf both assisted on two of Anaheim’s goals. Manson was credited with the primary helper on Lindholm’s goal and the secondary on Rakell’s while Getzlaf had the primary on Rakell’s goal and the secondary on Henrique’s.\nAfter finishing its homestand at 3-0-1, Anaheim begins a two-game road trip Thursday against Nashville. Washington continues its three-game trip Thursday vs. Los Angeles.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T13:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:22:13.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
