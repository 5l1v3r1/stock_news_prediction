But that hasn’t stopped it from becoming the third-largest crypto, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. It boasts a market cap of more than $41 billion. \nThe rumors about Coinbase adding support for Ripple are nothing new. They’ve been around for months. Traders seem to have been encouraged by reports that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse will appear on CNBC’s Fast Money program on Tuesday alongside Coinbase President Asiff Hirji. \nThe Coinbase tie, goes the thinking, would allow retail investors to purchase it on its website or app. For now, Ripple’s website is the place you can find all of the exchanges where XRP is available for purchase. Some of the top exchanges include Bitstamp , Kraken , and Gatehub . \nRipple peaked at $3.32 in early January, before joining the rest of the cryptocurrencies that crashed. As of mid-morning Monday, it was trading at $1.06.
