GE described the issue as minor and that it would not delay the program.\nThe engine has approximately the same diameter as the fuselage of a Boeing 737 and houses a 134-inch-diameter front fan, that GE has claimed to be the largest of any commercial engine in production.\nIn a press release, Ted Ingling, the general manager of the GE9X program, said the test flight was \"picture perfect,\" adding that final engine certification is expected in 2019.\nGE is building the GE9X for Boeing's new 777x long-haul airplane, due to take to the skies in 2020. Almost 700 GE9X engines are already on order.\nDuncan Chard | Bloomberg | Getty Images A model of Boeing's 777X aircraft. GE has said that the 100,000-pound thrust engine will be the most fuel-efficient the company has ever produced and 5 percent more economical than any twin-aisle engine on the market.\nOn a per-pounds-of-thrust basis, the firm has also described the engine as the quietest it has ever built.\nGE's partners on the GE9X include France's Safran, Japan's IHI Corp, and Germany's MTU Aero Engines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T13:34:13.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
