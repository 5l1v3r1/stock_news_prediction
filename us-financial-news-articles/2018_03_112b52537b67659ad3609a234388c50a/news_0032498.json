The offer was delivered on Wednesday, the source added, asking for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Paper Excellence, controlled by the Wijaya family, which also owns Asia Pulp & Paper Company Ltd., still has to present documents referring to the bid financing and offered a $1.2 billion (£0.8 billion) break-up fee to Fibria. Paper Excellence declined to comment. Controlling shareholders Votorantim Participações and development bank BNDES did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
