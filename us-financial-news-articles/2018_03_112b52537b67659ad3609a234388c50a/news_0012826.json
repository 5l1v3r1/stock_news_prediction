The Mexico City service will launch with set routes including between Mexico City's main international airport and the Toluca International Airport, a distance of about 50 miles (80 kilometers). The service is aimed at some of the wealthiest commuters in the city. A trip from the upscale Polanco neighborhood to Montes Urales will cost 2,000 Mexican pesos, around US$107. The trip between the airports costs 5,500 pesos, or about $294. \nThe platform gives travelers the option to book a flight seven days in advance or up to an hour ahead of time. It is already available in Sao Paulo. The actual flying is supplied by outside helicopter operators.\nBoth cities have severe traffic problems, but neither as worse as Los Angeles, which has the worst in the world, according to Inrix.\nVoom choose Mexico City because of its dedicated air traffic control and helicopter infrastructure, such as some 200 helipads, Subramanian said.\nThe company now wants to expand the service to other cities, and is analyzing some candidates in Asia.\nHelicopter demand weakened following a slump in commodity prices from 2014, and orders are falling. Airbus said its order intake for its helicopter unit fell 5 percent last year from 2016, while demand for passenger jets is surging as record numbers of travelers take to the sky.\nThe idea is that Voom, which was born in Airbus' Silicon Valley incubator A3 , will get a new generation zipping around cities in helicopters. \nAirbus is developing a self-flying, electric, vertical-take off and landing, or VTOL, aircraft, called Vahana, which it said took its first test flight last month . Other companies, like Uber , are developing their own electric flying taxis.\nIf you could get people flying today, there will be loyal customers by the time electric VTOL comes, Subramanian said. \"We create more demand.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T16:03:57.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
