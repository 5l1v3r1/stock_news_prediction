Against the yen it fell 0.7 percent to 129.35 yen, its lowest since late August.\nThe euro zone’s third biggest economy faces a prolonged period of political instability.\n“We have seen the ascent of parties that create some concern in terms of reforms, their views on the euro and their views on forming alliances and so this does not favour stability,” said Maria Paola Toschi, a global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London.\nBut risk reversals in the currency derivatives markets for euro/dollar showed markets had been far more cautious before the French election verdict.\nEven latest positioning data showed euro bulls remained firmly upbeat, with net long currency positions still near touching distance of record bullish bets in early February.\n“Ultimately this is expected uncertainty and the markets are far more tolerant about European politics than earlier given the favorable economic backdrop,” said Geoffrey Yu, head of the U.K. investment office at UBS Wealth Management in London.\nThe dollar was also on slippery footing after U.S. President Donald Trump last week proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, raising fears of retaliation that could trigger a trade war.\nThe dollar was softer against the yen at 105.49 yen , near Friday’s 16-month low of 105.24.\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ would consider an exit from its ultra-easy monetary policy if it met its inflation target in the next fiscal year from April 2019.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake in TOKYO and Dhara Ranasinghe; editing by John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:16:15.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
