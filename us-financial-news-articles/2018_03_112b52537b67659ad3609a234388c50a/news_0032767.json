Mr. Slaughter will report to Ralph Miller, Chief Executive Officer, and become one of the senior executives within the company.\nFrom Ralph Miller, CEO of dotCMS, \"Since we sell a mar-tech product, we need to 'walk the talk,' and that means we had to bring someone onboard with the skill set that only a few people have today. Someone who combines the knowledge of the space, digital strategy, demand generation knowledge and is very technical. He has to understand our product, use our product and evangelize about the product. We are really glad to have found the perfect person for this role.\"\nMr. Slaughter was most recently Principal at Ripple Effect Advisors, a B2B Marketing and Sales Acceleration Firm based in Washington, D.C. where he led the global marketing initiatives of several high-growth, technology firms.\n\"Having a previous professional relationship with Ralph, I am keenly aware of his business acumen and ability to grow and scale companies. And then once I dug into the product and viewed the executive team's commercial roadmap, I was convinced dotCMS was 100% committed to customer success. That type of mindshare in the B2B world is hard to find, and I couldn't be more excited or optimistic,\" said Slaughter.\nAbout dotCMS\ndotCMS is a leading, open source content and customer experience management platform for companies that want innovation and performance driving their websites and other content-driven applications.
