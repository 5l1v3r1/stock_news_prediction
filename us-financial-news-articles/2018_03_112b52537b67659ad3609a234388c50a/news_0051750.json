Executives say that the technology can shave as many as 10 days off the process of applying for a mortgage.\nLike many major home builders, Lennar has a mortgage subsidiary, Eagle Home Mortgage, that helps buyers of its homes and others get mortgages.\nMaking it easier for those buyers to get mortgages could help Lennar with attracting millennials, a critical group of home buyers that have been put off from buying new homes by the high prices and long commute times to many communities. An additional obstacle on the margins for younger home buyers is the complicated process of applying for a mortgage.\n“It’s an incredible challenge for a first-time buyer because you’re pulling documents from many different sources and it hasn’t been a very friendly process,” said Bruce Gross, Lennar’s chief financial officer, who oversees the company’s financial-services operation.\nThe mortgage industry has been slow to adopt better technology, in part due to the costs of complying with complex regulations that vacuum resources away from innovation and also have made it a challenging industry for startups. As millennials enter their early 30s, they are expected to become an increasingly large share of home buyers, and the industry is now struggling to cater to their expectations.\nErin Collard, chief financial officer and co-founder of Blend, said young buyers are comparing the experience of applying for a mortgage to the ease with which they can now call a taxi or order in food.\n“What’s changed is people have really gone from comparing lenders to lenders to comparing lenders to consumer products, which sets the bar very high,” Mr. Collard said.\nWrite to Laura Kusisto at laura.kusisto@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T02:34:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
