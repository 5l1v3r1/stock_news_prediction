They are usually not used to this sort of interaction with the press and sometimes they let slip more than they want to,\" he said.\nMarket participants will track the Fed's economic projections for clues to a possible fourth rate hike this year, analysts said.\n\"The dollar remains in wait-and-see mode ahead of tomorrow's FOMC meeting, with everyone awaiting the reveal of the dot plot and the tone of the presser,\" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York.\nAn index tracking the greenback versus a basket of six currencies rose 0.613 points or 0.68 percent, to 90.378.
