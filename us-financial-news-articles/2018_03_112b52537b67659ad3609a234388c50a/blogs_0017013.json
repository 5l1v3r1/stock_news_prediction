But the White House turned over\nnone of the records Gowdy had requested.\nIn its letter, the White House said it would \"update\" the committee at an \"appropriate time\" on the progress an Executive Branch working group has made to review and improve security\nclearance procedure.\nCummings called the White House response an \"affront to our responsibilities under the Constitution.\"\nAmanda Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Gowdy, did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the White House letter and Cummings' request that the committee issue a subpoena for administration records.\nOn Monday, Gonzalez told Reuters that the White House had been in \"consistent contact with the committee\" about its requests for security clearance documents. She said \"the committee anticipates a productive response shortly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T22:29:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
