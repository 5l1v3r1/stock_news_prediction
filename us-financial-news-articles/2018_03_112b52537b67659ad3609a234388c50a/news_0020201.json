The leasing market is pretty good,” Ali said in an interview in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru.\nIn November, Air Arabia announced a leasing agreement for six Airbus A321neo long-range jets from U.S.-based Air Lease Corp.\n“Our technical team and financial team are working with both Boeing and Airbus,” Ali said.\nThe Sharjah-headquartered airline currently operates an all-Airbus A320 narrow-body fleet of around 50 jets.\nAli did not rule out a deal for CSeries jets made by Canada’s Bombardier, though suggested a preliminary agreement by an airline Air Arabia now partly owns was no longer valid.\nPetra Airlines, in which Air Arabia bought a 49 percent stake three years ago, signed a letter of intent with Bombardier in 2014 to buy up to four CSeries jets in a deal worth up to $300 million at list prices.\n“Petra as an airline was finished a long time ago. That’s history. Everything that was there is gone,” he said.\nPetra was rebranded Air Arabia Jordan in 2015 with the opening of Air Arabia’s fourth hub in Amman.\nAli said Air Arabia would sharpen its focus on Egypt this year as demand increases.\n“We see the tourists coming back, trade is coming back. We have slowed down in Egypt for some time now because of geopolitical and economic uncertainties. We now see certainty there,” he added.\nThe carrier also expects to grow in Russia and some former Soviet states this year. The 2018 FIFA World Cup will be held in Russia, which is expected to spur demand.\nAir Arabia plans to add more routes in India, Ali said. The airline already operates a handful of routes in the country, a booming aviation market.\nAdditional reporting by Alexander Cornwell in Dubai; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:29:16.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
