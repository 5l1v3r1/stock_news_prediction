The increase is mainly attributable to revenue contributions from the anesthesia businesses acquired by the Company in 2017, along with acquisitions completed mid-year in fiscal 2016. Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the revenue contributions from anesthesia businesses acquired earlier in the year and were $32,302,854, an increase of $6,480,751 when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues from anesthesia services for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $88,741,075 compared to $67,821,879 for the year ended December 31, 2016. As above, the increase was primarily due to the Company's anesthesia acquisitions throughout 2017 and 2016; however, there were a number of factors which impacted the change in revenue between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. The $20.9 million increase in revenue from the prior period is reflective of the following:\ngrowth through acquisitions contributed $23.4 million of the increase when comparing the two periods. This is comprised of growth from acquisitions completed in 2017 ($14.3 million) and growth from acquisitions completed in 2016 ($9.2 million); a change in our commercial payor mix and rates within our commercial payors contributed a decrease in revenue of $4.6 million when compared to revenues from 2016. This is largely isolated to acquisitions completed within 2014 and 2015; a positive adjustment as a result of the change in the impact of revenue estimates of $1.4 million, when compared to 2016; and revenue growth from our exclusive agreement to develop and manage a monitored anesthesia care program with Puget Sound Gastroenterology of approximately $0.7 million (see recent events).\nAnesthesia revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $29,230,584 compared to $23,008,147 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The $6.2 million increase in revenue from the prior period is reflective of the following:\nincreased revenue from acquisitions completed in 2017, of $9.6 million a change in our commercial payor mix and rates within our commercial payors contributed a decrease in revenue of $3.4 million when compared to revenues from 2016; a negative adjustment as a result of the change in the impact of revenue estimates of $0.2 million, when compared to the 2016 year to date period; and revenue growth from our exclusive agreement with Puget Sound Gastroenterology of approximately $0.3 million (see recent events).\nDuring the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, revenue was affected by changes in the percentage of patient cases covered by commercial insurance versus federal insurance. Revenue was also affected by commercial payor mix changes that result from the annual process that insured individuals and companies go through when renewing their health insurance policies and from changes in rates from commercial payors as the Company executes contracts with payors. Changes in payor mix could have a positive or negative impact on revenues. The commercial payor mix changes described above primarily relate to one payor at GAA. As adjusted operating expenses are largely fixed in nature, changes in revenue primary drive changes in operating income and adjusted operating EBITDA.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2017, the anesthesia services segment serviced 201,578 patient cases compared to 141,020 patient cases during the year ended December 31, 2016. Patient cases serviced in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 64,684 compared to 45,041 patient cases in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn 2018, the Company expects revenue from anesthesia services for the acquisitions completed through December 31, 2017 to be negatively impacted by the November 2, 2017 CMS final rule coming into effect on January 1, 2018 and to be negatively impacted by changes in the per unit reimbursements received from our commercial payors. The CMS final rule will impact our revenue per case by an estimated 12.5% and the changes from our commercial payors is expected to impact our revenue per case by an additional 5%. We expect the negative impacts to anesthesia revenue to be offset through organic growth in patient cases and deployment of available capital for future acquisitions.\nRevenues from product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $11,501,005 compared to $10,532,753 for 2016. The increase in product sales is the result of the continuing successful execution of the Company's direct to physician program that allows physicians to purchase our hemorrhoid banding technology, treatment protocols, marketing and operational experience. Revenues from product sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $3,072,270 compared to $2,813,956 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has trained 2,686 physicians to use the O'Regan System, representing 1,034 clinical practices. This compares to 2,414 physicians trained, representing 930 clinical practices, as of December 31, 2016.\nIn the future, the Company expects revenue from product sales to continue to increase, as it has historically, as we expand our physician network and increase physician use of our technology. Potentially offsetting these increases would be competitive pressures that could impact our market share or pricing power.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total adjusted operating expenses were $51,107,595 compared to $36,864,304 for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, total adjusted operating expenses were $15,340,310 compared to $11,321,510 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Increases in adjusted operating expenses are primarily related to adjusted operating expenses in the anesthesia services business. Factors impacting the fluctuation of total adjusted operating expenses are consistent with those impacting operating expenses.\nAnesthesia services adjusted operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $42,834,918, compared to $29,767,269 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Anesthesia services adjusted operating expenses primarily include labor related costs for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists and MD anesthesiologists, medical drugs and supplies, and billing and management related expenses. The Company's first anesthesia acquisition was in the fourth quarter of 2014, with fourteen further acquisitions completed in 2015, 2016 and 2017. As a result, fiscal 2017 is not directly comparable to 2016, with the majority of the increase relating to operating expenses for acquired companies and as a result of infrastructure investments made by the Company throughout 2017. As the Company works toward its acquisition strategy, it has invested in resources and infrastructure to support its initiatives. The investment in resources and infrastructure contributed approximately $1.0 million in anesthesia adjusted operating expenses in the year. Anesthesia services adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $13,162,989 compared to $9,492,140 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Similar to the year ended December 31, 2017, the last quarter of 2017 is not comparable to the same period in 2016 due to the timing of acquisitions. Investments in infrastructure and resources contributed approximately $0.1 million to anesthesia services adjusted operating expenses in the quarter. Though quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly, quarterly adjusted operating expenses which are primarily employee related costs, due to their fixed nature, are not expected to fluctuate materially. These expenses are primarily impacted by the Company's acquisition strategy.\nProduct sales adjusted operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4,568,422 compared to $4,059,858 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in product sales adjusted operating expenses compared to 2016 is a reflection of higher employee related costs as a result of increased sales activity as well as an increase in professional fees related to continuing efforts to distribute our product in China. Product sales expenses primarily include employee wages, product cost and support, marketing programs, office expenses, professional fees, and insurance. In the future, the Company expects adjusted operating expenses to increase as the Company continues to invest in activities aimed at increasing demand for training and use of the CRH O'Regan System. Product sales adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,295,163 compared to $1,083,481 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nCorporate adjusted operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3,704,255 compared to $3,037,177 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in corporate adjusted operating expense is a reflection of higher professional fees and employee related costs, and, in general, is reflective of the increasing complexity of our business which is also increasing our compliance costs. Corporate adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $882,158 compared to $745,889 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA attributable to shareholders of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $34,335,942, an increase of $1,964,826 from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA attributable to shareholders is primarily a reflection of the contributions from acquisitions completed in 2017, offset by the negative revenue rate and payor mix variances recorded in the year in respect of the Company's anesthesia providers acquired prior to 2016. Adjusted operating EBITDA attributable to shareholders of the Company for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $11,489,153 an increase of $1,207,771 from the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest was $14,798,542 for the year ended December 31, 2017. This comprises the non-controlling interests' share of revenues of $25,906,688 and adjusted operating expenses of $11,108,146. Adjusted operating EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest was $5,473,391 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This comprises the non-controlling interests' share of revenues of $9,394,392 and adjusted operating expenses of $3,921,001.\nTotal adjusted operating EBITDA was $49,134,485 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $7,644,156 from the same period in 2016. Total adjusted operating EBITDA was $16,962,544 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2,461,951 from the same period in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $12,486,884 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $9,507,004 at the end of 2016. The increase in cash and equivalents is primarily a reflection of cash generated from operations and debt financing activities, less cash used to finance normal course issuer bid repurchases and acquisitions during the first nine months of 2017, less repayment of debt in the period.\nWorking capital was $20,102,948 compared to working capital of $9,657,303 at December 31, 2016. The Company expects to meet its short-term obligations, including short-term obligations in respect of its notes payable and deferred consideration through cash earned through operating activities. The average number of days receivables outstanding at December 31, 2017 was 42 days. At December 31, 2016, the average number of days receivables outstanding was 34 days.\nConference Call\nCRH will host a conference call to discuss its results on Tuesday, March 6, 2018, at 11:00 am EST (08:00 am PST).

These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. When used, these measures are defined in such terms as to allow the reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure. These measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses of the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS measures such as operating expenses – adjusted and operating EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets, and to assess its ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditure, and working capital requirements.\nThe non-IFRS measures are reconciled to reported IFRS figures in the tables below:\nAdjusted operating EBITDA\nFor the three months ended\n2017\n2016\n2015\n(USD in thousands)\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nDec\nAdjusted operating EBITDA attributable\nto:\nShareholders of the Company\n11,489\n7,775\n7,352\n7,719\n10,281\n9,122\n7,054\n5,914\n6,797\nNon-controlling interest\n5,473\n3,119\n2,878\n3,328\n4,219\n2,533\n1,518\n848\n465\nTotal adjusted operating EBITDA\n16,963\n10,894\n10,230\n11,047\n14,500\n11,655\n8,572\n6,762\n7,263\nAmortization expense\n(7,169)\n(5,897)\n(5,603)\n(5,059)\n(4,715)\n(4,711)\n(2,925)\n(2,475)\n(2,188)\nDepreciation and related expense\n(25)\n(22)\n(20)\n(13)\n(30)\n(31)\n(30)\n(15)\n(18)\nStock based compensation\n(799)\n(968)\n(781)\n(906)\n(525)\n(297)\n(290)\n(264)\n(261)\nAcquisition expenses\n(97)\n(355)\n(88)\n(127)\n(58)\n(21)\n(286)\n(62)\n(123)\nImpairment of inventory\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nImpairment of intangible assets\n(6,653)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOperating income\n2,219\n3,652\n3,738\n4,946\n9,172\n6,595\n5,041\n3,946\n4,673\nNet finance income (expense)\n9,834\n400\n(3,571)\n(1,246)\n(1,175)\n(1,381)\n(2,156)\n289\n(5,914)\nIncome tax (expense) recovery\n(5,755)\n(604)\n453\n(397)\n(1,643)\n(188)\n(1,219)\n(1,205)\n1,541\nNet and comprehensive income\n6,298\n3,448\n620\n3,302\n6,354\n5,026\n1,666\n3,030\n300\nAdjusted operating expenses\nFor the three months ended\n2017\n2016\n2015\n(USD in thousands)\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nDec\nAnesthesia services - adjusted\noperating expense\n13,162\n10,362\n9,840\n9,469\n9,492\n8,794\n6,158\n5,323\n5,061\nAmortization expense\n7,169\n5,897\n5,603\n5,056\n4,715\n4,711\n2,925\n2,475\n2,188\nDepreciation and related expense\n3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n3\n2\n2\n4\nStock based compensation\n71\n100\n106\n149\n120\n38\n27\n17\n12\nAcquisition expenses\n97\n356\n87\n127\n58\n21\n286\n62\n123\nImpairment of intangible assets\n6,653\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAnesthesia services expense\n27,156\n16,718\n15,639\n14,803\n14,386\n13,567\n9,398\n7,879\n7,389\nProduct sales - adjusted operating\nexpense\n1,295\n1,094\n1,142\n1,037\n1,083\n974\n1,004\n998\n950\nAmortization expense\n1\n1\n1\n5\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDepreciation and related expense\n16\n14\n12\n8\n15\n15\n15\n1\n1\nStock based compensation\n95\n90\n76\n110\n125\n90\n99\n84\n81\nImpairment of inventory\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nProduct sales expense\n1,408\n1,199\n1,231\n1,160\n1,223\n1,079\n1,118\n1,083\n1,031\nCorporate - adjusted operating\nexpenses\n882\n994\n844\n985\n746\n684\n853\n754\n664\nAmortization expense\n-\n-\n-\n(4)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDepreciation and related expense\n6\n6\n5\n3\n14\n14\n13\n13\n14\nStock based compensation\n633\n777\n599\n647\n280\n169\n164\n1621167\nCorporate expense\n1,521\n1,776\n1,448\n1,630\n1,040\n867\n1,030\n929\n845\nTotal adjusted operating expense\n15,340\n12,451\n11,825\n11,491\n11,321\n10,453\n8,015\n7,075\n6,675\nTotal operating expense\n30,084\n19,693\n18,317\n17,593\n16,649\n15,514\n11,546\n9,891\n9,265\nForward-looking Statements\nInformation included or incorporated by reference in this report may contain forward-looking statements.
