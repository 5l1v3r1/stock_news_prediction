REUTERS/Marco Bello Government stalwart Jorge Rodriguez said Thursday’s agreement with Falcon’s Progressive Advance party, and some other movements, was evidence of a reconciliatory spirit that undercut foreign criticism of autocratic rule in Venezuela.\n“Venezuela is a model democracy for the whole world,” Rodriguez, who is communications minister, told reporters at the election board headquarters.\nLuis Romero, who leads Falcon’s party, said the only way to bring about change was via the polls, and not through protests similar to those that caused nearly 130 deaths last year.\nSlideshow (6 Images) “Venezuelans want to get rid of Maduro, but not by killing each other in the streets,” he said, also speaking at the election board in downtown Caracas.\nAs well as a change in the date, Falcon is demanding reforms of the pro-government election board, U.N. observers, and the end of state handouts close to voting booths on election days. He told Reuters he may pull out if guarantees are not given.\nA former military man who broke with the ruling socialists in 2010, Falcon styles himself a center-leftist favoring business-friendly policies with strong welfare programs.\nMaduro is campaigning on a pledge to stay loyal to predecessor Hugo Chavez’s self-styled “21st century socialism.”\nBucking most analysts’ consensus, several polls have shown Falcon would in fact have a chance of defeating Maduro.\nA survey of 1,000 people in early February by Datanalisis said that in a two-way race Falcon would defeat Maduro by 45.8 percent to 32.2 percent of likely voters.\nMaduro says Venezuela’s election system is clean, and accuses the United States of leading a right-wing international conspiracy to end socialism and take over his nation’s oil.\nThe election board said on Thursday that local state legislature votes would take place at the same time as the presidential election.\nAdditional reporting by Corina Pons; Editing by Angus Berwick and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T19:06:41.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
