Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the beliefs, expectations and future plans and strategies of the Company, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements or in management's expectations. Important factors which could cause or contribute to actual results being materially and adversely different from those described or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, risks related to competition, management of growth, access to sufficient capital to fund our business and our growth, new products, services and technologies, potential fluctuations in operating results, international expansion, outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, seasonality, commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, foreign exchange rates, system interruption, cyber-attacks, access to sufficient inventory, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. More information about factors that potentially could affect HealthWarehouse.com's financial results is included in HealthWarehouse.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nHealthWarehouse.com, Inc. (the \"Company\") prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which is commonly used. In addition to adjusting net loss to exclude interest, depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation, and certain other nonrecurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, Adjusted EBITDA is used internally in planning and evaluating the Company's performance. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of this metric offers investors, bankers and other shareholders an additional view of the Company's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash used in operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the Company's performance.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180329005831/en/\nHealthWarehouse.com, Inc.\nJoseph Peters, 800-748-7001\nSource: HealthWarehouse.com, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180329005831/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.HealthWarehouse.com&esheet=51780964&newsitemid=20180329005831&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.HealthWarehouse.com&index=1&md5=e8b49cb2359737a9434daa863ad63f9b"], "published": "2018-03-29T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T19:19:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
