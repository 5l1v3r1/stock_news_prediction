The flu-like symptoms can lead to nausea, diarrhoea, infection of the blood stream and brain.\nThe bacteria is found in soil, water and vegetation and can contaminate food anywhere during the production process from harvesting to serving.\nFoods that can pose a risk of listeriosis include pre-cut melons, cold salads, raw seafood and smoked salmon, unpasteurised milk products, sprouted seeds and raw mushrooms.\nReporting by Alison Bevege; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-04T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T08:13:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
