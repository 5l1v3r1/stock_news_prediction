(NYSE: KEYS), a leading technology company that helps enterprises, service providers and governments accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, announced today that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $350 million of its common stock.\n“We are pleased with the overall progress we have made to transform and position Keysight at the forefront of next-generation electronic innovation in order to create value for our customers, employees, and shareholders,” said Ron Nersesian, president and chief executive officer. “We will continue our targeted investments in our organic capabilities and opportunistically pursue acquisitions, while returning capital to our shareholders.”\nThe new repurchase program is effective immediately and replaces the previously authorized program from 2016 that was suspended with the acquisition of Ixia and of which $139 million remained.
