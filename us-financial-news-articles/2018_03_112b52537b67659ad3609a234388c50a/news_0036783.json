The company has a diverse mix of assets that provide multiple options to achieve its credit objectives while still achieving its earnings targets. These include a drop of its equity interest in Cove Point into Dominion Energy Midstream Partners (financed in public or private markets), the sale of existing assets and, if necessary, issuing incremental equity from Dominion Energy.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dominion-energy-affirms-earnings-guidance-credit-objectives-300615867.html\nSOURCE Dominion Energy", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dominion-energy-affirms-earnings-guidance-credit-objectives-300615867.html"], "published": "2018-03-19T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T19:15:47.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
