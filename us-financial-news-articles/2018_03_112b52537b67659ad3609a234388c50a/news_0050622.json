She has 27 screws holding her face in place. \n“I didn’t realise how much it affected me until I got the surgery done,” said Korda, who won the Honda LPGA Thailand in February. \n“I’m just a happy person now. I wake up, no headaches. I get to wake up pain free every day and that’s amazing to me.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T01:06:51.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
