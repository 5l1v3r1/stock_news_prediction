Connon, who has long been regarded as one of the brightest minds in marketing and advertising, will be a key voice as ViralGains positions itself to take the next step in its mission to better predict and drive business outcomes through video advertising using deep consumer insights.\n“Mark has been a prominent executive in our space for decades, and we are thrilled to have him join the ViralGains team,” said ViralGains CEO Tod Loofbourrow. “As ViralGains looks to extend its leadership in improving the video advertising experience, Mark will be a crucial addition to the team. He understands what brands need and how ViralGains’ disruptive solutions are changing the advertising experience so that brands only pay for great results and consumers only see ads that interest them.”\nPreviously, Connon was Senior Vice President, Global Chief Mobile and Data Officer at AOL, a subsidiary of Verizon now known as Oath, where he was responsible for leading mobile and data strategy within the advertising group as well as data commercialization across the enterprise. He also served as Chief Revenue Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Development at Nexage, and as Executive Vice President of Platform Business at Millennial Media. During his tenure at Nexage, Connon helped to bring OpenRTB Mobile to market, which is now an industry standard in advertising.\n“The demand for ViralGains’ proprietary video technology platform has exploded as they help brands and agencies navigate around the walled gardens of Facebook and Google by providing open, accessible data that enables them to learn directly from consumer interactions with their ads,” said Connon. “ViralGains sits at the cornerstone of consumer data and authentic conversation, and they are maximizing this data to the benefit of both brands and consumers. ViralGains’ unique insights into consumer behaviors and attitudes give brands the power to create more relevant messaging and drive high-impact business outcomes at every stage of the buyer journey. I look forward to helping ViralGains seize this massive market opportunity—and create a healthier advertising ecosystem in the process.”\nAbout ViralGains\nViralGains is a digital video ad journey platform that enables marketers to engage targeted audiences with relevant brand stories in the contexts they most favor.
