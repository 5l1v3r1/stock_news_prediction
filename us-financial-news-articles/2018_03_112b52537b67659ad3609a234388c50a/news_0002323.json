This includes employees from Greenhouse Partners , a brand strategy, creative, marketing communications, and innovation firm; The18 , the largest—by cross-platform audience size—digital soccer media company in the U.S.; and Greenhouse Scholars , an education nonprofit that cultivates extraordinary leaders to change low-income families and communities.\n“Our three companies have grown to the point where we needed a new space, not only so we all could fit, but where we have room to continue our growth while nurturing our distinct and shared company cultures,” said Pete Burridge, CEO of the three companies. “We were able to design and build out this facility to our own unique specifications, and we are thrilled with the spectacular home we will enjoy for many years to come.”\nThe building has been transformed into a bright, airy space with distinct areas for the three companies, yet plenty of communal workspaces where employees can collaborate. The facility has a two-story, floor-to-ceiling glass wall as its entry area, contains multiple tech-centered conference rooms, comfortable open meeting spaces, and a phone room decorated as an iconic London red telephone booth. In addition, the building houses The18’s new studio, outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and containing three different sets to produce the digital media company’s video and photography content.\nThe facility is also packed with amenities for employees, including a full kitchen that includes beer and wine fridges, a long café style booth seating area, and a foosball table, private bicycle parking including communal bikes for employee use, four distinctive wifi-equipped outdoor patios and courtyards, shower facilities, and a library.\nAbout the Greenhouse Family of Companies\nGreenhouse Partners is a brand strategy, creative, marketing communications, and innovation firm founded in 2001.
