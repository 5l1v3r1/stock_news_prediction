This strategic acquisition, coupled with the 2017 acquisition of CG Visions, will continue to deepen the Simpson Strong-Tie partnership with top builders, architects and engineers throughout the country by offering scalable software solutions via key apps for the industry-standard design platforms Autodesk ® AutoCAD ® Architecture and Autodesk ® Revit ® .\nFounded in 2016 by construction IT veteran Jon Albert, LotSpec is focused on the design and development of efficiency tools, practices and workflows for the large-volume homebuilders. The company's core LotSpec application has been recognized as an elegant solution for helping builders manage project options, and is built on a similar code base in both 2D or 3D AutoCAD Architecture and Autodesk's flagship product Revit. This dual functionality allows builders to gain maximum efficiency from their existing 2D drawings, while setting the stage to ease into advanced functionality with Revit and other complementary technology solutions provided by CG Visions.\nAccording to an October 2016 survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders, awareness and adoption of BIM solutions is increasing among residential construction professionals. In the survey of architects, single-family and multifamily builders, 27% of respondents said they were familiar with BIM, compared to only 17% who reported being familiar with the technology in 2014. Even among those professionals who are BIM-aware, adoption is increasing slowly, demonstrating the need for easily implemented, scalable solutions.\n\"As the industry looks to achieve more from their existing construction documents and evolve to newer technology, solutions are needed that provide immediate value and still allow for adoption of more advanced programming, but on the builder's own timeline,\" says Albert. \"With LotSpec now available as a choice from the Simpson Strong-Tie technology offering, current and future customers will have access to additional product resources and technologies which are designed to integrate with their business needs.\"\nIn addition to configuring lot-specific plan sets, the LotSpec app enables production builders to create master plan sets and manage the myriad of options offered to homebuyers, providing a customized project design and build approach that favors variety and flexibility over a static, cookie-cutter style.\nWith the LotSpec acquisition, Simpson Strong-Tie further broadens its technological service portfolio offering builders a diversity of software choices to fit their individual business needs. \"LotSpec complements our 2017 acquisition of CG Visions by expanding our list of software choices to the residential builder market,\" says Simpson Strong-Tie President of North American Sales Roger Dankel. \"This strategy continues to strengthen our value proposition of being the industry's trusted partner in construction solutions and building systems.\"\nAbout Simpson Strong-Tie Company Inc.\nFor more than 60 years, Simpson Strong-Tie has dedicated itself to creating structural products that help people build safer, stronger homes and buildings.
