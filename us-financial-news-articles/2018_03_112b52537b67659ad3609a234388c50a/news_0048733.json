She’s been my favourite player for forever and this is just a special moment I’m trying to wrap my head around it.” \nThe 24-year-old is finally finding her feet at the highest level, as she showed by keeping the pressure on Williams with victory in sight. \n“She’s been in a lot of situations where she’s been down and come back. I knew I was going to really have to work for it and she wasn’t going to give it to me,” Collins said of the 37-year-old seven-times grand slam champion. \n“I’m just starting to finally put all of the pieces together.” \nEarlier, sixth seed Ostapenko was far from her best in her quarter-final, spraying the court with 44 unforced errors and having her serve broken six times on a windy day. \nYet the 20-year-old’s aggressive approach, stepping into the court to take Svitolina’s second serves early and targeting the lines with her powerful backhand, paid off in the match’s biggest moments. \nAfter Svitolina saved three consecutive match points in the second set tiebreak, Ostapenko hammered her 41st winner, a crosscourt backhand, on match point to end the nearly two hour contest. \nOstapenko said she followed coach David Taylor’s advice to stay on the attack against the defensive-minded Svitolina even when she was having trouble with her accuracy. \n“When David came on the court he was telling me to keep playing aggressive, to go for the shots,” Ostapenko said on court. \n“Even if you are missing you have to play aggressive,” she said. \n“I’m just trying to fight for every point and be more consistent and I think I’m getting there in my form.” \nOstapenko has now won both of her meetings against Svitolina, included a victory over the 23-year-old at Wimbledon last year.
