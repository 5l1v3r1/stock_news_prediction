The winter restrictions are due to be lifted on March 15.\nOther nonferrous metals such as copper and nickel have also attracted speculative bets on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, but aluminum featured most prominently in the MIIT statement.\nThe metal was listed as a priority for 2018, including implementing China’s aluminum smelting capacity replacement scheme, via the transfer of quotas and mergers and acquisitions, and speeding up the elimination of inefficient capacity.\nChina has been shuttering aluminum smelting capacity as part of supply-side reforms, and the MIIT said in January that Chinese aluminum firms that were entitled to replace capacity closed over the past seven years must do so by the end of 2018.\nThe ministry’s other priorities for this year included promoting international cooperation and the development and application of new nonferrous metal materials.\nReporting by Tom Daly; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:48:58.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
