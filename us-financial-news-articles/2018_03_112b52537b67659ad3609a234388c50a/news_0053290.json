She remains in temporary custody.\nUnder the French legal system, being “placed under investigation” is a step judicial investigators can take if they have serious grounds for suspecting an offence. It often but not always leads to trial.\nLadkim was shot dead by security forces at the scene.\nReporting by Emmanuel Jarry; writing by Michel Rose; editing by John Irish and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:21:14.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
