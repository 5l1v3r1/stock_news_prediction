But a lawsuit filed on Feb. 11 by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman complicated the negotiations. The company had said on Monday it planned to file for bankruptcy.\nThe Weinstein Company suffered a major blow after more than 70 women accused founder Harvey Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.\nThe studio, launched in October 2005, produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including \"The King's Speech\" and \"Silver Linings Playbook.\" Weinstein was known as the leading tastemaker for independent film and a master at Academy Awards campaigns.\nWhen the allegations against Weinstein became public, the company's board fired him, and Hollywood heavyweights distanced themselves from the studio.\nSince then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement has emerged of victims using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.\nIn her statement, Contreras-Sweet thanked Schneiderman's office for helping the parties reach an agreement. Schneiderman's office did not respond to a request for comment.
