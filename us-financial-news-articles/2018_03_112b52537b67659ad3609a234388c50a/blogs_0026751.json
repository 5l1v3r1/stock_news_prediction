Of the 11 sectors that make up the S&P, Gordon points out that only the tech sector has broken above its Jan. 26 highs. \n\"Technology is doing the heavy lifting here. It's doing a great job, but unfortunately I don't think it's enough,\" he added. \nIn other words, it could be a while before the market returns to its highs. \nAs a result, Gordon wants to position for a move in the S&P 500 using options. Specifically, he is selling the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) April 16 weekly 275-strike call and buying the April 16 weekly 280-strike call for a $2.75 credit, or $275 per options spread. If SPY closes below $275 on April 16 expiration, then Gordon would make the $275 on the trade. But if SPY were to rally and close above $280 on the expiration date, Gordon could lose $225. \n\"We are starting to hesitate at that last retracement level, which [tends to precede a lot of reversals],\" he said. \"So we're starting to get a bit of a double top at around the $280 region here in the SPY, and it looks like we might be heading lower.\" \nThe SPY was trading just above $275 on Wednesday as all three major market indexes gave up their gains from the morning open.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T21:37:48.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
