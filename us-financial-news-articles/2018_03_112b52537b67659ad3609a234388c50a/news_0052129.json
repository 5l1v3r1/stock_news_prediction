That is the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2013.\nSales of co-ops, which include many lower-priced apartments, fell only slightly, by 2.3%, but sales of new condominiums were down by more than 35%.\nSome of the decline in closings of new condominium sales reflect the vagaries of construction schedules. But brokers said it also follows a slump in the pace of contract signings—especially on new high-end developments—that continued for much of 2017.\nLast year, many market analysts attributed the slowdown to uncertainty over governance in Washington, concerns about potential conflicts around the world or worries about changes to federal tax laws. More recently, they said, many sellers of individual apartments have made deep cuts in asking prices, in order to make deals in a less favorable environment.\nDevelopers, however, faced constraints from lenders and equity partners, and are slower to cut prices on new apartments, Ms. Olshan said.\nMedian prices of the apartments that sold fell slightly, by 1.5%, from the same quarter in 2017. But average prices dropped by 10% in the same period.\nThe Journal’s analysis, based on sale documents filed with the city’s Department of Finance as of March 23, put the median price of a Manhattan apartment at $1.095 million, about 8% below the all-time peak price recorded in the second quarter last year.\nThe median price for a condominium in the first quarter was $1.625 million, down 4.6% from the year-earlier quarter. The median price of a co-op was $810,000, up 7.3% during the same period. Sales of co-ops above $4 million rose by more than 30%, while sales below $1 million were down 7.4%.\nPamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group , said these numbers show there is plenty of activity in the market, but only if sellers price their properties properly. “We have plenty of good stories where there are still bidding wars and stories where things don’t sell because they are just overpriced,” Ms. Liebman said.\n“Buyers are much more aggressive, and in a lot of circumstances they are getting what they want,” she added. “The good news is there are a lot of buyers, and they have plenty of cash and are ready to make deals.”\nMany sales that closed during the first quarter were negotiated last year, but there are some signs that weakness is continuing.\nThe number of contracts signed on Manhattan properties priced at $4 million or more fell 15% in the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2017, according to data compiled by Ms. Olshan. Many of those won’t close for months. Ms. Olshan found the average price drop on these properties was 10% from the original asking price.\nThe top sale in the first quarter to date—a red-brick-and-limestone mansion on East 69th Street near Central Park—illustrates this pattern of price cutting. The house sold for $39 million in mid-March. It was listed for as much as $55 million in 2016, before several price cuts. It had previously sold for $48 million in 2011.\nSales inventory is also increasing. A new report by Brown Harris Stevens found that inventory in Manhattan is up 14% in March, compared with a year earlier. The biggest increase in supply is among studio and one-bedroom apartments.\nGregory Heym, the chief economist at brokerages Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said some sellers already have made cuts in asking prices that won’t be reflected until sales in future quarters. He said fears over the effects of federal tax changes, which could raise the burden of property taxes for some New York buyers, had convinced some sellers to cut prices.\n“You are seeing a continuation in price reductions,” said Leonard Steinberg, the president of brokerage Compass. He said when property isn’t moving, “sellers will want to acknowledge that, if they want to sell in less than 500 days.”\nYet, Mr. Steinberg said, sales in some neighborhoods remain strong, particularly in choice downtown areas. With the average Wall Street bonus reaching the highest level since before the financial crisis of 2008, some markets could strengthen even more this spring, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:05:13.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
