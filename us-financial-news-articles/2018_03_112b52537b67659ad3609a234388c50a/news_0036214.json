(CTZ – TSX-V) today reports the results of operations for the first three months of fiscal 2018, ended January 31 st . All amounts referenced herein are in Canadian dollars.\nRevenue for the first three months of fiscal 2018 was $742,488 as compared to $691,256 for the same period last year. Income before Income Tax, a key metric in gauging business performance, was $285,360 ($0.01 per share), as compared to $288,913 ($0.01 per share) in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company is not presently fully taxable due to loss carry forwards and Federal tax credits from previous years. It is noteworthy that the loss in foreign exchange, over which the Company has no control, was $53,833 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to $47,906 for the same period last year. The loss recorded for foreign exchange is largely a result of IFRS requirements to value foreign currency receivables at each quarter end, which will be collected in the next quarter and revalued based upon the $Cdn. exchange rate at that time. Comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2018 was $211,360 ($0.01 per share) compared to $211,794 ($0.01 per share) for the comparable period in 2017.\nThe Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nK.
