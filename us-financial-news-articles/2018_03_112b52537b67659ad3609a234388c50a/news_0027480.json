You kept the office open during the first two days of March Madness.\nWhat happened? We talk about this every year. Nobody wants to work during the opening Thursday and Friday of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. Nobody actually does work during the opening Thursday and Friday of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament.\nThey pretend to work, but trust me: they’re not doing a #@&! thing.\nLook over there, at your No. 2. Loyal, smart, tireless. A colleague you can trust. A colleague you can send an email to at 10 p.m. on a weekend—and get a response within 90 seconds.\nYou’re not even sure if your No. 2 has a family. Or a refrigerator.\nDo you think your No. 2 is working right now? Nope. They’re watching Penn-Kansas. And Duke-Iona. Sorry.\nMore by Jason Gay\nWhy No. 16 Penn Can Knock Off No. 1 Kansas March 14, 2018 The NCAA Tournament’s Most Valuable Plays: Purdue and Cincinnati March 13, 2018 Why No. 1 Virginia’s Plodding Pace Makes It Ripe for an Upset March 13, 2018 WSJ’s Madness Machine Can Fill Out Your Bracket March 12, 2018 Breaking Down the NCAA Tournament March 12, 2018 Oh, and your No. 3 called in sick. Breaking news: Your No. 3 is NOT SICK. Your No. 3 is in pajamas, and just ordered 75 Buffalo wings.\nSame goes for your CIO. Your CIO actually has a set-up in the office to watch every March Madness game simultaneously. That’s why they’re the CIO. It’s kind of impressive, actually.\nWhat about the CFO? Oh, that’s right: your CFO went to Villanova. Yeah, forget about the CFO. They’re actually at the tournament. (And they’re expensing it under “miscellaneous.”)\nAttendance did seem pretty light at the 10:30 staff meeting, didn’t it?\nWhere is everybody today? you asked. Somebody snickered.\nWalk over to any one of your employees sitting at their desks. Note how quickly their screen flashes and changes.\nYup, just looking at this spreadsheet, they say.\nThey were not looking at the spreadsheet. They were looking at Oklahoma-Rhode Island.\nTar Heels fans are ready for March Madness. Photo: Tom Pennington/Getty Images Why can’t you realize this? You’re supposed to be the CEO who “gets it.” You installed that ping-pong table. You changed the coffee in the coffee machines. You took everyone to the beach for an ideas meeting and danced to that Drake song.\nWhy don’t you understand that the first two days of March Madness are the two most unproductive days on the calendar?\nDon’t believe me? Call one of the folks in IT. Ask them if they can tell you how many people in the office are streaming basketball on their company computers right now.\nBetter yet, don’t. That’s creepy. And you don’t want to know.\nDon’t bother going down to HR to ask what the deal is, either. The entire HR department has disappeared.\nYour Thursday lunch just canceled. And your Friday lunch canceled, too.\nDid you really call a board meeting for Friday afternoon? Do you know that half of your board went to North Carolina?\nYou’re really trying to get yourself canned, aren’t you?\nWilbur, the Arizona mascot, and the Arizona cheerleaders during the Pac-12 tournament. Photo: Chris Williams/Zuma Press You’re starting to get a little sad. You knew CEO would be a lonely job. But once again, nobody asked you to join the office March Madness pool.\nWhy do they not let me play in the office pool? you think. I gave up my nice office and went open plan, just to show I was one of them. I sit in a stupid cube! I buy pizza on Fridays!\nYou call your CEO friends.\nYeah, nobody’s doing anything, one says.\nIt’s like New Year’s Day in here, says the other.\nYou call your “management guru,” the one you met at that conference in Big Sur last year.\nYeah, I’m watching Ohio State-San Diego State, your management guru says. Can I call you back?\nYou look at your copy of The Wall Street Journal. Even the Journal is going nuts for the tournament! You turn on cable news.\nELON MUSK: I’M WATCHING MARCH MADNESS ON MARS RIGHT NOW.\nYou sigh. You admit defeat. Nothing’s getting done the rest of this week. You may as well go downstairs to the neighborhood bar and get a beer.\nThe March Madness web site has a \"boss button.\" One click replaces the game with a fake screenshot of a search engine, spreadsheet or PowerPoint-like app. Photo: Associated Press You walk into the bar. Oh here’s the 10:30 staff meeting! And your No. 2 and No. 3. And everybody from IT and HR.\nThey see you, and get nervous. They’re worried you’re about to fire them.\nRelax. I’m not firing anybody, you say.\nYou join everyone and watch the basketball. You order wings. They let you join the office pool, late. They laugh a lot of your picks.\nIt’s OK. This is really fun. You’re one of them now.\nDon’t make the same mistake next year.\nYour pal,\nJason\nP.S. Please don’t fire me.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-4081?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4077?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4077?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4078?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4077?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4077?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4078?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4078?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4078?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4081?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4081?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4078?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4077?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4081?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4081?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4077?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4081?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-4078?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-03-15T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T22:42:15.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
