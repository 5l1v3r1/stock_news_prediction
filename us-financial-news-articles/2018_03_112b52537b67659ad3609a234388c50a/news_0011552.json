Adjusted EBITDA increased 42.2% from 4,455 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2016 to 6,334 kEUR. Net profit was 1,528 kEUR, or 0.03 EUR per diluted share, compared to 628 kEUR, or 0.01 EUR per diluted share, over the same period last year.\nIntroduction\nExecutive Chairman Peter Leys commented, “2017 has been a good year for Materialise. Organically, our annual revenues grew by 16% to 132,600 kEUR and our Adjusted EBITDA grew by 38% to 13,100 kEUR, both at the high end of the range we forecasted at the beginning of the year. Importantly, our software revenues (including from our Materialise Medical segment) grew 18% year over year and our end part-related revenues (from our Materialise Manufacturing and Materialise Medical segments) grew 21%, underscoring the successful execution of our strategy of rolling out our software and services backbone, with a particular focus on end part manufacturing. Even more significant, 2017 was the year in which ACTech joined Materialise. This acquisition enabled us to post even more impressive growth rates of 24.5% in revenues and 60% in Adjusted EBITDA, and, more importantly, positions us exceptionally well in the promising market of unique complex metal parts.”\nACTech Acquisition\nOn October 4, 2017, we acquired ACTech, a full-service manufacturer of complex metal parts. As described in more detail below, the acquisition increased the scope of our Materialise Manufacturing segment's operations and had a significant impact on our results of operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in increases to our revenues and operating expenses, among other items.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 42.1% to 44,733 kEUR compared to 31,477 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, revenue increased 10.5% to 34,768 kEUR. Total deferred revenue from annual software sales and maintenance contracts amounted to 18,723 kEUR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 compared 16,799 kEUR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA, which in the fourth quarter of 2017 excluded 343 kEUR of expenses related to the ACTech acquisition, increased to 6,334 kEUR from 4,455 kEUR, primarily as a result of the revenue contributed by ACTech. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, Adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly to 4,263 kEUR. The Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 14.2% (12.3% excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition) compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenue from our Materialise Software segment increased 29.6% to 10,468 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 8,078 kEUR for the same quarter last year, boosted by original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) sales growth of 46.7%. Segment EBITDA increased to 4,619 kEUR from 2,949 kEUR while the segment EBITDA margin was 44.1% compared to 36.5% in the prior-year period.\nRevenue from our Materialise Medical segment increased 17.7% to 11,842 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 10,061 kEUR for the same period in 2016. Compared to the same quarter in 2016, revenues from our medical software grew 9.9%, and revenues from medical devices and services grew 22.9%. Segment EBITDA was 2,158 kEUR compared to 656 kEUR while the segment EBITDA margin increased to 18.2% from 6.5 % in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenue from our Materialise Manufacturing segment increased 68.0% to 22,394 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 13,326 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment EBITDA increased to 1,905 kEUR from 1,438 kEUR while the segment EBITDA margin decreased to 8.5% from 10.8% for the same quarter in 2016. In particular, ACTech contributed revenue of 9,965 kEUR and segment EBITDA of 2,071 kEUR (and segment EBITDA margin of 20.8%). Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, revenue decreased 6.7% to 12,429 kEUR, and segment EBITDA decreased to (166) kEUR.\nGross profit was 24,048 kEUR, or 53.8% of total revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, gross profit was 21,421 kEUR, or 61.6% of total revenue, compared to 18,619 kEUR, or 59.2% of total revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nResearch and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”) and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses increased, in the aggregate, 32.8% to 24,553 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 18,483 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, operating expenses increased, in the aggregate, 19.1% to 22,017 kEUR. R&D expenses increased from 4,161 kEUR to 5,535 kEUR while S&M expenses increased from 9,506 kEUR to 9,711 kEUR, and G&A expenses increased from 4,816 kEUR to 6,771 kEUR, primarily representing non-recurring expenses, including 343 kEUR related to the acquisition of ACTech.\nNet other operating income increased by 192 kEUR to 1,971 kEUR compared to 1,779 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, net other operating income decreased by 193 kEUR. Net other operating income consists primarily of withholding tax exemptions for qualifying researchers, development grants, partial funding of R&D projects and currency exchange results on purchase and sales transactions.\nOperating result decreased to 1,466 kEUR from 1,915 kEUR for the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, operating result amounted to 990 kEUR. This decrease was the result of the 19.1% increase in operating expenses, which was offset in part by the 15.0% increase in gross profit. The operating result was also negatively affected by depreciation expenses, which increased to 4,488 kEUR (2,894 kEUR excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition) from 2,280 kEUR for the fourth quarter of 2016, and by 343 kEUR of expenses related to the acquisition of ACTech.\nNet financial result was (356) kEUR compared to 253 kEUR for the prior-year period. The financial result included (269) kEUR net financial expenses related to ACTech. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, the variances primarily reflected increases in interest expense on the company's financial debt and variances in the currency exchange rates, primarily on the portion of the company’s IPO proceeds held in U.S. dollars versus the euro.\nNet profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1,528 kEUR (1,253 kEUR excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition) compared to net profit of 620 kEUR for the same period in 2016. The decrease in operating profit of 449 kEUR was offset by an increase of 777 kEUR in the company’s share in the result of a joint venture, and an increase of 1,189 kEUR in income tax. Total comprehensive income for the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, was 1,319 kEUR compared to 685 kEUR for the same period in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had cash and equivalents of 43,175 kEUR compared to 55,912 kEUR at December 31, 2016. Cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 7,368 kEUR compared to 4,180 kEUR in the same period in 2016.\nNet shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2017 was 77,515 kEUR compared to 79,033 kEUR at December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 24.5% to 142,573 kEUR compared to 114,477 kEUR for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, revenues increased 15.8% to 132,608 kEUR. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 15,138 kEUR, an increase of 60.1% compared to 9,458 kEUR for the year ended December 31, 2016 (an increase of 38.2% to 13,067 kEUR excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition). The Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 10.6% (9.9% excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition) for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily the result of the combination of a 24.5% revenue growth (of which 8.7% was from ACTech), a 17.7% improvement in gross profit (of which 3.9% was from ACTech) and an increase of 14.5% (of which 3.4% was from ACTech) in operational costs in R&D, S&M and G&A, and a decrease in net other operating income of 581 kEUR.\nRevenues from our Materialise Software segment increased 18.8% to 35,770 kEUR for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 30,122 kEUR for the year ended December 31, 2016. This growth was driven by a 23.8% increase in OEM sales and 15.1% increase in recurrent revenues from annual and renewed licenses and maintenance fees. The segment EBITDA margin was 38.9% in 2017, compared to 33.6% in 2016.\nRevenues from our Materialise Medical segment grew by 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 42,841 kEUR from 37,910 kEUR for the year ended December 31, 2016. Medical software growth was 16.5%, and revenues from medical devices and services increased 11.1%. The segment EBITDA margin increased to 10.3% from 2.4%, primarily as a result of the combination of revenue growth and limited increases in operating expenses, as well as increased other operating income.\nRevenues from our Materialise Manufacturing segment increased 37.3% to 63,712 kEUR (15.8% to 53,747 kEUR excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition) for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 46,406 kEUR for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue from end parts increased by 34.4%. The segment EBITDA margin decreased from 8.3% in 2016 to 7.8% in 2017. Excluding the impact of the ACTech acquisition, the segment EBITDA margin decreased to 5.4%, primarily as a result of the lower gross margin and the increase in operating expenses.\nNet loss improved from (3,019) kEUR for 2016 to a net loss of (1,656) kEUR for 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nMr. Leys concluded, “The additive manufacturing market continues to evolve, particularly in the direction of end part production, and we intend to continue positioning Materialise to benefit from this promising growth market in the coming years. In 2018, we intend to give particular attention to the significant partnerships that we have entered into and to the strategic initiatives that we have launched over the previous years. Simultaneously, in 2018 we will continue to sustain our leadership position in software through continued innovation and strategic partnerships; to drive the next stage of growth in our medical segment, including by entering into partnerships and rolling out our software and planning backbone; and to continue increasing our manufacturing of complex and unique parts. We anticipate delivering sales and Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion in 2018 while reinvesting efficiency gains in selected business development initiatives.\n“For fiscal 2018, we expect to report consolidated revenue between 180,000 kEUR - 185,000 kEUR and Adjusted EBITDA between 22,000 kEUR - 25,000 kEUR. We expect our financial results to be particularly strong in the third quarter and even stronger in the fourth quarter. We expect the amount of deferred revenue that Materialise generates from annual licenses and maintenance in 2018 to increase by an amount between 2,000 kEUR – 4,000 kEUR.”\nNon-IFRS Measures\nMaterialise uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is determined by adding non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses of business combinations to EBITDA. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company's business, or the charges associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company's ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company's presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nExchange Rate\nThis press release contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.
