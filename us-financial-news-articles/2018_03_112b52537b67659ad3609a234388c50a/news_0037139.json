Here's Pew's breakdown of how much you have to earn each year to be considered upper-income, depending on the size of your family: \nHousehold of one : Minimum of $72,126 \nHousehold of two : Minimum of $102,001 \nHousehold of three : Minimum of $124,925 \nHousehold of four : Minimum of $144,251 \nHousehold of five : Minimum of $161,277 \nStill, just because you fit into those parameters doesn't necessarily mean you will feel upper-class. \nCourtney Mishoe and her husband are making more than $180,000 a year to support their five-person family. Still, the suburban Georgia couple doesn't \" feel wealthy ,\" Mishoe told Todd C. Frankel of the Washington Post. Some people living in the area who earn $100,000 \"are living paycheck to paycheck,\" the Post reports, and even families earning up to $250,000 \"don't consider themselves to be high-earners.\" \nThese situations illustrate how difficult it can be to avoid lifestyle creep and how a hefty paycheck doesn't always guarantee financial peace of mind. show chapters 9:15 AM ET Wed, 22 Feb 2017 | 00:55 \nPlus, where you live matters , since median income, as well as cost of living, can vary drastically by city.
