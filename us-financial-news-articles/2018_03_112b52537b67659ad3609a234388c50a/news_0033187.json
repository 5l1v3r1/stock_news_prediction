The plant, which is expected to open by 2021, will help increase its manufacturing capacity by up to 450,000 tons a year. The expansion is part of Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods’ plans to spend $50 billion in the United States over the next five years. A final decision on the investment, estimated at several hundred million dollars, is expected later this year, Exxon said. “Abundant supplies of domestically produced oil and natural gas have reduced energy costs and created new sources of feedstock for U.S. chemical manufacturing,” ExxonMobil Chemical Co President John Verity said. “Most of our planned investment in the Gulf Coast region is focused on supplying emerging markets like Asia.” The potential project will create more than 600 jobs during peak construction and about 60 permanent jobs when production begins, the company said.
