The good news is we’re now taking action,” said U.N. Special Envoy for the Ocean Peter Thomson.\n“At the moment, we’re not winning, but the battle’s on,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the conference.\nHEALTH THREAT Developing the so-called “blue economy” could lure capital into bonds and other financial instruments designed to help protect the oceans, but people could make a difference simply by cutting their use of plastic which is contributing to contamination, said Thomson.\nBlockchain technology could help some consumers scan the fish they buy, like tuna, to see where it comes from, while greater use of satellite technology could boost monitoring and crack down on illegal fishing in protected areas, said Sukhdev.\nUncontrolled plastic pollution now risks developing into a “very severe” health issue with tiny particles turning up in the fish that ends up on people’s plates, he warned.\nWhile close to 200 countries signed up to a U.N. proposal in December to stop plastic pollution, an estimated 8 billion tonnes of plastic washes into the ocean each year to join the 5 trillion pieces of plastic thought to be already floating around the world.\nStronger public pressure will eventually start to force companies and governments to take action, said Sukhdev.\n“No amount of effort spent in getting these messages created, packaged and presented to people so they can themselves push for the right answer... is a bad idea,” he added.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.
