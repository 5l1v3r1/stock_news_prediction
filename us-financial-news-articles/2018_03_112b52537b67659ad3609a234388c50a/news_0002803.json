Prosecutors agreed to dismiss his case if he got treatment for a year and stayed out of trouble.\nReinstating Crumpacker was \"so off brand,\" said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at San Francisco's Golden Gate University.\n\"Crumpacker may have to be replaced,\" said Ivan Feinseth, who oversees investment strategy and research at Tigress Financial Partners in New York City. Tigress funds do not own Chipotle shares, but Feinseth said he is looking to buy on a dip.\nThe Denver-based Chipotle has been remotely managed since the December 2016 departure of co-CEO Monty Moran. Niccol will be based at headquarters, Arnold said.\nSteve Ells, Chipotle's founder, chairman and outgoing CEO, and Crumpacker work from Manhattan. Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung is based in Chicago.\n\"If you're going to build a team, the team has got to be there,\" Feinseth said.\n\"That's something they can look into. That's low-hanging fruit,\" Blechman said.
