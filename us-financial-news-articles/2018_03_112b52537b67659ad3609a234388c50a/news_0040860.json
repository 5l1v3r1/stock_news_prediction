China can also set itself against the US in international organizations such as the UN,\" it said.\n\"The mainland must also prepare itself for a direct military clash in the Taiwan Straits. It needs to make clear that escalation of U.S.-Taiwan official exchanges will bring serious consequences to Taiwan,\" said the paper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.\n\"This newspaper has suggested that the mainland can send military planes and warships across the Taiwan Straits middle line. This can be implemented gradually depending on the cross-Straits situation,\" it said.\nThe island is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint. Underlining that threat, Taiwan sent ships and an aircraft earlier on Wednesday to shadow a Chinese aircraft carrier group through the narrow Taiwan Strait, its defense ministry said.\nÂ© REUTERS/Pichi Chuang FILE PHOTO: Members of the National Security Bureau take part in a drill at its headquarters in Taipei The Global Times said it was a misunderstanding to think that \"peaceful unification\" would be a harmonious, happy process.\n\"Sticks matter more than flowers on the path to peaceful reunification,\" it said.\nChina's hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.\nChina suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Paul Tait)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T08:07:13.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
