(Nasdaq:KCAP) (“KCAP” or the “Company”) announces its full year 2017 financial results.\nFinancial Highlights\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $11.0 million, or $0.30 per basic share, compared with $18.5 million, $0.50 per basic share in 2016.\nTaxable distributable income for the year was $0.16 per basic share.\nKCAP declared a fourth quarter shareholder distribution of $0.10 per share.\nAt December 31, 2017, the fair value of KCAP's investments totaled approximately $312.0 million.\nNet asset value per share of $4.87 as of December 31, 2017, compared with $5.24 at December 31, 2016.\nDayl Pearson, President and Chief Executive Officer of KCAP Financial, Inc., noted, \"We had a busy year in 2017 including taking action to significantly reduce leverage, adding dry powder to our balance sheet for new investments and increasing our middle market assets under management through our Joint Venture. At the same time, our Asset Manager Affiliates extended the life and increased the size of two managed CLOs and reduced the cost of capital of three managed CLOs. Business development efforts continued into 2018 as we recently closed a $50 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders.”\nOperating Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported total investment income of approximately $28.3 million as compared to approximately $36.2 million in the prior year, a decrease of 22%. Investment income from debt securities decreased 27% to approximately $15.1 million from approximately $20.8 million. Investment income from investments in CLO fund securities in 2017 decreased 16% to $11.2 million from $13.3 million in 2016, and dividends from our Asset Manager Affiliates decreased 67% from $1.4 million to $460,000.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total expenses were lower by approximately $465,000 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense related to the lower average outstanding principal balance on our borrowings during 2017.\nNet investment income for the years ended 2017 and 2016 was approximately $11.0 million and $18.5 million, or $0.30 and $0.50 per share, respectively. Net realized and unrealized depreciation on investments for the year ended 2017 was approximately $3.5 million, compared to net realized and unrealized depreciation on investments of $19.4 million for the same period in 2016.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nThe fair value of our portfolio was approximately $312.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The composition of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, at cost and fair value, was as follows:\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Security Type Cost/Amortized Cost Fair Value %¹ Cost/Amortized Cost Fair Value %¹ Short-term investments² $ 77,300,320 $ 77,300,320 26 $ 28,699,269 $ 28,699,269 8 % Senior Secured Loan 48,337,900 44,960,146 14 207,701,078 200,322,152 55 Junior Secured Loan 62,561,913 58,941,300 19 37,251,776 35,444,440 10 Senior Unsecured Loan 12,777,283 12,777,283 4 — — — First Lien Bond — — — 3,060,919 1,089,338 — Senior Secured Bond 1,502,374 1,518,750 — 1,506,461 1,487,400 — CLO Fund Securities 72,339,032 51,678,673 17 76,851,317 54,174,350 15 Equity Securities 10,571,007 4,414,684 1 10,389,007 5,056,355 1 Asset Manager Affiliates³ 52,591,230 38,849,000 12 55,341,230 40,198,000 11 Joint Venture 24,914,858 21,516,000 7 — — — Total $ 362,895,917 $ 311,956,156 100 % $ 420,801,057 $ 366,471,304 100 % ¹ Represents percentage of total portfolio at fair value. ² Includes money market accounts and U.S. treasury bills. ³ Represents the equity investment in the Asset Manager Affiliates.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $104.4 million of borrowings outstanding ($101.4 million net of discount) with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.4%.\nDistributions\nGenerally, we seek to fund distributions to shareholders from current distributable earnings, primarily from net interest and dividend income generated by our investment portfolio and any distributions from our Asset Manager Affiliates, which include Trimaran Advisors, L.L.C. and Katonah Debt Advisors, L.L.C.. However, a portion of distributions paid to shareholders may be a return of capital. We announced a regular quarterly distribution of $0.10 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The record date for this distribution was January 5, 2018 and the distribution was paid on January 25, 2018. Tax characteristics of all distributions paid by us in 2017 have been reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year.\nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of distributions in shares of our common stock, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if we declare a cash distribution, shareholders who have not \"opted out\" of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash. Please contact your broker or other financial intermediary for more information regarding the dividend reinvestment plan.\nConference Call and Webcast\nWe will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss our full year 2017 financial results.
