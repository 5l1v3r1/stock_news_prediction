The bank had forecast 3 percent growth for the first quarter.\nMcCall, who headed newspaper publishing group Guardian Media Group before joining easyJet, said ITV had to do a better job of selling broadcast television to advertisers.\nShows such as “I‘m a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here,” which reached more 16-34 years olds than any other last year, delivered the mass audiences brands wanted and the company could do more targeted advertising online, she said.\nITV reported a 5 percent drop in adjusted full-year earnings of 842 million pounds ($1.17 billion) on Wednesday, broadly in line with forecasts, while total external revenue was up 2 percent to 3.13 billion pounds.\nIt will pay a final dividend of 5.28 pence, taking its full-year payment up 8 percent to 7.8 pence.\n$1 = 0.7194 pounds Reporting by Paul Sandle Editing by Elisabeth O'Leary and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:13:54.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
