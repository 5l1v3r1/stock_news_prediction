Those rights need to be extended to all Australians, including those of Cambodian descent.”\nHun Sen has frequently said he wants to remain in power for at least another decade. The dissolution of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party eliminated a major obstacle to his re-election ahead of the July election.\nEditing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T09:48:02.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
