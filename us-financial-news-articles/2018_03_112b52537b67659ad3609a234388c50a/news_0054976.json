REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo \nFailure to meet the deadline gives Toshiba the option of walking away from the sale of the world’s No. 2 producer of NAND chips without penalty - a move that some investors have urged it to consider. \nBut the company said in a statement that it still plans to sell the unit, aiming to finalize the deal as soon as possible. \nToshiba agreed last year to sell the chip unit to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital to cover liabilities arising from its bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. \nBut the conglomerate no longer needs the funds as much, having raised $5.4 billion from a share issue to foreign investors late last year. \nSome activist shareholders oppose the sale, saying the $18 billion price tag undervalues the business and that Toshiba should renegotiate with the Bain group or consider an initial public offering. \nThe chip business currently accounts for most of the company’s profit, and Toshiba is struggling to grow other core businesses such as social infrastructure. \nUnder the deal, it plans to repurchase 40 percent of the chip unit.
