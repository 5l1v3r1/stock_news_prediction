Michelle Berrey.\n\nMore from Triangle Business Journal: \nHere's what N.C. has to lose by Trump's proposed tariffs against China \nWhy one economist says N.C. could lose Amazon – and still win\nHow these N.C. companies are scoring big as Major League Baseball looks to protect fans \nIn fact, data presented by Chimerix at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation in Lisbon, Portugal, showed that one in three pediatric stem cell transplant recipients in a recent study developed an adenovirus infection within six months of transplant. The data also showed that there was a \"greater than ten-fold risk of mortality\" in those recipients with the highest levels of the virus.\nThe goal with brincidofovir is to \"decrease the amount of virus in the blood very quickly,\" says Berrey.\nChimerix started setting up the first sites for the clinical trial in December, she says, and will continue enrolling to 30 to 35 sites in the U.S. and Europe for the next couple of months. The company expects to see data from the 140-patient trial in the second half of next year, and the program could ultimately lead to the company's first approval of a drug for clinical use.\nAside from brincidofovir, Chimerix is also developing the drug for the treatment of human herpesviruses and smallpox in animals. Chimerix is also developing another candidate for the treatment and prevention of norovirus.\nThe company currently employs 80 people in Durham, and a team of three people in Europe, which it is looking to build out further in the near future as it believes its first launch will be in Europe, closely followed by the U.S., according to Berrey.", "external_links": ["https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2018/03/23/heres-what-n-c-has-to-lose-by-trumps-proposed.html", "https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2018/03/23/how-thesen-c-companies-are-scoring-big-as-major.html", "https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2018/03/22/why-one-economist-says-n-c-could-lose-amazon-and.html"], "published": "2018-03-23T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T06:23:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
