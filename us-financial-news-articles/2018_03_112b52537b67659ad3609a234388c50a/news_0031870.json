Ripple, ethereum, bitcoin and litecoin were all down in the last week as a result of selloffs. \n\"It's probably a concern for the industry,\" Blockchain Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Patrick Moynihan told CNBC in Puerto Rico. \nBitcoin , the popular digital currency that reached highs around $19,500 last December, fell below $8,000 this week. \nCNBC's Seema Mody contributed to this article.
