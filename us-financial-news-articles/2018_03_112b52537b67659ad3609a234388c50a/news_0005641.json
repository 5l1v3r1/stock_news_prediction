Other funds involved are GoldenTree and Centaurus. In addition Austrian bank Bawag is also contributing.\nThe transaction will also see the bank’s non-performing loan portfolio, principally shipping-related, sold to a special purpose vehicle set up by Cerberus, JC Flowers, GoldenTree and Centaurus at a price below its current book value.\nThat will incur a charge expected to lead to a “mid-three-digit” million euro pre-tax loss for the 2017 financial year to December 31. The implication is the changes will make the bank unable to meet all its obligations to creditors, leading to the planned liability management exercise.\nAt the beginning of the sales process a group of bondholders offered to swap their notes for equity in the Landesbank. They held more than €700m (in principal value) of Tier 1 instruments, or roughly a third of the €2.1bn of such instruments in issue.\nOne instrument, a €500m perpetual FRN callable in 2018, was down by 7% on a cash basis to 39.66 cents in the euro by 2:30pm in London.\n“If we assume a loss in the €1bn area, we think the T1 instruments would be written down to 40-cent area under GAAP and in the low 70s under IFRS,” wrote credit analysts at BNP Paribas.\n“With the exception of the HSHN 7.25%, the other bonds could be called at the new written down amount. We view an LME in the mid 40-cent area as an effective way to take out the bonds and reduce litigation risk.”\nThe bondholder group is understood to be assessing the privatisation statement.\nUnder European Commission rules on state aid, the sale had to be announced by the end of February to prevent the bank from being wound down.\nThe states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein ended up taking control of the bank after problems emerged in its shipping loan portfolio during the financial crisis. JC Flowers, which used to own the bank, already has 5% of its equity.\nThe deal will also need to be approved by the two state parliaments and vetted by the EC.
