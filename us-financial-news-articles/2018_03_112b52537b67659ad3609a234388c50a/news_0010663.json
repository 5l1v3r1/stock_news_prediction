But with some deals being done at big earnings multiples, companies and their investors may find they haven’t spent wisely when the dust eventually settles.\nTo be sure, not all deals will get done: Comcast ’s bid for European pay TV giant, Sky, faces competition from Disney , while a private-equity backed bid for department store Nordstrom has been rebuffed by its board . International Paper’s bid Tuesday for Irish cardboard box giant Smurfit Kappa earned an initial rejection.\nThe U.S. corporate tax cuts and incentives for investment and repatriation of foreign cash are meant to help growth and wages, and many companies, from AT&T to WalMart , have announced pay increases for low-wage workers.\nHowever, the cost of these moves likely pales in comparison to the hundreds of billions being spent in the hunt for growth and higher returns. Mergers and acquisitions announced by U.S. acquirers so far in 2018 are running at the highest dollar volume since the first two months of 2000, according to Dealogic. Thomson Reuters, which publishes slightly different numbers, puts it at the highest since the start of 2007.\nA private-equity backed bid for department store Nordstrom has been rebuffed by its board Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press More than $325 billion worth of bids have been launched so far in 2018, according to Dealogic, with all-cash offers outstripping all-share offers by three-to-one in dollar terms, highlighting the continued availability of cheap debt as well as the income boost to come from tax cuts.\nDeals for growth at home also outnumber bids for overseas targets by more than three-to-one in dollar terms, which is also in line with recent trends.\nThis corporate shopping spree adds to the cash flowing back to investors via buybacks, which exceeded $200 billion in the three months to the end of February this year, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.\nWith the Federal Reserve expected to tighten monetary conditions only gradually and with companies and private-equity firms flush with cash and confidence, this M&A party looks likely to get bigger and louder before it ends.\nRelated Video Under the new tax law approved by Congress, the standard deduction is going up and the personal exemption is going away. But these changes won't be visible until your 2019 returns. WSJ's Richard Rubin explains the recipe behind the changes that are coming to your tax bill. Write to Paul J.
