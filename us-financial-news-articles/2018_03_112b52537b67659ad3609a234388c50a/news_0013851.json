(NYSE: LTC), a real estate investment trust that primarily invests in seniors housing and health care properties, today announced operating results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income available to common stockholders was $19.8 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with $20.6 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016. The decrease in net income available to common stockholders was primarily due to: a $1.2 million net loss on the sale of an assisted living community; donation of a skilled nursing center in the fourth quarter of 2017; higher interest expense resulting from the sale of $100.0 million senior unsecured notes in 2017; a reduction in rental income related to the properties sold in 2017; and a defaulted master lease that was placed on a cash basis during the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher income from unconsolidated joint ventures and mezzanine loans.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) was $30.4 million for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with $30.7 million for the comparable 2016 period. FFO per diluted common share was $0.77 and $0.78 for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in FFO and FFO per diluted common share was primarily due to the same factors that impacted net income available to common stockholders, except for the net loss on sale which is added back to FFO.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, LTC completed the following transactions:\nAcquired a newly constructed 73-unit assisted living and memory care community in Missouri for $16.6 million. The property was added to an existing master lease agreement at an initial annual lease rate of 7.0%. Entered into a partnership agreement with a 90% controlling interest to develop a 110-unit independent living, assisted living and memory care community in Wisconsin. The total estimated project cost, including the purchase of land, is $22.5 million. LTC anticipates entering into a 10-year lease agreement at an initial cash yield of 7.5% with a new operator. Entered into a partnership agreement with a 90% controlling interest to acquire an 87-unit assisted living and memory care community in South Carolina for $10.0 million. Simultaneously with the acquisition, LTC entered into a 10-year master lease agreement with a new operator at an initial cash yield of 7.25%. Completed the development of a 66-unit memory care community in Illinois which opened in December 2017. Sold a 36-unit closed assisted living community in Oregon for $1.4 million and recorded a net loss on sale of $70,000. Donated an 85-bed skilled nursing center located in Texas to a nonprofit health care provider organization. The net book value of this property was $1.2 million.\nConference Call Information\nLTC will conduct a conference call on Friday, March 2, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time), to provide commentary on its performance and operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Investors, analysts and the Company use FFO, AFFO and FAD as supplemental measures of operating performance. The Company believes FFO, AFFO and FAD are helpful in evaluating the operating performance of a REIT. Real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, but cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. We believe that by excluding the effect of historical cost depreciation, which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO, AFFO and FAD facilitate like comparisons of operating performance between periods. Additionally the Company believes that normalized FFO, normalized AFFO and normalized FAD provide useful information because they allow investors, analysts and our management to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items.\nFFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), means net income available to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on the sale of real estate and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized FFO represents FFO adjusted for certain items detailed in the reconciliations. The Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or have a different interpretation of the current NAREIT definition from that of the Company; therefore, caution should be exercised when comparing our Company’s FFO to that of other REITs.\nWe define AFFO as FFO excluding the effects of straight-line rent, amortization of lease inducement, effective interest income and deferred income from unconsolidated joint ventures. GAAP requires rental revenues related to non-contingent leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. This method results in rental income in the early years of a lease that is higher than actual cash received, creating a straight-line rent receivable asset included in our consolidated balance sheet. At some point during the lease, depending on its terms, cash rent payments exceed the straight-line rent which results in the straight-line rent receivable asset decreasing to zero over the remainder of the lease term. Effective interest method, as required by GAAP, is a technique for calculating the actual interest rate for the term of a mortgage loan based on the initial origination value. Similar to the accounting methodology of straight-line rent, the actual interest rate is higher than the stated interest rate in the early years of the mortgage loan thus creating an effective interest receivable asset included in the interest receivable line item in our consolidated balance sheet and reduces down to zero when, at some point during the mortgage loan, the stated interest rate is higher than the actual interest rate. By excluding the non-cash portion of rental income, interest income from mortgage loans and income from unconsolidated joint ventures, investors, analysts and our management can compare AFFO between periods. Normalized AFFO represents AFFO adjusted for certain items detailed in the reconciliations.\nWe define FAD as AFFO excluding the effects of non-cash compensation charges, capitalized interest and non-cash interest charges. FAD is useful in analyzing the portion of cash flow that is available for distribution to stockholders. Investors, analysts and the Company utilize FAD as an indicator of common dividend potential. The FAD payout ratio, which represents annual distributions to common shareholders expressed as a percentage of FAD, facilitates the comparison of dividend coverage between REITs. Normalized FAD represents FAD adjusted for certain items detailed in the reconciliations.\nWhile the Company uses FFO, Normalized FFO, AFFO, Normalized AFFO, FAD and Normalized FAD as supplemental performance measures of our cash flow generated by operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders, such measures are not representative of cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income available to common stockholders.\nReconciliation of FFO, AFFO and FAD\nThe following table reconciles GAAP net income available to common stockholders to each of NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders and normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders, as well as normalized AFFO and normalized FAD (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 30, December 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP net income available to common stockholders $ 19,753 $ 20,577 $ 86,978 $ 84,730 Add: Depreciation and amortization 9,424 9,309 37,610 35,932 Add: Impairment charges — 766 1,880 766 Loss (Gain) on sale of real estate, net 1,240 — (3,814 ) (3,582 ) NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders 30,417 30,652 122,654 117,846 Less: Non-cash rental income (2,804 ) (4,777 ) (8,485 ) (11,532 ) Less: Non-cash other income — — (842 ) — Less: Effective interest income from mortgage loans (1,398 ) (1,349 ) (5,500 ) (5,256 ) Less: Deferred income from unconsolidated joint ventures (36 ) — (177 ) — Adjusted FFO (AFFO) 26,179 24,526 107,650 101,058 Add: Non-cash compensation charges 1,282 1,131 5,249 4,280 Add: Non-cash interest related to earn-out liabilities 126 146 602 684 Less: Capitalized interest (281 ) (215 ) (908 ) (1,408 ) Funds available for distribution (FAD) $ 27,306 $ 25,588 $ 112,593 $ 104,614 NAREIT Basic FFO attributable to common stockholders per share $ 0.77 $ 0.78 $ 3.11 $ 3.07 NAREIT Diluted FFO attributable to common stockholders per share $ 0.77 $ 0.78 $ 3.10 $ 3.06 NAREIT Diluted FFO attributable to common stockholders $ 30,498 $ 30,741 $ 123,016 $ 118,231 Weighted average shares used to calculate NAREIT diluted FFO per share attributable to common stockholders 39,645 39,260 39,637 38,597 Diluted AFFO $ 26,260 $ 24,615 $ 108,012 $ 101,443 Weighted average shares used to calculate diluted AFFO per share 39,645 39,260 39,637 38,597 Diluted FAD $ 27,387 $ 25,677 $ 112,955 $ 104,999 Weighted average shares used to calculate diluted FAD per share 39,645 39,260 39,637 38,597 LTC PROPERTIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(amounts in thousands, except per share)\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ASSETS (audited) (audited) Investments: Land $ 124,041 $ 116,096 Buildings and improvements 1,262,335 1,185,467 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (304,117 ) (275,861 ) Operating real estate property, net 1,082,259 1,025,702 Properties held-for-sale, net of accumulated depreciation: 2017—$1,916; 2016—$0 3,830 — Real property investments, net 1,086,089 1,025,702 Mortgage loans receivable, net of loan loss reserve: 2017—$2,255; 2016—$2,315 223,907 229,801 Real estate investments, net 1,309,996 1,255,503 Notes receivable, net of loan loss reserve: 2017—$166; 2016—$166 16,402 16,427 Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 29,898 25,221 Investments, net 1,356,296 1,297,151 Other assets: Cash and cash equivalents 5,213 7,991 Debt issue costs related to bank borrowings 810 1,847 Interest receivable 15,050 9,683 Straight-line rent receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts: 2017—$814; 2016—$960 64,490 55,276 Prepaid expenses and other assets 23,711 22,948 Total assets $ 1,465,570 $ 1,394,896 LIABILITIES Bank borrowings $ 96,500 $ 107,100 Senior unsecured notes, net of debt issue costs: 2017—$1,131; 2016—$1,009 571,002 502,291 Accrued interest 5,276 4,675 Accrued incentives and earn-outs 8,916 12,229 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 25,228 28,553 Total liabilities 706,922 654,848 EQUITY Stockholders’ equity: Common stock: $0.01 par value; 60,000 shares authorized; shares issued and outstanding: 2017—39,570; 2016—39,221 396 392 Capital in excess of par value 856,992 839,005 Cumulative net income 1,100,783 1,013,443 Cumulative distributions (1,203,011 ) (1,112,792 ) Total LTC Properties, Inc. stockholders’ equity 755,160 740,048 Non-controlling interests 3,488 — Total equity 758,648 740,048 Total liabilities and equity $ 1,465,570 $ 1,394,896\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006313/en/\nLTC Properties, Inc.\nWendy L.
