The exchange has set aside $10 million for future bounties and is encouraging other platforms to do the same, it said.\nBinance disclosed last week that it had been the target of a “large-scale phishing and stealing attempt.” While the exchange said “all funds are safe,” Binance noted that it was unable to reverse some trades from accounts targeted by the hackers.\nAs prices of digital assets have soared, the platforms that trade them have become increasingly juicy targets for cyber thieves. Hackers stole tokens worth about $700 million from venues in Japan and Italy since the start of this year. The robberies have added pressure on both exchanges and regulators to do more to protect investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T08:15:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
