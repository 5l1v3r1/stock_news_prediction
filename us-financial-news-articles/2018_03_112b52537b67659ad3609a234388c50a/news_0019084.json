(Nasdaq: PLSE), a medical technology company developing a proprietary therapeutic tissue treatment based on its Nano-Pulse Stimulation platform, today announced that the Company will report fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and operational highlights on Friday, March 16th, 2018. Pulse Biosciences management will host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (PT).\nAnalysts and investors can participate in the conference call by dialing (844) 494-0190 (domestic) and (508) 637-5580 (international) using the conference ID# 1487908. The webcast of the conference call can be accessed live on the Investor Relations section of the Pulse Biosciences website, www.pulsebiosciences.com .\nAbout Pulse Biosciences\nPulse Biosciences is a medical technology company developing a therapeutic tissue treatment based on the Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS) platform, a proprietary cell signaling technology. NPS is a non-thermal, precise, focal, drug-free tissue treatment technology that directly affects the cell membrane and intracellular structures to stimulate unique behaviors in cells. NPS can initiate a cell death process that allows for the treatment of tissue cells with only a minimal inflammatory response, which improves healing outcomes and supports the replacement of treated tissue cells with healthy tissue cells. In cancerous lesions, NPS has been shown in preclinical models to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), which exposes the unique antigens of the treated cells to the immune system, results in the generation of cytotoxic T-cells and mounts an adaptive immune response. Pulse Biosciences is investigating a variety of applications for its technology that exploits the technologyâ€™s unique biologic effect, including immuno-oncology, dermatology, and veterinary medicine.
