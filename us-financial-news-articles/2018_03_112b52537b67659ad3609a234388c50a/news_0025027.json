(NASDAQ:ACRS), a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company committed to identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies to address significant unmet needs in aesthetic and medical dermatology, and immunology, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on its clinical development and commercial programs.\n“2017 was a defining year in Aclaris’ history, with the FDA approval of ESKATA™ (hydrogen peroxide) Topical Solution, 40% (w/w), the first and only FDA-approved topical, non-invasive treatment of raised seborrheic keratosis (SK). We have generated a high level of excitement around ESKATA in the dermatology community, and look forward to our official launch in the second quarter of 2018,” said Dr. Neal Walker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aclaris. “In January 2018, we announced positive topline results from two Phase 2 clinical trials (WART-202 and WART-203) of A-101 45% Topical Solution (A-101 45%) for the treatment of common warts (verruca vulgaris). We also advanced our topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor programs in alopecia, with results from multiple Phase 2 trials expected later this year. As our early-stage pipeline compounds advance towards the clinic, we continue to progress towards our goal of becoming a vertically integrated, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a robust clinical-stage pipeline and drug discovery engine.”\nClinical Pipeline Update\nA-101 45% Topical Solution\nIn January 2018, reported positive results from two Phase 2 clinical trials (WART-202 and WART-203) of A-101 45%, an investigational new drug for the treatment of common warts. A-101 45% met all primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints of each trial analyzed to date, achieving clinically and statistically significant clearance of common warts.\nScheduled an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA for mid-2018, and plan to initiate two pivotal Phase 3 trials in the second half of 2018.\nJAK Inhibitor\nAA-202 Topical – an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ATI-502 (formerly ATI-50002) for the topical treatment of alopecia areata (AA). This trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of ATI-502 compared with placebo in 12 patients with AA. This randomized, double-blind clinical trial is being conducted at two investigational centers within the United States, and topline data are expected in the first half of 2018. After completing the 28-day portion of the trial, patients will then enter a 6-month open label extension during which all patients will receive drug.\nAUATB-201 Topical – an ongoing Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of ATI-502 for the topical treatment of AA.

This trial will evaluate the effect of two concentrations of ATI-502 on the regrowth of hair in a randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trial in up to 120 patients with AA. This trial is being conducted at 25 investigational centers within the United States and data are expected by year end 2018.\nVITI-201 Topical – an ongoing Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of ATI-502 for the topical treatment of vitiligo. This trial will evaluate the effect of ATI-502 on the repigmentation of facial skin in up to 24 patients with vitiligo and data are expected in the first half of 2019.\nAGA-201 Topical – a planned Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of ATI-502 for the topical treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also known as male/female pattern hair loss, which is anticipated to begin in the first half of this year. This trial will evaluate the effect of ATI-502 on the regrowth of hair in up to 24 patients with AGA and data are expected in first half of 2019.\nAUAT-201 Oral – a planned Phase 2 dose ranging trial of ATI-501 (formerly ATI-50001), an oral JAK inhibitor, for the treatment of AA which is anticipated to begin in the first half of 2018.

The ‘301 Patent contains 67 claims and expires in November 2031.\nThis newly allowed patent is owned by The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York and exclusively licensed to Aclaris and is the latest U.S. patent to issue in connection with Aclaris' JAK drug development program for hair loss disorders.\nRecently added to the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NASDAQ:NBI).\nFinancial Highlights\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, Aclaris had aggregate cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $208.9 million compared to $174.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The $34.8 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 included:\nAggregate net proceeds of $100.2 million from the sale of common stock under an at-the-market facility with Cowen and Company LLC in April 2017 and a follow-on public offering of common stock in August 2017.\n$9.6 million of cash used to acquire Confluence in August 2017, net of cash acquired.\n$1.2 million of purchases of property and equipment.\nNet loss of $68.5 million, offset by $0.9 million of net cash provided by working capital and $14.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization.\nAclaris anticipates that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund its operations into the second half of 2019, without giving effect to any potential new business development transactions or financing activities.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet loss was $22.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $11.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Upon new tax legislation passed in December 2017, Aclaris recognized an income tax benefit of $1.8 million related to the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the In-Process Research and Development recognized in the Confluence acquisition earlier this year.\nRevenue of $1 million and cost of revenue of $0.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to our contract research business acquired in August 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $25.7 million, compared to $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses were $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $6.3 million was primarily attributable to a $2.3 million increase in expenses related to the WART-202 and WART-203 trials, a $1.5 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to increased headcount, a $2 million increase in preclinical and clinical trial development expenses related to the JAK inhibitor portfolio and a $1.5 million increase in Medical Affairs expenses and other costs, including early stage drug discovery. This increase was partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease due to the completion of our ESKATA Phase 3 clinical trials and the submission preparation of the NDA for ESKATA in November 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $12.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $7.8 million was primarily attributable to $2.9 million in higher personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to increased headcount, and a $1 million increase related to relocating our corporate headquarters and administrative costs related to our St. Louis, Missouri operations acquired in August 2017. Additionally, Aclaris incurred a $3.3 million increase in market research and sales operations expenses related to pre-commercial activities for ESKATA.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet loss was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenue of $1.7 million and cost of revenue of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the contract research business acquired in August 2017.\nTotal operating expenses were $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $54.7 million, compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $6.3 million was due to higher payroll-related expenses of $5.6 million due to increased headcount, including stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $4.5 million in preclinical and clinical trial development expenses related to our JAK inhibitor portfolio, an increase of $3.4 million in expenses related to the WART-202 and WART-203 trials, and a $3.6 million increase in medical affairs and early stage drug discovery activities. The increases noted above were partially offset by a $7.7 million decrease related to our ESKATA Phase 3 clinical trials costs, which were completed in November 2016, and $3.4 million in costs incurred with the acquisition of Vixen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $18 million was primarily attributable to an increase of $9.3 million in payroll-related expenses due to increased headcount, including stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $6.1 million in pre-commercial launch activities for ESKATA, a $1.3 million increase in facilities-related costs, and a $1.3 million increase in other professional fees. As of December 31, 2017, Aclaris had approximately 30.8 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAclaris expects 2018 GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses to be in the range of $67 to $75 million, which, when excluding estimated stock-based compensation of $9 million, results in 2018 non-GAAP R&D expense of $58 to $66 million. The anticipated increase in R&D expenses in 2018 is mainly due to the planned execution of Phase 2 clinical trials in AA, AGA, and vitiligo, two planned pivotal Phase 3 trials in common warts, and development of our early stage pipeline compounds.\nAclaris expects 2018 GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to be in the range of $80 to $86 million, which, when excluding estimated stock-based compensation of $14 million, results in 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense of $66 to $72 million. The anticipated increase in SG&A expenses in 2018 is primarily the result of the deployment of our new sales force in January 2018 and the additional selling, marketing and consumer initiatives to support the commercial launch of ESKATA.\nCompany to Host Conference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET today to discuss Aclaris’ financial results and provide a general business update.
