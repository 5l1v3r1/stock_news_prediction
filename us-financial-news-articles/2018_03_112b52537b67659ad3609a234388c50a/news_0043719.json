The emphasis will be to reduce maintenance costs.\n“The main element of cost we want to rein in is maintenance cost, particularly engine costs,” he said.\nAegean will decide on the aircraft supplier in the coming weeks. Most of its current leases need to be replaced between 2019 and 2023.\n“The main upfront investment, the pre-delivery payment, will be partially funded by our own cash and the rest from banks.” Vassilakis said.
