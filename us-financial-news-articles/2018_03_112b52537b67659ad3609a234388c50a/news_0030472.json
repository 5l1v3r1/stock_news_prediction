Toys ‘R’ Us may be on the verge of disappearing , but its “I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us Kid” jingle will forever remain an earworm. Earlier this week, CNN spoke to Linda Kaplan Thaler, the former J. Walter Thompson copywriter who conjured up the memorable tune . “I felt that if kids could sing it, that’s like free advertising,” Ms. Thaler said.\nLet’s Get Ready to Rumble We’re fast approaching what might be one of the biggest antitrust cases of modern times when the opening arguments begin next week in the Justice Department’s bid to block AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. As WSJ’s Brent Kendall and Drew FitzGerald report, the outcome of the face-off could have huge implications on the media industry and beyond. It could determine whether antitrust enforcers can challenge so-called vertical mergers. If AT&T emerges as the victor, it could have the scale, content, infrastructure and targeting data to better take on Google and Facebook’s dominance of the ad market, and it also could set off more media deal-making. Or, as the government argues, an AT&T victory could lead to consumers paying higher prices for their cable bills and slow down innovation. Key news nugget from the piece: AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson has always said publicly that he has never offered to sell CNN to smooth the deal through. U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, in a sworn legal affidavit obtained by the Journal, said Mr. Stephenson *had* indeed asked him whether the department would approve the deal if AT&T sold CNN.\nNow That It’s Raining More Than Ever First Kylie Jenner, now Rihanna—if another celebrity lashes out at Snap and sinks its stock, we’ll be on the verge of a trend. Snap’s shares declined more than 5% on Thursday before rebounding slightly after the “Umbrella” singer slammed the company for approving an ad that appeared to make light of domestic violence . The ad, for a mobile game called “Would You Rather,” asked whether users would prefer to slap Rihanna or punch her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, who in 2009 pleaded guilty to felony assault after a fight between the couple. In a statement, Snap said the ad was “disgusting” and was approved in error. It is now investigating how it happened, and the advertiser also has been banned from the platform. As Snapchat now offers a self-service ad platform, there’s more of a chance that an ad that violates its guidelines could slip through the cracks. Snap will need to provide assurances that its review process remains thorough now it’s opened up those programmatic floodgates.\nFull Time She’s had the time of her life, and now the woman behind this year’s popular “Dirty Dancing”-themed Super Bowl ad is leaving on a high. NFL marketing chief Dawn Hudson is stepping down next month after more than three years in the role, CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports. It’s been a challenging few years for the league, which has been dealing with issues including accusations of domestic abuse involving players, studies linking football with brain injuries, anthem protests and declining ratings. Ms. Hudson helped the league use marketing to bring humanity to the brand, from ad efforts shining a light on domestic violence to heartwarming spots such as “Super Bowl Babies.” When Ms. Hudson joined the NFL in 2014, she had told Commissioner Roger Goodell she wanted to stay only for a few seasons. When the NFL appointed Maryann Turcke to chief operating officer earlier this week, a role that includes marketing responsibilities, that “seemed like a natural breaking point,” says Ms. Hudson, who now plans to explore opportunities outside marketing.\nThe Writing’s on the Wall Another legal case could have had implications on the ad industry—before an abrupt about-turn. As Ad Age reported, street artist Jason Williams, aka Revok, recently sent H&M a cease-and-desist letter after the fashion retailer featured some of his graffiti in an activewear ad campaign. H&M responded with a lawsuit , arguing graffiti can’t be protected by copyright because it was created illegally. It wasn’t long before a #BoycottHM hashtag started doing the rounds on Twitter. On Thursday, H&M released a statement saying it had withdrawn the suit. “We should have acted differently in our approach to this matter,” the statement said. “It was never our intention to set a precedent concerning public art or to influence the debate on the legality of street art.” Lawsuit aside, brands: If you’re planning to appropriate street art in your ad campaigns, it’s a wise idea to get permission from the artist first.\nBest of the rest Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards has resigned and will retire from the company in August. In an internal memo, the company also said it had received complaints about inappropriate workplace behavior, but it didn’t specify the nature of the complaints or whether they involved Mr. Edwards or other executives. A Nike spokesman said there were no allegations against Mr. Edwards and declined to provide details.
