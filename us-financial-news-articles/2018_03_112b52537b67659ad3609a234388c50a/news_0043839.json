We want our women and children to come back. They could not come back to their homeland,” said Afrin resident Abdurrahman Nahsen Suleymanoglu.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan rejected criticism of the Afrin campaign in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, according to a Turkish presidential source.\nAmong Turkey’s Western allies, France has been one of the biggest critics of the Turkish military operation, with its foreign minister saying concerns for its border security did not justify the incursion.\nAdditional reporting by Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul; Writing by Daren Butler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T07:32:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
