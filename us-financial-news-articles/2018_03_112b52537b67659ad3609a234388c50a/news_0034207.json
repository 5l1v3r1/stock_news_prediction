Both of those investigations are in the early stages, the bank said.\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve put significant restrictions on the San Francisco bank citing \"widespread consumer abuses.\" The bank is replacing four members of its board and its asset level has been frozen by the Fed until internal controls are improved.\nSeparate from the sales-practices and the reported wealth-management investigations, Wells Fargo is under investigation for potentially overcharging corporate customers in foreign-exchange transactions as well as an investigation into its auto-lending business, where it forced auto insurance policies onto customers who did not need them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T02:00:49.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
