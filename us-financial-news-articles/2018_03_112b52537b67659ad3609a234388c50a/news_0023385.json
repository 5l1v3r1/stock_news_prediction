REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Australia’s Woodside last month said it had agreed to pay $744 million for ExxonMobil’s stake in the project that has been stuck on the drawing board for nearly 40 years, taking its hold to 75 percent.\nThe deal on the remote, deepwater gas field off the coast of the state of Western Australia is expected to conclude by the end of this quarter, Woodside said in a statement.\nWoodside also granted BHP the option to buy an additional 10 percent interest in Scarborough on the same terms as the ExxonMobil deal.\nWoodside bought a 25 percent stake in Scarborough from BHP in 2016. The company in a separate announcement said it had closed the retail component of its A$2.5 billion capital raising, which it started last month to fund the Scarborough transaction.\nReporting by Devika Syamnath in Bengaluru; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T08:13:47.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
