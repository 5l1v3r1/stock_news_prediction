(OTC PINK: GAWK)\nDear Shareholder;\nWe’ve always disclosed all the updates, good or bad, to our shareholders. This is a good news/semi-bad news letter. The good news first: We have two potential acquisitions under analysis, since our growth strategy includes purchasing businesses that have market share, complimentary assets, advanced systems and infrastructure. Gawk’s management team grows as we employ talented, experienced professionals from our competition.\nThe good news continues: Our technical staff has created a best in class “voice broadcasting” platform, and in the 1st quarter, we also completed the development of our first proprietary software platform, a product known as Direct Delivery, which is a state-of-the-art Ringless Voice Mail system. This product has already generated over 70 new accounts since launch. The new “voice broadcasting” platform and the Direct Delivery platform also are enabling us to move into higher margin retail accounts and away from lower margin wholesale customers. We will be announcing significant customer wins in the voice broadcasting arena and in the RVM sector in the coming days.\nBecause the price of shares of Gawk has been stalled by our delay in filing quarterly reports, our Audit Committee chairman will now take an active role in the preparation of audit materials and in interfacing with our auditors. All bookkeeping has now been brought in-house and we are working to consolidate reporting from our subsidiaries to expedite the time needed to produce compiled data. As previously announced we have changed auditors to DMCL, Inc. who we feel are better suited to company’s like ours and can provide the needed professional services in a much more timely and cost effective fashion.\nWhich brings us to the “bad” news. As our shareholders know, our performance in the first three quarters of FY2018 was strongly affected by the delays associated with our public filings. Due to reasons beyond our control and with no reflection on the company or its financial reporting, these delays prevented the company from proceeding with multiple planned acquisitions, which according caused the company to under run our projected revenues.\nWe are making maximum efforts on increasing our revenue, both through acquisitions and organically, while reducing our General and Administrative costs.\nWe have emerged stronger than ever before. I have a deep resolve to finish this year strong and with knowing we have a powerful base for more growth in FY2019.\nThank you for your continued confidence in Gawk.\nSincerely,\nScott Kettle\nCEO\nAbout GAWK, Inc.\nGAWK, Inc., offers a suite of cloud communications, cloud connectivity, cloud computing, and managed cloud-based applications solutions to small, medium, and large businesses; and offers domestic and international voice services to communications carriers worldwide.
