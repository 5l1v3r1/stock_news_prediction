On Friday, the dollar fell back against a basket of currencies but the pound failed to benefit.\nAnalysts said that while May’s speech suggested a transition deal - designed to buy Britain time to agree terms of exit from the EU – is one step closer, she did not say enough to convince investors an agreement would be hammered out by the end of March, when Britain has said a deal will be done.\n“May’s comments signal one step closer to an agreement towards a transition arrangement and the weaker dollar is also keeping sterling supported. But we have to see more meaningful progress for sterling to break out of current ranges,” said Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\nWith an Italian election and a vote on a German governing coalition both due on Sunday, investors have also been reluctant to take on any new large positions ahead of next.\nWorries that Britain might not secure the post-Brexit transition period that it wants have overshadowed growing expectations that the Bank of England will hike rates in May thanks to better-than-expected economic performance and signs of inflationary pressures.\n“May’s cogent and carefully laid out case will not necessarily drive negotiations forward so in the short term, paradoxically, it was read as negative by sterling buyers,” said Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index.\nSome investors worry that delayed negotiations over a transition deal could make the BoE less likely to raise rates as early as May, as the market now largely expects.
