They have fallen 74 percent in the past year, versus a 4 percent slide in Britain’s FTSE 100 share index. \nThe source, who declined to be named, said Capita’s board signed off last week on the plans drawn up by Lewis, a turnaround specialist who joined Capita from oil services company Amec Foster Wheeler last December. \nThe group, which employs 70,000 staff primarily in Britain ran into problems after a downturn and problems on contracts following years of acquisition-led growth. \nThe rights issue is aimed at paying down debt, plugging a pension deficit and boosting investment. \nLewis has appointed a chief people officer and intends to bring in a director of digital and a general legal counsel who have a proven track record in turning around operations, the person said. \nCapita declined to comment.
