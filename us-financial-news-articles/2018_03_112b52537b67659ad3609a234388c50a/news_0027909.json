(NASDAQ:AGLE), a clinical-stage biotechnology company that designs and develops innovative human enzyme therapeutics for patients with rare genetic diseases and cancer, today reported new repeat dose data from its Phase 1/2 open-label trial of pegzilarginase (AEB1102) in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency. The Company also reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We have seen encouraging results after repeated doses of pegzilarginase in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency,” said Anthony G. Quinn, M.B Ch.B, Ph.D., interim chief executive officer of Aeglea. “Along with marked and sustained reductions in plasma arginine levels, we are seeing consistent reductions in the levels of other guanidino compounds beyond what appears to be achieved through current approaches to disease management. This is important given the potential contribution of guanidino compounds to the progressive hyperargininemia-related neurological abnormalities seen in this patient population. In addition to our developing understanding of the effects of lowering arginine levels in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency, we have a good understanding of the safety profile in a larger population that includes patients from our cancer trials. We look forward to sharing additional updates on Arginase 1 Deficiency at the ACMG Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting in April 2018 and in the third quarter of 2018. These updates will include clinical insights from the two adult patients in the long-term extension study.”\n\"Repeated doses of pegzilarginase lowered and maintained plasma arginine and guanidino compound metabolites beyond what was achievable with current standard of care, which consists of a protein-restricted diet and ammonia scavengers,” said George Diaz, M.D., Ph.D, professor and chief, Division of Medical Genetics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-author on the abstract. \"Given that some patients benefit from the reductions in plasma arginine achieved with dietary protein restriction, it will be important to learn whether longer term reductions in plasma arginine with pegzilarginase beyond that achieved with diet translates into clinical benefit.\"\nClinical Updates\nArginase 1 Deficiency:\nAeglea presented repeat dose data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of pegzilarginase for two adult patients and single ascending dose data for one pediatric patient with Arginase 1 Deficiency at the 2018 Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) Annual Meeting on March 12, 2018.\nSustained lowering of plasma arginine was achieved with repeated weekly IV dose of 0.04 mg/kg of pegzilarginase.\nArginine-derived metabolites elevated at baseline were rapidly decreased and reductions maintained with repeat doses of pegzilarginase.\nPegzilarginase was well tolerated with the exception of a single infusion-associated reaction in one pediatric patient who had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and blunting of the expected reduction in plasma arginine after the second dose. The patient transitioned to the repeat dose part of the trial and received three further infusions. Although dosing was well tolerated with premedication and slower infusion rates, the patient withdrew consent due to the burden of balancing school and the clinical trial.\nNo marked or sustained increase in ADA titers were seen in the two adult Arginase 1 Deficiency patients or in the 48 cancer patients tested after dosing with pegzilarginase. Baseline ADA at low titer was detected in one of two adult Arginase 1 Deficiency patients and four of 48 cancer patients. There was no apparent effect of the presence of the ADA on arginine reduction or safety profile.\nThe effects of repeat dosing of pegzilarginase provides an opportunity to evaluate the clinical benefits of sustained reduction of plasma arginine beyond what can be achieved with standard of care therapy.\nThe Company expects to report pediatric and adult repeat dose data in patients with Arginase 1 Deficiency in the third quarter of 2018.\nCancer:\nThe first uveal and cutaneous melanoma patients were dosed with pegzilarginase in Aeglea’s open-label Phase 1 cohort expansions, with the intent to confirm the safety profile and Phase 2 dose and identify further signals of clinical activity.\nThe Company expects to report Phase 1 cohort expansion topline data, including safety and clinical activity, in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nUpcoming Events\nAeglea will present a corporate update at the 17 th Annual Needham Healthcare Conference on March 27, 2018 in New York.\nAeglea will present a poster with additional data on Arginase 1 Deficiency patients at the 2018 ACMG Annual Clinical Genetics Meeting on April 12, 2018 in Charlotte, North Carolina that will include additional clinical insights on baseline standardized assessments of neuromotor function and on short-term treatment with repeat doses of pegzilarginase.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results\nAs of December 31, 2017, Aeglea had available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $50.3 million. Based on Aeglea’s current operating plan, management believes it has sufficient capital resources to fund anticipated operations through the third quarter of 2019.\nAeglea recognized grant revenues of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The grant revenues were the result of a $19.8 million research grant received from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). The revenue increase was primarily due to higher qualifying expenditures associated with the clinical trials for pegzilarginase in cancer patients in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGrant revenues of $5.2 million were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher qualifying expenditures associated with the clinical trials for pegzilarginase in cancer patients in 2017 compared with 2016.\nResearch and development expenses totaled $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to expanded clinical activity for Aeglea’s lead product candidate, pegzilarginase, as Aeglea initiated three solid tumor single-agent cohort expansions and a Phase 1/2 combination trial in patients with small cell lung cancer.\nResearch and development expenses totaled $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily associated with expanded manufacturing, regulatory, research, and clinical development capabilities, as Aeglea completed its Phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Additionally, the Company initiated enrollment in three solid tumor single-agent cohort expansions and a Phase 1/2 combination trial in patients with small cell lung cancer.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation, consulting, and facility costs.\nNet loss totaled $6.5 million and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss totaled $27.2 million and $21.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nConference Call & Webcast Details\nAeglea will hold a conference call on Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. ET.
