Some experts are predicting electric vehicles and other technologies will bite into oil demand in the decades ahead. In its annual outlook BP said peak oil demand will be reached sometime in the late 2030s, but Dudley said he expects oil demand to be still over 100 million barrels a day in 2040. \nOPEC's top executive said at CERAWeek on Tuesday that the 100-million barrel per day market is fast approaching. \nMore from CERAWeek:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:42:36.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
