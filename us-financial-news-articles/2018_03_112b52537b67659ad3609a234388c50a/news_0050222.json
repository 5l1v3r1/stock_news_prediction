The proceeds from the listing will contribute towards the cost of running the business until the investor cash call next year. \nCEO Sean Bennett told Reuters Kore hopes to raise $600 million in London and Johannesburg for its Kola project, with the balance obtained through debt funding. \n“By early next year we are seeking to raise that equity so bringing the listing to the market at this time made sense because it gives us time to get investors comfortable and ready to participate in a big placement,” Bennett said. \nBennett said Australian capital markets lacked the appetite to fund a large project in Africa. \nGlobal prices of potash, a fertiliser ingredient, are slowly perking up as plant closures ease oversupply in the roughly 65 million tonne market. \nThe Kola project is expected to begin production at the end of 2022, the company said. It is awaiting the completion of a definitive feasibility study that will be ready in the third quarter of 2018. \nKore plans to produce potash at the relatively low cost of $100 per tonne for delivery to top consumer Brazil due to the shallow nature of the mine, the ease of processing the product and the mine’s proximity to ports, Bennett said. \nThe Kola project will produce 2 million tonnes per year. \nKore’s main investors include Oman’s sovereign wealth fund SGRF, which owns 19 percent, and Chilean lithium and potash miner SQM, with 17.6 percent. \nKore is awaiting parliamentary approval of a convention that will protect the company against any changes to Congo Republic’s mining code. \nMeanwhile, mining companies operating in Democratic Republic of Congo are negotiating over the implementation of a strict new set of laws that include a 50 percent tax on windfall profits.
