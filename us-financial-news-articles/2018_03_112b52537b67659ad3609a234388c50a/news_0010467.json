The junior mining advisor, which only had space for 500, had 30 guests at its first party in 2012.\nPDAC president Glenn Mullan said the days of“zombie” miners doing distressed financing deals to keep their stock alive were over.“We’re enjoying some real indices of prosperity again.”\nFloor space was sold out at Toronto’s convention center, Canada’s biggest such facility at over 2 million square feet (186,000 square meters), with waiting lists for vacancies, he said.\nLast year, global exploration spending rose 15 percent to about $8.4 billion, and S&P Global Market Intelligence on Monday forecast a further increase of up to 20 percent in 2018.\nJohn Gravelle, the interim CEO of Colt Resources, said an industry uptick and buoyant battery metals prospects means many companies are upbeat.\n“Miners don’t need to act like Scrooge anymore, but we need to respect the shareholders whose money we’re spending,” he said.“Spending money and depriving ourselves of sleep is part of being here - but we need to wake up with the business cards that will generate the payback.”\nReporting by Susan Taylor; Editing by Amran Abocar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T22:23:08.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
