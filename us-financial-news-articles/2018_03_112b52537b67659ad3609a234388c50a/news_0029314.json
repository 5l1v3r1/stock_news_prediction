Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.7 million, or $0.21 per share, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million, or $0.25 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $4.0 million, compared with revenues of $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting revenues from Astellas Pharma Inc. for services performed under ASP0113 collaborative agreements.\nVical had cash and investments of $62.9 million at December 31, 2017. The Company’s cash burn for 2017 was $8.6 million, which was consistent with the Company’s full year 2017 guidance of between $8 million and $11 million. The Company is projecting net cash burn for 2018 between $20 million and $24 million.\nProgram updates include:\nVCL-HB01 HSV-2 Therapeutic Vaccine\nVical is developing an HSV-2 therapeutic vaccine, VCL-HB01, to treat subjects with symptomatic genital herpes infection. The vaccine is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in HSV-2 seropositive healthy adult subjects, 18 to 50 years of age who are randomized 2:1 to receive either vaccine or placebo. Recruitment of 261 subjects at 15 U.S. clinical sites was completed in April 2017 and dosing was completed in July 2017. Following the 4 th vaccination or placebo injection, each subject entered a 12-month surveillance period during which each new lesion recurrence is assessed in the clinic by the investigator. Once the last subject has completed a minimum of 9-months of surveillance, the primary endpoint of annualized recurrence rate will be calculated based on those recurrences that are both clinically- and virologically-confirmed. This endpoint provides important information on the number of recurrences over time in this chronic disease setting and is clinically meaningful for both patients and treating physicians. Vical expects to announce top-line results during the second quarter of 2018.\nVL-2397 Antifungal Drug\nIn February, the Company initiated a Phase 2 trial of VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The FDA has advised that VL‑2397 would be eligible for a Limited Use Indication (LUI) approval for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, assuming a successful outcome of a single Phase 2 trial carried out in accordance with a protocol and statistical analysis plan consistent with the Agency's advice. The final determination whether the drug is approvable will be made by FDA after review of all relevant data. Vical is collaborating with Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium to advance VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. The FDA has granted Vical Qualified Infectious Disease Product, Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations for VL-2397 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.\nHepatitis B Virus Therapeutic Drug\nThe Company is pursuing early stage development of a novel treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) infection based on its DNA and lipid-delivery technologies. The initial aim of this program will be to demonstrate preclinical proof of concept for inhibiting HBV infection in a mouse model. The ultimate aim will be to demonstrate eradication of persistent HBV infection in CHB patients. This preclinical development effort is being conducted in collaboration with Vical’s strategic partner, AnGes, Inc. of Osaka, Japan.\nASP0113 CMV Therapeutic Vaccine\nAstellas and Vical announced in January that ASP0113, a vaccine being developed for cytomegalovirus-seropositive hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 HELIOS clinical trial.\nVical will conduct a conference call and webcast today, March 15, at noon Eastern Time, to discuss the Company’s financial results and program updates.
