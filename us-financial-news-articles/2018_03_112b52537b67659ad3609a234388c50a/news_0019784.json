The deal priced on Wednesday.\nWith such pricing “we avoided paying any new issuance premium despite the continuing fluctuations we have been seeing in global financial markets”, Tom Koczwara, debt-management adviser to the government, said in an emailed statement.\n“Our choice to pursue the maximum deal size and tenor from the options available to us was based on strong positive feedback from our marketing activities,” he said.\nDemand for the issue was more than $2.4 billion, according to IFR News.\nThe sukuk is Sharjah’s second bond issue this year, preceded by a 2 billion renminbi ($316 million) three-year issuance in China’s Panda bond market in February.\nThe sukuk was arranged by Dubai Islamic Bank, HSBC, Sharjah Islamic Bank and Standard Chartered.
