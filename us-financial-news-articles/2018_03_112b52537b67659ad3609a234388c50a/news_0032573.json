Swede Stenson, despite three bogeys, stayed atop the leaderboard at 12-under 204 after shooting a one-under 71 at Bay Hill on a gorgeous Florida afternoon. Woods, an eight time winner, birdied the 18th for a 69 and a share of 10th at 209. “That was a nice one,” the former world number one said of the birdie. “Maybe a low (score) tomorrow will give me a chance to kind of steal one.” He will need to overcome some of the world’s top players. While DeChambeau, the second-round co-leader, hung on for second with a 72, McIlroy, Rose and Fowler are all well placed. Northern Irishman McIlroy, playing his best golf in the United States this year, was strong on a back nine which featured an eagle at the 12th. He finished the day outright third at 10-under after a round of 67. Englishman Rose (67) and American Ryan Moore (69) were a stroke back on eight-under in a group including Fowler, who managed a 70 despite dropping three strokes in a meltdown on the last two holes.
