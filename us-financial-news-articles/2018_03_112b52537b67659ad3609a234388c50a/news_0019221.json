Net sales for the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2018 increased 12.0 percent, to $63.40 billion from $56.60 billion last year.\nThe Company gained an incremental sales day in the quarter due to the shift of Thanksgiving, however pre-Thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell in the first quarter this year, versus the second quarter last year. This negatively impacted this year’s second quarter sales by approximately 1.4% in the U.S., and slightly less worldwide and negatively impacted E-commerce sales by approximately 7-8%.\nComparable sales for the second quarter and the twenty-four-week year-to-date periods ended February 18, 2018, were as follows:\n12 Weeks 12 Weeks 24 Weeks 24 Weeks Fiscal Quarter Fiscal Quarter Fiscal Year Fiscal Year w/o gas inflation & FX w/o gas inflation & FX U.S. 7.1% 5.7% 8.7% 7.1% Canada 8.7% 2.5% 10.0% 3.4% Other International 15.7% 7.4% 13.0% 7.8% Total Company 8.4% 5.4% 9.4% 6.6% E-commerce 28.5% 27.3% 35.0% 33.7% Reported net income for the quarter was $701 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared to $515 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, last year. Earnings per share increased $0.17 due to a net income tax benefit of $74 million, as a result of the new tax laws. Excluding this benefit, net income grew 22%. Net income for the first 24 weeks of fiscal year 2018 was $1.34 billion, or $3.04 per diluted share, compared to $1.06 billion, or $2.41 per diluted share, last year.\nFor the four-week reporting month of February, ended March 4, 2018, the Company reported net sales of $10.21 billion, an increase of 12.8 percent from $9.05 billion during the similar period last year. For the twenty-six week period ended March 4, 2018, net sales were $68.51 billion, an increase of 12.0 percent from $61.18 billion during the similar period last year. Lunar New Year/Chinese New Year occurred in February this year (as compared to January last year). This positively impacted February sales by approximately 4.5% for Other International and a little more than 0.5% for Total Company.\nComparable sales for the February four-week and twenty-six-week year-to-date periods ended March 4, 2018, were as follows:\n4 Weeks 4 Weeks 26 Weeks 26 Weeks Retail Month Retail Month Fiscal Year Fiscal Year w/o gas inflation & FX w/o gas inflation & FX U.S. 9.0% 7.5% 8.6% 7.1% Canada 8.4% 3.2% 9.8% 3.3% Other International 22.2% 14.1% 13.1% 7.7% Total Company 10.5% 7.7% 9.4% 6.6% E-commerce 38.1% 37.0% 35.3% 33.9% Costco currently operates 749 warehouses, including 519 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 98 in Canada, 38 in Mexico, 28 in the United Kingdom, 26 in Japan, 14 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain, one in Iceland and one in France.
