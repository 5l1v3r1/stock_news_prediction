In 2018, it moved into San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno.\nThe company said in January it planned to enter the New York market in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nIn Britain, Purplebricks and other online estate agents have challenged traditional operators such as Countrywide and Foxtons, which are struggling as the market cools due to uncertainties in the wake of Brexit.\nHowever, Purplebricks warned its group revenues for the year ending April 30 would be around 5 percent lower than its consensus of 98 million pounds due to weak market conditions in the UK, which has been worsened by poor weather.\nBoth Australia and the United States are on course to at least meet its full-year revenue expectations, the company said.\n$1 = 0.7036 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:24:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
