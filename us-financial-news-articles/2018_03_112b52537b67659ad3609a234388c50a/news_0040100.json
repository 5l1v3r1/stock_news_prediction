The decrease in income from operations was primarily the result in selling and administrative expense growth exceeding growth in gross profit.\nThe Company produced revenue of $20,853,527 and $19,425,412 in the years of 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $1,428,115, or 7.4%, in the current year compared to the prior year.
