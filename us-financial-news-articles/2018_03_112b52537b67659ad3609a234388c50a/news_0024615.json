The euro was last up a fraction at $1.2317, sandwiched between support at $1.2270 and resistance at $1.2296.\nThe dollar edged down on the yen to 106.58, having bounced 0.5 percent on Friday.\nInvestors had trimmed holdings of yen last week on news U.S. President Donald Trump was prepared to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions in the region.\nU.S. officials on Sunday defended Trump’s decision, saying the move was not just for show and not a gift to Pyongyang.\nThe mix of brisk U.S. economic growth and restrained inflation was a positive one for most commodities, with industrial metals and oil performing well.\nSpot gold was steady on Monday at $1,323.60 an ounce.\nBrent crude futures rose 21 cents to $65.70 a barrel, after surging almost 3 percent on Friday. U.S. crude futures rose 16 cents to $62.20 a barrel.\nEditing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T13:02:47.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
