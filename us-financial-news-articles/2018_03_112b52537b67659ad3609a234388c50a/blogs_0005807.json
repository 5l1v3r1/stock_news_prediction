The I-PACE will be the first of Jaguar's cars that can receive \"over-the-air\" software updates. \nAdditionally, Jaguar has created an Alexa skill that works in conjunction with its \"Jaguar InControl Remote App\" for the I-PACE. \nThe skill lets drivers check their vehicles remotely, just by asking an Echo, or any other Alexa-enabled device, what's happening while they're away. Is the car locked? Fully charged? Where did I park it? Where's the nearest charging station? \nIn a livestreamed demo on Thursday, Jaguar showed users asking if their car had enough of a charge to get to the office. \nToyota, Lexus and other automakers have integrated Alexa into their vehicles on-board software, as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T22:57:13.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
