REUTERS/Denis Balibouse “We have a strategic interest in avoiding a supply concentration in Asia,” Tavares said.\nThe Peugeot and Citroen maker “enthusiastically supports the creation of a European champion in battery development and manufacturing”, he also told members of the French parliament’s economic affairs committee.\nThe European Commission is attempting to corral automakers and chemical groups into creating a European leader in its field - citing Airbus in the aerospace sector as an example - that would invest in new regional production.\nWhile some carmakers assemble battery packs, Europe has no significant production of their constituent cells - currently dominated by a handful of firms including China’s CATL and Korean rivals LG Chem and Samsung.\nThe European Investment Bank last month approved 52.5 million euros ($65 million) in funding for Sweden’s Northvolt, which aims to build a battery plant in the country.\nPSA’s domestic rival Renault, which sources electric-car batteries from LG Chem, could also buy cells from a European supplier as production of electrified vehicles ramps up, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said in January.\n“LG Chem has no monopoly on battery supply contracts,” Ghosn had told a joint hearing of the same parliamentary committee and its financial affairs counterpart. “There is room for a European supplier if it’s competitive.”\n($1 = 0.8070 euros)\nReporting by Laurence Frost and Gilles Guillaume; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T14:01:28.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
