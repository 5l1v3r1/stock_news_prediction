REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Japan H2 Mobility LLC, whose backers include Toyota Motor Corp and JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, said on Monday it would oversee the construction and operation of the new fuelling stations, nearly doubling the number at present.\nAs countries seek low emissions energy sources to power vehicles, homes and industry, Japan is betting heavily on becoming a “hydrogen society” despite the high costs and technical difficulties of a process that creates electricity from a chemical reaction of fuel and oxygen.\nJXTG Nippon Oil Senior Vice President Yutaka Kuwahara said on Monday that a lack of users and high costs to build and operate fuelling stations had slowed construction in Japan, delaying a government target to build 100 stations by March 2016.\nJapan currently has about 90 stations, with at least 40 operated by JXTG Nippon Oil, and another 10 are in the planning or construction stage.\n“We must lower costs, which will remove many of the bottlenecks to developing more stations,” he told reporters at a briefing.\nFILE PHOTO: The name of the sedan car \"Mirai\", meaning \"future\" in Japanese, on Toyota Motor Corp's new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV), displayed during an unveiling event at the Miraikan National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Tokyo, November 18, 2014. REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo By about 2020, the Japanese government aims to roughly halve the cost of building a hydrogen fuelling station, which is currently about 400 million yen to 500 million yen ($3.8 million-$4.7 million), well above 100 million yen for a gasoline station.\nThe path to adopting hydrogen has been dogged by the difficulty in driving widespread take-up given high costs of fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), limited production capabilities and low numbers of fuelling stations.\nOnly a handful of automakers currently market FCVs, including Toyota, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co. Toyota has sold only 5,300 units of its Mirai FCV since its launch in 2015, while it has sold a total of around 11.5 million gasoline hybrids since launching the Prius 20 years ago.\nJapan wants to have 160 hydrogen stations and 40,000 FCVs on the country’s roads by March 2021. By 2030, it aims to have 900 stations to service some 800,000 FCVs, buses and forklifts.\nBy then, it expects the price of hydrogen to fall to around 30 yen per normal cubic meter, from up to 100 yen now.\nOther companies involved in Japan H2 Mobility include Honda, Nissan Motor, Idemitsu Kosan, Iwatani Corp, Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas, Air Liquide Japan Ltd, Toyota Tsusho.\nReporting by Naomi Tajitsu and Osamu Tsukimori; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:23:56.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
