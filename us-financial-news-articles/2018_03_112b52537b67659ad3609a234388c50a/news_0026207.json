In late 2016, the Internal Revenue Service began requiring participants and advisers to alert the agency to the transactions to aid in determining who should be audited.\nThe new data, provided to senators and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, come from the first wave of those disclosures. The reports show 552 separate transactions covering several years and exceeding previous estimates. The Brookings Institution has estimated that the total revenue loss from syndicated easement deals was between $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion in 2016.\nThe total value of claimed deductions over several years was $230 billion, far beyond previous estimates. That figure itself may be significantly overstated, with the same deduction appearing on disclosures from multiple entities that were required to file forms with the IRS, and the IRS document notes that it hasn’t been verified as accurate.\nRelated\nRead IRS Letter to Sen. Wyden Read IRS Supporting Document “What started as a critical tool for land preservation has been systematically exploited by bad actors peddling tax shelters to the highest bidder,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, who is asking the IRS for further analysis. “Congress must act swiftly to protect the integrity of the conservation easement program. American taxpayers could be on the hook for billions and billions of dollars.”\nUnder U.S. law, land owners can donate the development rights to their property to land trusts, other charities or governments. For example, a farmer with a $5 million piece of land in a fast-growing area can place an easement on the property that restricts development. By donating the easement to a charity and getting an appraisal, the farmer could show that the land’s value has diminished by $3 million and thus can claim that amount as a deduction.\nThat is relatively noncontroversial in Congress, though the break skews to wealthier households. President Donald Trump has used this type of deal in at least four states.\nRelated Video Under the new tax law approved by Congress, the standard deduction is going up and the personal exemption is going away. But these changes won't be visible until your 2019 returns. WSJ's Richard Rubin explains the recipe behind the changes that are coming to your tax bill. The syndicates that popped up in recent years, however, are more aggressive, and more controversial, because they can let people profit quickly from tax breaks. They have also led to a rift in the conservation world, with more established land trusts worrying that more aggressive deals undermine support for conservation easements more broadly.\nIn a syndicated easement, the organizer recruits investors who buy a piece of a partnership. The organizer identifies property, buys it, makes the donation and then parcels out the deduction. The syndicated deals are particularly popular in the Southeast, and their backers say they efficiently promote conservation by getting tax deductions to people who have the income to use them.\nThe key, critics say, is often an inflated and unrealistic appraisal and a relatively small network of advisers and charities supporting the transactions. The disclosures identified just 38 appraisers involved in the 552 deals.\nThe IRS’s 2016 requirement forced advisers and taxpayers to disclose transactions where the value of the deduction was at least 2.5 times the investment, roughly the point where the tax deduction exceeds the original investment for many taxpayers.\nThe average deduction was 4.07 times the investment, with some exceeding seven times the investment, according to the IRS data.\nThe IRS, which frequently challenges ordinary and syndicated easements, can then use the information in audits. Failure to disclose carries penalties of up to $200,000.\nSens. Steve Daines (R., Mont.) and Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) introduced a bill last month that would deny the tax break when the deduction-to-investment ratio exceeds 2.5. Mr. Wyden backed that bill on Wednesday and Reps. Mike Thompson (D., Calif.) and Mike Kelly (R., Pa.) have a companion House bill.\nAndrew Bowman, president of the Land Trust Alliance, which represents more established conservation groups, said there’s no reason to wait. “And every day that Congress does wait, what this shows is the taxpayers are going to be bilked out of millions, if not billions, of dollars,” he said.\nBut the syndicators have also gotten more active in Washington, ramping up their lobbying and campaign contributions .\nThe group arguing against the proposed changes, the Partnership for Conservation, said the IRS report doesn’t consider the benefits from land conservation. It said the $230 billion figure is “demonstrably false” when compared with previous IRS data on noncash donations.\n“The swirl of disinformation is being used to promote bad policy that will protect the interests of billionaires, limit the participation of everyday Americans in conservation and ultimately lead to less land being conserved,” said Randy Bampfield, co-chair of the group’s legal committee.\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T21:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T00:38:14.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
