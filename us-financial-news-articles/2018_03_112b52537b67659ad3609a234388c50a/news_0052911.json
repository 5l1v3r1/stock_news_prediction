The provision was slightly higher than the $75 million it had said last month it would set aside.\nNet interest income rose to 2.23 billion shekels in the quarter from 2.03 billion a year earlier while credit loss expenses plunged to 24 million shekels from 469 million.\nIts core Tier 1 capital ratio to risk-weighted assets, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 11.26 percent from 11.01 percent at the end of 2016.\nThe bank declared a quarterly dividend of 245 million shekels, or 18.345, shekels a share for a payout of 40 percent of net profit.
