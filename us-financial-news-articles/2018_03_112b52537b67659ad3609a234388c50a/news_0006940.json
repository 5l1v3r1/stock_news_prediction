But the broader market tanked, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 550 points at one stage on concerns about a trade war erupting. The Dow had been more than 150 points earlier in the session. \nMeanwhile, fears of a possible trade war were abound even before Thursday's announcement. Charles Bobrinskoy, vice Chairman and head of investment group Ariel Investments, told CNBC on Monday that the Great Depression began over trade wars. \nIt's unclear if the tariffs would apply to all imports or only certain metals, Miller said Thursday, but added that the construction and automotive industries will be hit the hardest. \n\"Ultimately, [valuations are] positive for steel and aluminum today,\" he said. \"We have to wait to see what it means for the GOP political landscape moving forward.\" Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Playing", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T22:05:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
