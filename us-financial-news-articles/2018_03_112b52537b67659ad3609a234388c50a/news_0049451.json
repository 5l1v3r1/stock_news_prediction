Union representatives at the firm said insolvency proceedings could help conclude a takeover deal.\nTerrena, which has said Doux lost around 35 million euros ($43 million) in each of the past two years, estimates the poultry firm needs 100 million euros in investment to reorganise its business model.\n$1 = 0.8118 euros Reporting by Pierre-Henri Allain; additional reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris Editing by Mark Potter and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:37:20.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
