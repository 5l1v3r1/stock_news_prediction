So that’s what I did, I hit a few winners, very fortunate to win the first set and then found my game in the second.” \nIn the opening set tiebreak, Zverev sent a crushing backhand winner up the line to earn a set point. And at 6-4, with Carreno Busta serving, Zverev forced his opponent into a forehand error.

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports \nZverev used a stinging crosscourt backhand for a break in the third game of the second set and broke his opponent again in the seventh before going on to serve out a match that took 88 minutes at Crandon Park. \nThe 20-year-old German will now set his sights on collecting his seventh career ATP Tour title and third Masters 1000 crown when he faces 14th-seed Isner in Sunday’s final. \nZverev is 3-0 in head-to-head meetings with Isner, his most recent victory coming in last year’s Italian Open semi-final.

Very, very encouraging. \n“Physically, I’m super-fresh and I’m ready to go for the finals.” Reporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina and Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Pritha Sarkar/Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T00:22:45.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
