(NASDAQ:NODK) today reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter ended December 31, 2017:\nNet income attributable to NI Holdings of $13.9 million compared to $1.1 million for 2016. Net premiums earned of $48.5 million, a 47.5% increase from 2016. Loss and LAE ratio of 39.5%, compared to 76.8% for 2016. Expense ratio of 26.6%, compared to 22.6% for 2016. Earnings per share of $0.62.\nYear ended December 31, 2017:\nNet income attributable to NI Holdings of $16.0 million compared to $4.6 million for 2016. Net premiums earned of $179.5 million, a 17.5% increase from 2016. Net realized capital gain on investments of $3.0 million, compared to $5.7 million for 2016. Loss and LAE ratio of 68.4%, compared to 77.6% for 2016. Expense ratio of 24.8%, compared to 25.6% for 2016. Combined ratio of 93.1%, compared to 103.2% for 2016. Earnings per share of $0.71. Total equity of $255.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\n“We are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and for 2017. Our bottom-line improved across all business segments other than crop. A dry start to the year in North Dakota combined with a late season hail storm resulted in a loss ratio for the crop line above our targeted expectations,” said Michael J. Alexander, President and CEO. “While second and third quarter results in this industry can be impacted by higher frequency and severity of weather related losses, our fourth quarter results usually benefit from calmer weather and when combined with our first quarter produce the majority of our profits.”\n“The improvement in the loss and LAE ratio reflects the decrease in the number of weather related losses in 2017 when compared to 2016. In addition, positive reserve development combined with rate adjustments across our Private Passenger Automobile, Non-Standard Auto, and the Home and Farm lines of business resulted in improved underwriting results.”\n“In our all other segment, the assumed reinsurance line of business was adversely affected by the hurricane activity in third quarter and the California wildfires in fourth quarter. However, losses on our commercial multi-peril and excess liability lines of business were much improved from a year ago, and more than offset the higher assumed losses from the hurricanes and wildfires.”\nThe increase in net income includes a one-time $1.3 million deferred income tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”). The TCJA was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In addition to other provisions, the TCJA lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Companies are required to calculate deferred income taxes using the income tax rates expected to be in effect when income tax timing differences reverse, which is now 21% versus the previous 35%. The Company was in a net deferred income tax liability position on the date of enactment, which means that the reduction in the income tax rate resulted in a lower deferred income tax liability. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), this reduction in the deferred income tax liability, which is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit, was recognized in net income in the fourth quarter.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will not hold an earnings conference call for fourth quarter 2017. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC is available on the Company’s website at http://www.niholdingsinc.com .
