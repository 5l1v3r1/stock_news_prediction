He faces multiple charges, including making a terroristic threat, which carries a sentence of between two and seven years, authorities said.\nPolice said on Monday they had received a threat from someone who said they were armed. Walker said they found no weapons in Omerovicâ€™s possession and declined to comment on a motive for the calls.\nThe campus was not locked down again on Tuesday as authorities determined Omerovic did not pose a significant threat, police said.\nIt could not be immediately determined if Omerovic had a lawyer to comment.\nReporting by Andrew Hay in Taos, New Mexico, Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T02:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T04:21:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
