The Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile is the most powerful rocket the North has tested to date.\nThe Hwasong-15 or KN-22 missile is believed to have a range capable of hitting the entire continental United States, according to estimates from the Missile Defense Project .\nIn 2017 alone, Kim Jong Un launched 24 missiles and carried out its largest nuclear test.\nAs it stands, North Korea remains the only nation to test nuclear weapons this in century.\nOn September 3, 2017, the rogue regime carries out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, saying it detonated an advanced hydrogen bomb designed for a long-range missile.\nThe bomb is estimated to have an explosive yield of 120 kilotons, which equates to a blast created from 265 million pounds worth of TNT, according to Norsar , a Norwegian geoscience research foundation.\n\"Kim Jong Un has repeatedly emphasized that nuclear weapons were a fundamental part of his national security and his nation's survival, and they even put nuclear weapons into their constitution,\" Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.\n\"It's a little surprising and difficult for me to believe that they would change that stance overnight,\" Collins added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T20:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T20:59:59.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
