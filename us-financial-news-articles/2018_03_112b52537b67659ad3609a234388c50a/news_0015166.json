Another 20 were rushed to area hospitals, where two died.\nThe others had already been picked up by immigrant smugglers.\nBradley, who was arrested at the scene, pleaded guilty in October to human smuggling charges and faces a life prison term when he is sentenced later this year.\nReporting by Jim Forsyth in San Antonio; Editing by Dan Whitcomband Leslie Adler\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T07:13:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
