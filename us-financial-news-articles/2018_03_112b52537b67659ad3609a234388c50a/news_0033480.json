The delisting from the TSX will not affect the company's listing on the over-the-counter market place (OTCQB).\nThe Company is currently subject to a delisting review and, based on discussions with TSX, the Company has concluded it will be unable to regain compliance with TSX's continued listing requirements by the deadline set by the TSX, March 29, 2018. In addition, given the relatively low trading volume of its shares on the TSX and the fact that TearLab's OTCQB listing provides its shareholders with sufficient liquidity, the Company believes that the costs associated with maintaining a dual listing are no longer justified. This is consistent with the Company’s previously announced strategy to conserve resources and streamline its operations. Accordingly, effective at the close of markets on March 29, 2018 the Company's common stock will no longer be traded on the TSX.\nAfter delisting from the TSX, the company's common stock will continue to trade on the OTCQB under the symbol TEAR.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange has neither approved nor disapproved the information contained herein.\nAbout TearLab Corporation\nTearLab Corporation ( www.tearlab.com ) develops and markets lab-on-a-chip technologies that enable eye care practitioners to improve standard of care by objectively and quantitatively testing for disease markers in tears at the point-of-care.
