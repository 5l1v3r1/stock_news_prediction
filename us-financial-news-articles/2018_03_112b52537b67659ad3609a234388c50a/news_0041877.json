About 20 companies—from Google and CBS to Condé Nast and Discovery—are scheduled to present.\nOmnicom Media Group, the division of Omnicom Group Inc. that houses its media-buying firms, is seeking more tailored pitches for its clients, in hopes of identifying potential brand integrations or unique ad formats early on. The firm wants to streamline what has become an unwieldy “upfront” season where increasingly more media companies host meetings and presentations to persuade advertisers to lock in spending commitments for the coming year.\nThe event is about having “a more constructive and strategic dialogue that isn’t bound by this ridiculous [upfront] calendar,” said John Swift, chief executive officer of investment for Omnicom Media Group North America. During the upfronts, he said, “Every night there is something and that doesn’t seem like the most productive way to approach this really changing marketplace.”\nBy having different types of media organizations present back-to-back, the agency is hoping to get an integrated view of the entire video marketplace, as opposed to looking at ad spending from a siloed approach.\nTV networks and digital publishers are in an arms race to win over ad dollars, which has led to an explosion of annual upfront pitches in recent years. Cable channels like Nickelodeon and A&E present over several weeks starting in early March, followed by digital publishers like YouTube and Refinery29, and then broadcast networks in May.\nOmnicom will still attend those events but believes its in-house event will leave it better prepared to do more comprehensive deals after the glitzy presentations.\nThe upfront selling season for broadcasters, when advertisers commit to buying the bulk of ad inventory for coming TV season, dates back to 1962, when ABC decided to launch all of its programs just after Labor Day—the week new car models were unveiled and advertised. The process became more formal in the late 1970s.\nCable companies joined the fray in the late 1980s and 1990s and began hosting their own presentations to highlight upcoming original TV programs. Digital publishers and tech companies began offering their version of such events during the NewFronts in 2012.\nOmnicom is one of the largest ad buyers in the world, responsible for purchasing an estimated $25 billion of advertising in the U.S. on behalf of clients such as Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and McDonald’s. The agency says it is hoping its own event will help it identify opportunities for unique ad deals that will help its clients stand out in an environment where consumers are eager to avoid advertising.\n“We told them [media companies and publishers] not to give us their elevator pitch,” said Catherine Sullivan, president of U.S. investment for Omnicom Media Group. Instead, Ms. Sullivan said she wants more tailored offers, like first looks at brand integrations into certain shows, new ad formats, or unique partnerships that can include creating ads that tie directly into specific programs.\nThere is plenty of money at stake in the upfronts. Last year, the broadcast networks secured an estimated $9.1 billion in upfront commitments, up 4.1% from the previous year, while cable networks took in $10.6 billion, an increase of 7.6%, according to Media Dynamics Inc., a media consulting firm based in New Jersey.\nMarketers have long complained about having to commit dollars ads in May, so far in advance of the September start to the new TV season and at a time of the year when most companies haven’t gotten their internal budgets and planning completed. Many buyers would rather purchase ads closer to air date, but the practice of buying inventory in advance shows no signs of diminishing.\n“The benefits of making a long-term commitment on TV are still clear in terms of availability of the programming you want to secure and the pricing benefits you get from buying ahead of time,” said Mr. Swift.\nUpfront commitments have also become necessary with some digital players because even though there is a plethora of digital ad inventory, “there is still a scarcity of truly premium and brand safe content to match the demand that exists,” he added.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nOmnicom is responsible for purchasing an estimated $25 billion of advertising in the U.S. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Omnicom is responsible for purchasing an estimated $25 million of advertising in the U.S. (March 22, 2018)\nWrite to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T14:04:11.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
