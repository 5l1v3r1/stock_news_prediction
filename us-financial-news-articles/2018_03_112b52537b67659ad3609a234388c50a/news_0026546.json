Democrats have the energy.\nInterviews with more than 20 Republican lawmakers, operatives and strategists nationwide reveal a party increasingly worried about high levels of enthusiasm on the Democratic side and struggling to motivate its own voters to come out in the numbers needed to retain its grip on the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives.\nIts a challenge, it is, said Jeff Flake, a Republican U.S. senator who is retiring this year. Weve got our work cut out for us.\nIssues that typically fire up conservatives when a Democrat is in the White House, including gun control, abortion, immigration and healthcare, have lost potency with Republicans in control of the White House and Congress as well as both legislative chambers in 32 U.S. states.\nMany Republican operatives and lawmakers believe their best argument will be the state of the economy and the tax overhaul passed by Congress late last year. They also believe the partys fundraising power can boost Republican candidates and get-out-the vote efforts in critical contests.\nBut some worry tax reform is not enough to get Republican voters to cast ballots in congressional races.\n\"Republicans are going to struggle to turn out voters if we can't get a lot more accomplished before November, said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster involved in key Senate races in Arizona, Nevada, Texas and elsewhere.\n'WE'RE IN RE-FREAK-OUT'\nAfter a brief period of optimism when the tax package passed in December, Republicans are now openly fretting about their party's image as Trumps White House appears gripped by turmoil, with a range of policy fights on key issues, a new round of high-level departures and ongoing probes into alleged ties between Trump's election campaign team and Russia.\n\"Were in a re-freak-out right now,\" said Doug Heye, a former top official at the RNC. \"If the conversation is on Russia, or White House discord, or Trumps tweets, were clearly not doing what we doing what we need to do.\"\nRepublicans have watched with deepening alarm as highly motivated Democratic voters came out in force in state special elections in Kentucky and Wisconsin, and in Texas primaries last week.\n\"We should take seriously the fact that when you feel as though you are out of power and out of control of your government, you are going to respond with a higher level of engagement than you would otherwise, said Dennis Revell, a board member of the California Republican Party.\nThe polling firm at the meeting in Sacramento warned that presidents who have an overall approving rating of under 50 percent as Trump does - typically lose an average of 40 seats in midterm elections.\nDemocrats need to gain a net total of 2 Senate seats and 24 House seats to take control of those chambers.\n'FEEL THE HEAT NOW'\nTo counteract the enthusiasm gap, Republican strategists say, candidates will need to run smart and well-funded campaigns.\nThe polling firm urged Republican incumbents in California to focus on fundraising and to hold town halls without delay in order to draw out criticism as early as possible and energize voters.\nOne slide in its presentation urged Republican candidates to: Feel the heat NOW, not in November. Another counseled candidates to prepare for a negative campaign\" and not shy away from giving opponents \"name ID, especially if that name ID is of the negative kind.\nIn Washington, one Republican operative said, the partys House incumbents were given a set of tips: Don't take supposedly safe districts for granted. Raise money. Introduce legislation to help constituents.\nOne advantage Republicans do hold over Democrats is financial. At the end of January, according to a Reuters analysis of each of the parties' three main political action committees, the RNC had a sizable financial advantage over Democrats at the end of January.\nFilings with the Federal Election Commission show the RNC had nearly $107 million on hand at the end of January, the last full reporting period, compared to the DNC's $74 million.\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the Koch brothers, says it will be active in Senate races and spend much of its money early in the campaign in the belief that is its best opportunity to shape the narrative of individual contests.\nIn the last three congressional elections, Republicans held the enthusiasm advantage, animated by their opposition to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and galvanized by hot-button issues such as immigration, guns, and healthcare.\nNavigating those issues may be trickier now. Republicans must defend 23 House districts won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and dominated by more moderate, college-educated voters.\nThe party also needs conservatives to vote heavily in rural states such as Montana, North Dakota, and Missouri, where Republicans hope to oust five moderate Democrats.\nWilson, the pollster involved in U.S. Senate races, warned that if bipartisan deals are reached in Congress on gun control and immigration in coming months, Republican turnout could be depressed.\nIts a complete recipe for a demoralized base, Wilson said.\nStill, conservative activists say some cultural issues will retain a punch.\nPenny Nance, president of Concerned Women of America, said the failure in February of a Senate bill that would have outlawed abortion after the 20th week of a pregnancy could be used against Democratic senators who opposed it, including North Dakotas Heidi Heitkamp.\nMatt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, suggested that Trumps ongoing attacks on the media are popular with his base of voters and could be an effective rallying cry.\nBut the most effective way for the party to have a unified message rests on the economy, operatives said,\nYou have to show people what you are doing to improve their lives, said Tim Phillips, Americans for Prosperitys president, although he conceded it is harder to motivate voters to come out when Republicans are the party in power.\n\"Its fair to say it's easier to vote against something than for it,\" he said.
