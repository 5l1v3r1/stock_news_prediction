REUTERS/Benoit Tessier \nThey did not disclose financial terms for the deal. \nMcCartney, known for her understated designs and commitment not to use fur or leather, had an option until March 31 to buy out half of her label under the terms of the partnership. \n“It is the right moment to acquire the full control of the company bearing my name,” McCartney said in a statement. \nA spokesman for the label declined to comment on how the acquisition would be financed. \nFollowing the agreement, Kering will continue to lend some support and services to the brand for a year, and the split will be final by the end of the first quarter of 2019, according to a spokeswoman for the French group. \nMcCartney will stay on as a board member of the Kering Foundation, which works to stop violence against women, and the companies said she would collaborate with Kering “in the field of sustainable fashion” - an area that has become her hallmark.
