AAPL, +0.69% and Samsung Electronics Co. SSNHZ, +0.00% The company would also need to form a partnership with a telecom carrier, the market’s gatekeepers. \nXiaomi could also be caught in a pushback against Chinese smartphone vendors in the U.S. Earlier this year, Huawei Technologies Co., lost out on a deal with AT&T Inc. T, +0.97% to sell its high-end Mate 10 phone there due to national security concerns—concerns Huawei has long said are misplaced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T15:41:31.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
