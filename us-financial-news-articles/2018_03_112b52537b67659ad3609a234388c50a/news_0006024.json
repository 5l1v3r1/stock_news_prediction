Yards are very important customers. This influences the portfolio,” she said\n** GIEK’s 2017 earnings, which have not yet been published, will swing to a profit from a 2016 loss, Nistad added\n** Despite requests from exporters, GIEK has so far been unable to support businesses seeking to sell to Iran\n** “We haven’t been able to guarantee investments in Iran so far, this has to do with the banking sector and the banking relationships with Iran. Because we need a bank to cooperate with in case we should do some transactions and this has proven to be very, very difficult,” Nistad added (Reporting by Lefteris Karagiannopoulos, editing by Terje Solsvik)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:15:07.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
