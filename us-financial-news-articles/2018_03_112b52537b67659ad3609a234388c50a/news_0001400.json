Carmakers are ditching booth babes, the next Warren Buffett could be a woman, and Hope Hicks is out as WH comms director. Have a fantastic first day of March. EVERYONE'S TALKING \n• No Hope . Hope Hicks, White House communications director and one of President Trump’s longest-serving advisers, has announced that she’s leaving her position. Her next move remains unclear. Hicks has been described as one of the few people who understands the president and is able to convince him to change his mind. (Indeed, Axios’s Jonathan Swan describes her as “like a daughter to Trump.”) She resigned the day after she testified before the House Intelligence Committee in connection with the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. \nArguably one of the most powerful people in Washington—and certainly among the most powerful women in the Trump’s White House—Hicks kept an unusually low profile while holding a high-profile job. She was also known for bringing order and brokering compromise, suggesting that she will leave the White House a more chaotic and discordant place. Her departure will also leave the upper ranks of the president’s key advisers far more male. Advertisement ALSO IN THE HEADLINES \n• A seat at the cap table . #Angels, an all-woman investing collective that includes Twitter vets Katie Jacobs Stanton, Jessica Verrilli, and Vijaya Gadde, among others, is launching a new initiative, #TheGapTable. The movement aims to call attention to the paucity of women and underrepresented minorities in startups’ cap tables—the documents that record who owns shares in a company and how many. Why is that so important? “The cap table holds the roadmap to wealth and power in Silicon Valley.” Medium \n• Bad education . Terry Karl left her job as an assistant professor of government at Harvard University in the early 1980s after the school dolled out a lax punishment to Jorge Domínguez, a senior colleague who was sexually harassing her. Unsurprisingly, Domínguez continued to harass other women. Now the Chronicle of Higher Ed asks: “Did the university’s handling of one professor’s sexual-harassment complaint keep other women from coming forward for decades?” Chronicle of Higher Education \n• DeLauro’s demands . In this Fortune op-ed, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who represents Connecticut’s Third Congressional District, praises the Parkland students and calls for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as the closure of the “gun show loophole.” ", "external_links": ["http://features.hollywoodreporter.com/what-if-the-oscar-were-a-woman-12-interpretations-for-the-metoo-era/?utm_source=Sailthru&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;utm_campaign=THR%27s%20Today%20in%20Entertainment_now_2018-02-28%2010:08:07_rrahman&#038;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_tie", "https://medium.com/@HelloAngels/9982230d923a", "https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/28/business/where-are-we-40-years-after-pregnancy-discrimination-act", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/style/women-tattoo-artists.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&#038;action=click&#038;contentCollection=business&#038;region=stream&#038;module=stream_unit&#038;version=latest&#038;contentPlacement=9&#038;pgtype=sectionfront", "https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/harvard-harassment", "https://www.axios.com/why-hope-hicks-leaving-matters-984cf495-b34f-4a34-a008-a9bb7859a3b5.html", "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/27/former-white-house-aide-dina-powell-rejoins-goldman-sachs-430096", "https://www.elle.com/fashion/a18729212/stitch-fix-new-feature-extras-intimates/?src=socialflowTW", "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-02-28/the-next-warren-buffett-will-be-a-woman", "http://fortunedotcom.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post&#x3D;2303690&action&#x3D;edit", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/books/harper-lee-will.html?emc=edit_nn_20180228&#038;nl=morning-briefing&#038;nlid=61273230&#038;te=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/french-academy-launches-nowweact-white-ribbon-campaign-cesar-awards-1089281", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/us/politics/hope-hicks-resign-communications-director.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T15:59:08.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
