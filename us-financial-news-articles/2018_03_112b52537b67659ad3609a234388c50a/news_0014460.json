Traditional male views of women were a significant roadblock, she said.\n“Because I am female it is harder for me to find jobs,” she said by phone from Amman, the capital. “It has to do with a conservative mindset that men don’t want women to work - they are for marriage and to be in the home.”\nShe said the monthly wage for the sales jobs she sought was about 200 Jordanian dinar ($282).\n“A lot of the time when I go for jobs they are asking for males and the salaries are so low,” she said.\nMiddle Eastern countries are among the worst in the world for unequal pay between men and women, according to the World Economic Forum, a Swiss charity.\nThe five lowest ranking countries for women’s economic participation and opportunity are Syria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Iran, with a gap of at least 65 percent, it said.\nReporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Katy Migiro.
