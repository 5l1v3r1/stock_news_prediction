Manufacturers that use steel and aluminium, such as Boeing and General Motors , were particularly affected by the drop.\nDespite the selloff, the president stood by his stance on Friday.\nTweet \nWhile you might not want to boast about your 401(k) balances on Twitter, as some investors were doing earlier this year, you still want to stay invested, financial advisors say.\n\"The 401(k) as a place to save for retirement is one of the very best places you can put your money,\" said Paul Pagnato, founder and CEO of PagnatoKarp in Reston, Virginia. \"We highly encourage people to continue to put as much money into that as they possibly can.\"\nAdmittedly, not everyone is investing in a 401(k).

But you may want to think about how the money in your account is allocated, particularly if you haven't done so in a while, he said.\n\"If someone hasn't looked at their allocation in a couple of years, now is the time to make some adjustments,\" Hanson said.\nOne risk to watch out for: You could be overweighted in stocks because the market has done so well.\n\"The 401(k) as a place to save for retirement is one of the very best places you can put your money.
