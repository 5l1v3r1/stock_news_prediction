Inflation remains well below its 2 percent target even as the economy enjoys its longest growth run in 28 years, keeping it from dialing back stimulus despite the rising costs of prolonged easing.\nThat leaves Kuroda with a tough task in his second term beginning in April, which is to navigate the long road toward a stimulus exit with subtle hints without stoking market fears of an imminent policy shift.\nA majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to keep its long-term rate target unchanged this year, though 40 percent expect a hike.\nThe March rate review will be the final one before a BOJ leadership change, in which two new deputy governors will replace the departing officeholders on March 20.\nEditing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:39:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
