Thursday’s agreement includes the sale of Māui, Pohokura and Tank Farms. After deal closure, Shell Taranaki and Shell New Zealand employees will become a part of OMV New Zealand, Shell said. “This acquisition is an important step to develop Australasia into a core region in line with our new strategy,” OMV CEO Rainer Seele said. Shell has sold or agreed to sell over $25 billion of assets as part of a three-year programme to dispose of $30 billion by the end of 2018, following the acquisition of BG Group in 2016. Shell sold its stake in Kapuni gas field, New Zealand’s second-largest, for an undisclosed price in 2017.
