Some services to key corporate markets like Australia, Japan and South Korea have lacked that level of comfort when the airline has used its older regional fleet of Airbus SE A330s and Boeing 777s. \nThe fuel-efficient jet will help Singapore Airlines lower its cost base, improve its product for business travelers and return to major capacity growth at its premium brand after years of being more focused on expanding in the budget sector. \nThe carrier last year launched a three-year transformation program designed to help it compete more effectively against Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers.
