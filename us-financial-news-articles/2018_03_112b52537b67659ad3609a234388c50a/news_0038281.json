The per share price represents a 36% premium over MuleSoft's closing share price on March 19, 2018.\nUnder the terms of the transaction, Salesforce will commence an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of MuleSoft. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of Salesforce's fiscal year 2019, ending July 31, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the tender by MuleSoft stockholders of shares representing a majority of the MuleSoft common stock voting power, on a one-vote per share basis, and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Stockholders of MuleSoft owning approximately 30% of the outstanding shares have entered into tender and support agreements with Salesforce, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, and subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, to tender their shares of MuleSoft common stock in the exchange offer. Following the successful completion of the exchange offer, MuleSoft shares not tendered in the exchange offer will be converted in a second step merger into the right to receive the same $36.00 in cash and 0.0711 shares of Salesforce common stock, paid in the exchange offer, per MuleSoft share.\nSalesforce expects to fund the cash consideration with cash from its balance sheet and approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from a combination of term loans and/or the issuance of debt securities.
