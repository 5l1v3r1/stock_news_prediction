He also served as chief economic adviser to the then-Prime-Minister Jose Maria Aznar from 2000 to 2004.\nMarried with three children, Escolano will be expected to hold the position until at least the next general election in 2019 or 2020, when the ruling People’s Party (PP) will seek their third term in power.\nReporting by Paul Day; Editing by Julien Toyer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:01:23.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
