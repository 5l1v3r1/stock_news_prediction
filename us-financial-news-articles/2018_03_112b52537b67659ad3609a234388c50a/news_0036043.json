REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Gert-Jan van den Akker told the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne that agricultural markets were tightening and volatility coming back, adding that this was good for traders. Akker said Argentinaâ€™s soybean crop was likely to be between 40 million tonnes and 45 million tonnes this year, down from an initially expected 57 million tonnes. Drought has dented crop prospects in Argentina. The U.S. Department of Agriculture this month forecast a 2017/18 crop of 47 million tonnes, down from an original forecast of 57 million tonnes issued in May last year.
