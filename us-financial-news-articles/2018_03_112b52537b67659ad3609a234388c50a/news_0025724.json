(\"AgroFresh\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: AGFS), a global leader in produce freshness solutions, announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJordi Ferre, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I am pleased to report a solid finish to 2017 and strong momentum as we enter a new growth phase for AgroFresh in 2018. Our core business is healthy. The enhanced overall service offering of our SmartFresh™ Quality System has enabled us to provide our customers with superior product performance, increase penetration into other crops beyond apples and diversify our revenue base. Harvista continues to grow at double-digit rates, and RipeLock is starting to make inroads with large retailers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced the strategic acquisition of Tecnidex Fruit Protection S.A.U., a global leader in the citrus market. As a result of the diversification we have achieved through the Tecnidex acquisition, our increased penetration into new crops, and the success of our SmartFresh™ Quality System, we believe our franchise has never been stronger or better prepared to thrive in a competitive market. In addition, we made a strategic investment in Food Freshness Technologies (“FFT”), which provides us with access to complementary technology that we believe will help us expand into new crops such as berries and avocados, as well as connect with FFT’s roster of leading retailers.\n“This is the beginning of what we expect to be a period of renewed growth at AgroFresh, both organically and through acquisition. Our goal is to significantly grow our share of the highly-fragmented post-harvest food preservation and waste reduction market and introduce new solutions and technologies that can effectively expand the addressable market.\n“We believe that we are well-positioned to achieve this objective, with a core business that generates strong cash flow, a virtually unparalleled IP portfolio, over 20 years of institutional R & D knowledge, and 3,000 direct customers, all of which provide us unique competitive advantages to grow in each stage of the food supply chain. In 2018, we are setting out on an ambitious plan to grow our revenues to as much as $500 million in the next five years as we develop a track record of organic growth and acquisitions. And, our success in 2017 illustrates the strength and long-term potential of the AgroFresh franchise to achieve this goal.”\nFinancial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $54 million, up from $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to the contribution of Tecnidex, acquired in December 2017. Net sales for the full year 2017 were $164 million, up from $160 million in 2016, driven by the contribution of Tecnidex and increased sales of Harvista.\nOperating margins were 79 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 78 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating margins for full year 2017 were 80 percent compared to 81 percent in 2016, excluding the impact of inventory step-up amortization in the first half of 2016. The full year 2017 margins reflect the impact of product mix.\nResearch and development costs of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $18 million in the quarter, up from $13 million a year ago, primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition of Tecnidex, an increase in incentive compensation, along with litigation and SAP implementation related costs.\nInterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $8 million was down $6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by lower accretion of contingent consideration on the Company’s Tax Receivables Agreement with The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) associated with the divestiture of the AgroFresh business by Dow. Cash interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up slightly from the same period a year ago due to higher interest rates. AgroFresh hedged the majority of its variable rate debt in the fourth quarter, which we expect will mitigate future exposure to rising interest rates.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe Company continues to generate strong cash flow, with cash from operations of $39 million in 2017 versus $30 million of cash generated by operations in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the company had cash on hand of $64 million.\nKatherine Harper, CFO, said, “In fiscal 2017, we grew revenues for the first time since 2014, while maintaining our strong margins and generating attractive cash flow. The integration of Tecnidex is going very well, and we expect Tecnidex to grow and create synergies, especially in strengthening our SmartFresh tm Quality System fungicide program that started in 2017 with ActiMist. Costs remain a focus, although a majority of the variance from our expectations this year was due to unusual items, primarily legal and consulting expenses associated with the Tecnidex acquisition and other investments and transactions in 2017. And, despite using $20 million of cash in the Tecnidex acquisition and $10 million for the FFT investment, we still ended the year with $64 million of cash, illustrating the significant cash-flow generation capability of our asset-light model. The evolution of new technologies and the rising cost of food waste is creating a growing demand for new solutions to address the challenge of post-harvest food preservation. Our long history of delivering cost-effective solutions that help get more food from the farm to the table puts us in a unique position to capitalize on the need for creative solutions to more efficiently feed the world.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on March 14, 2018.
