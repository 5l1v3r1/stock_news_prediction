But for that settlement, Impax would have launched its generic version “at-risk” while the litigation continued, they say. \nHayward, California-based Impax denied that there was any such arrangement to delay competition.[nL1N1QU1FY] \nThursday’s settlement came in the third week of the trial and after the plaintiffs finished presenting their evidence against Impax, which in October agreed to combine with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. \n“It’s a fair result,” Douglas Baldridge, a lawyer for Impax, said outside of court. \nThe deal marked the final settlement in the litigation. Impax previously agreed to pay $35 million to resolve class action claims brought on behalf of direct purchasers of Solodyn such as retailers.[nL1N1QS06H] \nMid-trial, Impax on Sunday settled lawsuits by retail pharmacy operators including CVS Health Corp, Rite Aid Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, Kroger Co, Albertsons Companies Inc and HEB Grocery Company LP. Terms were not disclosed. \nValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which acquired Medicis in 2012, said in February it would pay $58 million to resolve related claims. \nJurors had been asked only to determine liability because damages would have been determined at a later trial. \nLawyers for the consumers and insurers had alleged that because of the “pay-for-delay” settlement, they were overcharged by up to $790.3 million, according to an October court ruling. \n“The fact that the case was presented to you had a lot to do with this case settling,” U.S. District Judge Denise Casper told jurors before excusing them on Thursday morning. \nThe case is In re Solodyn (Minocycline Hydrochloride) Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 14-md-02503.
