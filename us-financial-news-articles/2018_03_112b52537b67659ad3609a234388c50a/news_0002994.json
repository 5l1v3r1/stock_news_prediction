(NYSE: AMC) (“AMC” or “the Company”), today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, include the following:\nAMC set fourth quarter records for the three months ended December 31 period for all revenue categories: admissions, food and beverage and other. Much of the growth in revenue is due in large part to the acquisitions of Odeon Cinemas Group (“Odeon”), Carmike Cinemas, Inc. (“Carmike”) and Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”). Total revenues increased 53.0% to $1,416.8 million compared to total revenues of $926.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Total revenues in 2017 included approximately $438.5 million of revenues from our international theatres as compared to $114.1 million in the three-month period a year ago. Admissions revenues increased 52.3% to $897.1 million compared to $588.8 million for the same period a year ago. Food and beverage revenues increased 47.0% to $415.3 million, compared to $282.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Earnings before income taxes grew 13.7% to $14.1 million, compared to $12.4 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net earnings decreased $305.4 million to a net loss of $276.4 million compared to net earnings of $29.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Included in the net loss for the quarter was approximately $310.0 million of tax expense in our U.S. markets related to the impact of the change in the U.S. enacted federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the impact of a full valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets. Diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) decreased $2.43 to a loss of $2.14 per share compared to earnings of $0.29 per share for the same period a year ago. Average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased approximately 28.2% compared to the fourth quarter last year as a result of the successful completion of an equity offering in February 2017, less the effect of 3.2 million shares repurchased during 2017. Total Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased 58.7% to $288.2 million compared to $181.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. International Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter grew $70.2 million to $98.8 million compared to $28.6 million a year ago.\n\"Fiscal year 2017 ended on a very positive note, much like it began, as movie-goers patronized AMC theatres in significant numbers. The acquisitions of Odeon, Carmike and Nordic, and the investments we made during 2017, both domestically and internationally, in food and beverage initiatives, in our signature recliners and in premium sight and sound experiences, together with previously announced revenue enhancements and cost controls drove record revenues and improved operating margins in the fourth quarter,” said Adam Aron, CEO and President of AMC Entertainment. “As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we are pleased and greatly encouraged by the progress we made during and since the fourth quarter of 2017, both operationally and in dealing with several specific industry challenges. And naturally, we are inspired by the record breaking audiences that are coming to our movie theatres across the U.S. and Europe to take in BLACK PANTHER. With more great movies on the horizon, and further investment at AMC in guest heralded amenities, we are increasingly optimistic about the potential for success at AMC Entertainment in 2018 and the years to come.”\nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the following:\nAMC set annual records for the twelve months ended December 31 period for all revenue categories: admissions, food and beverage and other. Total revenues increased 57.0% to $5,079.2 million compared to total revenues of $3,235.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total revenues for 2017 included approximately $1,355.7 million of revenues from our international theatres as compared to $118.9 million in the period a year ago, due to the acquisitions of Odeon and Nordic. Admissions revenues grew 57.6% to $3,229.5 million compared to $2,049.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Food and beverage revenues increased 51.9% to $1,548.4 million, compared to $1,019.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Loss before income taxes increased $482.8 million to $333.1 million, compared to earnings before income taxes of $149.7 million for the same quarter a year ago. Net earnings decreased $598.9 million to a net loss of $487.2 million and diluted earnings per share decreased $4.93 per share to a loss of $3.80 per share compared to net earnings of $111.7 million and net earnings per share of $1.13 per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in the net loss for the year ended 2017 were $208.0 million in pre-tax impairment charges related to the NCM investment and approximately $310.0 million of tax expense related to the impact of the change in the U.S. enacted federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and the impact of a full valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets. Total Adjusted EBITDA (1) grew 36.6% to $822.5 million compared to $602.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. International Adjusted EBITDA grew $184.1 million to $212.5 million compared to $28.4 million in the same period a year ago.\n(1) (Reconciliations and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial schedules accompanying this press release.) CFO Commentary\nCommentary on the quarter by Craig Ramsey, AMC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, is available at http://investor.amctheatres.com .\nAdditional information detailing select unaudited pro forma financial data for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 is included in the fourth quarter 2017 CFO Commentary. The select unaudited pro forma data for the periods combines the historical financial data of operations of AMC, Odeon, Carmike and Nordic, giving effect to the acquisitions, financings and theatre divestitures as if they had been completed on January 1, 2016. The historical consolidated financial information for Odeon and Nordic has been adjusted to comply with U.S. GAAP. The classification of certain items presented by Odeon under U.K. GAAP has been modified in order to align with the presentation used by AMC under U.S. GAAP. The classification of certain items presented by Nordic under IFRS has been modified in order to align with the presentation used by AMC under U.S. GAAP. In addition to the U.S. GAAP adjustments and the reclassifications, amounts have also been translated to U.S. Dollars. The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations would actually have been had the acquisitions occurred on the date indicated. Please refer to the August 1, 2017 Form 8-K and 8-K/A on December 4, 2017 for additional information on pro forma financial statement adjustments.\nUpdate of Share Repurchase Program\nOn August 3, 2017, AMC announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company’s Class A common stock over a two-year period.\nAs of March 1, 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 50% of the authorized $100 million, having purchased more than 3.2 million shares of AMC’s Class A common stock for approximately $47.5 million, representing an average share price of $14.86.\nDividends\nOn October 27, 2017, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, which was paid on December 18, 2017, to shareholders of record on December 4, 2017. The total dividends paid in the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately $25.9 million.\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, payable on March 26, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 12, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Tax Reform Act of 2017 was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018.\nIncome taxes for the first nine months of 2017 were recorded using an estimated effective tax rate of 39%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined in accordance with accounting standards that a valuation allowance or reserve against our deferred tax assets was required. Our deferred tax assets primarily relate to deferred revenue and lease accounting items.\nBased on the resulting impact of the passage of the Tax Reform Act and the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $310.0 million to the income tax provision in our U.S. markets for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nGoing forward we expect our consolidated effective tax rate to be between 22% and 26%.\nConference Call / Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call via webcast for investors and other interested parties beginning at 7:30 a.m. CST/8:30 a.m. EST on Thursday, March 1, 2018.

as a supplemental measure of our performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in international markets and any cash distributions of earnings from other equity method investees. These further adjustments are itemized above. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides management and investors with additional information to measure our performance and estimate our value. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example,\nAdjusted EBITDA:\ndoes not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; does not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; excludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; does not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; and does not reflect the impact of divestitures that may be required in connection with recently completed acquisitions.\n2) Amounts represent preopening expense related to temporarily closed screens under renovation, theatre and other closure expense for the permanent closure of screens including the related accretion of interest, non-cash deferred digital equipment rent expense, and disposition of assets and other non-operating gains or losses included in operating expenses. The Company has excluded these items as they are non-cash in nature, include components of interest cost for the time value of money or are non-operating in nature. 3) Equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities includes an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $208.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in NCM to Level 1 fair value during the year ended December 31, 2017. An other-than-temporary impairment charge of $204.5 million was recorded on our units and shares at the publicly Quote: d per share price on June 30, 2017, of $7.42 and an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.5 million was recorded on our units and shares at the publicly Quote: d per share price on December 31, 2017 of $6.86, based on our determination that the decline in the price per share during the respective quarters was other than temporary. Equity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities includes loss on the sale of a portion of our investment in NCM of $22.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. 4) Includes U.S. non-theatre distributions from equity method investments and International non-theatre distributions from equity method investments to the extent received. The Company believes including cash distributions is an appropriate reflection of the contribution of these investments to its operations. 5) Attributable EBITDA includes the EBITDA from minority equity investments in theatre operators in certain international markets. See below for a reconciliation of the Company’s equity earnings of non-consolidated entities to attributable EBITDA. Because these equity investments are in theatre operators in regions where the Company holds a significant market share, the Company believes attributable EBITDA is more indicative of the performance of these equity investments and management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate these equity investments.
