At the next meeting we may be able to sign an agreement,” ANPAC official Riccardo Canestrari told Reuters following a meeting with Ryanair management.\nAt a press conference in Rome, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O‘Leary said he hoped to sign an agreement at their next meeting with the airline’s management in two weeks’ time.\nThe airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognize pilots’ unions for the first time in its 32-year history and is talking with unions across Europe on formal recognition.\nBut progress had been slow and O‘Leary has warned that the company may face strike action at Easter or the summer.\nA union representing Ryanair cabin crew in Portugal this week announced it would hold three one-day strikes during the Easter holidays.\nManagement hopes that by reaching quick agreement with unions in its largest markets that it can avoid widespread disruption.\nANPAC’s Canestrari said that the union was negotiating a common pay scale for Ryanair pilots across Italy, its second biggest market, as well as other working conditions such as tax, paternal leave and rostering.\nHe said his understanding was that on completion of the agreement, the union would become the only official representative body for Ryanair pilots in Italy, replacing the airline’s Employee Representative Committees - a key demand by pilots in other jurisdictions.\nThe unofficial pan-European EERC body set up by pilots could have a role in pan-European questions like the transfer of pilots between jurisdictions, but primary negotiations on working conditions would take place with national unions, Canestrari said.\nO‘Leary said Ryanair was also negotiating with Italy’s ANPAV flight assistants’ union and hopes to reach a deal with them too shortly.\nReporting by Alberto Sisto in Rome and Conor Humphries in Dublin; Editing by Crispian Balmer and Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:15:13.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
