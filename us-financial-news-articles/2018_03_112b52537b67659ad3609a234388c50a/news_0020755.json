The pace of consumer price gains in the 12 months through February slowed to 5.34 percent, the national statistics agency said. That was just below analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for 5.37 percent and down from a 5.55 percent rate in January. Last month, Mexico's central bank raised interest rates to a nine-year high and said it could act again, if needed, to contain worries that inflation may not cool as quickly as forecast. The annual rate of core inflation , which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.27 percent. That was down from 4.56 percent in January, and below 4.29 percent rate forecast by analysts. Consumer prices rose 0.38 percent in February from the prior month, while the core index rose 0.49 percent during the month .
