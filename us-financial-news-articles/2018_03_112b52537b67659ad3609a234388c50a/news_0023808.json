It aims to reach more customers online with the Farfetch deal, through which it will offer a selection of items.\nThe companies also said in a statement they would “explore additional retail and technology initiatives” in the United Kingdom.\nLondon-based Farfetch is working with French fashion house Chanel, for instance, on store technology that will give customers ways of signalling their preferences or sizes through an app, or of chatting virtually with shop assistants.\nUnlike some online retailers, Farfetch does not stock inventory, instead connecting shoppers with items sold by boutiques or brands.
