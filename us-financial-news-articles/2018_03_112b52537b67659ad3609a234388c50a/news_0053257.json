(TSXV: DAP.U), a leading supplier of automotive paint protection and window films, announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nRevenues increased 52.7% to $20.2 million compared to fourth quarter 2016; Sequential revenue growth of 13.5% compared to third quarter of 2017 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 21.1% as a percentage of revenue Finalized Product Consolidation, Facility Consolidation and Sales and Operations Reorganization; Seeing Positive Impact In Q1 2018\nRevenues for the quarter grew 52.7% to $20.2 million. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 22.6% as compared to 23.9% in the prior quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $4.3 million, or 21.1% of revenue, as compared to $3.4 million, or 25.6% of revenue, in the prior year quarter. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) increased $0.9 million to $1.0 million compared to $0.1 million in the prior year quarter. Net income was $.004 million compared to a net loss of ($.09) million in the prior year quarter.\nThe Company generated $7.5 million in operating cash flow for the quarter which was used to fund ongoing working capital needs and to reduce its line of credit borrowings by $4.0 million.\nThe Company incurred certain one-time costs totaling $0.6 million during the quarter related to the consolidation of its product lines, the consolidation of its three existing warehouse facilities into a single facility in San Antonio and the restructuring of its sales and operations. Adjusting for these non-recurring costs, fourth quarter gross profit as a percentage of revenue would have been 24.9%, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales would have decreased to 20.3%, EBITDA would have been $1.6 million and Net Income would have been $0.45 million.\nMr. Ryan Pape, President and Chief Executive Officer of XPEL, commented, “We are seeing the positive impact we anticipated from our consolidation and reorganization initiatives and we expect continued strong growth in revenue and significant improvement in bottom line results in 2018. The consolidation of some of our legacy paint protection film lines allows us to enhance our product efficiency by removing our lowest margin products and the working capital requirements associated with them.\nMr. Pape continued, “During fiscal 2017 we delivered strong growth driven by robust demand for our paint protection and window film and we completed three acquisitions in key strategic areas. We remain focused on leveraging the strength of our brand and our unique service model.”\nFor the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017:\nRevenues. Revenues increased approximately $6.99 million to $20.2 million, or 52.7% over the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenues grew 51.2% to $20.10 million.\nGross Margin.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.9 million or 26.2% vs. prior year period and decreased as a percentage of sales to 21.1% of sales from 25.6% of sales in the prior year. This increase was due mainly to increases in personnel, occupancy, sales and marketing and travel related costs to support the ongoing growth of the business as well as increases in intercompany shipping expense related to the transfer of inventory to our various warehouses to support the needs of our customers. Additionally, the company changed its depreciation method from double declining balance to straight line resulting in additional depreciation expense of approximately $0.09 million vs. prior year quarter.\nEBITDA.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.7 million or 35.1% vs. prior year period and increased as a percentage of sales to 21.5% of sales from 20.8% of sales in the prior year.

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is a useful measure to allow period-to-period comparison of the Company’s operating performance. EBITDA does not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and is not necessarily comparable to measures presented by other Companies. EBITDA excludes components that are significant in understanding and assessing our results of operations and cash flows. EBITDA does not represent funds available for Management's discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations. EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for Net Income prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\nEBITDA Reconciliation\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2016\nTwelve Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017\nTwelve Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet (loss) income 4,252 (22,881 ) 1,134,344 2,163,500 Interest 142,914 42,891 337,670 223,045 Taxes 335,122 (226,806 ) 1,029,490 866,075 Depreciation 224,663 80,695 748,364 299,625 Amortization 310,648 218,663 1,017,646 840,501 EBITDA 1,017,599 92,561 4,267,514 4,392,746\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328005404/en/\nXPEL Technologies Corp.\nInvestor Relations:\nInstitutional Marketing Services (IMS)\nJohn Nesbett/Jennifer Belodeau, 203-972-9200\njnesbett@institutionalms.com\nSource: XPEL Technologies Corp.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xpel.com&esheet=51780117&newsitemid=20180328005404&lan=en-US&anchor=www.xpel.com&index=2&md5=6d299f7a4ef26b841c434d61fd5ff18e", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328005404/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xpel.com%2Finvestor&esheet=51780117&newsitemid=20180328005404&lan=en-US&anchor=www.xpel.com%2Finvestor&index=1&md5=f2921161580b810bc3779851cf079870"], "published": "2018-03-28T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:03:36.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
