It’s not a question of love, rather what I feel I have to do. I honestly feel that injury permitting I’d be in the starting 11 for Barca over the next two seasons,” Iniesta said. “If I go it’ll be because I can’t give my all as a player and person at my club. It’s going to be a difficult decision, whatever I choose.” Reporting by Joseph Cassinelli; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T13:52:16.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
