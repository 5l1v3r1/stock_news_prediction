The investigation is in relation to the preparation and approval of the financial statements of Carillion for theyears 2014 to 2016, the first half of 2017 and the preparation and reporting of other financial information during the period 2014-2017, the watchdog said. The FRC said it is liaising with UK’s Official Receiver, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Insolvency Service and The Pensions Regulator to ensure a “joined-up approach” to the investigation of matters arising from the collapse of Carillion.
