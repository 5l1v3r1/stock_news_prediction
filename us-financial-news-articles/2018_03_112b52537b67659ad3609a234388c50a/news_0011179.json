Moelis declined to comment.\nPeers as well as private equity groups will be targeted in the sale, the sources said.\nIGM Resins’ rivals include Advent-owned Allnex, France’s Arkema ( AKE.PA ) and Netherlands-based DSM ( DSMN.AS ). It was unclear whether any of them would bid for the company.\nIGM Resins was founded in 1999 as a one-man chemical company start-up.\nIt produces photoinitiators, monomers, oligomers and additives. Arsenal bought a majority stake in 2012.\nIn 2016, IGM bought a BASF ( BASFn.DE ) unit making photoinitiators, which are used in radiation-curing formulations in various industries.\nReporting by Ludwig Burger and Arno Schuetze; editing by Tom Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T13:01:59.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
