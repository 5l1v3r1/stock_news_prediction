Charitable organizations and wealthy individuals have invested about A$20 million, the study said.\nWhile social impact investing is “increasingly of interest in relation to homelessness and housing vulnerability, its application to affordable housing supply has not attracted the same kind of policy attention,” the study said.\nDiscussion around these investments reflects “a deep concern about the lack of affordable housing stock and mounting frustration at the lack of opportunities for investment.”\nLow interest rates have fueled a surge in home prices in Australia, with prices in Sydney and Melbourne having more than doubled since 2009.\nThere are more than 105,000 homeless people in the country, according to the charity Homelessness Australia, which cites “the chronic shortage of affordable and available rental housing” as a main reason.\nThe A$1.5 billion of social impact investment probably funded the construction of 500 houses, said Andrea Sharam at RMIT University in Melbourne, one of the authors of the report.\nThree of Australia’s biggest banks, and some smaller regional and cooperative banks have been investing in community housing for the past 10 years, she said.\nBut government assistance is needed to encourage more social impact investing in the sector.\nMeasures could include using well-located public land for affordable housing, and changing the zoning on existing redevelopment sites to include such accommodation, she said.\nThe use of government land “is a reasonable ask as not all surplus land will be viable for commercial needs,” Sharam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAffordable housing is key as “there is a need for certain key workers such as cleaners, who commercial tenants need, to be housed nearby as public transport hours to fringe areas is grossly inadequate for shift workers,” she said.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
