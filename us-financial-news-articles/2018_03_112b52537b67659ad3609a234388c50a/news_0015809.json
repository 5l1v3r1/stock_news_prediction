FILE PHOTO: Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski arrives to meet with the House Intelligence Committee, about their ongoing probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S., January 17, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files Lewandowski arrived at around 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) and was expected to talk to panel members behind closed doors until about 2 p.m. (1900 GMT). Lewandowski, who helped Trump win the Republican presidential nomination, last met with the committee on January 17. He could be one of the last major witnesses before House Intelligence as it looks into allegations that Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. campaign by hacking Democrats’ emails and using social media to spread propaganda and misleading reports, and the possibility that Trump associates may have colluded with Moscow.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files Russia denies meddling. Trump has denied collusion between his associates and Russia. Reflecting a deep partisan divide on the committee, Republicans - who have a majority in the House and thus control the committee’s actions - have been saying they expect to wrap up their investigation soon and begin to work on their report. But Democrats have said they have a significant list of witnesses still to call, as well as documents to subpoena. Lewandowski ran Trump’s campaign for around 18 months but he was fired in June 2016 after he clashed with other advisers over how to appeal to the broader general electorate after Trump won the nomination.
