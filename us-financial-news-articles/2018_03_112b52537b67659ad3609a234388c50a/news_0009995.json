Analysts had hoped it would join its peers Omnicom and IPG in sounding more upbeat about 2018.\nFor 2017, net sales were down 0.9 percent on a like-for-like basis, against a forecast of flat growth. For 2018, it said it was budgeting for both revenue and net sales to be flat, with headline operating margin also flat in constant currency.
