The service will roll out to more cities in the coming days, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge, as part of a push to expand the service to most Target stores nationwide by the end of the year.\nLast year, Target acquired Shipt, which offered same-day delivery for a variety of retailers, including Kroger and Costco , for $550 million . Shipt continues to serve retailers other than Target .\nTo use the service, Target customers pay $99 annually for an unlimited number of deliveries. Orders of $35 or more are free as part of that subscription while customers who place smaller orders must pay $7.\nShipt is the latest in a string of efforts by Walmart and Target to compete against Amazon . The e-commerce giant has attracted shoppers with its Prime delivery service, which costs $99 annually and allows for free two-day delivery. Amazon is also moving into same-day delivery in certain U.S. markets to compete with big-box retailers that offer same-day access to products.\n newsletter\nStill, there are plenty of customers who are willing to wait a day or two for their orders to be delivered instead of shopping in stores. To attract those customers who might not want to go to a store and top Amazon’s two-day Prime shipping, Target and Walmart are turning to same-day delivery.\nIn a statement earlier this week, Target said that Shipt’s same-day delivery is available for more than 55,000 products. By the end of next year, every “major” product category at Target will be included in the service.", "external_links": ["https://www.shipt.com/", "https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/27/1395831/0/en/Shipt-and-Target-to-Launch-Same-day-Delivery-Across-Louisiana.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T01:17:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
