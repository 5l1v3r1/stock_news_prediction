It was not immediately what conditions the pilots were being offered to fly for Swoop.\nALPA had argued that pilots who work for the new no-frills carrier should have the same working conditions as those who fly WestJet planes, with the union arguing they should all have the same contract.\nIn its March 2 order, seen by Reuters, the Canada Industrial Relations Board, or CIRB, told WestJet to “rescind the offer of a two-year leave of absence policy ... in order to fly for Swoop.”\nThe decision risks complicating expansion plans by Calgary-based WestJet, which is growing its international network while launching the no-frills carrier in June, raising analyst concerns.\nWestJet spokeswoman Lauren Stewart said by email that Swoop’s launch remained on track and that the carrier “remains committed to engaging in constructive dialogue with” the pilots’ union.\nAltaCorp analyst Chris Murray said by email that it was still too early to determine the “impact this could have on timing or costs, but certainly continues to add to the complexity.”\nReporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by David Gregorio and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T00:54:38.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
