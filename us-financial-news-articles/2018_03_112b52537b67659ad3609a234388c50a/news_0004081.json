We look back at some notable clashes between the sides. Watford 5 West Brom 1 (First Division, Aug. 1985) Striker Colin West scored with two spectacular headers before wrapping up his hat-trick with a cool tap-in from goalkeeper Tony Coton’s drop kick, building a platform for Watford’s biggest victory over West Brom at Vicarage Road. Steve Terry and Brian Talbot both latched onto deliveries from John Barnes to score goals off the underside of the bar, while West Brom’s only goal came from striker Imre Varadi. West Brom struggled for the majority of the season and were relegated from the top flight after recording just four victories in 42 matches. Watford 3 West Brom 3 (Second Division, Dec. 2000) In a contest littered with defensive errors, the hosts took the lead at Vicarage Road after Tony Butler scored an own goal from a low cross from Watford’s Tommy Smith in the second minute. After 26 minutes, striker Tommy Mooney doubled Watford’s lead with a lob from nearly 30 metres over goalkeeper Brian Jensen, who was off his line. Lee Hughes launched the comeback for the visitors after the interval with a close-range finish and were helped further by Watford goalkeeper Espen Baardsen, who gifted West Brom an equaliser for 2-2 by punching the ball into his own net. Jason Roberts earned West Brom a deserved lead but they surrendered the opportunity to claim all three points as Smith netted the game’s sixth goal from Butler’s attempted back pass. Watford 1 West Brom 0 (FA Cup, Jan. 2003) Heidar Helguson’s 10th goal of the season ensured second-tier Watford went through to the fifth round of the FA Cup at the expense of Premier League strugglers West Brom, who were now without a win for 11 away matches in all competitions. West Brom goalkeeper Russell Hoult had kept the visitors in the match with a string of impressive saves, including a penalty stop from Neil Cox. But Hoult could do nothing about Iceland international Helguson’s 80th-minute winner following splendid run from winger Jermaine Pennant. Watford went on to reach their first FA Cup semi-final in 16 years where they were beaten by Southampton, while West Brom were relegated from the top division at the end of the campaign. West Brom 5 Watford 0 (Championship, Oct. 2009) Roberto Di Matteo’s extra shooting sessions paid dividends for West Brom as they returned to the top of the second division standings with five different goalscorers contributing in a clinical demolition of Watford at the Hawthorns. The hosts took the early lead when Jonas Olsson headed in a Graham Dorrans’ free kick before Adrian Mariappa fouled Luke Moore and Dorrans scored from the penalty spot. Mariappa and Danny Graham missed chances for the visitors but Moore did not miss from close range to make it 3-0 and the rout was completed with two stunning long-range strikes from Gianni Zuiverloon and Simon Cox. Di Matteo’s first season in charge ended in an automatic promotion to the Premier League for the third time in eight years after they finished the season second behind Newcastle United. West Brom 0 Watford 1 (Premier League, April 2016) History repeated itself for Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes who saved two Saido Berahino penalties as the visitors hung on for a narrow win against West Brom at the Hawthorns. Gomes became the first goalkeeper to save two spot kicks in two Premier League games after first achieving the feat playing for Tottenham Hotspur against Sunderland in 2010. In a game which lacked clear cut chances from open play, Ben Watson produced a brilliant finish from Adlene Guedioura’s low corner in the 27th minute as Quique Sanchez Flores’s side moved beyond the magical 40-point mark in the top division. Watford made an FA Cup semi-final appearance and finished 13th in the league, two points and a place above Tony Pulis’ West Brom.
