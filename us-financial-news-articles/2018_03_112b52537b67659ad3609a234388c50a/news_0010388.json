REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo The drug regulator said the test, which work by analyzing DNA collected from saliva samples, provides genetic risk information but cannot determine a person’s overall risk of developing a disease or condition.\nThe test detects only three out of more than 1,000 known BRCA mutations and are not the most common ones in the general population, the drug regulator said.\nBRCA mutations account for about 50 percent of hereditary breast cancers and up to 65 percent of those who inherit the mutations will develop breast cancer.\nThe regulator said it reviewed data for the company’s test under a regulatory pathway for low-to-moderate risk devices that are not equivalent to an already marketed device.\nThe agency also set a condition known as special controls, clarifying its expectations for assuring test accuracy and reliability.\nReporting by Akankshita Mukhopadhyay in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T19:59:28.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
