Market participants estimated that the change could trigger about 580 billion yen ($5.44 billion) of selling by passive investors.\n$1 = 106.6700 yen Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T09:29:48.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
