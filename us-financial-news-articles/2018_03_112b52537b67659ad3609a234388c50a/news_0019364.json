Unlocking Upside In Uber Shares , include the following:\nSoftBank can bring order to Uber and the chaos of the ridesharing industry. After the most recent series G-1 financing, Uber has raised more than $14 billion in primary financing. SoftBank has now invested more than $20 billion in ridesharing companies, including DiDi, Grab, and Ola. SoftBank could play a key role in the industry’s upcoming consolidation and maturation. Uber’s sum-of-parts valuation analysis reveals upside potential. Uber could unlock greater shareholder value if it divests or spins off its self-driving car business, as well as its operations in India and other parts of Southeast Asia. SharesPost estimates that Uber’s non-core assets could be worth more than $17 billion. With its $54 billion blended valuation after the SoftBank investment, SharesPost estimates that Uber’s core business is potentially valued at $32 billion—nearly three times the company’s estimated net revenues for 2018. New CEO readies Uber for IPO. Even with major, back-to-back successes, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s pre-IPO, to-do list remains long. His next step should be prioritizing internal team-building and employee morale over external corporate development initiatives or media/investor relations.\nTo view recent SharesPost research reports click here .\nAbout SharesPost, Inc.\nSharesPost is an SEC-registered broker-dealer, investment advisor and an approved Alternative Trading System.
