As I said all along, these claims were completely baseless. Yesterday Judge Daniels agreed.”\nDaniels’ decision is a setback for the SEC, which brought the case as part of its “Aberrational Performance Inquiry,” an initiative to crack down on hedge funds posting returns that looked suspicious.\nThe regulator accused Yorkville, which typically invested in small start-ups or troubled companies, of ignoring “obvious decreases” in asset values to lure investors.\nIt said this enabled the Jersey City, New Jersey-based firm to raise more than $280 million from pension funds and funds of funds, and collect $10 million of undeserved fees.\nYorkville allegedly inflated the value of 15 holdings, out of 265, representing one-third of its asset base, court papers show. The alleged scheme ran from April 2008 to January 2010, the SEC said.\nDaniels said the SEC could pursue claims that Yorkville misled investors into believing it was using Pluris Valuation Advisors LLC to help price some investments after having decided to stop because it thought Pluris’ valuations were too low.\nThe judge also let the SEC pursue a claim that Angelo misled an investor in December 2008 by allegedly saying his funds had “about $100 million in cash.”\nThe case is SEC v Yorkville Advisors LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-07728.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T22:39:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
