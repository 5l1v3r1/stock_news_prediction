And when his opportunity came, he took it and he won.\"\nAnother administration official told CNBC that Cohn's resignation is \"a huge victory for the nationalists.\"\n\"Peter Navarro won the trade battle and now Gary's given up,\" that administration official said. \"It literally reestablishes the intellectual framework and the personnel who were originally envisioned after Trump won the election. We can let Trump be Trump.\"\nPossible Cohn replacements Navarro and Larry Kudlow, a prominent conservative and CNBC contributor, will likely be candidates for Cohn's job.\nThe second administration official played down the likelihood of Kudlow assuming the economic advisor role, however. Kudlow has been vocal in his opposition to the president's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum.\nA senior administration official said Cohn's departure came after 4-5 weeks of conversations between Cohn and the president about Cohn's role, including discussions of higher level opportunities within the administration.\nThe official said Cohn has offered to help Trump in selecting a successor, but has not yet suggested a specific name.\nThe official said Cohn's departure had less to do with the tariff disagreement and was a mutual agreement in the wake of the extended conversation about his future.\nWATCH: Cohn's departure strong indicator Trump will go through with Tariffs show chapters Cohn's departure strong indicator Trump will go through with tariffs 3 Hours Ago | 04:46", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T04:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T04:11:08.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
