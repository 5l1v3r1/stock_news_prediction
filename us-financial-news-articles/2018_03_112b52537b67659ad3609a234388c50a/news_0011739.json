They swept the season series from Washington, having recorded a 65-40 trouncing in Eugene, Ore., in February.\nThe Huskies (20-11, 10-8), who won their 20th game Thursday night against Oregon State, fell into a tie with Oregon in the final Pac-12 standings after having begun the day in a four-way tie for third place with UCLA, Utah and Stanford.\nOregon’s dominance began almost immediately, with MiKyle McIntosh connecting on a 3-point basket before teammates Paul White and Kenny Wooten added 2-point hoops in a 7-0 burst that turned a two-point deficit into a 9-4 lead.\nThe Ducks, who won for just the third time in nine road conference games, never trailed after that point.\nOregon broke the game open by scoring the last nine points of the first half to go up 44-29 at the intermission. Troy Brown had a basket, Keith Smith a hoop and two free throws and Payton Pritchard a 3-pointer in the back-breaking, 9-0 flurry.\nThe Huskies got as close as 68-64 on a pair of free throws by Noah Dickerson with still 3:12 to play.\nBut Oregon forced turnovers on Washington’s next two possessions, and Wooten got a key block on Jaylen Nowell in the final minute, setting up a pair of clinching free throws by White.\nPritchard had a team-high 14 points for Oregon, which was coming off a 78-76 loss at Washington State on Thursday.\nThe sophomore guard collected 12 of his 14 points on four 3-pointers on a day in which Oregon made 11 of its 23 3-point attempts, outscoring the hosts 33-15 from beyond the arc.\nWhite (13 points) and Brown (12) also scored in double figures for the Ducks, who outrebounded the Huskies 37-29. McIntosh was the team’s leading rebounder with seven, while White collected a game-high six assists.\nDavid Crisp was the game’s top scorer with 19 points and Dickerson added 18 for Washington, which had won its previous two games. Dickerson went 10-for-11 at the free throw line and also snatched a game-high eight rebounds.\nNowell added 12 points for the Huskies, who gave starts to their only two seniors — Greg Bowman and Dan Kingma — in the final home game of their college careers.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:55:13.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
