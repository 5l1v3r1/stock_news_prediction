Kyle Lowry posted 15 points, six rebounds, 15 assists and four steals, Norman Powell had 17 points and Jonas Valanciunas added 14 points and 11 rebounds for Toronto.\nBlake Griffin’s 31 points led Detroit, which has dropped four straight and 10 of 12. Reggie Bullock contributed 21 points, Ish Smith and James Ennis added 14 points apiece and Andre Drummond had 10 points and 21 rebounds.\nRaptors power forward Serge Ibaka was ejected in the second quarter for arguing with the officials.\nNeither side scored in overtime until Drummond was called for goaltending against Pascal Siakim with 2:01 left. Smith answered with a jumper but DeRozan responded with a three-point play.\nGriffin’s three with 36.8 seconds left tied it at 119-all.\nBullock missed on an open three and DeRozan then penetrated and kicked it out to VanVleet on the left side for the game-winner.\nGriffin’s 3-point try at the buzzer bounced off the rim.\nIbaka was tossed with 4:38 remaining in the second quarter after he picked up his third foul. That came at the tail end of a 22-2 Pistons outburst that gave them a 48-31 lead.\nThe game took a dramatic turn in the third quarter, as the Raptors outscored the Pistons 40-25.\nSmith drilled a three to tie the game at 109-all in the late going. DeRozan then fired in a shot from the left side with the shot clock running and 18.2 seconds remaining. Griffin responded with a shot in the lane while getting fouled by Siakam. His subsequent free throw gave Detroit a one-point lead.\nWith the Raptors out of timeouts, DeRozan went coast-to-coast for a dunk and got fouled by Anthony Tolliver in the process. He then made the free throw with 4.6 seconds left.\nFollowing a timeout, Griffin made a hook shot to send the game into overtime.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:32:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
