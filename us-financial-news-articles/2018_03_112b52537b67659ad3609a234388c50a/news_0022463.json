SXSW Interactive continues into this week, and experiential marketers have gone wild again. From HBO re-creating the town featured in “Westworld” to a “Ready Player One” pop-up party hangout with virtual reality activations and Google’s giant connected house , there’s plenty to take in beyond the conference stages.\nLet’s Play Ball Facebook’s biggest leap into live sports streaming so far is stepping up a gear. Having signed a nonexclusive deal to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games last year, the social network has obtained exclusive rights to show 25 games , beginning in April, in a deal valued at $30 million to $35 million, Bloomberg reports. This season’s MLB games add to a growing sports lineup on Facebook that includes UEFA Champions League soccer and college basketball. Recode reports that for now, Facebook’s MLB games won’t carry commercials , so it seems the intention is to draw audiences to the Watch section and perhaps encourage viewing of its wider slate of programming. Facebook’s new deal includes only afternoon games this time around, which may mean a digital platform is better suited than the TV screen for people who want to watch while at their desks. What’ll also be interesting for marketers to follow is how Facebook and MLB Network experiment with new formats, such as social integrations and interactive graphics.\nAutomatic For the People I’ve lost count of the times I’ve had to rush to hit the mute button after being surprised and certainly not delighted by a surprise autoplay video ad. But perhaps I won’t need to continue sharpening my reflexes. Muted autoplay ads are in vogue , and they’re here to stay, Digiday reports. A Digiday survey of more than 50 publisher executives found 60% of publishers are using the format to ramp up their digital video views. But how effective are they for advertisers? Some executives argue the rush to the format is a short-term grab for metrics from under-pressure publishers. “It’s an engineered feel-good factor, an artificial bubble,” said Alessandro De Zanche, an independent consultant and former News UK executive. Ad buyers say the average price for muted autoplay and click-to-play formats are around the same, at roughly $21 CPM, so there’s little incentive for publishers to wean themselves from muted autoplay. That might change as more research is released, offering better data on the relative effectiveness of each type of video ad.\nCut the Deck “Tweetdecking” is a term so new it’s probably not entered most marketers’ lexicons yet—and, thanks to action taken by Twitter over the weekend, the practice might already be on the way out. As BuzzFeed reported in January , Tweetdecking is a scrappy form of influencer marketing where people form secret groups on the Twitter-owned platform and manufacture virality by agreeing to mass-retweet content. Some Tweetdeckers were claiming to make thousands of dollars a month by charging brands and individuals for retweets. On Friday, Twitter suspended a number of hugely popular accounts, allegedly known for stealing other people’s jokes and memes , that were also reportedly Tweetdeckers. BuzzFeed News says the accounts—which include those with millions of followers, such as @Dory and @GirlPosts—were suspended for violating Twitter’s spam policy.\nDown In the Tube Station at Midnight YouTube Chief Business Officer Robert Kyncl has been with the Google-owned video company for nearly eight years, and he probably wouldn’t argue that the past 12 months were the most challenging. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Kyncl touches upon some of YouTube’s recent blips . On the controversial Logan Paul suicide victim video, Mr. Kyncl says YouTube “should have done better,” noting that while the company was quick with its PR response, it was slow on social. YouTube currently has a “three strikes and you’re out” discipline policy with badly behaving creators, but Mr. Kyncl hints the company will have more to announce about its procedures later this year. As for the work YouTube has done to calm the disquiet from both marketers after their ads were found appearing next to unsavory content and from creators who were upset after their videos were demonetized, Mr. Kyncl said, “We have a tremendous group of people all around Google who have been working on these things, day and night, through holidays, et cetera. If I had to go back, we couldn’t have done it differently.”\nCorrection:\nFriday’s newsletter contained a typo: I misspelled the name of the movie “Black Panther.” Apologies for the error.\nBest of the rest Dentsu Aegis Network and its digital subsidiary Accordant Media are looking to buy more ads directly from publishers, cutting out the ad-tech middlemen.
