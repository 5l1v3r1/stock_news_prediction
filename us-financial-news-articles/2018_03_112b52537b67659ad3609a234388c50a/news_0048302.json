The group included 27 Guatemalan nationals, 5 Mexican nationals and 2 Honduran nationals,” Mack said. \nAll 34 were detained for violations associated with the failed human smuggling operation and processed for removal. “The investigation into the smuggling activity is ongoing,” Mack said. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has ordered stricter immigration enforcement.
