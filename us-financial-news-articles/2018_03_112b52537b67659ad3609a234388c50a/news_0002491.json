U.S. stock indexes fell sharply, with the S&P 500 .SPX index down more than 1.5 percent in what would be a third consecutive day of losses.\nIn his testimony, Powell described trade as a “net positive” while conceding it created some losers in the economy, and said “the tariff approach is not the best approach. The best approach is to deal directly with the people who are affected rather than falling back on tariffs.”\nThe Fed is expected to increase rates at its March 20-21 policy meeting. Policymakers will also issue fresh forecasts that will indicate whether the core of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee has shifted its view.\n‘APPROPRIATE PATH’\nPowell’s twin appearances this week showed that he and the rest of the Fed are wrestling over how to square an economy that is strong on many levels, and possibly about to get at least a short-term boost from tax cuts, but still lacks the kind of inflation and wage gains that would prompt faster Fed action on rates.\nTo some policymakers, the absence of price pressures means the Fed should stand back, wait for wages to gain steam, and give workers a chance to make up ground lost due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and its aftermath even at the risk of faster inflation in the future.\n“Similar numbers of participants see upside risk to the outlook and downside risks on inflation,” analysts from Barclays wrote in a recent note. “If policy is to move faster, or slower, one of these groups needs to gain additional members.”\nEarlier on Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months. The report added to the sense that inflation is moving up to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nIn prepared remarks for his testimony this week, Powell pledged to “strike a balance” between avoiding any rapid rise in prices while keeping the recovery on track in the hope that the tight job market finally produces significant wage gains.\nHe also acknowledged, in response to lawmakers’ questions, that the labor market may have room to strengthen further, given uncertainty about the level of “full employment,” a concept generally associated with faster rising wages and prices.\nThough the current U.S. unemployment rate of 4.1 percent was “at or near or even below” many estimates of the full employment rate, “we don’t see any evidence of a decisive move up in wages ... Nothing in that suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration,” Powell told the Senate panel on Thursday.\nPowell said risks are “more two-sided” now than early in the recovery, adding that “the thing we don’t want to have happen is to get behind the curve.”\nBut he said at this point the Fed could continue “to gradually raise interest rates ... That is the path we have been on and my expectation is that will continue to be the appropriate path.”\nSince Powell’s appearance before the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, markets have been looking for clarity over whether the Fed will accelerate the pace of its rate increases this year.\nPowell’s bullish comments about the economy on Tuesday sparked a jump in U.S. bond yields and drop in stocks.\nReporting by Howard Schneider; Additional reporting by Pete Schroeder and Jason Lange in Washington, Jonathan Spicer in New York and Ann Saphir in San Francisco; Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T19:54:55.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
