REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins \nDeadly riots are common in Venezuela’s lawless prisons, where inmates often openly wield machine guns and use drugs. But the death toll in the decrepit city of Valencia, once a thriving industrial hub, in Wednesday’s riot was particularly shocking. \nIn Geneva, the United Nations human rights office called on authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims’ families. \n“We urge the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a prompt, thorough and effective investigation to establish the cause of these deaths, provide reparations to the victims’ families, and, where applicable, identify and bring those responsible to justice,” the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement voicing concern at prison conditions.
