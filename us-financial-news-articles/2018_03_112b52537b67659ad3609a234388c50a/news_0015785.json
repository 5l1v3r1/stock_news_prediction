In 2016, the coast guard sank a Chinese trawler it said was fishing illegally in its territorial waters.\nAfter detecting the Jing Yuan last month, the coast guard said it called on the boat to stop moving, at which point it turned off its lights and tried to escape into international waters.\nAn Argentine coast guard vessel pursued the boat and fired warning shots, but it said four other boats tried to collide with its vessel to prevent the Jing Yuan from being captured. The Foreign Ministry called off the operation after eight hours.\nArgentina’s coast is rich in squid, hake and prawns.\nChina has the world’s largest and farthest-ranging fishing operation, with 2,500 vessels logging approximately 17 million hours of fishing in 2016, mostly off the southern coast of their home country but also in Africa and South America.\nLast year, Chinese trawlers were seized off Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau over illegal fishing.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Matthew Lewis\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T00:54:34.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
