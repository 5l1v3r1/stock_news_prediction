The other six are American Samoa, Guam, Namibia, Palau, Samoa and Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe document, prepared by EU officials and dated March 8, also adds Anguilla, The British Virgin Islands, Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda to a so-called grey list of jurisdictions which do not respect EU anti-tax avoidance standards but have committed to change their practices.\nThe grey list includes dozens of jurisdictions from all over the world.\nBlacklisted jurisdictions could face reputational damage and stricter controls on their financial transactions with the EU, although no sanctions have been agreed by EU states yet.\nThose who are in the grey list could be moved to the blacklist if they do not honor their commitments.\nCaribbean islands hit by hurricanes last year were given more time to comply with EU tax transparency standards when the bloc’s blacklist was established in December.\nEarlier this month, EU experts decided to propose the delisting of Bahrain, the Marshall Islands and Saint Lucia, a document dated March 2 showed.\nThat attracted criticism from anti-corruption activists who called for disclosure of the commitments made by the delisted jurisdictions. These engagements remain secret.\nThe initial blacklist included 17 jurisdictions, but after one month eight were removed. They were Barbados, Grenada, South Korea, Macau, Mongolia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Panama. That move was also widely criticized by some EU lawmakers and activists.\nPanama’s delisting caused a particular outcry as the EU process to set up the tax-haven blacklist was triggered by publication of the Panama Papers - documents that showed how wealthy individuals and multinational corporations use offshore schemes to reduce their tax bills.\nEU countries were not screened. They were deemed to be already in line with EU standards against tax avoidance, though anti-corruption activists and lawmakers have repeatedly asked for some EU members such as Malta and Luxembourg to be blacklisted.\nReporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T13:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T13:48:47.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
