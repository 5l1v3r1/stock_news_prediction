North American fleet owners ordered 40,200 Class-8 trucks last month, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, extending a rebound for manufacturers that has fleet operators racing to get slots on production lines . Analysts FTR boosted their forecast for truck production this year to 330,000 vehicles. The orders mark a big turnaround for a truck-making industry that was laying off workers less than two years ago but is now scaling up for what could be its biggest production year in more than a decade. Engine maker Cummins Inc. CMI -0.18% says it expects revenue from its North American heavy-duty truck business to grow 20% this year. Still, it’s unclear so far whether the ordering boom that started last year is adding much capacity on the road. Truckers still say they are pressed to find enough drivers to fill seats even as freight demand stays strong.\nZara is turning to robotics to speed up the very last piece of its online sales, the “click and collect” operation in stores. The icon of fashion supply chains plans to automate the service of handing off online orders in its stores, the WSJ’s Jeannette Neumann reports, as the retailer steps up the pace of a strategy that’s grown so successful that it’s causing backups and long lines at its stores. It’s a new wrinkle to a distribution strategy that has made the fast-fashion unit of Inditex SA the envy of its more lumbering competitors. The stakes in store-pickup are big: one-third of Zara’s global online sales are picked up in stores—an increasingly popular fulfillment strategy for retailers. Under Zara’s automation plan, online customers will scan or enter a barcode at a store, triggering a behind-the-scenes robot to search for the package in a small warehouse, and deliver it quickly to a drop box.\nThe world’s oil supply chains increasingly will run through the U.S. The International Energy Agency says the country will overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2023, the WSJ’s Sarah Kent and Timothy Puko report, in a stark sign of how a U.S. oil and gas boom is overhauling global energy markets. The industry monitor says the growth in the U.S., which is expected to produce a record of 12.1 million barrels a day in five years, is part of a broader movement away from OPEC countries. The pace is getting the U.S. closer to producing enough crude to meet domestic demand, and it’s bringing greater influence in global markets. U.S. oil exports are forecast to more than double by 2023, putting more pressure to expand exporting capacity, including port terminals and shipping. Tanker capacity globally has been on the upswing, and a recent spike in orders for very large crude carriers pushed the backlog at Korean and Japanese ship yards to around 100 ships.\nECONOMY & TRADE A Navistar International Corp. International truck at the company's headquarters in Lisle, Ill. Photo: Bloomberg News The price tag on new infrastructure projects is rising and could go still higher just as the U.S. is preparing to build more highways and bridges. President Donald Trump’s move to impose tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports could end up undermining the president’s agenda to rebuild American infrastructure, the WSJ’s David Harrison writes, casting new clouds over a building plan that’s already facing headwinds in Washington . An improved global economic outlook has already raised demand, and prices, for building materials. One index of prices for a broad set of construction materials rose at its fastest pace in seven years in November, and was up 4.9% in January. Economists don’t expect proposed tariffs to have a big impact on the broader U.S. economy, but the construction business is a big consumer of steel and aluminum. Experts say new curbs on imports and rising domestic materials costs mean $1.5 trillion won’t buy as much as infrastructure as it used to.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ You could see a store as a liability.
