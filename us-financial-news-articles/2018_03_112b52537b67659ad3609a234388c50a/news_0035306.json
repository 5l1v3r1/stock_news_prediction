Advertising Week Europe continues into Day 2. If you’re heading over today, do swing by a session I’m chairing at 1:45 p.m. GMT, entitled, “ Taming the Wild West of Ad Tech ,” where I’ll be chatting with Assembly CEO Martin Cass; OpenX Co-Founder Jason Fairchild; the Telegraph’s digital managing director, Dora Michail; and the Trade Desk’s EMEA managing director, Sacha Berlik. (A similar session at Advertising Week New York in September turned out to be quite feisty .)\nCam We Kick It? The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica news cycle shows no sign of petering out just yet. Facebook’s shares took a pummeling on Monday as investors and users digested the blowback from the illicit data-sharing incident. Unlike the YouTube brand safety scandal before it, advertisers haven’t yet (as far as I’ve seen) taken a position on the issue either way—perhaps because their brands aren’t directly implicated in quite the same screenshot-shame way. Pivotal Research’s senior analyst, Brian Wieser, said in a note Sunday, “We don’t think advertisers will suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.” Plus, as AdExchanger reported, advertisers tend to continue spending on platforms that are producing results for them . Perhaps that’ll change if regulators clamp down on how much user data advertisers can access.\n—Catch Up—\nAfter the weekend’s revelations, the story kept snowballing on Monday. Here were some of the key moments:\nFacebook’s security chief, Alex Stamos, who has been one of the most vocal senior employees about the Cambridge Analytica debacle on Twitter over the past few days, plans to step down from the company this year after clashes with policy executives.\nUndercover journalists at Britain’s Channel 4 News filmed Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix and Managing Director Mark Turnbull touting the firm’s campaign tactics, such as entrapping political opponents with bribes and sex workers. In a statement , Cambridge Analytica said the video “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature” of the conversations.\nFacebook hired third-party digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a “comprehensive audit” of Cambridge Analytica.\nFacebook’s top executives, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, have been quiet on the matter so far. But Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, fielded questions about the issue at the ShopTalk retail conference in New York on Monday, where she said the company was “outraged and beyond disturbed” about the Cambridge Analytica news reports.\nAlexa, Google It In talking up Amazon’s growing dominance, advertising executives often cite (kind of old now) research that suggests more than half of product searches in the U.S. begin on the e-commerce platform . Google has been taking notice. On Monday, Google announced it was teaming up with a host of major traditional retailers —including Target, Walmart, Costco and Home Depot—allowing them to list their products directly within a sponsored Shopping ad unit that can appear on search results, its Express shopping service and Google’s voice assistant. Retailers will pay Google a share of each purchase made through its platforms. They’ll also be able to connect their loyalty programs, and customers can link their payment credentials. The launch is a clear defensive play against Amazon’s increasing power—from e-commerce to voice and search—highlighted by this Quote: from Google’s retail chief, Daniel Alegre, in the Reuters report: “We have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail.” Does that make Amazon the destroyer? (To be fair, Jeff Bezos does seem to enjoy playing the role of the cartoon villain lately, as this photo attests .)\nIt’s a Sprint, Not a Marathon Consulting is the flavor du jour in advertising, from big consulting firms parking their tanks on Madison Avenue’s lawn, to ad firms setting up consulting arms to provide strategic counsel to their clients’ senior executive teams. Now Publicis is placing its Sapient digital transformation unit at the heart of its goal to post organic growth of 4% in 2020, up from 0.8% last year. Publicis, which on Tuesday set out its three-year strategic plan , dubbed “Sprint to the Future,” also wants to grow its operating margin to as much as 17% in 2020, up from 15.5% last year. To get there, it’s embarking on a 450 million euro ($555 million) cost savings drive, around two-thirds of which will be reinvested in hiring and training employees. Publicis has been a little quiet on the M&A front of late, but that’s set to change, with the company saying it plans to spend around 300 million to 500 million euros per year over the next three years on acquiring companies. There’s hope for you yet, ad tech vendors…well, if you work the fields of data and “business transformation,” that is.\nVice as Nice Dominique Delport, managing director and chief client officer for Havas, has been with the advertising company for 13 years. But now the executive, who also serves as president of Vivendi Content, is up for a new challenge. As Variety first reported on Monday, Mr. Delport is in advanced negotiations to join Vice Media , to lead its international operations. Both Havas and Vice Media declined to comment when I got in touch with them on Monday. However, an internal memo sent by Havas Group CEO Yannick Bolloré on Monday confirmed Mr. Delport will indeed be leaving the advertising company in April to join Vice Media. “Thanks to his talent and commitment, he has been instrumental in growing our media business and developing our global clients,” the memo read. It also revealed that Mr. Delport’s role will not be replaced: “Since the end of 2016 we have put in place centralized management with the appointment of regional chairmen and CEOs and have established a robust global client council.”\nBest of the rest Tronc announced Monday its largest shareholder, Michael Ferro, was stepping down as chairman, hours before Fortune published an article disclosing allegations that he had made inappropriate sexual advances toward two female entrepreneurs. In a statement to Fortune, a spokesman for Mr. Ferro said, “Your on-the-record allegations appear to involve private conduct with private individuals who were not employees of Tronc or any other company he ran.” [ Fortune ]\nCheddar, the financial news streaming service aimed at millennials, has raised $22 million, a funding round that the company says values it at $160 million. Cheddar said it finished 2017 with $11.3 million in revenue. [ CMO Today ]\nFacebook plans to roll out a new feature in April that will let users subscribe to their favorite video creators or $4.99 a month. [ Recode ]\nWeinstein Co. has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Dallas-based investment firm Lantern Capital struck a deal to purchase the assets of troubled entertainment company, though it’s subject to higher bids in a sales process that will be conducted in bankruptcy court. [ WSJ ]\nIPG CEO Michael Roth spoke at Advertising Week Europe about how he has used financial incentives—and punishments—to ensure his agencies meet their diversity targets.
