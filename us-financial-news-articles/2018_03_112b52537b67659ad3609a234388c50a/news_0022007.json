Trump said he was prepared to meet Kim.\nThe news saw South Korean stocks rise more than 1 percent and hit a five-week high, putting the index on track for a 2.4 percent weekly gain. Chinese offshore and mainland stocks also added around 1 percent, helping to lift MSCI’s emerging stocks benchmark 0.5 percent, with the index on track for a 1.6 percent on the week.\n“Trump has also accepted an unexpected invitation from Kim Jong Un to meet before May this year,” Rabobank analysts said in a note to clients.\n“The move itself is positive. Whether the outcome will be positive remains to be seen.”\nInvestors had also taken some heart from Trump pressing ahead with tariffs, yet offering conditional exemptions for Canada and Mexico and saying other countries could apply for those, raising the hope that a full-blown global trade war could be averted.\nMeanwhile markets were cautious ahead of a U.S. February jobs report due later in the day after last month’s data heightened speculation of faster rate U.S. interest rate hikes, sparking a rout in the bond market and hammering world equities.\nAccording to a Reuters poll, hourly earnings growth is expected to increase 0.2 percent increase while headline non-farm payrolls is seen to have expanded by 200,000 jobs.\nMarkets expect the Fed to raise rates at least three times this year, with higher interest rates across developed markets raising the cost of borrowing for emerging economies.\nBut currencies put in a more mixed performance, with some still smarting from the Thursday dollar jump. News from Washington helped lift South Korea’s won and Mexico’s peso which both strengthened 0.4 percent on the day.\nBut South Africa’s rand, Turkey’s lira and Russia’s rouble all weakened against the dollar and look on track for a second or more week of losses.\nThe Hong Kong dollar extended its slide to hit a fresh 33-year low of 7.8440 per dollar, inching ever closer to the bottom end of its band of 7.75-7.85 per dollar.\nHong Kong markets have been flooded with cash thanks to heavy money printing by global central banks and the currency has been weakening since November alongside a rise in U.S. interest rates, which has widened the gap between local and U.S. yields.\nThe de-facto central bank said it had no plans to issue bills to prop up the local dollar, but warned it had sufficient fire power to defend the currency if need be.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) (Reporting by Karin Strohecker)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T12:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T13:16:07.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
