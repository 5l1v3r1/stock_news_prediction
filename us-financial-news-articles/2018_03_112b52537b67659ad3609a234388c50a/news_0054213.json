If that was not possible Turkey would prevent them itself, the council added. \n“In the meeting it is stated that aside from Syria, Turkey expects Iraq to prevent operations by the separatist terrorist organisation in its territory and if it is not possible Turkey will prevent them by itself,” the council statement said using the term it applies to PKK. \nOn Tuesday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Iraqi armed forces would prevent Kurdish militants based in northern Iraq from staging cross-border attacks against Turkey during a phone call with his Turkish counterpart.
