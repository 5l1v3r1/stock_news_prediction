We believe in free trade,” the official added. “We don’t think tariffs in respect of steel are at all helpful.” (Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Writing by Eric Walsh Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:23:02.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
