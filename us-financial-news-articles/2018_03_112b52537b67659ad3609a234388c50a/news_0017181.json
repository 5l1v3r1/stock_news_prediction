But now it is enlisting the help of the Associated Press to double down on its efforts. \nThe AP announced that it will be working with Facebook to “identify and debunk false and misleading stories related to the U.S. midterm election that are circulating on the platform.” Under this partnership, AP will reportedly “leverage the presence of AP reporters” across all 50 states, allowing Facebook’s fact-checking initiative to draw on local sources. \nJournalists will be enlisted to fact-check election-related stories from the national, state, and local levels on Facebook. They will not only generate their own stories intended to provide “background and context” on the elections, but also will seek to either debunk or validate other stories that appear on Facebook.
