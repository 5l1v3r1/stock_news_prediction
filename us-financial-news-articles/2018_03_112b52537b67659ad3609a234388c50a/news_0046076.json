(Nasdaq: RIOT) (the \"Company\") today announced that it has closed on its acquisition of 92.5% of Logical Brokerage Corp (\"Logical Brokerage\"). Logical Brokerage is a futures introducing broker headquartered in Miami, FL registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") and a member of the National Futures Association (\"NFA\").\nRiot Blockchain intends to investigate launching a digital currency exchange and a futures brokerage operation within the United States. Neither the CFTC nor the NFA regulate spot-market digital currency exchanges or activity, although the CFTC's jurisdiction is implicated when there is fraud or manipulation involving a virtual currency traded in interstate commerce.\nSeparately, the Company announced that on or prior to April 17, 2018, and within 15 calendar days following the end of each calendar month thereafter for a six-month period, it will publicly announce its gross cryptocurrency production for the previous month. Initially the Company will release information for a six-month period and may discontinue such information release at any time. Such information will be unaudited and will reflect the activities of the installed mining servers that are operational at any given time, which may vary. Readers of this information are cautioned that: (1) our cryptocurrency production is subject to many risks and our cryptocurrency production in any month may not be representative or predictive of our cryptocurrency production in other months; (2) the value of the production is highly volatile and will not be published by us on a monthly basis; (3) our operating results, including our revenue, are dependent on many factors in addition to our cryptocurrency production; and (4) our gross cryptocurrency production is not a substitute for measures of our operating results to be reflected in our financial statements prepared under GAAP, which we will release only on a quarterly basis.\nThe blockchain is a decentralized and encrypted ledger that offers a secure, efficient, verifiable and permanent way of storing records and other information without the need for intermediaries. These protocols are the backbone of numerous cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. Blockchain protocols have a wide range of use, including processing transactions, accounting, verification and proof of ownership across a far-reaching spectrum of applications.\nAbout Riot Blockchain\nRiot Blockchain intends to gain exposure to the blockchain ecosystem through its cryptocurrency mining operations, internally developed businesses, joint ventures, and targeted investments in the sector. Its primary focus is on Bitcoin and general blockchain technology.
