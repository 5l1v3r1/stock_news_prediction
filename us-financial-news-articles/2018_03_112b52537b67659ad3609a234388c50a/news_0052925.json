A second source, with extensive contacts in the underground church, said Guo had been taken away for a day but had since returned to his diocese. \nBoth of the sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Neither said why Guo had been detained. \nThe Ningde City public security bureau in Fujian and the Fujian Provincial Bureau of Nationalities and Religious Affairs did not answer repeated telephone calls. \nChina’s Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no understanding of the situation, but the government fully protected people’s right to freedom of religion. \nGuo’s detention comes as unprecedented efforts are underway between Beijing and the Vatican to resolve the thorny issue of who gets to appoint bishops. ‘AUXILIARY’ \nA senior Vatican source told Reuters last month a framework accord was ready and could be signed in months. It could open the way for a resumption of diplomatic relations nearly 70 years after they were cut during the Communist takeover of China. \nFull relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China’s estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast. \nUnder the expected deal, the Vatican would have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops, Reuters reported in February. \nIn order to facilitate it, the Vatican-recognised bishop Guo was being asked to become an auxiliary to the government-appointed Zhan, the Vatican source said. \nCritics of the deal, including Cardinal Joseph Zen, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, have suggested the Vatican is about to “sell out” those Catholics in China, like Guo, who have remained loyal to the Vatican and suffered hardship for doing so. \nAsia News said in its report Guo had been detained for 20 days last year over Easter. \nA deal between the Vatican and Beijing would likely leave Taiwan in the diplomatic lurch. \nThe Vatican is one of only 20 states that still recognise self-ruled Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Beijing insists that if countries want relations with it they must break ties with Taiwan.
