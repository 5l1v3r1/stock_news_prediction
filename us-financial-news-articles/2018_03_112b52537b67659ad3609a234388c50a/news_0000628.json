Earnings before interest, taxation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 3.8 percent to 1.46 billion euros - slightly better than analysts had expected.\nCore profits would remain “broadly stable” the company said on Wednesday, after stripping out the positive one-off impact of the sale of buildings in last year’s results.\nRTL said it would propose a final dividend of 3 euros per share, on top of an interim dividend of 1 euro paid last September, representing a dividend yield of 5.9 percent to its shareholders.
