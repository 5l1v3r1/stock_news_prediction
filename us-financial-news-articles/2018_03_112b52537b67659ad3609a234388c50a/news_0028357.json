The company's logo is seen outside Austria's first Apple store, which opens on February 24, during a media preview in Vienna, Austria, February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader Speaking on RTL radio, Le Maire said on Wednesday he had become aware that Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. unilaterally imposed prices and other contractual terms on software developers. “I will therefore be taking Google and Apple to the Paris commercial court for abusive trade practices,” Le Maire said. The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake “As powerful as they are, Google and Apple should not be able to treat our startups and our developers the way they currently do.” Spokespeople for Apple France and Google France did not immediately respond to calls and messages from Reuters seeking comment. Le Maire also said he expected the European Union to close tax loopholes that benefit Google, Apple, Facebook ( FB.O ) and Amazon ( AMZN.O ) by the start of 2019. Brussels is currently examining measures to improve the taxation of overseas tech giants’ online business in European markets.
