There will still be metal available, it will just cost more.”\nAluminium premiums were also boosted by a lock-out of union workers at an Alcoa smelter in Quebec, which has cut its operation by about two-thirds, said a source at a global producer.\nTraders and analysts said premiums would likely settle lower in the short-term, but remain at elevated levels.\nShaw noted the proposed U.S. duty would take the total cost for the 150 kg (330 lbs) of aluminium contained of the average car body to $365 from $330.\nAustralia’s CBA bank said the United States hoped to add about 670,000 tonnes of domestic aluminium output, which would displace about 1 percent of global aluminium production.\n“We expect aluminium markets will be able to absorb the impact quite comfortably,” CBA said in a report.\nThe United States imported around 7 million tonnes of crude, semi-manufactured and aluminium scrap, according to U.S. government statistics, mostly from Canada, Russia, the UAE and China.\nSome traders had been increasing metal shipments to the United States since December, hoping to cash in on the tariffs, said a source at a metals warehousing company in Singapore.\n“A lot of people picked this well ahead, and they reacted early on,” he said.“If it hasn’t sailed before the end of January it’s going to miss the window.” Comex aluminium stocks have surged by more than 50 percent this year to 65,327 tonnes.
