Named after a movie about car racing, the operation sought to curb gun trafficking criminals who were selling weapons to Mexican drug cartels.\nCriticism emerged after it was revealed that U.S. agents in Arizona let at least 2,000 guns slip across the Mexican border.\nIn 2012, the Republican-led House of Representatives held Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing to turn over documents about the operation. Holder had been appointed by President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\nLater that year, the department's inspector general released a report faulting 12 department employees for failures related to the operation. The report vindicated Holder, concluding he neither conceived the operation nor attempted a cover-up. (Reporting by Sarah N.
