REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo “The increase is worth noting because it happened while there has been industrial cuts in China. It suggests the cuts may not have been so effective,” said Vivek Dhar, analyst at CBA in Melbourne.\nShipments have risen since November when the cuts were first introduced, creating a favorable arbitrage to the London Metal Exchange price and encouraging producers and fabricators to seek better margins abroad.\nThe United States accounts for 14 percent of China’s total aluminum exports.\nFebruary’s exports fell 15 percent from January, but the data may partly reflect the timing of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which was held later this year.\nAnalysts suggested there might have been a dash to sell into the United States before the imposition of punitive duties on aluminum foil, although foil volumes remained steady in January. February’s foil figures will be released later this month.\nWashington has slapped anti-dumping duties on a swathe of Chinese steel and aluminum products in recent years, including aluminum extrusions and alloy sheet.\nFALLING STEEL EXPORTS China’s steel product exports over January and February fell 27 percent to 9.5 million tonnes from a year earlier.\nChina accounted for only about 2.9 percent of U.S. steel imports, data compiled by Wood Mackenzie showed. The world’s top steel-buying nation, the United States imported a total 35.6 million tonnes last year.\nThe January and February figures were the lowest monthly totals in four years, reflecting a tighter domestic market as the government ramps up its effort to curb outdated, excess capacity, as well as rising domestic demand.\n“As long as China’s domestic market remains tight, exports would remain slow,” said Daniel Meng, analyst at CLSA in Hong Kong.\nReporting by Josephine Mason and Tom Daly in BEIJING, Melanie Burton in MELBOURNE and Manolo Serapio in MANILA; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2Fk7TxZ", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://reut.rs/2FhYO8N"], "published": "2018-03-08T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:30:07.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
