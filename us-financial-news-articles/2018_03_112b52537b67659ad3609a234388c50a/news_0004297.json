Without a favourable trade deal, UK-based fintech firms won’t be able to serve EU customers from Britain.\nCurrently there are no EU rules for crowdfunding, meaning they must deal with a patchwork of national rules, which can make operating in more than one country costly.\nThe EU draft law from the European Commission introduces an optional, pan-EU regime whereby a crowdfunding platform that wants to operate across the bloc could obtain a “passport” licence from the European Securities and Markets Authority.\n“Instead of having to comply with different regulatory regimes, platforms will have to comply with only one set of rules, both when operating in their home market and in other EU member states,” the commission said.\n“For investors the proposal will further provide legal certainty as regards the applicable investor protection rules.”\nThe draft rules cover crowdfunding “campaigns” of up to a million euros over 12 months. Raising higher sums would come under the bloc’s existing prospectus and securities rules.
