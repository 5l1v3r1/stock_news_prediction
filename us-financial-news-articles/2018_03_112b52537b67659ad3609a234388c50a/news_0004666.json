U.S. officials have pointed to Bitcoin’s volatility, and recently sent subpoenas to companies that may be performing Initial Coin Offerings, Bloomberg reported citing sources.\nSouth Korea meanwhile was said to be considering an outright ban of cryptocurrencies in late December, before saying earlier this year that it plans to lay out a regulatory system for the emerging sector .\nIn the past, Bitcoin investors have largely taken news of such regulation as a positive. A moderate level regulation, the logic goes, strips out the bad players such as hackers and scammers, leaving a much safer and less volatile asset behind.\nThe price of Bitcoin remained flat, at about $10,800 as of afternoon trading Friday.", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-fintech/mexico-financial-technology-law-passes-final-hurdle-in-congress-idUSKCN1GD6KX"], "published": "2018-03-03T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T00:13:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
