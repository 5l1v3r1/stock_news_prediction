The transaction was led by Daniel Withers , Senior Vice President of Multifamily, who exclusively represented the seller in this sale.\nUtilizing the Matthews™ marketing platform, Withers generated more than ten offers, had over 45 interested buyers, and conducted over 25 property tours. Located at 6833 Sepulveda Boulevard, the asset set one of the highest price-per-square-foot sales in Van Nuys for a property built in 1967. The property sold for $272.75 per square-foot and $156,250 per unit.\nWithers negotiated on behalf of the seller, Newport Property Investments, LLC, for the buyer to cover the cost of future soft story retrofit on the property. The buyer, RCG, Inc., satisfied a 1031 exchange and assumed the 1 st trust deed.\nThe unit mix, majority one-bedrooms, created some challenges during the deal process. However, Withers was able to complete a record breaking sale and satisfy both the buyer and seller.\nFor more information regarding the sale of 6833 Sepulveda Boulevard or if you have any questions relating to your multifamily investment(s), please do not hesitate to reach out to Daniel Withers .
