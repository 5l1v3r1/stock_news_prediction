For instance, temperatures in Leuven could increase by as little as 1.1C.\nThe new data provides “foundation knowledge” for cities at the forefront of efforts to rein in the effects of global warming, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, an editor of the report and a researcher with NASA.\nThe new findings come on the heels of a U.N. draft report already causing alarm with projections that the global temperature rise is on track to exceed a 1.5C target included in the Paris pact to curb global warming.\nIn addition, experts say that storms, floods and other extreme weather events that are related to climate change are hitting cities much harder than scientists had predicted.\n“How will the cities know how they should develop their resilience plans unless they know what temperature projections, how the climate is supposed to change in their cities?” said Rosenzweig during a press conference.\nThe findings’ variance - projected increases do not exceed 1C in a handful of cases - offer a reminder that cities need to develop tailored plans to mitigate the effects of climate change, said Solecki, a professor at Hunter College in New York.\nPlanning is particularly crucial given growing pressures from urbanization, he said.\nAbout half the world’s population lives in urban areas, and that figure is expected to reach 66 percent by 2050, according to the U.N.\nThe new report was launched in the western Canadian city of Edmonton, on the sidelines of a global summit where scientists and city planners are charting a roadmap for cities to fight the impact of climate change.\n(Adjusts the conversion rate from Celsius to Fahrenheit)\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Jared FerriePlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
