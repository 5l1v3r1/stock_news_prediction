One sticking point has been Washington's demand that auto exports to the U.S. contain a minimum of 50 percent U.S. content, although that requirement could have been dropped, according to recent reports .\nEarlier this week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau indicated he was upbeat about working out a satisfactory deal, Reuters reported.\nChampagne also highlighted the significance of the U.S.-Canada relationship, adding that \"there are no two nations that are trading more.\"\n\"Where we are in this discussion, it's not a relation of buyers and sellers. We make things together and because of that, we have created prosperity on both sides of the border and we want to continue that,\" he said.\nNAFTA Plan B? Although Champagne did not directly address what Canada's plans would be should NAFTA talks break down, he said that the U.S. would \"always remain\" Canada's largest trading partner, due to the former's geographical location and size of its economy.\nIn the meantime, Canada has been involved in various trade agreements as the global economic power balance shifts.\n\"There's never been a better time to diversify ... I think Canadians understand that the center of gravity of the world economy is shifting toward Asia Pacific,\" Champagne said. As Canada is \"very much a Pacific nation,\" it had to position itself for the next few decades, he added.\nCanada has participated in various trade agreements of late, including last year's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Europe and this year's revamped Trans-Pacific Partnership deal .\nWATCH: CNBC Explains: What is the TPP 11?", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T09:41:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
