(NYSE: SPLP), a diversified global holding company, today announced operating results for the fourth quarter and 2017. For a full discussion of the results, please see the Company's Form 10-K as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found at www.steelpartners.com .\nRevenue for the 2017 fourth quarter increased to $335.3 million from $318.5 million for the same period in 2016. Loss before taxes, associated companies and other investments held at fair value was $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $18.5 million for the comparable 2016 period. Net loss attributable to the Company's common unitholders for the 2017 fourth quarter was $14.2 million, or $0.55 per common unit, compared with $15.4 million, or $0.59 per common unit, a year ago.\nFor the 2017, revenue increased to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion for 2016. Income before taxes, associated companies and other investments held at fair value rose to $40.4 million for 2017 from $22.4 million for 2016. Net loss attributable to the Company's common unitholders for the year was breakeven, compared with net income of $6.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted common unit, for 2016.\nResults for the quarter and 2017, and the comparable periods of 2016, include certain significant acquisition and integration-related charges associated with the Company's recently completed transactions, as well as other non-cash income or loss from associated companies and other investments held at fair value, net of taxes, which are allocated by segment. Results for the quarter and 2017 also reflect an accrual for incentive unit expense of $5.1 million and $9.0 million, respectively, based on an increase in the market price of the Company's common units, as well as a reduction in deferred tax assets associated with the recent changes in U.S. tax regulations, partially offset by the reversal of certain deferred tax valuation allowances. Results for the 2016 periods also include non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges, resulting from a decline in market conditions and lower demand for certain of the Company's Performance Materials product lines.\nSteel Partners generated a 4.0% increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 to $38.7 million from $37.2 million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 quarter's Adjusted EBITDA reflects a higher contribution from the Financial Services segment, partially offset by a decline from the Diversified Industrial segment. For the full 2017 year, Steel Partners generated a 10.2% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $164.0 million from $148.9 million in 2016. The Company is presenting Adjusted EBITDA to assist investors with their understanding of Steel Partners' results of operations and financial condition. See \"Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements\" below for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n\"Results for 2017 and the most recent fourth quarter reflect continued implementation of the Steel Business System, improving both top- and bottom-line performance in each of our operating segments,\" said Warren Lichtenstein, Executive Chairman of Steel Partners. \"Our fourth quarter activities, including completion of our tender offer for the remaining shares of Handy & Harman Ltd. that Steel Partners did not previously own, entry into a combined, revolving credit facility covering substantially all Steel Partners entities, and our additional $35 million investment in Steel Connect, Inc. (formerly ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc.), reflect our continued journey toward One Steel. We expect continued progress on our strategic initiatives during 2018, along with further investments in growth platforms, as reflected by our February acquisition of Dunmore Corporation,\" Lichtenstein added.\nBased on current information, Steel Partners expects 2018 first quarter revenue between $332 million and $386 million and Adjusted EBITDA between $30 million and $37 million. The Company anticipates revenue for the full 2018 year between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion and Adjusted EBITDA between $184 million and $225 million. These forecasts include the expected operating results of Dunmore Corporation from the date of acquisition.\n(Financial Tables on Following Pages)\nFinancial Summary\n(in thousands, except per common unit) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue $ 335,277 $ 318,505 $ 1,372,027 $ 1,163,549 Costs and expenses 336,852 337,047 1,331,604 1,141,111 (Loss) income before taxes, associated companies and other\ninvestments held at fair value\n(1,575 ) (18,542 ) 40,423 22,438 Income tax provision 24,124 5,595 51,299 23,952 Income of associated companies and other investments held at fair\nvalue, net of taxes\n(8,186 ) (1,436 ) (16,888 ) (4,085 ) Net (loss) income (17,513 ) (22,701 ) 6,012 2,571 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests in\nconsolidated entities\n3,313 7,328 (6,028 ) 4,059 Net (loss) income attributable to common unitholders $ (14,200 ) $ (15,373 ) $ (16 ) $ 6,630 Net (loss) income per common unit - basic $ (0.55 ) $ (0.59 ) $ — $ 0.25 Net (loss) income per common unit - diluted $ (0.55 ) $ (0.59 ) $ — $ 0.25 Capital expenditures $ 16,822 $ 15,450 $ 54,737 $ 34,183 Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation: (in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income $ (17,513 ) $ (22,701 ) $ 6,012 $ 2,571 Income tax provision 24,124 5,595 51,299 23,952 Income (loss) before income taxes 6,611 (17,106 ) 57,311 26,523 Add (Deduct): Income of associated companies and other investments held at fair value,\nnet of taxes\n(8,186 ) (1,436 ) (16,888 ) (4,085 ) Interest expense 8,358 3,662 22,804 11,052 Depreciation and amortization 17,723 24,059 71,936 70,546 Non-cash goodwill impairment charges — 24,254 — 24,254 Non-cash asset impairment charges 2,028 5,732 2,028 18,668 Non-cash pension expense (income) 5,787 (239 ) 9,647 2,416 Non-cash equity-based compensation 5,781 758 11,477 3,844 Amortization of fair value adjustments to acquisition-date\ninventories\n— 209 — 2,133 Realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, net 169 (3,295 ) 938 (7,478 ) Other items, net 450 639 4,795 1,000 Adjusted EBITDA $ 38,721 $ 37,237 $ 164,048 $ 148,873 Segment Results\n(in thousands) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue: Diversified industrial $ 276,672 $ 276,157 $ 1,156,187 $ 998,556 Energy 36,151 25,127 135,461 93,995 Financial services 22,454 17,221 80,379 70,998 Total Revenue $ 335,277 $ 318,505 $ 1,372,027 $ 1,163,549 Income (loss) before income taxes: Diversified industrial $ 3,116 $ (18,324 ) $ 50,104 $ 19,175 Energy (8,555 ) (5,057 ) (21,514 ) (11,459 ) Financial services 13,192 10,500 41,328 42,518 Corporate and other (1,142 ) (4,225 ) (12,607 ) (23,711 ) Income (loss) before income taxes 6,611 (17,106 ) 57,311 26,523 Income tax provision 24,124 5,595 51,299 23,952 Net (loss) income $ (17,513 ) $ (22,701 ) $ 6,012 $ 2,571 Income (loss) of associated companies and other investments held\nat fair value, net of taxes:\nDiversified industrial $ — $ — $ — $ 8,078 Energy (1,359 ) 2,968 593 9,944 Corporate and other 9,545 (1,532 ) 16,295 (13,937 ) Total $ 8,186 $ 1,436 $ 16,888 $ 4,085 Segment Depreciation and Amortization: Diversified industrial $ 12,627 $ 18,944 $ 50,741 $ 50,100 Energy 4,982 5,121 20,735 20,076 Financial services 82 (15 ) 294 274 Corporate and other 32 9 166 96 Total Depreciation and Amortization $ 17,723 $ 24,059 $ 71,936 $ 70,546 Segment Adjusted EBITDA: Diversified industrial $ 26,105 $ 28,542 $ 128,650 $ 115,516 Energy 522 137 4,098 (1,701 ) Financial services 13,343 10,486 41,742 42,792 Corporate and other (1,249 ) (1,928 ) (10,442 ) (7,734 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 38,721 $ 37,237 $ 164,048 $ 148,873 Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements\nThe financial data contained in this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measurements as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including \"Adjusted EBITDA.\" The Company is presenting Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that it provides useful information to investors about SPLP, its business and its financial condition. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before the effects of income or loss from investments in associated companies and other investments held at fair value, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash pension expense or income, and realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments and excludes certain non-recurring and non-cash items. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is one of the measures used by the Company's Board of Directors and management to evaluate its business, including in internal management reporting, budgeting and forecasting processes, in comparing operating results across the business, as an internal profitability measure, as a component in evaluating the ability and the desirability of making capital expenditures and significant acquisitions and as an element in determining executive compensation.\nHowever, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net income or loss, or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities. Because Adjusted EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including realized losses investments, interest expense and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business. There are a number of material limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool, including the following:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's tax provision or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income or loss from the Company's investments in associated companies and other investments held at fair value; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's interest expense; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses in the period recorded, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash requirements for such replacement; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's net realized and unrealized gains and losses on its investments; Adjusted EBITDA does not include non-cash charges for pension expense and equity-based compensation; and Adjusted EBITDA does not include certain other non-recurring and non-cash items.\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its U.S. GAAP financial measures and by using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information. The Company believes that consideration of Adjusted EBITDA, together with a careful review of its U.S. GAAP financial measures, is the most informed method of analyzing SPLP.\nThe Company reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income or loss, which does not include amounts reported under U.S. GAAP related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, and that reconciliation is set forth above. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Revenues and expenses are measured in accordance with the policies and procedures described in the Company's 2017.\nAbout Steel Partners Holdings L.P.\nSteel Partners Holdings L.P.
