It was not immediately clear what effect the Kurdish boycott of the vote would have on that.\nCOMPETING INTERESTS Shi’ite lawmakers wanted more spending allocated to the southern oil-producing, predominantly Shi’ite, provinces as well as greater salaries and benefits for the Iran-backed Shi’ite militias known as Popular Mobilisation Forces, who helped Iraq’s security forces defeat Islamic State.\nSunni lawmakers wanted more allocated towards reconstructing areas retaken from the militants, which were predominantly Sunni. The areas include Iraq’s second city Mosul, which was retaken after nine months of urban warfare.\nOn Thursday the“three presidencies” of Iraq, its Shi’ite prime minister, Sunni parliament speaker, and Kurdish president, met to discuss how to push the budget through.\nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Iraqis over the passing of the budget on Saturday and said it was the result of cooperation between the executive and legislative branches.\nSpeaker Salim al-Jabouri said the budget addressed Kurdish concerns and that the federal government would pay the salaries of Kurdish civil servants and Peshmerga fighters, as well as welfare entitlements.\nBaghdad had stopped paying salaries or making budget transfers to the Kurdish regional capital Erbil in 2014 when the Kurds started independently selling oil.\nOil exports, Iraq’s main source of revenue, have risen above 3.4 million barrels per day this year but a global slump in prices for crude, compounded by the costs of rebuilding an infrastructure damaged by the war against Islamic State, have battered the country’s finances.\nLast month, Iraq received pledges of $30 billion, mostly in credit facilities and investment, from allies at a reconstruction conference in Kuwait, but this fell short of the $88 billion Baghdad says it needs.\n$1 = 1,181.0000 Iraqi dinars Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein and Ahmed Rasheed; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T15:37:38.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
