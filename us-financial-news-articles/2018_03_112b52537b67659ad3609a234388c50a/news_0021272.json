They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).\"\nIn a letter to the companies on March 5, CFIUS expressed concerns that Broadcom would not be willing to fund the research needed to maintain Qualcomms strong position on so-called 5G technology, a forthcoming standard for wireless data networks, leaving the U.S. with nowhere but China to turn for such technology.\nCFIUS also said that Qualcomm has a number of military contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense.\nShares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14. Neither company responded immediately to a request for comment.\nThe move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U.S. president himself announced Broadcom's decision to move its headquarters to the United States and called it \"one of the really great, great companies.\"\nThis is the fifth time ever a U.S. President has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office.\n\"The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,\" the presidential order released on Monday said.\nThe order issued by the White House cited \"credible evidence\" that led Trump to believe that Broadcom taking control of Qualcomm \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"\nTrump's move accelerated a decision that appeared likely after CFIUS told Broadcom in a letter on Sunday that its investigation \"so far confirmed the national security concerns.\"\nThe U.S. Treasury Department letter was \"obviously a poison pill,\" Jim Lewis, a CFIUS expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said before the Trump order. He described the CFIUS communication to Broadcom as \"unprecedented.\"\nThe semiconductor industry is racing to develop chips that power so-called 5G wireless technology, allowing the transmission of data at faster speeds.\nBroadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.\nThe presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed. However, it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States.
