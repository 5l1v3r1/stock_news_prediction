(NYSE:MXF) announced that the Board of Directors (Board) changed the quarterly distribution from $0.13 per share to $0.15 per share, representing an increase of 15.4%. Accordingly, the Board declared a distribution of $0.15 per share to stockholders of record on April 19, 2018, which is payable in cash on April 27, 2018.\nUnder the Fund’s Managed Distribution Plan (MDP), the Fund pays quarterly distributions of $0.15 per share. The Board has ratified the continuation of the Fund’s MDP during 2018. The Board may amend or terminate the MDP at any time without prior notice to stockholders. Since the implementation of the MDP in September 2008, the Fund has paid a total of $22.30 per share in cash distributions to stockholders.\nThe amount of distributable income for each fiscal period depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Fund’s fiscal year.\nHowever, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund is required to indicate the source of each distribution to stockholders. The following table sets forth (A) an estimate of the source of the April 2018 distribution and (B) an estimate of the source of distributions for the current fiscal year:\nDistribution Estimates April 2018 Fiscal Year-to-date ( YTD) 1 Source Per Share\nAmount Percent of\nCurrent\nDistribution Per Share\nAmount Percent of Fiscal\nYear Distributions Net Investment Income - - - - Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains - - - - Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains - - - - Return of Capital $0.1500 100.00% $0.2800 100.00% Total Distribution $ 0.1500 100.00 % $ 0.2800 100.00 % Information regarding the Fund’s performance and distribution rates is set forth below:\nAverage Annual Total Return for the 5-year period ended on February 28, 2018 2 (3.15 )% Current Annualized Distribution Rate (current fiscal year) 3 2.16 % Current Fiscal Year Cumulative Total Return 4 2.36 % Cumulative Distribution Rate (current fiscal year) 5 0.71 % 1 The Fund’s current fiscal year began on November 1, 2017.\n2 Average Annual Total Return represents the simple arithmetic average of the Annual NAV Total Returns of the Fund for the last five years.
