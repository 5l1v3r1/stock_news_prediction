JLR will also showcase technology which alerts drivers when an emergency vehicle is approaching and notifies motorists when another connected car brakes, helping to potentially avoid accidents. The tests will take place in the central English town of Milton Keynes. In a potential blow to the technology expected to transform transportation worldwide, an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona, police said on Monday.
