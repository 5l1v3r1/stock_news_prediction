The service fee is 0.4% of net asset value per annum. The Fund is making this change in recognition of an industry trend, exhibited by the actions of fund managers when launching new funds, by the input of investment advisors and by comments from securities regulators, away from the historical practice of paying service fees. The removal of the service fee will reduce the management fee paid and will thereby positively impact the Fund’s management expense ratio.\nClass A unitholders are reminded that the Fund has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) providing Class A unitholders with the ability to automatically reinvest their distributions and benefit from the compound growth from this reinvestment. Please contact your Investment Advisor or financial institution to enrol in this DRIP.\nFor further information please contact Unitholder Information at 416-861-9941 or 1-855-BLOOM18 or visit www.bloomfunds.ca\nCommissions, management fees and other expenses may all be associated with investment funds. Please read the Fund’s publicly filed documents which are available from SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Investment funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.\nSource:Bloom U.S. Income & Growth Fund", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2a32bdc2-403f-432a-b2ae-5f448677ffc1", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yCSd60kcuZH8HJ4gKx24paB27v2jWnlMhrHKD_MrbqWtKzzJGVSpPSEDATWfILfZWtiDzWeIVlPehbYjxYxStg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Ib3qgDFvk33i0kuVip9MfzywcsLP166zm2iRgdcXYlrwXbh_CvwEYMREzvvdJXGFOkmg06DhS7Q-a_icKHm78Q=="], "published": "2018-03-13T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T20:31:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
