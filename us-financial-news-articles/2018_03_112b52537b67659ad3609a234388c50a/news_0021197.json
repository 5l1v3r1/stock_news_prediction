Meanwhile Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, whose dovish views have fallen increasingly out of the Fed mainstream, said Friday the \"strong\" jobs report and \"good news\" of sidelined workers returning to the labor force did not salve his nervousness about low inflation.\n\"My own preference would be to wait a little bit longer\" on raising rates, he told CNBC in an interview, adding that he would at least like to see March inflation data before raising rates further.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who like Evans dissented against the Fed's rate hike in December, went further, making fun of many of his colleagues' assessments that the U.S. economy had already reached the Fed's goal of \"maximum\" employment even before employers found workers to fill more than 300,000 jobs in February.\n\"We are now at maximumer employment,\" Kashkari quipped on Twitter. Explaining his sarcasm in a second tweet, he said, \"We keep saying we are at max employment and then all these people choose to work. It suggests we weren't really at max employment.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer, Ann Saphir, Richard Leong, Howard Schneider and Lindsay Dunsmuir.
