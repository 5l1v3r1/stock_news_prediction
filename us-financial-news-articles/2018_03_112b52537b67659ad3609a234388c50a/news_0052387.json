Turnover was 2.14 trillion yen, also the lowest level since then.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.7 percent to 1,716.30.\nIndex-heavy Fast Retailing soared 3.1 percent, contributing a hefty 49 points to the Nikkei.\nRecently-battered semiconductor equipment makers rebounded, with Tokyo Electron up 4.2 percent and Advantest Corp 1.6 percent higher.\nSilicon maker Sumco gained 2.5 percent.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Kim Coghill\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
