Now, the required range is just 1 to 3 percent.\nMoody's left its December forecast of a 1.5 percent rise in sales for 2018 unchanged.\nIn addition, U.S. auto sales are expected to shrink less in 2018 than Moody's previously forecast. Automakers are now expected to sell 16.9 million light vehicles in the U.S. in 2018, up slightly from Moody's December forecast of 16.8 million.\nOverall improvements in the economy partly drove that adjustment. Moody's now forecasts U.S. gross domestic product to grow by 2.7 percent in 2018 and 2.3 percent in 2019, up from previous estimates of 2.3 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.\nSales of autos in the U.S. were down in 2017 after two record-setting years.\nHowever, consumer tastes have shifted in recent years to SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks, which tend to command higher transaction prices, and thus more profits for automakers. Many in the industry believe the shift to be either permanent or at least long term.\nIn addition, the expiration of a tax cut on small vehicle purchases in China is expected to soften auto sales gains in 2018, the firm said. China's auto market is expected to see 2 percent growth in 2018, and 2.5 percent growth in 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T19:08:24.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
