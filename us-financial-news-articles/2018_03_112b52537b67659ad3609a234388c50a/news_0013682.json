Earthworks, an environmental group, compared the magnitude of the XTO well blowout with some of the biggest methane releases in the United States.\nMatusic said the company has been taking air samples since the blowout and “never picked up anything that would harm humans or animals.”\nFollowing the well blowout, emergency responders evacuated about 30 homes within one mile of the well. Residents of all but four homes located within a half mile of the well were able to return home within a few days, Matusic said.\nOhio Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is the lead government agency at the XTO well pad. Officials at the DNR were not immediately available for comment\nThe U.S. EPA said it responded to a fire at the well on Feb. 15 to provide technical assistance and air monitoring at the site. Because there were no apparent release of oil or hazardous substances, the EPA said it demobilized on Feb. 21.\nAn unknown quantity of brine and produced water, estimated to be more than 5,000 gallons, was initially discharged to streams that flow into the Ohio River, according to the EPA.\nProtected wildlife species located in proximity to or downstream from the well site are the Eastern Hellbender Salamander, Northern longeared bat, and protected fish.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino in New York and Kim Palmer in Cleveland; Editing by Leslie Adler and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T01:04:53.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
