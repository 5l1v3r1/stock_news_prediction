The economy. So the economy is for specialists,” he told Reuters during an interview at his new offices in Caracas.\n“Francisco is a man with many qualifications, but he is also a politician recognized internally and abroad ... We need to build a really good team led by a great economist, that’s Francisco Rodriguez.”\nRodriguez, one of the most influential analysts of Venezuela’s dysfunctional economy, has recently been suggesting the bolivar currency should be scrapped for the U.S. dollar as an extreme measure to fix runaway inflation by stopping the government from printing excess money.\nRodriguez also believes Venezuela - in the fifth year of crippling recession that has left millions hungry and created widespread shortages - would receive major help from international loan bodies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund under a new government.\nFalcon, a former state governor who has broken with an opposition boycott to run against Maduro, said he would prioritize repairing relations with Washington should he win the vote slated for April 22.\n“The United States would have a potential ally in a new Venezuelan government,” said Falcon, who defines himself as a center-leftist in favor of both market-friendly policies and strong welfare protection programs.\nFalcon implied he disagreed with possible U.S. oil sanctions against OPEC member Venezuela, however, saying he opposed any measures that “end up hurting the poor.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has already slapped some individual sanctions on officials it deems guilty of rights abuses or eroding democracy in Venezuela, and has also imposed measures to block new financing for the government.\nIt is pondering measures against the oil sector if Maduro does not improve conditions for the presidential election, which critics say has been rigged to legitimize Maduro’s “dictatorship.”\nFalcon, a 56-year-old former military man who supported the ruling socialists until a 2010 split, has drawn the wrath of Venezuela’s opposition coalition by throwing his hat into the ring and undercutting their boycott policy.\n“Abstention is no use,” he said, arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change and the majority preferred to vote.\n“In world history, at least for the last two centuries, no government has won an election at a time of hyper-inflation.”\nPrices in Venezuela rose more than 4,000 percent in the 12 months to the end of January, according to estimates by the country’s opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists’ figures.
