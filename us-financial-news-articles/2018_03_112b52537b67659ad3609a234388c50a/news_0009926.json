Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims.\nThe 880,000-hectare SC-72 at the Reed Bank, a disputed area, is where PXP Energy Corp had been undertaking exploration to evaluate the block’s gas reserves.\nIn 2016, the Philippines won a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which invalidated China’s claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, and also made clear the Reed Bank was inside the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). China does not recognise the ruling.\nSince Reed Bank is disputed, Roque said“there must be an agreement before the two countries can proceed with the joint exploration”.\nThe Philippine energy ministry suspended exploration in the Reed Bank, known locally as Recto Bank, in late 2014 as the government pursued the arbitration case, disrupting PXP Energy’s plan to drill two wells. Chinese boats had in 2011 harassed a survey ship contracted by PXP’s unit, Forum Energy.\nPXP is eager to resume exploration in the Reed Bank but said any joint venture would likely involve a Chinese company.\nPXP had been talking with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) about Reed Bank during the administration of Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino, but the arbitration disrupted negotiations.\nIn September last year, the Philippines said it was pursuing a long-delayed oil and gas exploration project with CNOOC and a Canada-listed company in the SC-57 area, which is outside disputed waters.\nThe area lies near the country’s main oil and gas fields, including Malampaya, Nido, Cadlao and Matinloc.
