(\"the Company\") (OTC Pink:PSIX), a leader in the design, engineering and manufacture of emissions-certified, alternative-fuel power systems, announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”) as PSI’s new independent registered public accounting firm to succeed Frazier & Deeter, LLC (\"Frazier & Deeter\"). The decision to appoint BDO was not the result of any disagreement between PSI and Frazier & Deeter on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.\nJohn Miller, chief executive officer and president, commented, “We’ve made significant progress on the restatement since Frazier & Deeter’s appointment as our auditors. Also, during this time we’ve assembled a strong internal team dedicated to this effort. With the addition of BDO’s substantial resources, local presence in Chicago and highly seasoned restatement team, we believe that we will be in a position to complete our restatement of the affected prior period financial statements and concurrently complete our delinquent filings for the 2016 and 2017 periods by the end of the third quarter of 2018.”\nAbout Power Solutions International, Inc.\nPower Solutions International, Inc.
