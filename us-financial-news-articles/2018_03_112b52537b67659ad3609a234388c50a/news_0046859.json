This isn’t war, it’s not an unexpected methane explosion at a coal mine. People came to relax, children. We’re talking about demography and losing so many people,” Putin angrily told officials.\n“Why? Because of some criminal negligence, because of slovenliness. How could this ever happen?,” he added. “The first emotion when hearing about the number of dead and dead children is not to cry but to wail. And when you listen to what has been said here, speaking honestly, other emotions arise.”\nInvestigators said fire exits had been illegally blocked, the public address system had not been switched on, the fire alarm system was broken, and children had been locked inside cinemas.\nThe fire swept through the upper floors of the shopping centre, where a cinema complex and children’s play area were located, on Sunday afternoon.\nHundreds of angry protesters, many of them crying, gathered in central Kemerovo. The mayor, Ilya Seredyuk, tried to speak, but his words were often drowned out by chants calling on him to resign.\n“Why don’t they tell us the truth?,” shouted one protester.\nMany locals do not believe the official death toll of 64 and suspect that hundreds of people were killed in the blaze and that a cover-up is underway, something Putin has flatly denied.\nRelatives of the victims say they have compiled a list of 85 people, most of them children, who are still missing.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with victims injured during a fire in a shopping mall, at a hospital in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, Russia March 27, 2018. Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS Opposition leader Alexei Navalny called on people to attend a protest event later on Tuesday in Moscow.\nRAW ANGER Public anger in Kemerovo was reflected in protesters’ placards.\n“How many victims are there really,?” read one, while another suggested corrupt officials had taken a bribe to sign off on the mall’s fire safety.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “Vova and Aman to prison!” read another banner, referring to Putin and the local governor.\nOne senior regional official, Sergei Tsivilev, got down on his knees to apologise to the crowd.\nNatalia and Sergei Agarkov, whose two children were killed in the tragedy along with their grandmother stood on the square holding photographs of their dead loved ones.\n“Masha was 10, Kostya was eight,” Sergei told Reuters. “Masha ... was really good at sport. She should have ran out, but everything was locked. I identified them yesterday. I didn’t see Kostya, but recognised him by his little boots.”\nAlexander Bastrykin, head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, told Putin the fire alarm system in the mall had been out of order since March 19 and that a security guard had not turned on the public address system to warn people to evacuate the building.\nHe said five people had already been detained.\nReplying to Putin, Bastrykin said: “Most of the staff ran away and left children and parents and their children to their fate.”\n“Those workers who should have been responsible for people’s safety, for organising an evacuation, they were the first to run away,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Alexander Reshetnikov and Maria Kiselyova; Writing by Christian Lowe and Andrew Osborn; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T09:50:05.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
