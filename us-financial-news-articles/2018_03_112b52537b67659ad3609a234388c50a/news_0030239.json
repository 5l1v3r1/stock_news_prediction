May, who performs under the name Flourgon, reportedly claims that he originated the phrase in his 1988 reggae track “We Run Things,” which includes the lyrics “We run things/ Things no run we.”\n“May was the first to construct such a sequence using the phrase 'We run things. Things no run we',” May's lawyers argue in the obtained documents, adding that Cyrus owes her track’s “chart-topping popularity and its highly-lucrative success” to May.\n“We Can’t Stop” features references to drug use, and was featured in Cyrus’ album Bangerz , which marked a break away from the singer’s previous more innocent persona in Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana . The song also reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nWhile the court documents don’t specify the exact amount that May is suing Cyrus for, but May’s lawyers specified $300 million to Reuters , adding that the sum “would be a reasonable compensation”, CNN Money reports . May also wants to prohibit Cyrus from obtaining further profits from the song.\nCyrus’ rep has not yet responded to media outlets’ requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T10:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T16:36:58.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
