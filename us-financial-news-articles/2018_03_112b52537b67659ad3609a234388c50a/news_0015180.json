Long eclipsed by castmates Ford and the late Carrie Fisher, he was never able turn himself into the leading man of the big screen after 1982’s “Return of the Jedi.”\nBut reviving the Skywalker role in two recent iterations of Disney’s “Star Wars” films and an active presence on Twitter has helped bring Hamill back into the spotlight.\nActor Mark Hamill poses on his star after it was unveiled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 8, 2018.

He proved his mettle well.”\nHamill, who also starred on the stage in “Amadeus” and voiced the Joker in the animated “Batman” TV series, returned the favor to Lucas.\nSlideshow (8 Images) “Let’s be honest, if it weren’t for the genius of George Lucas, I wouldn’t be standing here today,” Hamill said. “Whatever led me to his doorstep, he changed my life forever in a way that still reverberates today.”\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and is major tourist attraction.\n“From Jedi to Joker and back again, it has been a fantastic ride, thank you so much and may the force be with each and every one of you,” Hamill said.\nReporting by Rollo Ross, writing by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T02:13:55.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
