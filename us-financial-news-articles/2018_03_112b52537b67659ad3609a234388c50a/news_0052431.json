I need to see a little proof before I really commit.”\nEarly advances were dampened by the technology sector, which pulled the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq into negative territory as a scandal widened over political consultants’ use of Facebook user data.\n“Nobody’s really sure what impact the government is going to impose on their business model. I think it’s a lot of chest pounding on the part of regulators and other parties that are trying to make political hay out of it,” said Pavlik.\nLast week was Wall Street’s worst since January 2016, slammed by news that President Donald Trump would impose tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports.\nBut the markets roared back on Monday with their best day since August 2015 on hopes that the world’s two largest economies were willing to renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances.\nAt 2:37PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 27.1 points, or 0.11 percent, to 24,229.7, the S&P 500 lost 9.08 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,649.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.56 points, or 1.41 percent, to 7,118.99.\nOf the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, three had turned negative by mid-afternoon, led by a 1.7 percent decline in technology stocks.\nFacebook led technology stocks lower, down 4 percent as the scandal over the use of data by political consultants widened after a whistleblower said Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed a program to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.\nAlphabet shares fell 2.4 percent after an appeals courts resurrected a multibillion dollar copyright case brought by Oracle Corp against the tech giant.\nNvidia was another weak spot, falling 6.6 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe.\nTesla shares were off 6.4 percent after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board opened a field investigation of last week’s fatal Tesla crash and vehicle fire.\nTwitter fell 9.1 percent after short-seller Citron Research called the stock “most vulnerable” to privacy regulations.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.85-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
