The Fed’s first post-crisis rate increase came in December 2015, more than a year after it ended the bond-buying.\nPowell’s comments on his personal outlook “was basically like him saying, ‘my dot is going up,'” said Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, in contrast to Bernanke and Yellen who felt they should never reveal their own “dots.”\nThe current Fed chief will have a chance to clarify his views when he goes before a Senate panel on Thursday. Powell may try to stick closer to the script set out in his testimony in which he pledged to gradually raise rates while preventing the economy from overheating.\nReporting by Howard Schneider Additional reporting by Ann Saphir in San Francisco and Richard Leong in New York Editing by Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:22:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
