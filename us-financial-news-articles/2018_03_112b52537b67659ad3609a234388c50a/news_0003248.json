The police haven’t yet ascertained whether the first lady is also a suspect, the spokeswomen said. Netanyahu was questioned at home Friday. \nThe investigation focuses on whether Israeli officials organized positive media coverage for Mr. Netanyahu and his wife on a popular news website. In return, police say officials promoted regulation worth tens of millions of dollars to the site’s owner, telecom firm Bezeq and one of its major shareholders. \nPolice already have recommended corruption charges against Mr. Netanyahu in two other cases, but this investigation—known as Case 4000—is considered more serious by many observers because it involves larger sums of money and the country’s biggest listed telecom firm. The former director of the communications ministry and confidant of Mr. Netanyahu, Shlomo Filber, also turned state witness in the case last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T17:36:44.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
