Ofo did not disclose an updated valuation for the firm. Prior to a $700 million funding round in July 2017, Dai said Ofo was worth upwards of $2 billion.

Ofo’s previous investors include ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing, which has integrated Ofo features into its own bike sharing platform. It said it has roughly 200 million users globally and is operating in 250 cities in 21 countries. Mobike, which is backed by internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, said this year it will launch its own car-sharing platform.
