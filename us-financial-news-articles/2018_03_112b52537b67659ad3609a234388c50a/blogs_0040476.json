Exemptions for other countries could help ease tensions among other trading partners, Perdue said. \nStill, the top U.S. farm official said he believed agricultural and farm products were the \"tip of the retaliatory spear\" and would be likely targets for angry trading partners. \nWORRIES MOUNT \nChina has opened an antidumping investigation into U.S. sorghum, seen by some as a response to White House actions on washing machines and solar panels. Beijing also began enforcing stricter quality standards as of Jan. 1 on U.S. soybeans, the top agricultural export from the United States in terms of value. \nFarm groups fear that China, which imports more than third of all U.S. soybeans, could slow their purchases of agricultural products, heaping more pain on the struggling U.S. farm sector. \nTheir worries continued to grow on Monday. The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property and investment practices. \nThe European Union, in response to the metals tariffs, has targeted a slate of U.S. products from rice and orange juice, to makeup and motorcycles. \n\"Retaliation is tit-for-tat and retaliation is possible, but it's not up to us how other countries will react,\" Perdue said.
