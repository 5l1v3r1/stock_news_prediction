The pound is currently trading at $1.3744 and 88.56 pence per euro. The chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, will meet May in London on Thursday, a day after the bloc’s Brexit negotiator weakened sterling by issuing another warning to Britain, which is due to leave the bloc in March 2019. Pictet Wealth manages 200 billion Swiss francs ($211 billion) in assets.
