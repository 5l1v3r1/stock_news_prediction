ANZ had expected both targets to be set at 10 percent or lower this year.\nChina also set its consumer price index at“around 3 percent” compared with 3 percent last year, as widely expected.\nStability will be the watchword this year as President Xi Jinping pursues his vision of turning China into a“modestly prosperous” nation by 2020 and into a“strong power” on the world stage by 2050.\nAhead of the meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC) this year, authorities have stepped up a crackdown on big-spending conglomerates, after a year of financial deleveraging that has targeted risky shadow financing and curbing corporate debt.\nThe NPC, which will end on March 20, is expected to approve the restructuring of various government departments and the appointment of several key officials including a vice president, vice premiers and a new central bank governor.
