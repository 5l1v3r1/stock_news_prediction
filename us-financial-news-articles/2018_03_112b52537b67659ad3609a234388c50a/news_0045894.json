In total, 100 Russian diplomats were being removed, the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War.\n“Together with the United Kingdom and other allies and partners, Australia is taking action in response to the recent nerve agent attack in Salisbury, UK,” Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced in a statement.\n“Two Russian diplomats identified as undeclared intelligence officers will be expelled by the Australian government for actions inconsistent with their status, pursuant to the Vienna Conventions.”\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said there were other possible actions, such as Australia boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop speak to the media during a news conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, March 27, 2018.

The boycott of the World Cup is one of the further actions that could be taken in relation to this matter,” Bishop told reporters in Canberra.\nThe governing body for Australian football said that as far as it was concerned, the World Cup was going ahead as planned.\nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks to the media during a news conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, March 27, 2018.

Most of the victims were Dutch and 28 were Australian.\nInternational prosecutors concluded the airliner was shot down by a missile fired from a launcher brought into Ukraine from Russia and located in a village held by pro-Russian rebels, contradicting Moscow’s suggestion that Ukraine’s military brought down the plane.\nReporting by Wayne Cole and Colin Packham; Editing by Michael Perry and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T06:09:02.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
