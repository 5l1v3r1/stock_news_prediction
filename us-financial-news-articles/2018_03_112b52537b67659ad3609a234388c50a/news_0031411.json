That would top the $40.75-a-share all-cash deal CSRA CSRA, -0.05% agreed to last month with General Dynamics GD, +0.06% that has yet to close. \nIt isn’t clear what CSRA’s reaction to the bid is and whether CACI will ultimately prevail. \nIt would be a big bite for Arlington, Va.-based CACI, which has a market value of just under $4 billion even after its shares closed at an all-time high Friday.
