It was not clear from the statement if they also had been arrested. \nDetails of the operation, in which about 13 homes were searched, were due to be announced at a news conference later on Wednesday. \nIn an interview published on Wednesday in the Turin newspaper La Stampa, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the security threat to Italy from supporters of Islamic State was higher than ever. \nMinniti said this was because more so-called foreign fighters would be attempting to return to Europe via Italy after IS suffered a series of defeats in Syria and Iraq. \nWednesday’s operation was the latest in a string of arrests in Italy of people suspected of supporting Islamic State. \nOn Tuesday in the southern city of Foggia, police arrested an Egyptian-born man suspected of being a member of Islamic State and of indoctrinating young children in a cultural centre he ran. They said the man encouraged the children to kill non-Muslims. \nOn March 15, police acting on a tip from the U.S. FBI arrested a man of Latvian origin who they said had been preparing pipe bombs. A judge’s detention order said the man had been considering an attack on a kindergarten. \nIn recent months, Italy has stepped up expulsions of foreigners believed to be a threat to national security. So far this year, 29 have been expelled, most of them Muslims, compared to 132 for all of 2017.
