(“Evine”) (NASDAQ:EVLV) today announced results for the 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week full year ended February 3, 2018. This compares to our 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week full year ended January 28, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nNet sales were $192.7 million, a 1.2% increase year-over-year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 33.8%. Net Income was $6.4 million, a 214% improvement year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.7 million, a 19% increase year-over-year. EPS was $0.10, a 233% improvement year-over-year.\nFiscal Year 2017 Operating Highlights\nImproved profitability in the third and fourth quarters combined by 28% year-over-year. Completed the sale of our Boston television station. Paid off our $17 million high interest term loan that was needed at the beginning of Fiscal 2016. Converted our broadcast signal from SD to HD under budget and ahead of schedule. Expanded our content distribution footprint by adding new HD channels in over 10 million homes. Introduced 65 new brands including Mackenzie-Childs, Victoria Wieck, Akos Jankura, and Sharif Handbags. Significantly improved our operational efficiencies in both fulfillment and customer solutions. Improved the balance sheet by decreasing net debt by 17% compared to the end of fiscal 2015. Significantly improved our digital and mobile technology to create a more seamless experience between all devices including transitioning from a third party to native mobile app.\nExecutive Commentary\n“I’m pleased to report our fourth quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we’re making in improving profitability and strengthening our financial position,” said CEO Bob Rosenblatt. “We reached many financial milestones in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, including the highest fourth quarter net income in the history of the company, the highest fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA since 2010, and the first fiscal year of positive net income since 2007. I’m proud of the many accomplishments we made this year and also realize that we have the opportunity for continued progress, especially on revenue growth, as we leverage our undervalued interactive digital commerce assets and expertise to scale our enterprise and continue to improve our profitability and free cash flow.”\nRosenblatt continued, “Our fourth quarter sales growth of 1.2% was below our original estimates as we decided to focus on execution and profitability. As such, during the quarter we chose to minimize aggressive promotions and pulled back on marketing spend, that might have garnered higher revenues in the short term but would not have been additive to profitability or to our overall brand and company strategy. We had many successes during the fourth quarter and fiscal year by broadening our merchandising assortment vis-a-vis brand launches and extensions. In addition to that, there still remains ample opportunity and ‘white space’ to continue to strengthen and add to all merchandise categories. We have already made significant progress doing this during the Fall 2017 season and this progress is already beginning to bear fruit in 2018. The most accretive component of this to our contribution margin is in our proprietary and exclusive brand product areas. To that end, the progress to continue to minimize friction throughout the customer experience across all platforms along with continuing to broaden our assortment in proprietary and exclusive brand product areas will be the two key focuses in fiscal 2018.”\nRosenblatt continued, “Strategically, 2018 is the third year of our turnaround plan. This year is about profitable revenue growth, product development and customer growth. Reestablishing profitability and strengthening the balance sheet these past two years has not been easy but I’m proud of the strong foundation we’ve built and believe it positions us well for profitable top line growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nSUMMARY RESULTS AND KEY OPERATING METRICS ($ Millions, except average selling price and EPS) Q4 2017\n2/3/2018 Q4 2016\n1/28/2017 Change YTD 2017\n2/3/2018 YTD 2016\n1/28/2017 Change Net Sales $ 192.7 $ 190.5 1.2% $ 648.2 $ 666.2 (2.7%) Gross Margin % 33.8% 34.0% (20 bps) 36.3% 36.3% 0 bps Adjusted EBITDA $ 7.7 $ 6.4 19% $ 18.0 $ 16.2 11% Net Income (Loss) $ 6.4 $ 2.0 214% $ 0.1 $ (8.7) N/A EPS $ 0.10 $ 0.03 233% $ 0.00 $ (0.15) N/A Net Shipped Units (000s) 3,052 3,132 (3%) 10,397 10,263 1% Average Selling Price (ASP) $57 $54 6% $56 $57 (2%) Return Rate % 19.0% 18.4% 60 bps 19.0% 19.4% (40 bps) Digital Net Sales % 54.4% 51.9% 250 bps 51.9% 49.5% 240 bps Total Customers - 12 Month Rolling (000s) 1,295 1,429 (9%) N/A N/A N/A % of Net Merchandise Sales by Category Jewelry & Watches 37% 38% 39% 41% Home & Consumer Electronics 33% 31% 27% 25% Beauty 17% 17% 16% 16% Fashion & Accessories 13% 14% 18% 18% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nThe top performing category in the quarter was Home & Consumer Electronics, which grew 10% year-over-year. The Beauty category grew slightly year-over-year while Fashion, Jewelry & Watches both decreased slightly year-over-year. Return rate for the quarter was 19.0%; an increase of 60 basis points year-over-year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 33.8%, driven primarily by merchandise mix. Gross profit dollars increased 0.4% year-over-year to $65.1 million. Operating expense decreased 1.0% year-over-year to $60.4 million. Net Income was $6.4 million, a 214% improvement year-over-year, and EPS was $0.10, a 233% improvement year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $7.7 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nThe top performing category during the year was Home & Consumer Electronics, which grew 3% year-over-year compared to a 22% decrease last year. Fashion and Beauty had slight decreases and Jewelry & Watches decreased 6%. Return rate for the year was 19.0%, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was flat to last year at 36.3%. Gross profit dollars decreased 2.7% to $235.1 million. Net Income was $0.1 million, an $8.9 million improvement year-over-year and Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to $18.0 million. EPS for the fiscal year was $0.00, which includes $2.1 million, or ($0.03) of executive and management transition costs, $1.5 million, or ($0.02) of loss on debt extinguishment, $3.5 million, or $0.05 of net tax benefit from the Boston station sale, and $0.6 million, or $0.01 of gain on the Boston station sale. EPS for fiscal 2016 was ($0.15), which includes $4.4 million, or ($0.07) of executive and management transition costs, and $0.7 million, or ($0.01) of distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of February 3, 2018, total cash was $24 million, compared to $23 million at the end of the third quarter. The Company also had an additional $18 million of unused availability on its revolving credit facility with PNC Bank, which gives the Company total liquidity of approximately $42 million as of the end of the fourth quarter.\nImpact of 53 rd Week in Fiscal 2017\nBecause Evine follows a 4-5-4 retail calendar, every five to six years the Company has an extra week of operations, and this occurred in fiscal 2017. Therefore, Q4 2017 and full year 2017 have 14 and 53 weeks, respectively, as compared to the same periods last year of 13 and 52 weeks. Q4 2017 results on a 13-week basis were calculated by excluding discrete items and then dividing actual Q4 2017 results by 14 and by multiplying the quotients by 13. Using this calculation, Q4 2017 net sales decreased 6% year-over-year and there was no change in EPS.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nNote: Fiscal 2018 has 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in Fiscal 2017.\nWe expect normalized sales growth in the 2% to 5% range on a 52-week over 52-week basis, which equates to 0% to 3% on a reported basis because of the extra week in fiscal 2017. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be in the $19 to $21 million range, which would be growth of 5% to 17% year-over-year. 1\nConference Call\nA conference call and webcast to discuss the Company's fourth quarter earnings will be held at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, March 14, 2018:\nWEBCAST LINK: https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1552340/070743253029E2B1A6683BAC8C5A988C\nTELEPHONE: 1-877-407-9039 (domestic) or 1-201-689-8470 (international)\nPlease visit www.evine.com/ir for more investor information and to review an updated investor deck.\nAbout Evine Live Inc.\nEvine Live Inc.

These adjustments may include the impact of such items as loss on debt extinguishment, gain on sale of assets, executive and management transition costs, restructuring charges, the effect of other certain one-time items, and the income tax effect of such items. We are unable to quantify these types of adjustments that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. In addition, we believe such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision on inherently unpredictable events in our outlook that could be confusing to investors.\nEVINE Live Inc.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding non-operating gains (losses); executive and management transition costs; loss on debt extinguishment; distribution facility consolidation and technology upgrade costs; gain on sale of television station and non-cash share-based compensation expense. The Company has included the term “Adjusted EBITDA” in our EBITDA reconciliation in order to adequately assess the operating performance of our television and online businesses and in order to maintain comparability to our analyst's coverage and financial guidance, when given. Management believes that the term Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to make a meaningful comparison between our business operating results over different periods of time with those of other similar companies. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a metric to evaluate operating performance under the Company’s management and executive incentive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. The Company has included a reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in this release.\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis document may contain certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
