(\"Abengoa\") to identify, develop, and construct clean energy and water infrastructure assets with a global focus. Concurrently with the creation of AAGES, APUC entered into a definitive agreement to purchase from Abengoa a 25% equity interest in Atlantica Yield plc (\"Atlantica\") for a total purchase price of approximately U.S. $608 million. The transaction is expected to close sometime in the first quarter of 2018.\nOn November 10, 2017, APUC closed a bought deal offering announced on November 1, 2017, including the exercise in full of the underwriters' over-allotment option.

As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, APUC is required to revalue its U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the new tax rate. This revaluation resulted in a one-time non-cash accounting charge of $22.4 million in the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Year End Growth Highlights\nFourth Quarter 2017:\nOn October 31, 2017, The Liberty Utilities Group announced a proposed plan to phase out the Asbury coal generation facility and expand its wind resources with the development of up to 800 MW of new wind generation in or near its service territory by the end of 2020. The plan projects cost savings for customers of U.S. $172 million - U.S. $325 million over a twenty-year period. The request for approval was filed with regulators in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and, subject to their respective review, orders from the various jurisdictions are anticipated by June 2018.\nOn December 4, 2017, the Liberty Utilities Group announced plans for Granite Bridge, a new infrastructure project designed to bring natural gas supply from existing infrastructure located in New Hampshire's Seacoast region to residents and businesses in the central part of the state through an underground pipeline. The Granite Bridge project also includes a proposed Liquefied Natural Gas storage facility capable of storing up to two billion cubic feet of natural gas. The project represents a potential investment of between U.S. $320 million and U.S. $360 million and is subject to approval from regulatory authorities.\nFull Year 2017:\nOn January 1, 2017, the Liberty Utilities Group successfully completed its acquisition of The Empire District Electric Company (\"Empire\") for approximately U.S. $2.4 billion.

Specific forward-looking information in this document includes, but is not limited to: the expected completion and timeline for completion of the Atlantica transaction; expectations and plans, including potential investment amounts, with respect to the Granite Bridge project; expectations, including projected cost savings, with respect to the Asbury Coal Power Plant; expectations with respect to electricity generation by APUC's facilities; the expected closing timing and amount of indebtedness to be assumed in relation to the St. Lawrence Gas Company, Inc. transaction; expectations with respect to pending rate case filings; and expectations with respect to APUC's growth plans, earnings, cash flow and dividend amounts. These statements are based on factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including assumptions based on historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments. Since forward-looking statements relate to future events and conditions, by their very nature they require making assumptions and involve inherent risks and uncertainties. APUC cautions that although it is believed that the assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances, these risks and uncertainties give rise to the possibility that actual results may differ materially from the expectations set out in the forward-looking statements. Material risk factors include those set out in the management's discussion and analysis section of APUC's most recent annual report, quarterly report, and Annual Information Form. Given these risks, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of their dates. Other than as specifically required by law, APUC undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise.\n(1) Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe terms \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" are used in this press release. The terms \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" are not recognized measures under GAAP. There is no standardized measure of \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" and consequently APUC's method of calculating these measures may differ from methods used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A calculation, analysis and reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" can be found in the Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure calculated by APUC as cash provided by operating activities without giving effect to (as applicable): depreciation and amortization expense, income tax expense or recoveries, acquisition costs, litigation expenses, interest expense, gain or loss on derivative financial instruments, write down of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, earnings attributable to non-controlling interests and gain or loss on foreign exchange, earnings or loss from discontinued operations and other typically non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be representative of cash provided by operating activities or results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Net Earnings\nAdjusted Net Earnings is a non-GAAP measure calculated by APUC as net earnings from operations without giving effect to (as applicable): gains or losses on foreign exchange, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, acquisition costs, litigation expenses and write down of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, earnings or loss from discontinued operations and other typically non-recurring items as these are not reflective of the performance of the underlying business of APUC. It is not intended to be representative of net earnings or loss determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations\nAdjusted Funds from Operations is a non-GAAP calculated by APUC as cash flows from operating activities without giving effect to (as applicable) changes in working capital balances, acquisition expenses, litigation expenses, cash provided or used in discontinued operations and other typically non-recurring items affecting cash from operations as these are not reflective of the long-term performance of the underlying businesses of APUC. It is not intended to be representative of cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nSOURCE Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.", "external_links": ["http://services.choruscall.ca/links/algonquinpower20180302.html", "http://www.algonquinpowerandutilities.com/", "http://www.sec.gov/", "http://www.sedar.com/"], "published": "2018-03-02T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T05:16:38.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
