'Biggest asset I have is data' The CEO also told CNBC that he has other plans for the airlines, through utilizing the data and ecosystem that the group already possesses, including providing small loans to customers, and an ICO in the future.\n\"The biggest asset I have is data,\" Fernandes said, pointing to digital companies like Uber, which are trying to attain similar data at a steep cost. \"We have those customers and we have that ecosystem,\" he said.\nThe first step, according to Fernandes, is to \"remove cash off the plane.\"\n\"So you'll buy food, you'll trade with us using our payment system. But we are also bringing out points, and points are really a digital currency â€” that's where the ICO comes in,\" he said, pointing out that many AirAsia passengers are migrant workers who \"use foreign exchange services a lot\" to send money home.\nEventually, he said, the airline should be able to give out small loans to its customers, but that would probably come from a partnership and may ultimately get spun off.\nThe future of the company is clear, Fernandes said: \"For us, in the airline business, it's getting rid of cash. It's making money from [foreign exchange]. There's a huge amount to be made, for us, from [foreign exchange].\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T08:44:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
