Kim is also set to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April, followed by a planned summit with President Donald Trump. \nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s top aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said that Tokyo-Pyongyang talks have begun through the two countries’ embassies in Beijing as well as through “various means.” He declined to give details. \nThat followed a phone call March 16 in which Abe told Moon that Tokyo wanted to talk to North Korea.
