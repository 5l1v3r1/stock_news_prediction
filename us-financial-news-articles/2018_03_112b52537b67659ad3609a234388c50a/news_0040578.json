If the pro-free-trade faction prevails, I think we do go higher. If they lose, I think we go lower.\" WATCH: The connection between Kudlow and the FedEx earnings call show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T01:06:38.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
