Additionally, Blockseer’s blockchain and data analytics expertise provides the capabilities to uniquely offer class-leading enterprise solutions with a natural convergence of Blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies - data is the asset, which can be tracked and monetized utilizing blockchain technology.\nBlockseer is a blockchain and artificial intelligence company headquartered in Silicon Valley, California. Blockseer has worked with several law enforcement agencies including the U.S. Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service, and it also provides Ethereum blockchain data services for Blockchain.info, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency wallet providers.

With the Blockseer product line, and the DMG presence in the market today, Japan represents a massive opportunity for our stakeholders. We have already planned a visit for Dr. Danny Yang to visit Japan and look forward to sharing our progress in short order.”\nTerms of the Transaction\nUnder the terms of the Transaction, DMG, through its U.S. subsidiary (“ DMG-US ”), acquired Blockseer for a purchase price comprising C$2,630,769 in cash and 7,673,076 common shares of DMG (the “ Transaction Shares ”).\nThe Transaction Shares issued to the former Blockseer securities holders will be subject to vesting with such shares vesting ratably on a calendar quarterly basis over a two-year period following the Closing (the “ Trading Restrictions ”).\nFollowing the Transaction, DMG-US will own 100% of Blockseer, with DMG-US shares being owned approximately 61% by DMG and approximately 39% by the selling securityholders of Blockseer.\nUpon completion of the Trading Restrictions, each individual holder of the DMG-US shall have the option to exchange such shares at the election of the holder 1-for-1 for DMG common shares, which will be fully tradable subject to the regulations of the TSX Venture Exchange.
