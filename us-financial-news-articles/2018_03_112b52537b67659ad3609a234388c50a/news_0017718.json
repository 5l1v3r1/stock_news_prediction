McEntire is the first women to ever portray the fried chicken chain’s founder.\nIn addition to KFC, many other businesses have temporarily changed their logos to celebrate the day. Johnny Walker has transformed its bottle into “Jane Walker” for the month , replacing the iconic walking man with a woman, and McDonald’s has turned its M logo upside down for the day online and at one restaurant in California, making it a W for women.\nYesterday Mattel also unveiled a set of “role model” Barbies modeled after iconic women.", "external_links": ["https://kfc.com.my/international-womens-day"], "published": "2018-03-09T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:28:31.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
