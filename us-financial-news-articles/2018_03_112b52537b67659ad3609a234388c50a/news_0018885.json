Those demonstrations eventually led to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist dictatorship in what became known as the Velvet Revolution.\nThe Communist party, which opposes NATO membership and holds pro-Russian views, has held out chances of support for Babis, whose minority cabinet lost a confidence vote in January even though ANO handily won an October election.\nOther parties have mostly shunned Babis, who faces police charges of illegally obtaining European Union funds worth 2 million euros ($2.48 million) a decade ago. He denies wrongdoing.\nHis ANO party is chiefly negotiating with the Social Democrats whose chairman, Jan Hamacek, had said the party could join an ANO-led government but Babis’ presence remained a problem.\nDirect or indirect support might also come from the far-right, anti-EU SPD party of Czech-Japanese businessman Tomio Okamura - which has also raised concern among opposition parties and from some in ANO.\n($1 = 0.8066 euros)\nReporting by Robert Muller, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:21:14.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
