(NasdaqGS: AKRX) have filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between March 1, 2017 and February 26, 2018.

KGaA (\"Fresenius\") agreed to acquire Akorn, with the transaction expected to close by early 2018. Akorn subsequently discussed the company's compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") regulations in its public filings, noting that all of the company's FDA approved facilities received satisfactory status from the FDA. According to the complaint, however, the company failed to mention that Fresenius' acquisition of Akorn could be in jeopardy due to potential breaches of FDA data integrity requirements relating to product development at Akorn. On this news, Akorn's stock fell over 38% to close at $18.65 per share on February 27, 2018.\nAkorn Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
