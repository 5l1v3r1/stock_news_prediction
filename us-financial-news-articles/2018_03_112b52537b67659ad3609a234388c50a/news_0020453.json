prior to December 31, 2016 reflects changes made to the calculation methodology as further described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 8, 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Gross Earning Assets under Energy Contract and Total Gross Earning Assets were reduced by $13 million to reflect changes related to modifications to the Federal Tax Code for assets deployed through December 31, 2017, including a reduction held as a reserve pending final tax regulation guidance based on the company’s best estimate of the potential effect.\nNumbers may not sum due to rounding.\nThe presentation of Creation Cost for periods prior to December 31, 2016 reflects changes made to the calculation methodology as further described in our Fourth Quarter 2016 earnings presentation available on our investor relations website.\nDefinitions\nCreation Cost includes (i) certain installation and general and administrative costs after subtracting the gross margin on solar energy systems and product sales divided by watts deployed during the measurement period and (ii) certain sales and marketing expenses under new Customer Agreements, net of cancellations during the period divided by the related watts deployed.\nCustomers refers to all residential homeowners (i) who have executed a Customer Agreement or cash sales agreement with us and (ii) for whom we have internal confirmation that the applicable solar energy system has reached notice to proceed or “NTP”, net of cancellations.\nCustomer Agreements refers to, collectively, solar power purchase agreements and solar leases.\nGross Earning Assets represents the net cash flows (discounted at 6%) we expect to receive during the initial 20-year term of our Customer Agreements for systems that have been deployed as of the measurement date, plus a discounted estimate of the value of the Customer Agreement renewal term or solar energy system purchase at the end of the initial term. Gross Earning Assets excludes estimated cash distributions to investors in consolidated joint ventures and estimated operating, maintenance and administrative expenses for systems deployed as of the measurement date. In calculating Gross Earning Assets, we deduct estimated cash distributions to our cash equity financing providers. In calculating Gross Earning Assets, we do not deduct customer payments we are obligated to pass through to investors in lease pass-throughs as these amounts are reflected on our balance sheet as long-term and short-term lease pass-through obligations, similar to the way that debt obligations are presented. In determining our finance strategy, we use lease pass-throughs and long-term debt in an equivalent fashion as the schedule of payments of distributions to lease pass-through investors is more similar to the payment of interest to lenders than the internal rates of return (IRRs) paid to investors in other tax equity structures.\nGross Earning Assets Under Energy Contract represents the net cash flows during the initial (typically 20 year) term of our Customer Agreements (less substantially all value from SRECs prior to July 1, 2015), for systems deployed as of the measurement date.\nGross Earning Assets Value of Purchase or Renewal is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for systems deployed as of the measurement date.\nMW Booked represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to an executed Customer Agreement, for which we have confirmation that the systems have reached NTP, net of cancellations.\nMW Deployed represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements, for which we have (i) confirmation that the systems are installed on the roof, subject to final inspection or (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost.\nNet Earning Assets represents Gross Earning Assets less both project level debt and Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation, as of the same measurement date. Because estimated cash distributions to our cash equity financing partners are deducted from Gross Earning Assets, a proportional share of the corresponding project level debt is deducted from Net Earning Assets.\nNPV equals Unlevered NPV multiplied by leased megawatts deployed in period.\nNTP or Notice to Proceed refers to our internal confirmation that a solar energy system has met our installation requirements for size, equipment and design.\nProject Value represents the value of upfront and future payments by customers, the benefits received from utility and state incentives, as well as the present value of net proceeds derived through investment funds. Specifically, Project Value is calculated as the sum of the following items (all measured on a per-watt basis with respect to megawatts deployed under Customer Agreements during the period): (i) estimated Gross Earning Assets, (ii) utility or upfront state incentives, (iii) upfront payments from customers for deposits and partial or full prepayments of amounts otherwise due under Customer Agreements and which are not already included in Gross Earning Assets and (iv) finance proceeds from tax equity investors, excluding cash true-up payments or the value of asset contributions in lieu of cash true-up payments made to investors. Project Value includes contracted SRECs for all periods after July 1, 2015.\nUnlevered NPV equals the difference between Project Value and estimated Creation Cost on a per watt basis.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nPatrick Jobin\nVice President, Finance & Investor Relations\ninvestors@sunrun.com\n(415) 638-4007\nMedia Contact:\nGeorgia Dempsey\nDirector of Corporate Communications\npress@sunrun.com\n(415) 518-9418\nSource:Sunrun Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9bc194d3-c574-42a2-b8a7-73781d611479", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zX2OuvEmNzDk_SnzscqzaSB3m49Uryyr_851-SwS6t9dDOeBmusdn8Ih_WQ7HAvkTrCnTsGMW0yayuhu3PQZ7w=="], "published": "2018-03-07T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T03:15:26.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
