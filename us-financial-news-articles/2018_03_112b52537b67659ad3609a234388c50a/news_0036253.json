Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC index dropped 0.84 percent, reaching its lowest level since last December, while Brazil's Bovespa was flat. Broadcaster Televisa weighed on the Mexican index as shares fell more than 7.0 percent after lawsuits were filed against the company regarding its role in the corruption scandal surrounding FIFA, soccer's world governing body. Analysts said the possibility of U.S. President Donald Trump enacting protectionist trade measures added to the pressure from interest rate hikes expected to be announced Wednesday after the first U.S. Federal Reserve Policy meeting under Chairman Jerome Powell. The Mexican peso weakened 0.33 percent while the Brazilian real weakened 0.12 percent. Investors largely expect the Fed to lift its benchmark overnight lending rate to a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent and update its assessment of the economy. Traders will scrutinize the Fed's policy statement in search of clues over the pace of future rate hikes, following signs of Powell's growing confidence in the U.S. economic recovery.
