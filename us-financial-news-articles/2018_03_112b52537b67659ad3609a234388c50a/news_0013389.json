An unnamed police officer who was at the scene was also hospitalised. “I heard this morning from the head of counter terrorism policing that he (the police officer) is at least engaging with, talking to, people, but that doesn’t mean that his situation isn’t serious,” Rudd said during an interview on BBC radio.

He’s not in intensive care but it is a serious situation.” Rudd, who declined to give any further details on the exact nature of the nerve agent used, said Britons should keep a cool head in reacting to the attack and wait for conclusive evidence about what happened.
