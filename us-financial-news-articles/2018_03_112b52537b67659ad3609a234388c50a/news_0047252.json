China plans to impose additional duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports, mainly in response to Washington’s import tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nThe sparring has cast a spotlight on U.S. firms such as Apple, which assemble the majority of their products in China for export to other countries. Electrical goods and tech gadgets are the largest U.S. import items from China.\n“Trump’s trade war with China could be a win for India,” said Neil Shah, partner at tech research firm Counterpoint.\nChina is currently among the top destinations for repair and refurbishment of electronic devices.\nIndia wants waste generated during the repair and refurbishing of the imported items to be treated in line with local laws including health, safety and environment norms, a government order issued on Wednesday said.\nThe South Asian nation’s new policy on import of used goods could help smartphone makers such as Apple to cut cost as they battle rising manufacturing and labour costs in China, where a bulk of its pricey iPhones are made.\n“(New Delhi’s policy change) will give someone like Apple an opportunity to tap India’s cheap talent for repairing phones and could potentially turn India into a global export hub for refurbished devices,” said Shah.\nApple has been in talks with the Indian government for months, seeking tax breaks and incentives to expand its operations in the country.\nApple did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
