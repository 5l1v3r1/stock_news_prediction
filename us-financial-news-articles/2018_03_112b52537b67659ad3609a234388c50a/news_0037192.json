The student said that it was a BB gun and that the bullets were his father’s, according to a probable-cause affidavit.\nThe unnamed student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used a “gamer tag name” of “NickCruz,” according to the affidavit, which is similar to Nikolas Cruz, the name of the former student accused of carrying out last month’s massacre on school grounds.\nAuthorities used a longstanding state law called the Baker Act to involuntarily hospitalize the student based on self-inflicted wounds to his left arm. Under state law, certain people institutionalized under the act can be prohibited from buying a gun.\nNikolas Cruz had also raised concerns at school and beyond because of issues like a disturbing social-media post, allegations of self-harm and talk of weapons. Authorities had considered , but didn’t pursue, involuntary commitment via the Baker Act for him.\nThe two other students arrested Tuesday were charged with bringing knives to the high school, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said. The two knife-related incidents were unrelated, the sheriff’s office said.\nAdditionally, the sheriff’s office said it suspended a deputy for allegedly sleeping in his patrol car on Monday while on duty at the school. The deputy was found about a half hour after Mr. Cruz’s younger brother, Zachary Cruz, was arrested for trespassing on campus .\nThe sheriff’s office said it invoked a brand-new provision signed into law by Gov. Rick Scott this month to try to keep weapons away from Zachary Cruz. Under the new law, the sheriff’s office is seeking a risk-protection order from a circuit court that would prohibit Mr. Cruz from possessing and acquiring firearms for a period determined by the court.\nMany states launched or sped up efforts to enact so-called red-flag laws following the Florida high-school shooting.\nThe sheriff’s office noted that Zachary Cruz was also involuntarily committed for a mental-health evaluation under the Baker Act.\nGov. Scott, a Republican, sent a letter to the Broward County sheriff and the county’s public-schools superintendent to offer assistance from the Florida Highway Patrol to help provide security at Marjory Stoneman Douglas while students are on campus.\nThe governor said armed officers should be securing every point of entry to the school.\nParents “are still concerned about student safety at the school,” Mr. Scott said in the letter. “Recent events at the school have demonstrated the need for additional security measures to be implemented.”\nWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T03:53:09.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
