The peso, it said, would remain and the CUC would become history. \nHowever, it did not give a timeframe for the transition. Castro said in December last year the reform could no longer be delayed, sparking speculation it might be announced before he was due to step down as president on April 19. \nCastro will remain party chief until 2021. \nThe central bank on Thursday recalled the party’s decision at its last congress to guarantee bank deposits in accounts in foreign currencies, CUCs and pesos.
