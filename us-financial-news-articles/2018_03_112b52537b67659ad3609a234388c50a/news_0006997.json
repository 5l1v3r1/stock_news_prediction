(the \"Fund\") announced today the results of the First Measurement Period (as defined below) under its previously announced discount management program (the \"Program\").\nAs part of its ongoing efforts to enhance long-term shareholder value and provide liquidity to the market for its common shareholders, the Fund previously announced that, under the Program, it intended to offer to repurchase 10% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's net asset value (\"NAV\") if the Fund's common shares traded at an average daily discount to NAV of greater than 7.5% during the period from December 1, 2017 through February 28, 2018 (the \"First Measurement Period\").\nThe Fund's average daily discount to NAV during the First Measurement Period was 8.5%. The Fund has therefore determined to execute the repurchase required by the terms of the First Measurement Period by conducting a tender offer for 10% of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to 98% of NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") on the day after the tender offer expires. The Fund expects to commence the tender offer on or about March 16, 2018, with the expiration of the tender offer currently anticipated to be on or about April 17, 2018. Additional terms and conditions of the Fund’s tender offer will be set forth in its offering materials, which will be distributed to its common shareholders. If more than 10% of the Fund's outstanding common shares are tendered, the Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined as of the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on the day after the tender offer expires.\nImportant Notice\nThis press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer or a solicitation to buy any common shares. The offer to purchase Fund common shares in response to the results of the First Measurement Period will be made pursuant to an offer on Schedule TO. COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE TENDER OFFER MATERIALS SENT IN RESPONSE TO THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST MEASUREMENT PERIOD, INCLUDING THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND ANY SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT REGARDING THE TENDER OFFER, AS THEY MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISION REGARDING TENDERING THEIR SHARES. Common shareholders may obtain a free copy of any of these statements and other documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov or by directing such requests to the Fund.\nAbout the Fund\nThe Fund is a diversified, closed-end investment company whose primary investment objective is to seek to provide current income by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies’ debt instruments, including corporate loans, which are rated in the lower rating categories of the established rating services (BBB or lower by S&P’s or Baa or lower by Moody’s) or unrated debt instruments, which are in the judgment of the investment adviser of equivalent quality, and whose secondary investment objective is to provide capital appreciation.\nCommon shares of closed-end investment companies often trade at a discount to their NAVs, and the Fund's common shares may also trade at a discount to their NAV, although it is possible that they may trade at or at a premium above NAV. The market price of the Fund's common shares is determined by such factors as relative demand for and supply of such common shares in the market, the Fund's NAV, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its common shares will trade at, below or above NAV.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock helps investors build better financial futures.
