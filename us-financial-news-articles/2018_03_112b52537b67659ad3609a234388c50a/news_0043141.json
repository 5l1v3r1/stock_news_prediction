Al Shabaab frequently carries out bombings and other attacks in Mogadishu in a campaign to topple Somalia’s Western-backed federal government.\n“We are behind the attack at the checkpoint from where the president’s palace, parliament house and the interior ministry of the apostate government are guarded,” said Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group’s spokesman for military operations.\nHe said 13 government soldiers had been killed, without offering any evidence. The group usually claims a higher death toll from its attacks than that of the government.\nAt least 14 people were killed on Thursday when al Shabaab set off a bomb outside a busy Mogadishu hotel.\nReporting by Abdi Sheikh; Writing by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T16:43:07.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
