Some $314 million of those grants, or 64% of the total, will go to projects in rural locations, defined as those outside areas with 50,000 or more residents. About 19% percent of the U.S. population lives in those rural areas.\nThat is more than three times the $100 million minimum required to be set aside for rural areas under the most recent appropriation for the grants; in the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, $103 million in grants went to rural projects. Under Mr. Obama, the Transportation Department sent more than $1 billion total in Tiger grants to rural areas, slightly more than 21% of the $5 billion distributed through the program during his presidency.\nAnd the program is set to get bigger. Mr. Trump had proposed eliminating the grant program altogether, cutting funding to zero in both of his budget proposals. But Congress rebuffed those cuts, tripling the size of the Tiger program to $1.5 billion this year in the spending bill enacted last week . The program hasn’t been funded at that level since 2009, when it was conceived as part of the Obama administration’s effort to stimulate the economy and pull out of recession.\nThe Trump administration says it is shifting the government’s focus to areas of the country that have been neglected in the years since. “We put a real focus on rural projects,” a senior administration official said.\nThe administration has made caring for rural areas a central tenet of its plans for funding infrastructure improvements . That includes its long-stalled bid to generate more than $1 trillion in public works over 10 years, funded primarily by state and local governments, but with a designated federal funding stream for projects in rural locations.\n“For years and years and years, for decades, rural America has been ignored and forgotten,” Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a recent House committee hearing, one of several frosty exchanges with representatives of suburbs and cities, who warn that the administration is shortchanging densely populated areas and mass transportation in favor of rural roads.\nRelated Video President Trump unveiled his infrastructure initiative as he hosted governors and mayors.

Jim Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican.\nNewsletter Sign-up Mr. Obama’s Tiger grants could be small and rural, too, like a $5 million grant in 2012 to help fund the Coalfields Expressway in West Virginia. But the bulk of grants went toward addressing congestion, boosting transit and overhauling streetscapes in more densely populated cities and suburbs.\n“Problems related to transportation in the United States are largely related to congestion,” which primarily affects cities and suburbs, said Yonah Freemark, who studies transportation and urban policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s not to say rural areas shouldn’t get help, but the idea they should be prioritized over urban areas is a little surprising—though perhaps given the political considerations, not so surprising.”\nThe shift in grants will benefit some regions that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians’ reservation near Rolette County, N.D., will see $6 million for reconstruction of 5 miles of Jack Rabbit Road, a major east-west thoroughfare.\nOne Nation, Divisible Rural America Is the New 'Inner City' Rural America Is Stranded in the Dial-Up Age Struggling Americans Once Sought Greener Pastures—Now They’re Stuck Rural America's Childbirth Crisis: The Fight to Save Whitney Brown Brothers in Arms: The Tragedy in Small-Town America How Dollar General Became Rural America's Store of Choice In a Divided Nation of Big Cities and Small Towns, Caity Cronkhite Thought She Knew Where She Belonged Goodbye, George Bailey: Decline of Rural Lending Crimps Small-Town Business But on balance, the shift is a benefit to regions that supported Mr. Trump. Of the 28 all or partly rural projects funded in the current round, more than two-thirds are in counties that voted for Mr. Trump.\n“This is driven by political retribution,” said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, a California Democrat, who argues that the Trump administration’s approach saps support from the most congested areas of the country. “It’s clearly meant to benefit the Trump-supporting areas.”\nA Transportation Department official noted that eligibility criteria for the grants are publicly available, and said the 2017 awards were unrelated to the results of the 2016 presidential election.\nThe administration says its approach helps the program cover more of the country; in 2017, grants were awarded to projects affecting 43 states. ”No one state can unduly bow out other states in the Tiger program,” Ms. Chao said.\nWrite to Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:05:01.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
