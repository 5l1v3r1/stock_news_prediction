A hold can be lifted and is often used when a Security Council member wants more information, but sometimes it can lead to a permanent blocking of a proposed blacklisting.\nThe Security Council North Korea sanctions committee works on the basis of unanimity.\nIf agreed, the 33 ships proposed by the United States, 19 of which are North Korean vessels, would be subjected to a global port entry ban. Countries would also be required to deregister the 14 ships that are not North Korean.\nThe 27 proposed companies and the one individuals would be subjected to an asset freeze.\nThe U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:25:35.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
