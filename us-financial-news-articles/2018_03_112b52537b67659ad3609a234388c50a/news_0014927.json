(Nasdaq:COLL) today reported its financial results for 2017 and provided a corporate update.\n“As we strive to establish Collegium as the leader in responsible pain management, we are encouraged by the success of Xtampza ER during the fourth quarter of 2017,” said Mike Heffernan, CEO of Collegium. “Integrating the Nucynta franchise into our pain portfolio in 2018 will enhance our ability to make a positive difference in the lives of people suffering from pain.”\n“In 2017, our focus on operational execution generated significant momentum with Xtampza ER,” said Joe Ciaffoni, Chief Operating Officer of Collegium. “In 2018, the Collegium team is committed to continuing this focus so that patients who require opioid pain management can benefit from abuse-deterrent Xtampza ER, as well as the Nucynta franchise.”\nRecent Milestones\nCommercial\nPrescriptions for Xtampza ER grew to 38,044 in the fourth quarter, a 37% increase over the third quarter of 2017. Prescribers of Xtampza ER grew to 6,895 since launch, including 1,603 new prescribers in the fourth quarter of 2017. Secured new exclusive ER oxycodone formulary wins with numerous payers, including: Optum Medicare Part D, all Medicare Advantage and select Medicare PDP plans, Humana Commercial, Navitus Commercial and UPMC Commercial and Medicare D. Addition of the Nucynta franchise to the pain portfolio establishes Collegium as a leader in responsible pain management. On January 9, 2018, the transaction closed. Collegium began promotion of the Nucynta franchise in mid-February 2018.\nCorporate\nStrengthened leadership team with the addition of Scott Dreyer, SVP, Sales, Marketing, Commercial Capabilities and Training. Scott brings over 24 years of commercial leadership experience across sales, marketing, commercial operations and strategic planning, all within the biopharma industry. Scott joins Collegium from The Medicines Company, where he was the SVP, Marketing and Commercial Operations.\nClinical\nWith the recent approval of our sNDA, the updated Xtampza ER label, includes:\n° OxyContin Comparative Data - The addition of comparative oral pharmacokinetic data,\n° Oral Human Abuse Potential Study - Results of an oral human abuse potential study comparing intact and manipulated Xtampza ER to oxycodone IR were added to the label,\n° Oral Abuse Deterrent Claim - The addition of an oral abuse deterrent claim into the label that indicates that Xtampza ER has physicochemical properties that are expected to reduce abuse via the oral route.\nFourth Quarter and 2017 Financial Results\nNet Product Revenues for Xtampza ER were $10.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (the “2017 Quarter”) compared to $1.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (the “2016 Quarter”). For the year ended December 31, 2017, Net Product Revenues were $28.5 million compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The quarter ended September 30, 2017 included a one-time $4.4 million increase to Net Product Revenue as a result of the Company’s change to the sell-in method of recognizing revenue during the quarter.\nNet loss for the 2017 Quarter was $17.4 million, or $0.54 per share (basic and diluted), as compared to net loss of $27.6 million, or $1.02 per share (basic and diluted), for the 2016 Quarter. Net loss includes stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million and $1.6 million for the 2017 Quarter and 2016 Quarter, respectively.\n expenses were $2.2 million for the 2017 Quarter compared to $3.3 million for the 2016 Quarter. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in product development manufacturing costs of $664,000 and a decrease in research-related regulatory costs of $584,000.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $25.1 million for the 2017 Quarter compared to $25.4 million for the 2016 Quarter. The decrease was primarily related to higher sales and marketing costs of $3.4 million in the 2016 Quarter due to the launch of Xtampza and a decrease in Post Marketing Requirements and other regulatory costs of $1.4 million in the 2017 Quarter. These decreases were partially offset by increased personnel related costs of $2.8 million and a one-time impairment charge of $1.8 million relating to the termination of the Onsolis license and development agreement.\nCollegium had cash and cash equivalents of $118.7 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $153.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Cash used in operating and investing activities for the 2017 Quarter was $13.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were 32,770,678 common shares outstanding.\nFinancial Outlook\nBased on our current operating plans, we believe that our existing cash resources, together with expected cash inflows from the commercialization of Xtampza ER and the Nucynta franchise will fund our operating expenses, debt service and capital expenditure requirements into 2020.\nConference Call Information\nCollegium will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Xtampza ER is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral formulation of oxycodone approved by the FDA for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.\nLIMITATIONS OF USE\nBecause of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release opioid formulations, reserve Xtampza ER for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.\nXtampza ER is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.\nThe Full Prescribing Information for Xtampza ER contains the following Boxed Warning:\nWARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; and CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; AND RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS\nAddiction, Abuse, and Misuse\nXtampza ER exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing Xtampza ER and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors or conditions.\nLife-Threatening Respiratory Depression\nSerious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Xtampza ER. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Xtampza ER or following a dose increase.\nAccidental Ingestion\nAccidental ingestion of even one dose of Xtampza ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone.\nNeonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome\nProlonged use of Xtampza ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.\nCytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction\nThe concomitant use of Xtampza ER with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving Xtampza ER and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer.\nRisks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants\nConcomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.\n• Reserve concomitant prescribing of Xtampza ER and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.\n• Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.\n• Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nXtampza ER is contraindicated in patients with: significant respiratory depression; acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment; known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus; and hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to oxycodone.\nXtampza ER contains oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Xtampza ER exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. As extended-release products, such as Xtampza ER, deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of oxycodone present.\nPotential serious adverse events caused by opioids include addiction, abuse, and misuse, life-threatening respiratory depression, neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, risks of concomitant use or discontinuation of cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors and inducers, risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, risk of life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients, adrenal insufficiency, severe hypotension, risks of use in patients with increased intracranial pressure, brain tumors, head injury, or impaired consciousness, risks of use in patients with gastrointestinal conditions, risk of use in patients with seizure disorders, withdrawal, risks of driving and operating machinery, and laboratory monitoring.\nThe most common AEs (>5%) reported by patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial during the titration phase were: nausea (16.6%), headache (13.9%), constipation (13.0%), somnolence (8.8%), pruritus (7.4%), vomiting (6.4%), and dizziness (5.7%).\nFor Important Safety Information including full prescribing information visit: http://www.xtampzaer.com/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
