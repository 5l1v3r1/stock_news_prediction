With our most recent capitalization, we feel we are poised for growth in 2018 and beyond.\"\nStrategic and operational highlights during and subsequent to the full year and quarter included:\nDebuted, installed and successfully completed operational testing of new Duplex Plug and Play burner – In February 2017, ClearSign introduced its innovative Duplex Plug & Play burner, which is a simple, pre-engineered solution for the refinery process heater market. Subsequently, Clearsign completed the first installation and operational testing of the burner at a refinery in Texas. Announced the completion of initial installation assessment by Aera Energy and received an additional order from this operator – ClearSign celebrated the conclusion of experimental permit status for its first Once Through Steam Generator (OTSG) project provided to Aera Energy and was granted a permanent operating permit . Additionally, the Company received its third order from Aera Energy to install its Duplex technology in an OTSG. This is the first project using oil field waste gas as a fuel source. Secured follow-on order from California refinery – This is the second order from this California-based refinery and we believe it further validates the Duplex technology. The installation marks the first installation of the Duplex technology into a new heater rather than a retrofit into a heater with an existing burner. The Company believes that California refinery customers will continue to provide opportunities for installation of its Duplex technology. Hired industry veteran as new Head of Business Development – Stephen M. Sock joined the Company, bringing over three decades of experience and vast oil and gas industry knowledge to help accelerate commercialization efforts. Successfully completed an order from ExxonMobil for qualification tests of Duplex technology – The supermajor oil company funded tests to determine Duplex's suitability for a variety of refinery process heaters and conditions. We believe that this qualification will be a precursor to an installation at one of its refineries. Pilot test with large Chinese heating district – ClearSign entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with one of China's largest providers of heating services to run a pilot test. This is the Company's first project outside of the U.S. California regulator approves funding for collaborative demonstration project with operator – The Board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District approved funding to demonstrate ClearSign's Duplex products at a refinery. ClearSign Asia Limited formed to facilitate potential strategic investments – Launch of ClearSign Asia Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, as well as receipt of a Letter of Intent from TG CITIC Environment Investment Group which is a joint venture between Tangsteel and CITIC. Closed $12.94 M public offering of common stock – Announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 5,750,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2.25 per share.\nRevenue from our Duplex technology in 2017 was $540,000 compared to revenue of $621,000 in 2016 after delivering retrofits in the flare, refinery, and enhanced oil recovery segments. The net loss for 2017 was $9.7 million compared to $11.2 million a year ago primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative costs.\nWorking capital at December 31, 2017 totaled $263,000 including cash and cash equivalents.\nOn February 27, 2018, we received approximately $11.9 million in net cash proceeds from the closing of the offering of our common stock.\nShares outstanding at December 31, 2017 total 15,608,853.\nConference Call\nA conference call discussing the release of the Company's results for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2017 will be held today, March 27, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.
