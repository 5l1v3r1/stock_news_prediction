He said he and Tillerson got on \"quite well\" but had \"different mindsets.\"\nIran has been increasingly marginalized during the Trump administration, which has sided with Saudi Arabia in the regional battle for influence in the Middle East.\nInternational sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of the Barack Obama-era nuclear deal with Iran that was struck alongside the U.K., Russia, France, China and Germany. It allowed restrictions on Iran's economy and trading activities to be lifted as long as Tehran limited its nuclear energy program, which had long been feared as a cover for developing nuclear weapons.\nshow chapters Pompeo: Opposes enhanced interrogration 6:07 PM ET Thu, 12 Jan 2017 | 01:25 Trump has been a vociferous critic of the deal since his election, saying that Iran had not stuck to it, although he has so far stopped short of tearing up or renegotiating the agreement.\nIn January, Trump decided to stick with the deal for now, but said its \"terrible flaws\" needed to be fixed. In particular, he wants so-called \"sunset clauses\" that would allow Iran to slowly resume its nuclear activities over the next decade to be removed.\nIran has said it would not accept any changes to the deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T16:26:40.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
