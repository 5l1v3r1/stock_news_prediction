The tariffs are slated to take effect as early as next week and will be applied broadly , which counters Secretary of Defense James Mattis’ recommendation of targeted tariffs. \nIn a Department of Defense memo related to the proposed tariffs, Mattis said that while the Pentagon “concurs with the Department of Commerce’s conclusion that imports of foreign steel and aluminum based on unfair trading practices impair the national security” the U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each only represent about 3 percent of U.S. production. \nMattis cited concerns about the “negative impact on our key allies” and said that therefore “targeted tariffs are more preferable than a global quota or global tariff.” \n“While it is true what the DoD said about being able to rely on U.S. domestic sources of supply, I think the analysis didn’t get down to the supply-chain level,” Nathan noted. \n“Throughout the supply chain you’ve got companies that make products for both the civil market and the military market. The contracts on the civil side tend to be higher volume and higher profit margin, and it helps them underwrite their investments, hiring and innovation on the military side of the market,” Nathan said. “So when you do things that impact the success of their commercial enterprise, and putting tariffs on steel and aluminum would certainly do that, then [there is] the big question mark about what pressure are you going to put on the defense side of their business.” \nEchoing similar sentiments, Eric Fanning, CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association and former secretary of the Army in the Obama administration, told CNBC that the proposed tariff will “impact companies big and small in the aerospace and defense world.” \n“The aerospace and defense industry generates the largest net surplus in the manufacturing sector at over $86 billion a year. We’ve got 2.4 million people who work in the aerospace and defense industry, they are paid almost double the national average, and these companies thrive on the exports of their products,” Fanning said.
