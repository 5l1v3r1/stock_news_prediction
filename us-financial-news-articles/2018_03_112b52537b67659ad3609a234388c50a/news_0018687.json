We believe in free trade,” the official added.“We don’t think tariffs in respect of steel are at all helpful.”\nReporting by Arshad Mohammed; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:04:58.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
