We don’t see this as a situation where, like in a zero-sum game, one party loses because another party wins. Trade is beneficial for everyone. It needs to take place on the basis of rules and these rules are in place.”\nThe Commission has said it will respond to defend its interests.\n“The measures that we are prepared to take will prove that we will, on the basis of the rules, not hesitate to protect our industry,” the spokesman said.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:25:13.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
