We believe that this event requires response and action from a wide range of entities across both the public and private sectors,” BlackRock said in a note to clients.\nBlackRock’s comments are among the most detailed response yet from any part of the financial sector, which has been under pressure from clients and safety activists to re-examine relations with the weapons industry after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.\nBlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in recent years has emphasized the firm’s focus on social and governance issues, which along with the company’s size has made it a focal point of gun-safety activists.\nBlackRock had previously said it would engage with weapons companies, as have other financial firms, including State Street Corp and Bank of America. Other firms have cut marketing ties with the National Rifle Association, including First National Bank of Omaha, which will not renew a contract to issue an NRA-branded Visa card.\nRepresentatives for American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger have not responded to questions about the pressure from shareholders and other firms. Big retailers this week have put in place new restrictions, such as a decision by Dick’s Sporting Goods to halt the sale of assault-style rifles and to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy firearms.\nIn its client note BlackRock said its questions to gunmakers would include whether they require retailers to certify they do background checks and whether they require distributors to disclose regulatory warnings.\nFor retailers, BlackRock said it is asking questions such as what strategies they use to prevent the misuse of guns, such as limits on bulk purchases.
