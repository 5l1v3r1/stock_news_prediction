The data covers an eight-quarter period from Q1 2016 through Q4 2017 and is organized across eight major ecommerce industries including alcohol/tobacco/cannabis, apparel, consumer electronics, cosmetics/perfumes, department stores, furniture/appliances/home improvement, health/leisure/hobbies, and jewelry/watches/precious metals.\nAccording to the report, total fraud losses increased 7 percent from 3.80% in 2016 to 4.09% in 2017. Losses during the holiday season were higher, with fraud increasing 24 percent from 3.07% in Q4 2016 to 3.83% in Q4 2017.\nThe beauty industry was hit hard, with fraud increasing 102% for online cosmetics and perfume retailers from 2.52% in 2016 to 5.10% in 2017. Online department stores also struggled, with fraud losses increasing 48 percent from 1.47% in 2016 to 2.18% in 2017.\nLosses from account takeover fraud increased 80 percent from 0.25% in 2016 to 0.45% in 2017. Account takeover fraud occurs when a fraudster logs in as an existing user on a merchant’s site and uses pre-existing payment options to place purchases, usually shipped to a new address.\nFor online department stores, account takeover fraud increased a whopping 285%, from 0.06% in 2016 to 0.23% in 2017, representing more than 10% of total fraud losses. For jewelry and luxury watch merchants, account takeover fraud increased 194%, from 0.42% in 2016 to 1.24% in 2017.\nThrough data analysis and hundreds of interviews with merchants, Signifyd noticed the following ecommerce fraud prevention trends.\nMerchants Rejecting Legitimate Orders Due to Delivery Address Bias\nOver time, fraud prevention teams at merchants can develop a bias for delivery addresses, ZIP codes, cities, or even entire regions that just don’t “feel” right. Merchants using static rules based on ZIP codes, or relying too heavily on delivery addresses, are rejecting legitimate orders and losing revenue to false positives.\nLarger Merchants Evolving Fraud Defenses Faster\nLarger merchants outperform their smaller counterparts with higher acceptance rates and lower fraud losses. As merchants grow, they attract more experienced fraud prevention experts. These experts are better equipped to test new technologies and apply multiple methodologies, such as machine learning and liability shift options.\nPopular Products and Flash Sales Susceptible to Fraud\nWhen merchants with popular products increase their marketing efforts, they may inadvertently be driving consumers to fraudsters offering these products on Amazon or eBay. One example of product fandom that creates spikes in fraud are flash sales for limited edition items. Such flash sales are common in the cosmetics and apparel industries, where thousands of units will sell out in minutes. For merchants without machine learning, accepting thousands of orders in minutes can lead to hours of manual reviews and a great deal of chargebacks for fraudulent orders accepted during the flash sale rush.\nDetermining fraud as an individual merchant is a daunting task. Fraudsters hope merchants will act alone, with only the data available to them from each transaction. This works to the fraudster's advantage. For this reason, there is no lone wolf strategy for cybersecurity. Whenever possible, merchants should leverage the data and intelligence of peers in their industry, or in the case of this report, thousands of merchants across numerous industries.\nSignifyd provides a 100% financial guarantee against fraud and chargebacks for thousands of online retailers.
