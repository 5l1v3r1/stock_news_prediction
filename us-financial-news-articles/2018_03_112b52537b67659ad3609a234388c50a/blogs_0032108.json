Lopez Obrador unveiled his own planned cabinet last December. \nThe next president takes office on Dec. 1, and the top jobs would ultimately be up to Lopez Obrador, Polevnsky said. \nStill, she called Guajardo a \"very valuable\" official and indicated the door was open to Smith and others staying on to continue the negotiations under a MORENA government. \n\"Kenneth, of course. He's extremely valuable,\" she said, adding \"Baker too\" when asked if Guajardo's deputy might also be retained. \"There are a lot of very valuable people.\" \nGuajardo on Thursday urged officials to wrap up the talks quickly, but conceded that was unlikely to happen before the regular session of the Mexican Congress ends on April 30. \nThat raises the possibility of the renegotiation extending well into 2018 or beyond. \nGuajardo, speaking in Sao Paulo and asked whether he would stay on, told Reuters: \"That will depend on who wins the election and if they decide to invite us.\" \nLopez Obrador, whose criticism of Pena Nieto's economic reforms has alarmed influential sections of the business community, has expressed support for NAFTA.
