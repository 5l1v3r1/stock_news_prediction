A Tokyo-based spokesman for Bank of Japan Merrill Lynch declined to comment.\nVarious banks were sued by U.S. investors for colluding to fix bond prices, which investors argued forced them to accept unfair prices on securities.\nLast year, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America agreed to pay a combined $65.5 million to settle investor litigation accusing large banks of rigging the roughly $9 trillion market for U.S. government agency bonds.
