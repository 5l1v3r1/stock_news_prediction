Under Armour took steps to notify affected users, and is now is working with data security firms and law enforcement to assist in its investigation. \nThis story is developing, please check back for more information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T23:52:14.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
