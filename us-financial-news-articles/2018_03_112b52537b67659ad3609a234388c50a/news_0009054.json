The accord“is conditioned on the presentation by Sete Brasil of a world-class rig operator with deep water experience,” it added.\nSete Brasil, which was founded in 2008 to fill the world’s biggest deep-water drilling fleet order, filed for bankruptcy in 2016 after efforts to secure a long-term contract with Petrobras failed. That led to a legal dispute with the oil company.\nReporting by Gram Slattery; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T19:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:15:54.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
