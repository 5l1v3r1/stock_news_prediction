This should not and will not change because of any single event at a particular time,\" Xi said.\nSpeculation about a possible visit by Kim to Beijing was rife earlier this week after a train similar to the one used by Kim's father was seen in the Chinese capital, along with heavy security and a large motorcade.\nKim was accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, Xinhua said.\nXi had accepted an invitation from Kim to visit North Korea, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.\nImproving ties between North Korea and China would be a positive sign before planned summits involving the two Koreas and the United States , a senior South Korean official said on Tuesday. \nIn response to the Chinese government's announcement of Kim's visit, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters, \"The Chinese government contacted the White House earlier on Tuesday to brief us on Kim Jong Un's visit to Beijing. The briefing included a personal message from President Xi to President Trump, which has been conveyed to President Trump.\"\nKim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, met then-president Jiang Zemin in China in 2000 before a summit between the two Koreas in June that year. That visit was seen at the time as reaffirmation of close ties with Beijing.\n— CNBC.com contributed to this report .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/978781974042169344", "https://twitter.com/PDChina/status/978786105184026624"], "published": "2018-03-28T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T03:14:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
