Some of those who fled were opposition politicians who said they feared for their lives.\nBaricako’s party RANAC was a coalition of three political parties during the 2015 elections and registered as a single party in December 2016.\nWriting by Maggie Fick; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T14:42:41.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
