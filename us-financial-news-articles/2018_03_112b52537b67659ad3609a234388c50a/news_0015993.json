In the first part of the year, the division was unable to pass on higher freight rates to customers.\nAppel said that the division had seen growth in sales and profit in the fourth quarter, with EBIT up 18.3 percent, and that he was confident 2018 would see \"significant improvements\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T10:44:34.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
