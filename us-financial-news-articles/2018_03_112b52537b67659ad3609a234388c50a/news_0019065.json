Hodge’s 64th-minute try extended the Rebels’ slim 14-10 lead to 21-10 and the home side then quickly notched further tries to winger Jack Maddocks and replacement scrumhalf Michael Ruru to blow the scoreline out. The Rebels’ Japan international number eight Amanaki Mafi, who scored a first half try, produced several storming runs that got his team over the advantage line in a match that never really developed a flow. The Brumbies, who have been Australia’s best team the last two seasons, initially dominated in the scrum but were on the back foot after the first 20 minutes and their only points came from tries to wingers Chance Peni and Henry Speight.

Flanker Liam Squire, winger Waisake Naholo and number eight Luke Whitelock also crossed for the home team, who defended superbly as the Stormers hammered at their line. Stormers’ lock Chris Van Zyl and teenage flyhalf Damian Willemse scored for the visitors.
