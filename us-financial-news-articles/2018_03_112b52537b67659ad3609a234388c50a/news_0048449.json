They include a new suite of software services along with an updated iPad. The new tablet adds the company’s latest mobile processor with some other upgrades for the same price as its predecessor. That includes a 9% price discount for schools.\nApple last updated its iPad lineup a year ago , culling some offerings while trimming the price on its flagship 9.7-inch version. That didn’t arrest a long-running decline in sales for the pioneering tablet. iPad unit sales fell 4% in the fiscal year ended September, and Wall Street expects another 6% decline for the current year.\nBut Tuesday’s announcement wasn’t simply Apple trying to bolster what is now its fourth-largest business, behind the iPhone, services and Mac in terms of annual revenue. The company has lost significant ground to arch-rival Google in the education market. Apple accounted for nearly half of the laptops and tablets sold in the U.S. K-12 market in 2013, while Google’s Chromebooks accounted for 20%, up from 1% a year earlier, according to Futuresource Consulting. Last year, devices running Google’s Chrome OS accounted for 58% of that market.\nRelated Video On the iPhone’s 10th birthday, former Apple executives Scott Forstall, Tony Fadell and Greg Christie recount the arduous process of turning Steve Jobs’s vision into one of the best-selling products ever made. Watch the full documentary at wsj.com/docs. (Originally Published June 28, 2017) Altering that trajectory will be a major challenge, even for the world’s most valuable company. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., GOOGL 0.69% has the advantage of both price and ubiquity. The cheapest Chromebooks are about 40% less than the cheapest iPad, and Google’s G-Suite of services is already widespread in schools. Gmail alone passed the 1-billion-user mark two years ago.\nApple’s software often gets high marks. But the company’s software and services only work on its own equipment. That means the company’s prospects are always closely tied to its ability to sell devices. And since those devices still drive the majority of Apple’s operating profits, the company can’t really afford to compete on price.\nGoogle, which doesn’t even make most of the Chromebooks bearing its operating system, has no such limitations. Apple’s approach has served it well overall. But in budget-constrained markets like education, the right price isn’t always one the company can meet.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T01:50:05.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
