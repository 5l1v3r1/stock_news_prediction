Wall Street scored its best day in 2-1/2 years and the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its third-biggest point gain ever on Monday, as trade war fears eased on reports the United States and China are willing to renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances. \nGrains prices at 0023 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 452.75 -1.50 -0.33% -1.63% 476.57 34 CBOT corn 374.50 0.50 +0.13% -0.73% 380.49 38 CBOT soy 1025.00 -0.50 -0.05% -0.32% 1043.53 41 CBOT rice 12.45 -$0.02 -0.12% +0.69% $12.34 62 WTI crude 65.59 $0.04 +0.06% -0.44% $62.35 70 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.245 $0.001 +0.06% +0.80% USD/AUD 0.7747 0.000 +0.01% +0.66% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
