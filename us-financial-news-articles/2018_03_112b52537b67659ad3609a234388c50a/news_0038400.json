Any covert or overt attempt to misuse social media including Facebook to influence India's electoral process through undesirable means will neither be tolerated, nor be permitted.\"\nAn India-based spokeswoman for Menlo Park, California-headquartered Facebook did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\nCambridge Analytica has denied media accusations and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.\nFacebook has said it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015, but the issue has continued to rock the companies involved as well as some political parties across the world.
