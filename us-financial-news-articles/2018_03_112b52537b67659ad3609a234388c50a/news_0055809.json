REUTERS/ Stefano Rellandini \nThe opportunity to stream programs through Open Fiber’s network, alongside Sky’s existing satellite offer, will begin in summer 2019, the joint statement said. \nThe announcement confirms a Reuters story on Tuesday that the pair were close to signing a deal. \nThe move comes as more traditional broadcasters review business models to offer customers more services to fend off increased competition from online content providers like Netflix. \n“Sky’s mission is to be at the center of both innovation in the TV industry and the digitalization process of Italy. This agreement with Open Fiber is an important next step,” Sky Italia Chief Executive Andrea Zappia said in the statement. \nOpen Fiber, jointly controlled by Italy’s state-controlled utility Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, is rolling out a fast fiber optic network to take on phone incumbent Telecom Italia. \nZappia said he believed pay-TV had “significant room for growth and fiber represents an innovative and simple way to deliver more quality TV and on-demand content into the heart of Italian homes”. \nThe accord will give Sky Italia access to the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) ultrafast broadband network Open Fiber is laying in more than 270 Italian towns and cities by 2022. \nSky boasts 23 million customers in seven countries, including the UK, Italy and Germany.
