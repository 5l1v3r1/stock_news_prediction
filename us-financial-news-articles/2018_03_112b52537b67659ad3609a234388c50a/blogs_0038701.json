It is unclear whether the list will include a broad range of options mooted by both sides during recent negotiations hosted by the White House, or whether it will provide narrower recommendations, the sources said. \nOfficials for the EPA and Agriculture Department did not respond to requests for comment. \nThe RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel each year, or buy credits, known as RINs, from those that do. As biofuels volumes have increased, the price of RINs has too. Merchant refiners such as Valero and bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions say the costs have become too burdensome. \nTrump told lawmakers and industry officials in a closed-door meeting earlier this month that he supported a temporary cap on the price of RINs at 10 cents each, according to a source who attended but asked not to be named. \nBut a group of corn-state lawmakers told Trump in a letter last week that a cap would have \"severe and immediate\" consequences to farmers and the biofuels industry, by reducing incentives for blending. \nTrump also said he supported expanding sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round a tweak long sought by ethanol producers, according to the source. \nCredit costs have fallen roughly 40 percent in the past three weeks amid the political uncertainty, trading at 40 cents each on Monday, traders said.
