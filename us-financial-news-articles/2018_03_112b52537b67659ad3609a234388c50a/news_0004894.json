Kevin Durant matched Curry’s 28-point total on 12-for-19 shooting, while Young finished with 16 points and Thompson added 15.\nGolden State’s Draymond Green recorded team highs in rebounds (seven) and assists (nine) and scored two points. The Warriors connected on 11 of their 31 3-point attempts while earning their sixth straight victory over the Hawks.\nDennis Schroder backed Bazemore’s 29 points with 27 for the Hawks, who hit 15 of 35 3-point attempts.\nSchroder also recorded a team-high nine assists.\nJohn Collins added 16 points and a game-high eight rebounds, and Taurean Prince had 15 points for Atlanta, which has a far better record against Western Conference teams this season (10-13) than Eastern clubs (9-31).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:35:40.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
