Under the formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops.\nSome Catholic leaders outside China, particularly Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, has been highly critical of the accord, saying the Vatican would be “selling out” to China’s Communist Party.\nReporting by Philip Pullella, Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:57:46.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
