Drawing from more than 20 years’ experience in marketing leadership positions, Harris is responsible for defining, leading, and executing strategic marketing programs for JDog as the company adds territories and expands its nationwide footprint. She will lead the charge in driving consumer and enterprise awareness of the JDog brand, providing franchisee support, and fostering strategic relationships.\n“Suzanne is a stellar marketing professional with a unique background in executing marketing and branding strategies for companies in a variety of industries, including the franchise space,” said Jerry Flanagan, founder and Chief Executive Officer of JDog. “As an organization experiencing rapid growth and interest, JDog is fortunate to benefit from Suzanne’s talents. Her professional track record and integrated approach to marketing more than qualify her for the role, and her experiences as the daughter of a serviceman equip her to connect on an intimate level with JDog business owners and employees.”\nPrior to JDog, Harris was Founder and President of SRH Marketing Group, a boutique consulting practice specializing in marketing, corporate and investor communications, event management, fundraising, and public relations. For more than 13 years, Harris served as an outsourced Chief Marketing Officer and Marketing Director for multiple companies representing technology, real estate, financial, luxury travel as well as for various franchise industries.\nHarris also has a strong family legacy of military service. Her father served in the U.S. Navy for 15 years as an Aircrew Member in Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) operations, her father-in-law and two grandparents served in the U.S. Army, and several uncles are also military Veterans.\n\"I'm a purpose-driven marketer, and the mission of JDog is personal for me,” said Harris. “I come from a long line of military service, and now my children and nephew are considering opportunities with the military. I’ve seen firsthand the difficulties veterans face when reintegrating into civilian life, and am proud to be part of an organization and a movement that honors our veterans and creates a path for them to have successful careers and a bright future outside the service.”\nJDog awards franchises exclusively to military Veterans and their family members. To date, JDog has awarded more than 500 territories and created over 1,000 job opportunities across 130 active locations. Franchise owners operate easily recognizable, camouflaged vehicles and trailers and wear military-style uniforms.\nThe company is committed to protecting the environment by recycling, reprocessing, and repurposing items it collects from both residential and commercial customers. Last year alone the organization recycled more than 20,000 tons of junk, and salvaged millions of dollars of product for donation, resale, and reuse. JDog makes this happen by working closely with local and national organizations, as well as local schools, churches, and hospitals to donate useful items to those in need.\nFor more information, or to schedule a service with your local JDog Junk Removal, visit www.jdog.com .
