Walmart acquired the company in 2016. \nLore has said Jet.com aims to target consumers in urban markets who might not frequent Walmart stores. Late last year it launched its own private-label brand, Uniquely J , in a bid to win more of those shoppers' dollars and boost profit margins. \n\"With Jet Grocery being an integral part of the strategy, Simon brings incredible experience in scaling grocery delivery and his unique background in converging technology and retail to create amazing experiences for customers,\" Lore said in the memo.\nCurrent Jet.com execs Andrew Gasper, David Echegoyen and Jack Hanlon will report to Belsham, Lore said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T16:36:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
