REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay Last month Tata Steel guaranteed its Dutch division that it could continue to operate as an independent company within the planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, with control over its own profits and an independent supervisory board.\nA company logo is seen outside the Tata steelworks near Rotherham in Britain, in this March 30, 2016 file photo. REUTERS/Phil Noble/Files “Should the agreement for the Netherlands remain in place we will demand the same for us,” Markus Grolms, who also serves as trade union secretary at the IG Metall union, told Reuters. “But then a joint venture no longer makes sense because every unit would only act on its own.”\nThyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last year announced plans to combine their European steel operations to create the continent’s second-largest player after ArcelorMittal ( MT.AS ), including up to 4,000 job cuts.\nThyssenkrupp declined to comment.\nReporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff; Writing by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:47:52.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
