Chinese shares declined about 1.7 percent.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4 percent for its fourth consecutive day in the red.\nThe index is headed for its first quarterly decline since late 2016 as the risk of faster U.S. rate rises and a trade war spooked investors who had enjoyed a multi-year bull run.\nSouth Korea’s benchmark share index rose 0.3 percent, one of only three markets in positive territory.\n“Protectionism remains a source of volatility and downside risk for equities,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note.\n“Asia ex-Japan equity outperformance is in part a function of faster growth and capital inflows - both clearly at risk in a trade war.”\nIN SEARCH OF SAFETY In the uncertain global economic climate, investors looked to pile into the Japanese yen, traditionally a safe haven asset thanks to the country’s massive current account surplus.\nSpeculators added short dollar bets to their portfolios, taking the net short position to its highest in more than a year, according to calculations by Reuters and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for the week to March 20.\nShort yen positions were cut to the smallest since November 2016.\nBy late Asian trade, the yen had eased slightly from near 16-month highs to 104.90 per dollar while the Australian and New Zealand dollars, a liquid proxy for China plays, staged a welcome rebound.\nThe Aussie was up 0.3 percent while the kiwi gained 0.6 percent.\nThe dollar index tracking the greenback against six other major currencies was near a one-month low at 89.423.\nIn commodities, international Brent crude futures opened above $70 per barrel for the first time since January but the gains could not be sustained as the ongoing trade disputes weighed on global markets.\nSpot gold was flat at $1,346.8199 an ounce.\nReporting by Swati Pandey Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:13:57.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
