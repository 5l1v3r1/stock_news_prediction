A 2012 reform created a wholesale market and required Bezeq to lease its lines to smaller competitors.\nThe authority said the suspected abuse by Bezeq involved blocking and obstructing competitors who wished to deploy a line-based communications network over the Bezeq infrastructure.\n“This conduct could impede the development of competition in the supply of communications services such as internet, television and line-based telephony,” the authority said.\nBezeq and its CEO were granted a hearing for the authority’s commissioner on May 6.\n$1 = 3.4528 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Tova Cohen\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:13:47.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
