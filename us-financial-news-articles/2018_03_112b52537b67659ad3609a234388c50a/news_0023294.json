Rick Scott has signed, saying it violates the Second Amendment by raising the age to buy guns from 18 to 21.\nThe lawsuit came just hours after Gov. Scott, a Republican, signed the compromise bill Friday afternoon.\nLawyers for the NRA want a federal judge to block the new age restriction from taking effect.\nThe new legislation raises the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21, extends a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns and bans bump stocks that allow guns to mimic fully automatic fire. It also creates a so-called \"guardian\" program that enables teachers and other school employees to carry handguns.\nThe new measures come in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.\nWATCH: The list of companies that have bailed on NRA partnerships show chapters Here's the list of companies that have bailed on partnerships with the NRA      7:00 PM ET Mon, 26 Feb 2018 | 01:08", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T01:41:14.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
