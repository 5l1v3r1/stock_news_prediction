That mainly consist of revenue from infotainment and development agreements for self-driving cars.\n(Reporting by Alexandria Sage in San Fransisco and Sonam Rai in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T02:05:28.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
