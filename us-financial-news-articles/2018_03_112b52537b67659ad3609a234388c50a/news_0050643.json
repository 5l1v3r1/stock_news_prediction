Amazon declined to comment on Trump’s tweet on Thursday.\n“These market darlings have had a strong ride for so long and this mini-tech wreck or breather is kind of what we needed,” said Roseen.\nINTERNATIONAL STOCKS PUNISHED During the latest week, U.S. investors also turned on international stocks, which have been a popular place to sock away gains from the domestic market. Non-domestic equity funds recorded $340 million in withdrawals during their first week of outflows this year.\nEuropean stock funds posted $1.2 billion in withdrawals, their fourth straight week of outflows, according to Lipper. The euro zone’s momentum has been losing pace, according to Citigroup’s economic surprise index for the currency bloc, which is crouched near a two-year low.\nJapanese stock funds posted $638 million in withdrawals during the week, the most since July, Lipper said.\nBoth Japanese and European markets, which carry currency risks for U.S. investors, are down over the last month.\nIt was the second week of pressure for stock funds, which posted $9.6 billion in withdrawals the week prior, according to Lipper. Overall, the funds have attracted $55 billion this year.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Jennifer Ablan and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T01:35:02.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
