The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.\nMoody’s Investors Service downgraded Tesla’s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody’s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to “the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.”\nTesla’s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month , making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla’s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.\nFor starters, Tesla’s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group’s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.\nTesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.\nTesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won’t be comfortable if Tesla can’t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.\nNewsletter Sign-up Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn’t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.\nAnd Tesla can’t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.\nMore debt isn’t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won’t help—nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear .\nIf next week’s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com \n\nCorrections & Amplifications \nMoody’s downgraded Tesla’s debt on Tuesday afternoon.
