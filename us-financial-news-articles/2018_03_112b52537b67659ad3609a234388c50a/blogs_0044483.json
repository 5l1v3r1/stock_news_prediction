But if you look closely, there's a ladder from Uber's building to Lyft's — and employees are scrambling over.\nJuicero gets a building\nAnd don't forget Juicero, the juicing machine start-up that raised $100 million from investors — only to be shut down after it was revealed that the company's juice bags could be squeezed by hand, eliminating the need for its $700 machine. It now has its own building in \"Silicon Valley.\" On another note, the building nearby that used to house Alibaba and Yahoo no longer bears their logos.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T20:14:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
