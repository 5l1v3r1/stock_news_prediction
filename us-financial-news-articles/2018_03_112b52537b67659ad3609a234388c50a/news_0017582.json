For instance, the University of Pittsburgh has the best philosophy program in the world. Colorado School of Mines offers the best engineering program. University of California, Davis is home to the number one veterinary sciences program in the world. \nThat's according to UK-based higher education analytics company Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). \nQS calculated statistics from hundreds of universities worldwide to see which institutions were the strongest in 48 different subjects, from accounting to veterinary science. They found that 10 institutions consistently landed in the top 10 places of these subject rankings.\nHere are the 10 universities with the most top 10 subject rankings:\nJeff Greenberg/UIG via Getty Images National University of Singapore 9.

Harvard had 14 number one programs — including in Accounting, Business and Medicine — and 34 top-10 programs.\nAmerican universities account for more than half of the list, but according to QS's research, there was a slight decrease in the dominance of American universities in 2018.\n\"To be clear: It is going to be some time before the US's pre-eminence as a higher education research nation could reasonably be said to be in dispute,\" says Ben Sowter, Research Director at QS. \"But our 2018 results indicate that it is being relentlessly diminished by increasingly competitive research programs in nations around the world .\"\n\"In previous years, we have seen 'second-tier' U.S. institutions find themselves beleaguered by ranking regressions,\" explained Sowter. \"However, the performances of top institutions such as Cornell , UCLA and Yale — especially the latter, whose top-10 tally is now matched by the National University of Singapore — suggest that very few institutions are insulated from the inexorable worldwide improvement we are observing.\"\nLike this story?
