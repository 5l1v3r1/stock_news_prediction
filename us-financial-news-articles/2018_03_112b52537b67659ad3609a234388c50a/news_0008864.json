REUTERS/Eric Vidal “The president’s call for government shakeup would deny results of democratic election two years ago,” Fico told reporters.“If there is any government shakeup, it must be a result of an agreement between coalition partners. The constitution sees no role for the president in this process.”\nPresident Andrej Kiska made the comments in a televised speech following the murder of an investigative journalist and his girlfriend that has shaken the nation last weekend.\nKiska does not have any formal powers to trigger the fall of the three-party government.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Writing by Robert Muller; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T22:46:33.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
