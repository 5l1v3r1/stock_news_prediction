Authorities visited the grave on Friday and a doctor conducted an autopsy on the bodies.\n“The case has been filed at Mansi police station under section 302 (of Myanmar’s Penal Code), a murder charge,” said Thura Myo Naung, a spokesman for police in Kachin state who declined to comment further other than to say police were investigating.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement posted on its Facebook page the bodies had “penetration wounds on the left cheek” and the backs of their heads had “exploded”.\nThe men went missing while herding buffalo, according to a missing persons complaint filed on Feb. 5, said the statement, which did not mention the alleged involvement of soldiers.\nMilitary spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi declined to comment on the case.\nFortify Rights had raised concerns about the two men last month and cited two witnesses who said they saw soldiers detain them. One witness said soldiers tried to put KIA uniforms on the men, according to the group, which kept the witnesses anonymous.\nAung Myu San, a Kachin youth leader in Maing Hkawng, said the doctor’s autopsy report had not yet been made available but he had seen the bodies along with other residents.\n“When we personally went there to look, we saw the situation and we thought it looked like a gunshot to the mouth because the back part of the head is totally gone,” he said.\nMyanmar’s security forces are also accused of rape, murder and arson of Muslim Rohingya in a campaign launched in response to insurgent attacks in August in the western Rakhine state, prompting hundreds of thousands to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.\nMyanmar has asked for “clear evidence” of atrocities in Rakhine, but the U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein called on Friday for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court for what he said may be “acts of genocide” against the stateless Rohingya minority.\nWriting by Simon Lewis; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T10:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T11:21:52.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
