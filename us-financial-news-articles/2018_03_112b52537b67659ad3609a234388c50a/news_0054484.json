It will be the final test for fast bowler Morne Morkel. \nThe storm that has followed the scandal has been widely felt in Australia and saw coach Darren Lehmann announce on Thursday that he was quitting at the end of the series. \nTeams: \nSouth Africa: Faf du Plessis (captain), Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Themba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wicketkeeper), Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel. \nAustralia: Tim Paine (captain and wicketkeeper), Joe Burns, Matt Renshaw, Usman Khawaja, Peter Hanscomb, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Pat Cummins, Chadd Sayers, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.
