The company says it has already received more than 7,000 orders for the cars from the Italian postal service and from ARVAL, a vehicle-leasing service.\nThe cars top out at 70 kilometers per hour (a little under 45 MPH) and have a range of 150 kilometers (just over 90 miles). A designer for XEV told South China Morning Post that China was the biggest market for their cars, and the company is in talks to set up a production line on the mainland.\nLSEV is 3D-printed low-speed electric vehicle that's expected to go on sale next year.
