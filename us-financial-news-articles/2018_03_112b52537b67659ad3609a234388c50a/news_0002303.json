But that is why we were impressing upon the American administration the unacceptable nature of these proposals that are going to hurt them every bit as much as they are going to hurt us, and we are confident we're going to continue to be able to defend Canadian industry,\" Trudeau told reporters at a news conference in Barrie, Ontario. \nOfficials have not said whether U.S. President Donald Trump 's plan for tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum products would include imports from Canada and Mexico.
