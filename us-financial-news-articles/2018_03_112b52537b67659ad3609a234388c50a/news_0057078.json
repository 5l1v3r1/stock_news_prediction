He also observed that the “team had demonstrated no real willingness or desire to improve the culture within their organisation”. \nPaine stressed that they had now taken on board all that was being said. \nWhile his team mates had been ordered to tone down their on-field aggression, Paine was confident this new attitude will not mean they lose their intensity. BUILD BACK RESPECT \n“We want to be super competitive but we also want to be respectful of our opposition. We are slowly trying to build back the respect of the cricket world and our fans,” he said. \n“We know we have a really long journey ahead of us to get to where we want to but the last couple of days have been the start of that.” \nAfter such a turbulent week, the 33-year-old Paine admitted there had been far less on-pitch chatter with the South African players in Johannesburg when compared to the first three ill-tempered tests. \n“I still think it was really competitive, there wasn’t too much verbal going back and forth between the two sides and we have spoken about that as a group, going forward that is not the way we are going to play our cricket,” he said. \n“At times we have tended to push the (sledging) boundaries as far as we possibly could and we have seen that people don’t like that. It is time for us to change. \n“We are happy to do that and I actually think it suits this group of players, we are a different group than Australia have had for a long time. \n“We don’t have too many guys that like to verbalise and have that hard-nosed Australian approach. We are about creating an environment where guys can come in and play their cricket and just be themselves.” \nPaine added there was a lot of sympathy within the team for the three players sent home and that Smith’s emotional press conference in Sydney on Thursday, when the former skipper repeatedly broke down in tears as he apologised for his actions, had been hard to watch. \n“A few guys watched it and it really cut them up. You saw how much not playing for Australia is hurting those guys. It’s important for us to realise how lucky we are and how privileged we are,” said Paine.
