Casin also said it planned to eventually build an exchange in China using CHX technology.\nThe politically sensitive deal was originally approved by the SEC staff, but the agency’s commissioners, led by Jay Clayton, an appointee of U.S. President Donald Trump, stayed the decision pending their own review.\nWhen it blocked the sale, the SEC said CHX could not provide key information it had requested, including access to the potential owners’ books. The regulator also said it was not convinced the exchange would be properly monitored after a deal.\nCHX has also proposed giving certain trading firms faster access to orders on the exchange if they agree to strict trading obligations aimed at making it easier for others to buy and sell stocks.\nThe SEC originally approved that plan, but the approval was also stayed by the SEC’s commissioners, who have yet to issue a final ruling.\nReporting by John McCrank; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:40:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
