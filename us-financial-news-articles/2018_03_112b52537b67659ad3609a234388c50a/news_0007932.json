That data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nReports on weekly jobless claims and ISM’s index of national factory activity are also expected on Thursday.\nFed New York head William Dudley is due to speak on trade and globalization at a Central Bank of Brazil event.\nAmong stocks, Novavax soared nearly 30 percent after the vaccine developer reported positive results from early-stage study of influenza vaccine.\nBest Buy jumped around 5 percent after it reported for the fourth quarter, recovering from falls overnight due to the U.S. consumer electronics retailer’s announcement of 250 small mobile phone store closures.\nShares of steel companies AK Steel and US Steel Corp gained on signs of a possible major trade announcement by President Donald Trump, who has been considering imposing hefty tariffs on imports of the metals from China and other countries.
