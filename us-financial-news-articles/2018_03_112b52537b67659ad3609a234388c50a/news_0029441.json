The research, which was conducted by researchers at the State University of New York at Fredonia and non-profit journalism organization Orb Media, found an average of 10.4 plastic particles per liter of water, which is twice the amount of contamination found in tap water, according to another Orb Media investigation . \nThe study, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a journal, tested well-known bottled water ranging from Aquafina, Dasani, Nestle Pure Life to San Pellegrino.\nResearcher Sherri Mason of the State University of New York at Fredonia told AFP that 65% of the plastic particles found were \"fragments\" of plastic, and included the plastic used to make some bottle caps.\nMore from USA Today: \nTravelers who landed in Detroit, Newark, Memphis pop up with measles \n94% of U.S. tap water contaminated by plastic fibers â€” including from the faucets at Trump Tower\nOur trash is harming the deepest fish in the ocean \n\"I think it is coming through the process of bottling the water,\" Mason told AFP. \"I think that most of the plastic that we are seeing is coming from the bottle itself, it is coming from the cap, it is coming from the industrial process of bottling the water.\"\nSo, is it dangerous to drink bottled water? \nResearchers caution that it's unclear what effect microplastics can have on the human body. And, microplastics have been found in everything ranging from fish and shellfish found at the super market to tap water.\n\"There are connections to increases in certain kinds of cancer to lower sperm count to increases in conditions like ADHD and autism,\" said Mason. \"We know that they are connected to these synthetic chemicals in the environment and we know that plastics are providing kind of a means to get those chemicals into our bodies.\"\nThe World Health Organization confirmed to BBC that it is launching a review into the potential risks of drinking bottled water.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:54:38.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
