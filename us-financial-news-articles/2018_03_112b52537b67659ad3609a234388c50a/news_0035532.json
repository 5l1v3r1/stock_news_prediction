(head office: Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, CEO: Daizo Shimamura), an organization that provides research funds to the Project Research Center For Clinical Trials and Preventative Medicine at the Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences, the organization that carried out the world's first clinical study (24 weeks) of the long-term oral intake of NMN (Î² nicotinamide mononucleotide).\nClinical studies on oral NMN intake are currently underway at the Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences: Project Research Center For Clinical Trials and Preventative Medicine.\n(However, there are no plans for public disclosure of the clinical research results.)\nUMIN trial ID: UMIN000025739\nhttp://rctportal.niph.go.jp/en/detail?trial_id=UMIN000025739\nBased on the results of these clinical studies at Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences: Project Research Center For Clinical Trials and Preventative Medicine, Shinkowa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. intends to create products based on the newly discovered effects of NMN, and to continue clinical research related to the possibilities that have emerged in relation to these new effects.\nAlthough we do not plan to publicly announce the results of this clinical study, we do intend to actively disclose the information free of charge to researchers and organizations involved in NMN research.\nIn September 2015, Shinkowa Pharmaceuticals commissioned clinical trial contractor DRC Co., Ltd. to implement the world's first human clinical trial of NMN. The trial has been completed and we have already received the clinical results.\nBy acquiring the shares of Hakushindo Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., we will further build up the clinical trial results database of the Hiroshima University Graduate School of Biomedical & Health Sciences: Project Research Center For Clinical Trials and Preventative Medicine.\nAbout Clinical trial by DRC Co., Ltd.\nClinical trial name: Study on the Lipid Improvement Effects of Ingesting Foods and Compounds Containing Resveratrol and Nicotinamide Mononucleotides\nTrial plan number: F_1507092\nVersion 1 creation date: September 1, 2015 Version No.: Version 1\nEthics Review Committee approval date: September 4, 2015\nIn addition, although Shinkowa Pharmaceuticals is currently purchasing NMN from a manufacturer, we have already signed contracts for the provision of technology to manufacture NMN, and are aiming to establish and operate what will become Japan's 2nd ever domestic NMN manufacturing facility (production volume: about 3 tons/year).\nWe believe that this factory operation will allow us to significantly lower the cost of the products we currently sell, as well as new products.\nIn the future, in regard to the cosmetic products we currently sell, we plan to confirm increased NMN and NADH both in the skin and subcutaneously, and confirm mitochondrial activity. We also have plans to develop new pet supplement products.\nWe are also considering a project to provide ongoing support for free or partially discounted products to people with health problems for which the effectiveness of NMN has been confirmed.\nIn order to realize productive aging worldwide and continue to innovate and contribute, we have also begun preparations to increase our capital through a third-party share allocation. The funds raised will be used for capital investments related to the establishment of an NMN manufacturing facility (factory construction costs, employment expenses), as well as the costs of carrying out numerous human clinical trials in order to request the examination of several patents we have filed.\n(We are currently recruiting engineers for our NMN factory.)\nWe also intend to seek business tie-ups with companies that are actively looking to invest in the NMN business and the field of productive aging.\n\"Shinkowa Pharmaceutical sincerely aims to achieve productive aging worldwide, based on scientific evidence.\"\nWe are the company that will achieve productive aging worldwide by advancing biomedical science.\nCompany profile\nCompany name: Shinkowa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nRepresentative: Megumi Tanaka\nLocation: 2-30-11 Shinkawa, Chuo-ku, Tokyo\nBusiness description: Health food and cosmetics distribution and trade\nURL: http://shinkowapharma.com/\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180320005621/en/\nFor inquiries related to this press release\nShinkowa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\nDaizo Shimamura, +81-3-5403-6393\ninfo@shinkowapharma.com\nFAX: +81-3-5403-6379\n* Please make all inquiries by email.\nSource: Shinkowa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://shinkowapharma.com/", "http://rctportal.niph.go.jp/en/detail?trial_id=UMIN000025739", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Frctportal.niph.go.jp%2Fen%2Fdetail%3Ftrial_id%3DUMIN000025739&esheet=51775172&newsitemid=20180320005621&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Frctportal.niph.go.jp%2Fen%2Fdetail%3Ftrial_id%3DUMIN000025739&index=1&md5=8cade4bb307f9732abc39a2682aba82f", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180320005621/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fshinkowapharma.com%2F&esheet=51775172&newsitemid=20180320005621&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fshinkowapharma.com%2F&index=2&md5=9c9375135217d1afcd77364cda6995a0"], "published": "2018-03-20T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T23:34:16.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
