Mighty big if.\"\nAs for Celgene, another formerly red-hot biotech stock that has struggled since the fall, Boroden thought its daily chart still showed some promise.\nShares of Celgene seemed to have found a floor of support in the mid-$80s, just under where they were trading on Tuesday. Boroden argued that if they could break out into the mid-$90s, Celgene could be ready to run higher.\n\"The bottom line? The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, are not looking that great for Regeneron or Celgene at the moment,\" Cramer concluded. \"But with the biotech ETF showing some signs of life, she thinks it's worth watching these two former market darlings in case they start getting some traction. If Regeneron and Celgene can start breaking out to the upside, she'd get positive fast. Me? I think they're absolutely worth watching, especially Celgene, which has been punished far too harshly, but there are easier ways to make money.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's charts show things looking up for biotech show chapters Cramer's charts show 'signs of life' for the struggling biotech sector 20 Hours Ago | 08:55 ", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://vine.co/u/984542302087651328", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer"], "published": "2018-03-21T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T00:32:11.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
