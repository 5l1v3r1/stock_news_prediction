(“ Partner ” or the “ Company ”) (NASDAQ and TASE: PTNR), a leading Israeli communications provider, announced today its results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nCommenting on the fourth quarter 2017 results, Mr. Isaac Benbenisti, CEO of Partner noted :\n\"We view significant accomplishments in our financial results for 2017 growth in the Company's EBITDA compared to 2016, while doubling profit, adding 79 thousand cellular Post-Paid subscribers, a record addition of TV households to Partner TV, massive deployment of fiber optic infrastructure, all this while solidifying the financial strength to leverage the Company's growth.\n\"Partner TV is leading the Israeli TV market in terms of household additions, and with a significant gap compared with its competitors. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional 29 thousand households joined Partner TV and, as of today, over 64 thousand households are connected to Partner TV, most of them customers who left HOT and Yes and chose to move to the only TV service in Israel which offers all of its customers 4K set-top boxes together with Netflix at a push of a button in the remote control. Our cooperation with Netflix continues to prove successful and we are proud of this cooperation and recognize the great value that it brings to our customers.\n\"Our fiber optic project, Partner Fiber, which was commercially launched in August 2017, experienced a significant increase in the pace of deployment in the fourth quarter and, as of March 2018, tens of thousands of households, across many cities throughout the country, are already able to connect to Partner’s fiber services. Last month, we launched new products that combine Partner Fiber, the fast internet infrastructure with speeds of up to 1,000 Mbps, with Partner TV. We intend to continue to expand our offerings, which are based on full communication solutions on Partner's independent infrastructure, in internet, TV and cellular services.\n\"In the cellular space, Partner continued to increase its cellular Post-Paid subscriber base in the fourth quarter of 2017, so that 87% of our cellular subscribers were Post-Paid subscribers at year-end. In the last quarter alone, we reported net growth of 14 thousand Post-Paid subscribers, which completes an addition of 79 thousand Post-Paid subscribers in 2017, who chose to join Partner's cellular services due to, among other reasons, value offerings such as advanced cyber services which are included in various plans, unique Partner services such as wifi calling, and Israel's most advanced network deployment of LTE and LTE Advanced. In addition, as part of our strategy to offer unique value offerings to our customers, and again demonstrating our ability to partner with leading international companies, we announced at the end of December 2017 an exclusive collaboration with Apple Music, under which we offer all our Post-Paid cellular subscribers a free six-month subscription to its music services. ”\nMr. Tamir Amar, Partner's Chief Financial Officer, commented on the results:\n“2017 was characterized by the strengthening of Partner's position in the communications market and its transformation into a comprehensive communications group with entry into new activities, including the entry into the television world, Partner TV, which was officially launched in June 2017, and the expansion of the deployment of an independent fiber optic infrastructure for residential customers. At the same time, the Company continued to strengthen its cellular subscriber base with growth of 79,000 Post-Paid cellular subscribers in 2017, similar to the growth seen in 2016, as well as a decline in the churn rate as a result of lower churn among Post-Paid cellular subscribers.\nIn addition, during 2017, the Company took a number of steps to improve the profitability of equipment sales, and accordingly, equipment sales profitability improved from 18% in 2016 to 21% in 2017, together with a significant improvement in the quality of sales as reflected by, among others, the decrease in doubtful debts expenses.\nIn spite of the Company's entry into television services, which was accompanied by an increase in expenses (content and internet expenses), the Company recorded a decrease of 16% in operating expenses (OPEX) in 2017 compared to 2016; without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15, operating expenses decreased by 13% (a decrease of NIS 294 million compared with 2016). The decrease resulted from close management of the Company's cost structure and its assets, including the cost savings from the network sharing agreement with Hot Mobile.\nIn addition, the Company strengthened its balance sheet structure with a continued decrease in net debt to NIS 0.9 billion. Net debt decreased by NIS 620 million during 2017, which, together with the early repayments and the debt recycle, led to a reduction in the average interest rate of the Company's debt and to a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 at year-end. The change in the Company's debt structure and its reduction will result in a significant reduction of financing expenses (excluding the one-time debt repayment expenses) and provides a strong foundation to support the Company's continued development in the coming years.\nThe increase in CAPEX in 2017, without the impact of IFRS 15, totaled NIS 104 million compared to 2016, mainly resulting from the increased deployment of the fiber optic infrastructure and from the Company's entry into TV operations, which constitute growth potential in the Company's revenues in the coming years.\"\nNIS Million Q3’17 Q4’17 Comments Service Revenues 666 630 The decrease resulted mainly from cellular seasonal roaming revenues Equipment Revenues 160 204 The increase resulted mainly from higher cellular equipment volume and a higher average sale price Total Revenues 826 834 Gross profit from equipment sales 43 40 Change in product mix with lower profit per device OPEX 477 519 Increase in expenses mainly related to the Company's TV and internet services, periodic payroll & related expenses and a nonrecurring decrease in site-rental expenses in Q3 2017 Adjusted EBITDA 239 158 Profit (loss) for the Period 54 (50) The company recorded one-time expenses of NIS 65 million in Q4 2017 as a result of early loans repayments (as reported on December 5, 2017), partially offset by nonrecurring tax income of NIS 19 million Capital Expenditures (additions) 107 174 The increase resulted mainly from increase in investments related to fiber optic deployment and TV services Adjusted free cash flow (before interest payments) 202 63 The decrease resulted mainly from a decrease in EBITDA and a smaller decrease in operating assets and liabilities Net Debt 887 906 Q3’17 Q4’17 Comments Cellular Post-Paid Subscribers (end of period, thousands) 2,306 2,320 Increase of 14 thousand subscribers Cellular Pre-Paid Subscribers (end of period, thousands)\n371 354 Decrease of 17 thousand subscribers Monthly Average Revenue per Cellular User (ARPU) (NIS) 64 59 Mainly the result of higher seasonal roaming revenues in Q3 2017 Quarterly Cellular Churn Rate (%) 9.3% 9.9% The increase resulted from an increase in Pre-Paid subscriber churn Key Financial Results\nNIS MILLION (except EPS) 2013 2014 2015 3\n2016 2017 w/o\nIFRS 15*\n2017\nReported*\nRevenues 4,519 4,400 4,111 3,544 3,270 3,268 Cost of revenues 3,510 3,419 3,472 2,924 2,627 2,627 Gross profit 1,009 981 639 620 643 641 S,G&A 679 631 640 689 536 465 Income with respect to settlement agreement with Orange\n61 217 108 108 Other income 79 50 47 45 31 31 Operating profit 409 400 107 193 246 315 Finance costs, net 211 159 143 105 180 180 Income tax expenses 63 79 4 36 5 21 Profit (loss) for the year 135 162 (40) 52 61 114 Earnings (loss) per share (basic, NIS) 0.87 1.04 (0.26) 0.33 0.38 0.70 NIS MILLION (except EPS) Q4’16 Q1’17* Q2’17* Q3’17* Q4’17* Revenues 821 803 805 826 834 Cost of revenues 706 654 637 625 711 Gross profit 115 149 168 201 123 S,G&A 171 107 112 116 130 Income with respect to settlement agreement with Orange\n54 54 54 - - Other income 10 9 8 7 7 Operating profit 8 105 118 92 0 Finance costs, net 23 23 54 15 88 Income tax expenses (income) (8) 18 18 23 (38) Profit (loss) for the period (7) 64 46 54 (50) Earnings (loss) per share (basic, NIS) (0.04) 0.41 0.29 0.32 (0.30) NIS MILLION (except EPS) Q4'16 Q4'17* % Change Revenues 821 834 +2% Cost of revenues 706 711 +1% Gross profit 115 123 +7% Operating profit 8 0 N/A Loss for the period (7) (50) Loss per share (basic, NIS) (0.04) (0.30) *The Company adopted IFRS 15 from the beginning of 2017.

The decrease was mainly a result of the continued downward pressures on the prices of Post-Paid and Pre-Paid cellular services as a result of the continued competition in the cellular market. In addition, cellular segment service revenues were negatively affected by a decline in revenues as a result of the termination of the Right of Use Agreement with HOT Mobile from the second quarter of 2016, for which the Company recorded revenues in an amount of approximately NIS 51 million in 2016.\nService revenues for the fixed-line segment in 2017 totaled NIS 777 million (US$ 224 million), a decrease of 10% from NIS 866 million in 2016. This decrease mainly reflected a decrease in revenues from international calling services (including the market for wholesale international traffic) which were adversely affected both by the increased penetration of internet-based solutions and increased competition from other service providers, and a decrease in inter-segment revenues.\nIn Q4 2017, total revenues were NIS 834 million (US$ 241 million), an increase of 2% from NIS 821 million in Q4 2016.\nService revenues in Q4 2017 totaled NIS 630 million (US$ 182 million), a decrease of 3% from NIS 652 million in Q4 2016.\nService revenues for the cellular segment in Q4 2017 totaled NIS 478 million (US$ 138 million), a decrease of 4% from NIS 498 million in Q4 2016. The decrease was mainly the result of the continued price erosion of cellular services (both Post-Paid and Pre-Paid) due to the continued competitive market conditions.\nService revenues for the fixed-line segment in Q4 2017 totaled NIS 197 million (US$ 57 million), a decrease of 4% from NIS 205 million in Q4 2016. The decrease reflected the continuing decrease in revenues from international calling services.\nEquipment revenues in 2017 totaled NIS 686 million (US$ 198 million), a decrease of 13% from NIS 792 million in 2016, largely reflecting the downward impact of the tightening of the Company’s customer credit policy on the volume of sales.\nGross profit from equipment sales in 2017 was NIS 142 million (US$ 41 million), compared with NIS 144 million in 2016, a decrease of 1%, reflecting a decrease in gross profit from equipment sales for the cellular segment which was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from equipment sales for the fixed-line segment.\nEquipment revenues in Q4 2017 totaled NIS 204 million (US$ 59 million), an increase of 21% from NIS 169 million in Q4 2016, largely reflecting an increase in the volume of sales of cellular equipment and fixed-line business equipment.\nGross profit from equipment sales in Q4 2017 was NIS 40 million (US$ 12 million), compared with NIS 18 million in Q4 2016, an increase of 122%, mainly reflecting higher profit margins from sales due to a change in the product mix.\nTotal operating expenses (‘OPEX’) totaled NIS 1,946 million (US$ 561 million) in 2017. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, total operating expenses would have been NIS 2,030 million, a decrease of 13% or NIS 294 million from 2016. This decrease mainly reflected a decline in expenses related to the cellular network - largely reflecting the impact of the network sharing agreement with Hot Mobile; a decrease in international calls expenses, a decrease in bad debts and allowance for doubtful accounts expenses which was mainly a result of the impact of the tightening of the Company’s customer credit policy for handset sales; a decrease in advertising and marketing expenses; and a decrease in other expense items reflecting the impact of various efficiency measures undertaken; which were partially offset by additional expenses relating to the Company's TV and internet services. Including depreciation and amortization expenses and other expenses (mainly amortization of employee share based compensation), OPEX in 2017 without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 would have decreased by 12% compared with 2016, mainly for the same reasons as explained above.\nFor Q4 2017, total operating expenses (‘OPEX’) totaled NIS 519 million (US$ 150 million). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, total operating expenses would have been NIS 547 million in Q4 2017, a decrease of 4% or NIS 23 million from Q4 2016. The decrease mainly reflected a decline in expenses related to the cellular network and a decrease in bad debts and allowance for doubtful accounts expenses in 2017 and one-time expenses totaling NIS 19 million in Q4 2016, partially offset by additional expenses relating to the Company's TV and internet services. Including depreciation and amortization expenses and other expenses (mainly amortization of employee share based compensation), OPEX without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017 would have decreased by 3% in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016, mainly for the same reasons as explained above.\nIn 2017, the Company recorded income with respect to the settlement agreement of the Orange brand agreement in an amount of NIS 108 million (US$ 31 million) compared with NIS 217 million recorded in 2016. 2017 is the final year for which the Company will record income with respect to the settlement agreement of the Orange brand agreement.\nOperating profit for 2017 was NIS 315 million (US$ 91 million). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, operating profit would have been NIS 246 million, an increase of 27% compared with NIS 193 million in 2016.\nFor Q4 2017, operating profit was zero. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, there would have been an operating loss of NIS 18 million in Q4 2017, compared with an operating profit of NIS 8 million in Q4 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in 2017 totaled NIS 917 million (US$ 264 million), 28% of revenues. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, Adjusted EBITDA would have been NIS 835 million, 26% of revenues, approximately unchanged compared with NIS 834 million in 2016, 24% of revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the cellular segment in 2017 was NIS 710 million (US$ 205 million), 27% of revenues. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, Adjusted EBITDA for the cellular segment would have been NIS 647 million, 25% of revenues, an increase of 15% from NIS 562 million in 2016, 20% of revenues. The increase reflected the decrease in total operating expenses, partially offset by the impact of the decreases in service revenues, in income with respect to the settlement agreement with Orange, and in gross profits from cellular segment equipment sales.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fixed-line segment was NIS 207 million (US$ 60 million) in 2017, 24% of revenues. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, Adjusted EBITDA for the fixed-line segment would have been NIS 188 million, 22% of revenues, a decrease of 31% from NIS 272 million in 2016, 29% of revenues. The decrease mainly reflected the decrease in service revenues and the increase in total operating expenses, partially offset by the increase in gross profit from equipment sales.\nFor Q4 2017, Adjusted EBITDA totaled NIS 158 million (US$ 46 million), 19% of revenues. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, Adjusted EBITDA would have been NIS 132 million in Q4 2017, 16% of revenues, a decrease of 20% from NIS 164 million in Q4 2016 or 20% of revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the cellular segment in Q4 2017 was NIS 124 million (US$ 36 million), 19% of revenues. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, Adjusted EBITDA for the cellular segment would have been NIS 108 million in Q4 2017, 16% of revenues, approximately unchanged compared with NIS 109 million in Q4 2016, 17% of revenues. The stability reflected the decrease in OPEX and the increase in gross profit from equipment sales, which were offset by the decrease in income with respect to the settlement agreement with Orange and the decrease in service revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fixed-line segment in Q4 2017 was NIS 34 million (US$ 10 million), 16% of revenues. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, Adjusted EBITDA for the fixed-line segment would have been NIS 24 million in Q4 2017, 11% of revenues, a decrease of 56% from NIS 55 million in Q4 2016, 25% of revenues. The decrease mainly reflected the increase in OPEX resulting from the launch of the TV services, partly offset by a decline in expenses related to international calling services.\nFinance costs, net in 2017 were NIS 180 million (US$ 52 million), an increase of 71% compared with NIS 105 million in 2016. The increase largely reflected the impact of the increase in early debt repayment expenses in 2017 compared with 2016, of NIS 82 million, which was mainly related to the early repayment of borrowings during 2017 in a total amount of NIS 1,283 million (US$ 370 million).\nFinance costs, net, are expected to be significantly lower in 2018 than in 2017, both reflecting the early debt repayment expenses recorded in 2017 as well as anticipated lower interest expenses as a result of the lower average level of financial debt and a lower average debt interest rate.\nFor Q4 2017, finance costs, net were NIS 88 million (US$ 25 million), an increase of 65 million compared with NIS 23 million in Q4 2016. The increase reflected the one time early repayment costs of NIS 65 million recorded in Q4 2017.\nIncome tax expenses for 2017 were NIS 21 million (US$ 6 million). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, income tax expenses on profit would have been NIS 5 million compared with NIS 36 million in 2016 . An income tax audit of the Company, concluded in 2017, resulted in one-time income of NIS 10 million in income tax expenses and in an additional one-time deferred tax income of NIS 9 million, which was recognized in income tax expenses.\nOverall, the company's profit in 2017 was NIS 114 million (US$ 33 million). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, profit would have been NIS 61 million, an increase of 17% compared with profit of NIS 52 million in 2016.\nFor Q4 2017, loss was NIS 50 million (US$ 14 million). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, loss would have been NIS 64 million in Q4 2017, compared with a loss of NIS 7 million in Q4 2016.\nBased on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during 2017, basic earnings per share or ADS, was NIS 0.70 (US$ 0.20). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, basic earnings per share or ADS would have been NIS 0.38 compared with NIS 0.33 in 2016.\nFor Q4 2017, based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during Q4 2017, basic loss per share or ADS, was NIS 0.30 (US$ 0.08). Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, basic loss per share or ADS would have been NIS 0.38 in Q4 2017, compared with basic loss per share or ADS of NIS 0.04 in Q4 2016.\nCellular Segment Operational Review\nAt the end of 2017, the Company's cellular subscriber base (including mobile data and 012 Mobile subscribers) was approximately 2.67 million including approximately 2.32 million Post-Paid subscribers or 87% of the base, and approximately 354,000 Pre-Paid subscribers, or 13% of the subscriber base.\nOver 2017, the cellular subscriber base declined by approximately 12,000. The Pre-Paid subscriber base decreased by approximately 91,000, while the Post-Paid subscriber base increased by approximately 79,000. The decrease in the Pre-Paid subscriber base was largely attributed to Pre-Paid subscribers moving to Post-Paid subscriber packages as a result of the significant price difference of these products, as well as to increased competition for Pre-Paid subscribers.\nThe annual churn rate for cellular subscribers in 2017 was 38%, a decrease of 2 percentage points compared with 40% in 2016, and 46% in 2015.\nThe monthly Average Revenue per User (“ ARPU ”) for cellular subscribers in 2017 was NIS 62 (US$ 18), a decrease of 5% from NIS 65 in 2016. The decrease mainly reflected the continued price erosion in cellular services due to the persistent competition in the cellular market, as well as a decrease in revenues as a result of the termination of the Right of Use Agreement with HOT Mobile from the second quarter of 2016.\nTotal cellular market share (based on the number of subscribers) at the end of 2017 was estimated to be approximately 25%, a slight decrease from 26% at 2016 year-end.\nDuring Q4 2017, the cellular subscriber base declined by approximately 3,000 subscribers. The Post-Paid subscriber base increased by approximately 14,000 subscribers, while the Pre-Paid subscriber base declined by approximately 17,000 subscribers.\nThe quarterly churn rate for cellular subscribers in Q4 2017 was 9.9%, compared with 9.4% in Q4 2016.\nFor Q4 2017, ARPU for cellular subscribers was NIS 59 (US$ 17), a decrease of 5% from NIS 62 in Q4 2016.\nFunding and Investing Review\nIn 2017, Adjusted Free Cash Flow totaled NIS 599 million (US$ 173 million), an increase of 21% from NIS 758 million in 2016.\nCash generated from operations totaled NIS 973 million (US$ 281 million) in 2017. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, cash generated from operations would have been NIS 897 million compared with NIS 945 million in 2016, a decrease of 5%. The decrease mainly reflected the payment by HOT Mobile in 2016 of the lump sum of NIS 250 million under the Network Sharing Agreement, partially offset by an increase in trade payables balances and by a larger decrease in trade receivables, which was mainly related to the decrease in the volume of equipment sales under long-term payment plans in 2017 compared with 2016.\nCash capital expenditures (CAPEX payments) , as represented by cash flows used for the acquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets, were NIS 376 million (US$ 108 million) in 2017. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, cash capital expenditures would have been NIS 300 million, an increase of 53% from NIS 196 million in 2016. The increase mainly reflected the increase in investments related to fiber deployment and TV services.\nFor Q4 2017, Adjusted Free Cash Flow totaled NIS 63 million (US$ 18 million), a decrease of 77% from NIS 269 million in Q4 2016. Excluding the impact of the NIS 180 million payment received from Hot Mobile in Q4 2016 as part of lump sum, Adjusted Free Cash Flow decreased by 29%.\nCash generated from operations totaled NIS 176 million (US$ 51 million) in Q4 2017. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, cash generated from operations would have been NIS 151 million in Q4 2017, a decrease of 52% from NIS 313 million in Q4 2016. The decrease mainly reflected the one-time payment received from HOT Mobile in an amount of NIS 180 million in Q4 2016 as explained above.\nCash capital expenditures (‘CAPEX payments’) , as represented by cash flows used for the acquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets, were NIS 113 million (US$ 33 million) in Q4 2017. Without the impact of the early adoption of IFRS 15 in 2017, cash capital expenditures would have been NIS 88 million in Q4 2017, an increase of 87% from NIS 47 million in Q4 2016. The increase mainly reflected the increase in investments related to fiber deployment and TV services.\nThe level of Net Debt at the end of 2017 amounted to NIS 906 million (US$ 261 million), compared with NIS 1,526 million at the end of 2016.\nConference Call Details\nPartner will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 29, 2018 at 10.00AM Eastern Time / 5.00PM Israel Time .\nTo join the call, please dial the following numbers (at least 10 minutes before the scheduled time):\nInternational: +972.3.918.0610\nNorth America toll-free: +1.888.407.2553\nA live webcast of the call will also be available on Partner's Investors Relations website at: www.partner.co.il/en/Investors-Relations/lobby/\nIf you are unavailable to join live, the replay of the call will be available from March 29, 2018 until April 19, 2018, at the following numbers:\nInternational: +972.3.925.5925\nNorth America toll-free: +1.888.782.4291\nIn addition, the archived webcast of the call will be available on Partner's Investor Relations website at the above address for approximately three months.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the safe harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
