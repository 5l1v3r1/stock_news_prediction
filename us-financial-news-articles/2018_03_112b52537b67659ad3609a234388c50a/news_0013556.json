(Nasdaq:MRNS), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, today provided a business update on its clinical development activities and reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNear-term Clinical Value Catalysts\nInitiate Phase 3 pivotal study with oral ganaxolone in children with CDD (CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder) mid-2018 Report top-line intravenous (IV) ganaxolone data from Phase 2 Magnolia study in women with severe postpartum depression (PPD) third quarter 2018. Report top-line oral ganaxolone data from Amaryllis study in women with moderate PPD fourth quarter 2018.\n“2017 was a significant year for Marinus, and one that has positioned us for important data readouts and advancing ganaxolone into late stage development in 2018,” said Christopher M. Cashman, chief executive officer of Marinus Pharmaceuticals. “The data obtained last September from our study in children with CDKL5 deficiency disorder were impressive and drove our decision to advance this program into a global, pivotal study which we will initiate this year. We, along with the CDKL5 community of caregivers, physicians and investigators, are excited to participate in this first ever late-stage clinical trial for these children suffering from this rare and debilitating epilepsy with no approved treatments or even any reasonable standard of care. Similarly, our two phase 2 studies in women suffering from severe and moderate PPD are expected to generate data with IV and oral regimens of ganaxolone this year to support the design and initiation of pivotal Phase 3 studies next year. We remain focused on our goal of being able to treat underserved patient populations with patient-convenient, setting appropriate, effective and safe treatment regimens.”\nCDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD)\nIn November, the Company presented the successful results from its Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ganaxolone in children with CDD at the annual CDKL5 Forum in Boston. Marinus was recognized as the leader in clinical research in CDD. The data presented showed that ganaxolone provided substantial and durable anti-seizure efficacy in children with CDD and was generally safe and well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. The last patient enrolled into the Phase 2 study, recently completed the six-month treatment period, and based on good seizure control, entered the one-year extension to the study. The majority of CDD patients from the Phase 2 study entered the one-year study extension and continue to receive ganaxolone. The Company is engaging in successful, collaborative discussions with regulatory agencies and expects to initiate a global, pivotal study in mid-2018.\nPostpartum Depression (PPD)\nMarinus is enrolling patients into the Magnolia Study, a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization clinical trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ganaxolone in women diagnosed with severe PPD (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) score ≥26). Patients randomized into the first part of the study will undergo an infusion of either ganaxolone or placebo and will be followed for 30 days. The goal of the first part of the study is to evaluate multiple regimens of intravenous (IV) ganaxolone, which will inform dosing for the second part of the study. Patients enrolled into the second part of the study could receive IV ganaxolone of various infusion lengths followed by administration of oral ganaxolone. The goal of the second part of the study is to identify an optimized dose or doses for further testing in phase 3. Based upon the effect size shown in a recent study for a compound with similar mechanism of action, the Company has increased targeted enrollment in this study. This increase in study scope and the corresponding forecast for patient recruitment have extended our expected timing for completion of the first part to the third quarter of 2018.\nThe Company is enrolling patients into its Amaryllis Study, a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral ganaxolone in women with moderate PPD (HAMD17 score > 20 and < 26). The study is designed to enroll approximately 50 women at 20 sites within the US. Data from this study are expected fourth quarter of 2018.\nStatus Epilepticus (SE)\nThe Company has initiated its Phase 2 study with ganaxolone IV in patients with refractory status epilepticus (RSE). Data from this proof-of-concept study are expected fourth quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Update\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $58.4 million, compared to $30.1 million at December 31, 2016. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017 will enable us to fund our current scale of operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2020.\nResearch and development expenses decreased to $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $22.0 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $11.0 million associated with our drug-resistant focal onset seizures program, which we discontinued in June 2016. Additionally, we sold $0.4 million in state research and development tax credits which we used to offset research and development expenses. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $2.3 million associated with our IV programs in PPD, for which a Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in June 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.4 million, to $6.7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in noncash stock-based compensation expense.\nThe Company reported net losses of $18.9 million and $28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash used in operating activities was $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $24.8 million for the same period a year ago.\nReaders are referred to, and encouraged to read in its entirety the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes further detail on the above-referenced transactions and the Company’s business plans and operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSelected Financial Data (in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(unaudited) December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $33,531 $26,178 Investments 24,825 3,922 Other assets 2,316 1,347 Total assets $60,672 $31,447 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Total current liabilities $2,544 $8,084 Notes payable, long-term portion — 1,743 Other long term liabilities 120 141 Total liabilities 2,664 9,968 Total stockholders’ equity 58,008 21,479 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $60,672 $31,447\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Expenses: Research and development $ 12,376 $ 22,005 General and administrative 6,667 6,237 Loss from operations (19,043 ) (28,242 ) Interest income 324 128 Interest expense (159 ) (464 ) Other expense (20 ) (65 ) Net loss $ (18,898 ) $ (28,643 ) Per share information: Net loss per share of common stock—basic and diluted $ (0.80 ) $ (1.47 ) Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding 23,540,738 19,498,143 About Marinus Pharmaceuticals\nMarinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of ganaxolone, which offers a new mechanism of action, demonstrated efficacy and safety, and convenient dosing to improve the lives of patients suffering from epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.
