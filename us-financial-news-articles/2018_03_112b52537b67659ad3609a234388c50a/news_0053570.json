The company last October announced it would close down Animas after failing to find a buyer.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch is providing the entire debt commitment to Platinum Equity initially but will carve out a portion to other banks, the sources said. The carveout could be as high as 60%, one of the sources said.\nThe debt will be split between a US$1.4bn secured term loan with a first priority claim and a US$350m secured term loan with a second priority claim, the sources said.\nThe financing includes a US$125m revolving credit facility that will be undrawn at close, the sources added.\nJ&J, BAML and Platinum did not respond to requests for comment.\nLIFELINE LifeScan’s performance has been weighed down in recent years due to pricing pressure stemming from competition, the sources said. The unit has also faced challenges securing rights to newer technology, a third source said.\nDue to declining Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the debt underwriting process centered around an absolute debt amount rather than the more typical factor in leveraged lending, a debt-to-Ebitda multiple, sources said.\nThe Ebitda figure that will be used to market the deal has not been solidified. The metric ranges between US$450m and US$600m depending on whether it’s calculated on a last 12-months’, full-year 2017/2018, or trough basis, one of the sources said.\nLeverage would be 3.9 times and 2.9 times at the low and high end of that range, respectively.\nThe timing of the syndication of the debt is also fluid, as the closing process is likely to be protracted due to regulatory concerns and the new owner may seek to avoid paying ticking fees, the sources said.\nAssuming the offer is accepted, closing is expected by year-end, according to a J&J&rsquo;s press release.\nPlatinum on March 16 announced it had submitted a binding offer to acquire LifeScan for approximately US$2.1bn. It has given J&J until June 15 to accept the offer, to allow for consultations with work councils that represent employees. LifeScan is headquartered in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania and Zug, Switzerland.\nReporting by Andrew Berlin; Editing by Michelle Sierra, Lynn Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T05:28:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
