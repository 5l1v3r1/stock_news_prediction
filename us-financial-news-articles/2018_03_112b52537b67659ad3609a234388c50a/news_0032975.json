The Mexican peso, meanwhile, has gained nearly 5%, outperforming all currencies except the Japanese yen.\nBoth countries’ economies lean heavily on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is now being renegotiated as part of President Donald Trump’s push to gain more favorable trade terms for the U.S.\nWhile worries over trade have sharpened in recent weeks, investor timing, central bank policy and domestic politics have all played a role in determining the currencies’ trajectories this year.\nInvestors often use currencies to bet on political and economic outcomes, and many sold the peso in recent years as Mr. Trump’s political fortunes improved during the U.S. presidential election, analysts said. This year’s rally recoups some of the decline that has pushed the peso more than 9% lower against the dollar since the start of 2016. Some investors believe the selloff has left the peso with little room to fall and expect the currency to bounce.\n“Many of the negative scenarios are already priced in,” said Momtchil Pojarliev, deputy head of currencies at BNP Paribas Asset Management . “You can be pretty sure that a big part of the move is already over.”\nMr. Pojarliev owns the peso as part of a basket of emerging-market currencies and believes it will appreciate further against the dollar in the coming months.\nMany bullish investors also are drawn to the yields of peso-denominated assets, which are much higher than those found in developed countries. Uncertainty over politics and trade may push Mexico’s central bank to raise interest rates again, analysts at UBS Wealth Management said, further increasing the payout for yield-hungry investors.\nIn Canada, meanwhile, trade worries have coincided with uneven economic data. January’s trade statistics, released earlier this month, revealed a sharp drop in both exports and imports, after a cut in U.S. corporate tax rates that may have tipped the scale in favor of making business investments in the U.S. instead of Canada. Foreign direct investment in Canada last year hit its lowest level in seven years.\nThe Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged earlier this month and ramped up its warnings over trade. Economic growth in the fourth quarter also came in weaker than anticipated.\n“Data momentum has lost a lot of steam,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX Strategy at TD Securities. His firm believes the U.S. dollar will rise to C$1.35 against the Canadian dollar, from around $1.3080 Tuesday.\nInvestors in both currencies run the risk of swift reversals. The peso is vulnerable to political uncertainty stemming from Mexico’s presidential vote, slated for July. Some investors fear that the front-runner, left-wing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, will stall economic reforms and complicate renegotiation of Nafta if he is elected.\nJim Barrineau, co-head of emerging-market debt at Schroders, is betting the peso will decline in the coming months. He believes that Mr. López Obrador, who is prone to fiery rhetoric, may clash with Mr. Trump, worsening relations between the two countries.\nThe two leaders “are relatively inexperienced, and hold very strong views,” Mr. Barrineau said. “How can you render a guess as to what will happen?”\nSince 1994, the peso has declined an average of nearly 6% against the dollar in the months leading up to a presidential election, research from Natixis shows.\nSome investors in the Canadian dollar say a rally in oil, a key Canadian export, will eventually lift the country’s currency. Improvement in Canada’s economic data—the unemployment rate edged down in February to a 10-year low, and the economy added jobs after a steep decline in the previous month—could also spark a recovery in the Canadian dollar.\nA turn for the worse in trade talks would likely dent both currencies, analysts said.\nBoth countries avoided disruption earlier this month, when the Trump administration said Canada and Mexico would be initially spared from its plan to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. That exemption, however, is contingent on a successful renegotiation of Nafta.\n“If Trump walks away from Nafta, the Canadian dollar will get crushed,” Mr. McCormick said.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.31.min.js"], "published": "2018-03-21T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T19:34:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
