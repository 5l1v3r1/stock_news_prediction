The letter notes that Facebook (Nasdaq: FB ) users \"never authorized these developers to obtain it, and relied on terms of service and settings that were confusing and perhaps misleading.\"\nFacebook's data practices have been thrust into the news spotlight after reports that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, got its hands on 50 million Facebook users' information. Cambridge Analytica's work has been connected to Donald Trump's campaign for president.\n\nMore from Kansas City Business Journal: \nOP native becomes a tech billionaire\nRegulators bear down on Facebook \nGreitens' invasion of privacy trial will be heard by a jury \nFacebook has said the access didn't involve a breach; instead, Facebook itself exposed the data to the software developers â€” a practice the company clamped down on in 2015.\nThe letter also alleges that Facebook collected as much as 30 percent \"of payments made through the developers' applications by Facebook users.\"\nThe AGs also want an update about Facebook's plans to let users \"more easily control the privacy of their accounts,\" the letter states.\nThe letter joins a chorus of other calls for answers. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection announced that it has \" an open non-public investigation into these practices .\"\nAnd in November, well before the Cambridge Analytica imbroglio, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley took aim at another online giant. He subpoenaed Google Inc. about its practices handling users' information and online activities . Hawley also signed the letter from the National Association of Attorneys General.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T23:41:24.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
