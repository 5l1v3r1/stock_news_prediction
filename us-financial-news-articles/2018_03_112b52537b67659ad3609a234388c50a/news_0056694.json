That doubles a previous raise first disclosed in mid-February, adding up to a total of $1.7 billion raised by the firm incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. \nAnd the fundraising might not stop there. \n“The issuers may pursue one or more subsequent offerings,” the Thursday filing read. \nThe interest in Telegram, though, comes at a time when the price of Bitcoin is plummeting to new lows for 2018. Once as high as $20,000 in December, the cryptocurrency fell 6% to $6,600 on Friday. \nTelegram did not respond to requests for comment from Fortune . \nThe firm is thought to be using the proceeds from the private funding rounds to build a blockchain network, the Telegram Open Network (TON). The network would allow Telegram’s 200 million users to pay for services on that blockchain, using the cryptocurrency Gram. \nThe fundraising comes at a time when the SEC has grown increasingly wary of ICOs . The Wall Street Journal reported in late February that the SEC had issued dozens of subpoenas to cryptocurrency-related firms. \nThe SEC declined to comment.
