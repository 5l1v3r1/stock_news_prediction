It came a day after Trump's announcement of tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports.\nChinese President Xi Jinping \"had a list that was so ready of what they're blocking,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street \" Friday. \"They are so ready for what we do, it's embarrassing.\"\n\"Do you think that [China] has not figured this stuff out,\" asked Cramer. \"They've got a game plan.\"\nTrump said his tariffs on China, which primarily target certain products in the technology sector, would be \"the first of many\" trade actions. Beijing said it would take measures against the U.S. goods in two stages if it cannot reach an agreement with Washington.\nCramer said Trump will have to \"up his game,\" because China was more prepared than the U.S., calling it a \"beat down.\"\n\"You don't wing it with the Chinese. The Chinese are so ready for us,\" said Cramer, host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\" Trump \"better understand that these guys have been in a war against us for years.\"\n\"If you're going to be in a trade war with these guys, you have to be better than they are,\" he added.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
