The workers will also reportedly have “opportunities to engage with Amazon Robotics in a highly technological workplace.” \nThis is the second Amazon facility in Missouri. The other is a sorting center in Hazelwood. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Amazon could receive up to $7.95 million in sales tax exemptions to support the project, as well as close to $3 million in non-manufacturing personal property incentives, and $100,000 from the Skilled Workforce Missouri program to “fund development and operations.” \nMissouri had previously made a bid for Amazon’s HQ2 in St. Louis, but did not make the list of 20 finalists.
