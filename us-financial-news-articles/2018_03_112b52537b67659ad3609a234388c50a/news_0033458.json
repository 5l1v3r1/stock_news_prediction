Alexander Nix told the committee last month that his firm had not received data from a researcher accused of harvesting millions of Facebook users' personal information.\nOn Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, which is best known for working on President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, over allegations it retained improperly obtained user data after claiming it had deleted the information.\nFormer Cambridge Analytica employee Chris Wylie says the company harvested information from 50 million Facebook users, using it to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories.\nCollins said he would summon Nix to appear before the committee again.\n\"It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements,\" Collins said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T19:44:11.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
