Space-enabled data has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems by revolutionising innovation in a multitude of sectors, including telecoms, energy, smart city, agriculture, transport, maritime & logistics. With Qualcomm and Cisco I've witnessed first-hand the transformational impact such paradigmatic shifts can have on huge global markets.\"\nMark Boggett, CEO of Seraphim Capital commented, \"we are thrilled to have Frédéric joining the team.
