But the government has provided few details about who was netted in the sweep, what they were accused of and how much they gave up.\nForbes said earlier in the week that it was “impossible to know definitively who gave how much to whom when”.\nThe magazine said it had removed the 10 Saudi billionaires who made the cut last year, including detained in the crackdown like Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, with wealth previously valued at $18.7 billion, and Mohammed al-Amoudi whose treasure stood at $8.1 billion.\n“With greater clarity regarding their wealth, some might eventually return to the ranking,” Forbes said.\nThe magazine’s Middle East edition said in a separate statement on Thursday that the wealth of Saudi billionaires was believed to have increased from $42.1 billion last year due to the rise in oil prices and capital markets globally, but would be excluded due to the reported asset seizures.\nAlwaleed, who told Reuters in an interview hours before his release in January that he did not expect to give up any assets to the government, sued Forbes in 2013 alleging the magazine had undervalued his wealth.\nThe magazine listed 2,208 billionaires worldwide in 2018, up from 2,043 in 2017.\nReporting By Stephen Kalin, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T13:00:05.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
