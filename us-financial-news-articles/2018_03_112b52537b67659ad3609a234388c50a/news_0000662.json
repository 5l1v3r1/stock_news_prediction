In 2017, oil averaged approximately U.S. $52 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”)) compared to approximately U.S. $43 per barrel (WTI) in 2016. Canadian natural gas prices, which reached 10 year lows in the first half of 2016, continued to be very volatile in 2017 due to pipeline outages and surplus supply. Well completions, a key indicator of industry activity in the western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (“WCSB”) increased 87% for the year, compared to the prior year.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFourth Quarter 2017\nRevenue was $43.3 million, a 31% increase from the fourth quarter 2016, as both Essential Coil Well Service (“ECWS”) and Tryton experienced stronger customer demand and ECWS benefitted from price increases implemented in the first quarter 2017. EBITDAS (1) increased $5.3 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016 due to higher revenue, partially offset by additional costs incurred in ECWS. Fourth quarter 2016 included an onerous lease contract expense and severance costs, which were not factors in the same period of 2017.\nHighlights:\nECWS revenue increased $4.4 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016. Higher revenue in the quarter was more than offset by costs associated with re-activating equipment, recruiting and training crews and unanticipated equipment repairs. Costs were incurred to recruit and train a larger workforce and ready equipment in anticipation of higher first quarter 2018 demand. Tryton revenue increased $5.6 million compared to the fourth quarter 2016 and generated a 20% gross margin. All service lines improved, with especially strong demand for conventional tools used to maintain producing wells and for abandonment work. On November 3, 2017, the Federal Court of Canada rendered a decision in Essential’s favour with regard to a patent infringement litigation commenced by Packers Plus Energy Services Inc., ruling that the patent being asserted by them was not valid and that Essential did not infringe the patent (the “Decision”). Management was very pleased with the Decision which exonerates Essential of any wrongdoing regarding this litigation.\nYear 2017\nRevenue was $175.9 million, an 80% increase from 2016, due to stronger customer demand for both ECWS and Tryton and price increases for ECWS realized in the first quarter 2017. EBITDAS (1) was $18.6 million compared to negative $9.2 million in 2016, which included a one-time onerous lease contract expense and severance costs.\nHighlights:\nECWS operating hours increased 58% from the prior year. Customer demand, particularly in the Montney region of the WCSB, was focused on the completion of long-reach horizontal wells. ECWS revenue per hour increased due to higher prices realized in the first quarter 2017, which helped offset rising operating costs, including labour and maintenance costs, throughout the year. Tryton revenue increased in all service lines compared to the prior year, with particularly strong demand for the Multi-Stage Fracturing System ® (“MSFS ® ”) as key customers expanded their horizontal well completion programs. Revenue per job was higher for MSFS ® tools as customers increased the number of stages per horizontal well. Essential’s capital expenditures were $20.2 million, comprised of $11.4 million of growth capital and $8.8 million of maintenance capital. A substantial portion of the growth capital was targeted at equipment to service long-reach horizontal wells, including fabrication of two quintuplex fluid pumpers expected to be delivered in the second quarter 2018, pumping support equipment and the cost to recertify and upgrade the Generation III coil tubing rigs and pumping equipment acquired in 2016.\nEssential was financially well positioned at December 31, 2017 with debt outstanding of $18.0 million, an increase of $6.7 million from December 31, 2016. The increase was due to capital expenditures and increased working capital, primarily accounts receivable and inventory, as activity improved. Funded debt (1) to bank EBITDA (1) was 0.96x at the end of 2017. On March 7, 2018, Essential had $26.3 million of debt outstanding.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSEGMENT RESULTS – ESSENTIAL COIL WELL SERVICE (in thousands of dollars, Three months ended December 31, Years ended December 31, except percentages, hours and fleet data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue $ 22,002 $ 17,564 $ 93,896 $ 53,638 Operating expenses 21,072 16,107 79,314 49,976 Gross margin $ 930 $ 1,457 $ 14,582 $ 3,662 Gross margin % 4 % 8% 16 % 7% Operating hours Coil tubing rigs 11,215 11,119 48,425 32,306 Pumpers 14,581 12,341 60,857 37,022 Equipment fleet (i) Coil tubing rigs (iii) 30 31 30 31 Fluid pumpers (ii) 18 21 18 21 Nitrogen pumpers (iii) 8 11 8 11 (i) Fleet data represents the number of units at the end of the period.\n(ii) Essential retired three single fluid pumpers in 2017, one in the second quarter and two in the third quarter.\n(iii) During the fourth quarter 2017, Essential retired one Generation I coil tubing rig and three nitrogen pumpers.\nECWS revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $22.0 million, a 25% increase compared to the fourth quarter 2016, but considerably less than management’s expectations. Fourth quarter 2017 activity slowed as the quarter progressed as customers completed their 2017 capital programs. Long-reach horizontal well completions in the Montney region of the WCSB provided a market for the Generation III coil tubing rig and pumper packages. ECWS also saw increased demand for nitrogen pumpers. Compared to the same prior year period, lower revenue from the Generation II coil tubing rigs, single and twin fluid pumpers was offset by higher revenue from the Generation III coil tubing rigs and quintuplex fluid pumpers, as customer well specifications were at times beyond the capabilities of Generation II coil tubing rigs and twin fluid pumpers.\nPricing remained stable following price increases in the first quarter 2017, as there was sufficient equipment available to meet industry demand. Compared to the same prior year period, revenue per hour for ECWS was higher in the fourth quarter 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 4%, compared to 8% for the same prior year period. Higher revenue in the quarter was more than offset by costs associated with re-activating equipment, recruiting and training crews and unanticipated equipment repairs. At the end of the third quarter 2017, decisions were made to continue to recruit and train crews and to re-activate more equipment in preparation for an anticipated busy first quarter 2018. Training initiatives included using an extra employee on crews. Although highly effective for training, this significantly increased labour, travel and other related expenses. The activity slow-down in the fourth quarter, combined with higher incremental costs from larger crew sizes and maintaining non-chargeable personnel, disrupted financial performance and eroded margin. In addition, unanticipated equipment repairs due to component failures resulted in down-time, inefficient crew management and non-chargeable travel time, also eroding margin.\nECWS revenue in 2017 was $93.9 million, a 75% increase compared to the prior year due to higher industry activity and price increases realized in the first quarter 2017. ECWS activity increased 58% from the prior year, with the Generation III coil tubing rigs and pumpers experiencing significant year-over-year improvement in operating hours. Customer demand was focused on the completion of long-reach horizontal wells. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in 2017 was 16%, a significant improvement over the prior year due to increased revenue and fixed costs representing a smaller portion of revenue.\nSEGMENT RESULTS - TRYTON Three months ended December 31, Years ended December 31, (in thousands of dollars, except percentages) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue $ 21,260 $ 15,655 $ 82,012 $ 44,383 Operating expenses 17,074 12,731 62,555 37,905 Gross margin $ 4,186 $ 2,924 $ 19,457 $ 6,478 Gross margin % 20 % 19% 24 % 15% Tryton revenue – % of revenue Tryton MSFS ® 44 % 53% 49 % 43% Conventional Tools & Rentals 56 % 47% 51 % 57% Tryton fourth quarter 2017 revenue was $21.3 million, a 36% increase from the fourth quarter 2016. Both Canadian and U.S. operations benefitted from higher activity and a broader customer base. Canadian downhole tools revenue increased due to higher demand for conventional tools used in maintenance of producing wells and abandonment work, as well as higher MSFS ® activity. Tryton U.S. revenue continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement, particularly in Texas, with stronger customer demand as activity continued to improve.\nTryton gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 20% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, similar to 19% realized in the same prior year period.\n2017 Tryton revenue increased 85% compared to the prior year as a result of higher activity, particularly MSFS ® tool revenue which improved 113%. This improvement was due to increased activity and revenue per job, as customers completing long-reach horizontal wells increased the number of stages per well. 2017 gross margin was 24% of revenue, a significant year-over-year improvement due to Tryton’s variable cost structure and the absorption of fixed costs by higher revenue.\nEQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES Three months ended December 31, Years ended December 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Essential Coil Well Service $ 4,448 $ 353 $ 15,880 $ 7,788 Tryton 1,808 1,393 3,991 2,769 Corporate 34 37 348 70 Total equipment expenditures 6,290 1,783 20,219 10,627 Less proceeds on disposal of property and equipment (891 ) (1,550 ) (2,660 ) (3,569 ) Net equipment expenditures (1) $ 5,399 $ 233 $ 17,559 $ 7,058 Essential classifies its equipment expenditures as growth capital (1) and maintenance capital (1) : Three months ended December 31, Years ended December 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Growth capital (1) $ 4,521 $ 1,386 $ 11,382 $ 7,761 Maintenance capital (1) 1,769 397 8,837 2,866 Total equipment expenditures $ 6,290 $ 1,783 $ 20,219 $ 10,627 2017 growth capital spending related to the fabrication of two new quintuplex fluid pumpers expected to be delivered in the second quarter 2018, pumping support equipment, costs to recertify and upgrade the coil tubing rigs and pumping equipment acquired in 2016 and rental drill pipe. The fluid pumpers support Essential’s deep coil tubing fleet working on long-reach horizontal wells where greater pumping capacity is required due to the depths and pressures of these wells.\nEssential’s 2018 capital budget is $13 million, comprised of $5 million of growth capital and $8 million of maintenance capital. Growth capital consists of costs to retrofit one Generation IV coil tubing rig, the addition of one nitrogen pumper, coil support equipment and $1.5 million of carryover capital to complete the two quintuplex fluid pumpers started in 2017.\nOUTLOOK\nAnalyst and industry associations are generally forecasting industry activity and E&P spending in the WCSB in 2018 will be similar to 2017. Canadian oil and natural gas prices are generally forecast to continue to trade significantly below their U.S. benchmarks due to oversupply and export capacity constraints in the WCSB.\nUntil oil and natural gas market access is addressed, Canadian oil and natural gas activity is anticipated to remain constrained due to the inability to access world markets and achieve higher commodity pricing. These issues likely will not be resolved in the near term and are hindered by political and regulatory uncertainty in Canada, delaying resolution to allow projects to proceed. This is not helpful or constructive to the Canadian oilfield service outlook.\nECWS believes it has sufficient trained crews and activated equipment to meet anticipated customer demand through the first quarter 2018. To date, first quarter 2018 activity has been consistent with the same period in 2017 and on its peak day ECWS had 15 coil tubing rigs and 12 fluid pumpers working. Competitive pricing pressure remains a factor and prices are consistent with fourth quarter 2017. Demand for Generation III coil tubing rigs and quintuplex fluid pumpers is strong as customers complete longer reach horizontal wells, particularly in the Montney and Duvernay region of the WCSB.\nTryton continues to experience strong demand for its conventional and MSFS ® tools, including demand for its new composite bridge plug and re-designed cemented-in Viking sleeve system. These tools, introduced in 2017, have been well received by customers looking for new tools and techniques to efficiently and cost-effectively complete longer reach horizontal wells and increase stage count per well. During the first quarter 2018, Tryton used its composite bridge plug, in conjunction with its MSFS ® Ball & Seat tools, to complete two 90-stage MSFS ® jobs in the Montney region and used its Viking sleeve system to complete a 53-stage job in a single tool run in the Cardium region. These tools demonstrate Tryton’s ongoing commitment to develop innovative products and solutions to meet the needs of their customers.\nThe timing of spring breakup and operational performance in the month of March may impact activity in the first quarter in comparison to 2017, when favourable weather conditions extended industry activity to the end of March. Activity in the second half of 2018 will depend on E&P spending, and is difficult to forecast at this time.\nEssential’s 2018 capital budget is $13 million, comprised of $5 million of growth capital and $8 million of maintenance capital. Growth capital is targeted to address customer requirements for longer reach horizontal wells retrofitting one Generation IV coil tubing rig, adding a nitrogen pumper and completing two quintuplex fluid pumpers.\nWith long-term debt at March 7, 2018 of $26.3 million, Essential believes it is financially well-positioned to meet its working capital and capital spending requirements. The increase in debt from December 31, 2017 reflects increased accounts receivables for services provided in the first quarter 2018.\nThe Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and Financial Statements for 31, 2017 are available on Essential’s website at www.essentialenergy.ca and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\n(1) Non-IFRS Measures\nThroughout this news release, certain terms that are not specifically defined in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) are used to analyze Essential’s operations. In addition to the primary measures of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share in accordance with IFRS, Essential believes that certain measures not recognized under IFRS assist both Essential and the reader in assessing performance and understanding Essential’s results. Each of these measures provides the reader with additional insight into Essential’s ability to fund principal debt repayments and capital programs. As a result, the method of calculation may not be comparable with other companies. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share as calculated in accordance with IFRS. See the December 31, 2017 MD&A for a reconciliation of Bank EBITDA, EBITDAS from continuing operations and EBITDA from continuing operations, to the IFRS measure, net income (loss) from continuing operations.\nBank EBITDA – Bank EBITDA is generally defined in Essential’s Credit Facility as EBITDAS from continuing operations, including the equity cure, excluding onerous lease contract expense and severance costs (“Permitted Adjustments”).\nEBITDAS (Earnings before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction costs, losses or gains on disposal of equipment, write-down of assets, impairment loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, and share-based compensation, which includes both equity-settled and cash-settled transactions) – These adjustments are relevant as they provide another measure which is considered an indicator of Essential’s results from its principal business activities.\nFunded debt – Funded debt is generally defined in Essential’s Credit Facility as long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt plus deferred financing costs and bank indebtedness, net of cash.\nGrowth capital – Growth capital is capital spending which is intended to result in incremental revenue. Growth capital is considered to be a key measure as it represents the total expenditures on equipment expected to add incremental revenue to Essential.\nMaintenance capital – Equipment additions that are incurred in order to refurbish, replace or extend the life of previously acquired equipment. Such additions do not provide incremental revenue.\nNet equipment expenditures – This measure is equipment expenditures less proceeds on the disposal of equipment. Essential uses net equipment expenditures to describe net cash outflows related to the financing of Essential’s capital program.\nESSENTIAL ENERGY SERVICES LTD.
