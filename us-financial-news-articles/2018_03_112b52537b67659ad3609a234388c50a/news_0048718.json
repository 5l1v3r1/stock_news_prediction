Following its review, the commission provided no comments, Ofcom said.\n“BT must make its telegraph poles and underground tunnels open to rival providers, making it quicker and easier for them to build their own full-fibre networks directly to households around the UK,” the regulator said.\nOfcom said it would cap the amount BT’s Openreach network can charge rivals to use its entry-level superfast broadband service, which generally offers speeds up to 40 megabits a second, to help rivals attract customers while they build their own networks.\nThe cap will be gradually reduced to reach 12.06 pounds ($17.11) a month by 2020/21.\nOfcom said it had decided not to regulate the prices of Openreach’s fastest wholesale broadband products, including those delivered using its new full-fibre services.\n$1 = 0.7049 pounds Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:12:30.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
