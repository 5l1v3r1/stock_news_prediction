REUTERS/China Daily/File Photo Huarong ( 2799.HK ) acquired the stake in CEFC Hainan International in two tranches, in December and in February, according to a filing on Feb. 13 by CEFC Hainan at an online portal run by the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC).\nCEFC subsidiary CEFC Shanghai International Group Co owns the remaining 63.8 percent in CEFC Hainan.\nHuarong made the stake purchase through its unit, Huarong Ruitong Equity Investment Management Co.\nIt was not immediately clear how much Huarong paid for the stake, but the filing showed CEFC Hainan’s registered capital expanded by 9.6 billion yuan ($1.52 billion) as a result of Huarong Ruitong’s fund injection.\nHuarong Ruitong and CEFC did not immediately comment.\nReuters and other Chinese and international media reported last week that Ye Jianming, the chairman and founder of privately owned CEFC, had been investigated for suspected economic crimes.\nCEFC subsequently denied this and said operations were normal.\nIn just a few years, CEFC has transformed from a niche fuel trader into a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China’s energy giants. It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft for $9.1 billion.\nHuarong Ruitong, responsible for fundraising, project selection, debt acquisition and equity management for Huarong’s debt-for-equity swap deals, planned to raise a 50 billion yuan investment fund for deals, Huarong said in early 2017.\nReporting by Aizhu Chen and Lin Qi; Writing by Josephine Mason; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T13:28:51.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
