[OTC: BCDA], a leader in the development of comprehensive solutions for cardiovascular regenerative therapies, announced it filed its annual 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, March 16, 2018.\nBioCardia reported a net loss of $12.3 million in 2017, which compares to a net loss of $10.3 million in 2016. Research and development expenses increased by $2.5 million, from $3.3 million in 2016 to $5.8 million in 2017, primarily due to increased expenses incurred in conducting the first pivotal trial of its lead therapeutic candidate, the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System for the heart failure indication (CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial). Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million, from $4.1 million in 2016 to $6.4 million in 2017, primarily due to additional costs for the organizational structure needed to support its development activities and the Company’s first full year of operations as a public company. Net cash used in operations increased from $5.5 million in 2016 to $8.7 million in 2017.\nThe Company’s investigational CardiAMP Cell Therapy System is intended to provide a comprehensive biotherapeutic solution for the two indications of heart failure and chronic myocardial ischemia. The system incorporates a proprietary biomarker screening test to select patients most likely to respond to therapy, a point of care processing platform to prepare cells at the patient’s bedside and a highly efficient delivery system that easily navigates a patient’s vasculature to securely deliver cells in a standard cardiac catheterization procedure.\nThe ongoing pivotal CardiAMP Heart Failure Trial is approved to enroll up to 260 patients at up to 40 centers. This follows compelling data from the published Phase I open label and Phase II randomized placebo-controlled trials of CardiAMP therapy. The pivotal Phase III trial is currently enrolling at 10 world class centers in the United States. Safety and efficacy data from the open label roll-in cohort patients at three, six, nine and 12-month follow-up will be available in 2018. The trial is expected to complete enrollment in the second quarter of 2019. The Center for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) has designated that this trial qualifies for Medicare reimbursement, which significantly reduces the overall development costs of this program. The CardiAMP Chronic Myocardial Ischemia Trial is approved to enroll up to 343 patients, also at 40 centers in the United States. An application to CMS for the same reimbursement designation has been submitted and the Company anticipates a decision in April 2018.\nBioCardia Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Peter Altman said, “We believe our approach has great potential to positively impact the lives of millions of patients suffering from ischemic heart failure and chronic myocardial ischemia. Our clinical trials are designed to demonstrate that by selecting patients based on the characteristics of their own stem cells and preparing and delivering those cells in a high dosage using our delivery platform, they will be more likely to respond favorably to therapy. This differentiates the CardiAMP Cell Therapy from other approaches in the field.”\nAbout BioCardia®\nBioCardia , Inc., headquartered in San Carlos, California, is developing regenerative biologic therapies to treat cardiovascular disease. CardiAMP® and CardiALLO® cell therapies are the Company’s biotherapeutic product candidates in clinical development.
