It said the pirates used a speedboat to take away the South Koreans. \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in sent South Korea’s anti-piracy Cheonghae unit to the area to try to secure the South Koreans’ release, the ministry said. \nThe South Korean government has been working to tackle piracy with a number of African countries, as well as the United States and the European Union.
