The executives on this annual list are part of an elite group drawn from the larger pool of Channel Chief honorees each year and represent the cream of the IT channel crop—leaders who drive the channel agenda and evangelize the importance of channel partnerships. This distinguished group is recognized for outstanding achievement in driving growth and revenue in their organization, as well as extraordinary leadership in the channel as a whole.\nAll Channel Chief honorees are selected by CRN’s editorial staff on the basis of their professional achievements, standing in the industry, dedication to the channel partner community, and strategies for driving future growth and innovation. Each of the 2018 Channel Chiefs has demonstrated loyalty and ongoing support for the channel by consistently promoting, defending and executing outstanding partner programs. However, only 50 of these were selected for the Most Influential list, each singled out for his or her prominent role in guiding and shaping the IT channel itself.\nSchlagbaum has led Comcast Business’s continued investment in the channel with the addition of new tiers to its Master Agent program, focused support teams for escalations and customer moves, and increased headcount resources in the indirect channel team. In addition, he has added more innovative support allowing Comcast’s partners to sell more solutions that enable digital transformation for their customers including its Metro Ethernet services and ActiveCore SDN platform . This is the seventh straight year that he has been named a CRN Channel Chief and the fifth consecutive year that he has been named one of CRN’s 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs .\n“The executives on CRN’s 2018 Channel Chiefs list stand out for their exceptional leadership, vision and commitment to the channel,” said Robert Faletra, Executive Chairman of The Channel Company. “These individuals deserve special recognition for their development and support of robust partner programs, innovative business strategy, and significant contribution to the overall health of a vigorously growing channel. We applaud each Channel Chief’s impressive record of accomplishments and look forward to their future successes.”\n“It’s an honor and a true validation of all our channel efforts to again be named one of CRN’s 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs,” said Schlagbaum. “Coming into 2017, we had three goals: add more qualified partners, increase partners’ customer satisfaction ratings, and continue to increase ease of doing business with Comcast; we met all three of those goals and, in addition to our business success, this award is a great recognition of the entire channel team’s accomplishment.”\nThe 2018 CRN Channel Chiefs list, including the 50 Most Influential Channel Chiefs, is featured online at www.crn.com/channelchiefs and will appear in the February 2018 issue of CRN.\nFollow The Channel Company: Twitter , LinkedIn and Facebook\nTweet This:\n@TheChannelCo names @comcastbusiness's Craig Schlagbaum (@craigschlagbaum) to @CRN 2018 Channel Chiefs list #CRNChannelChiefs www.crn.com/channelchiefs .\nAbout Comcast Business\nComcast Business offers Ethernet, Internet, Wi-Fi, Voice, TV and Managed Enterprise Solutions to help organizations of all sizes transform their business.
