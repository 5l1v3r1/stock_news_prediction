The company faces an investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to explain how it allowed data of 50 million users get into the hands of a political consultancy. \nTwitter fell 5.7 percent after short-seller Citron Research said it was short on the stock, adding that the company was “most vulnerable” to privacy regulations. \nRed Hat shares rose about 4 percent after the software developer reported better-than-expected quarterly results on strong demand for its hybrid cloud products. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 1.22-to-1 ratio and for a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
