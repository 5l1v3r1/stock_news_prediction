We also remain open minded about new territories,” Chesnara said in a statement.\nChesnara reported a Solvency II ratio of 146 percent, up from 144 percent last year. The lower the ratio, the greater the chances of a company defaulting on its obligations.\nThe results were better than anticipated, said Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes.\n“Whilst we knew about the positive impact of the acquisition of L&G Nederland ... we had not anticipated the positive economic drivers that extended H1 performance into H2.”\nEconomic value earnings (EcV) net of tax rose to 139.5 million pounds in the year, from 72.5 million pounds a year earlier, while cash generation excluding the impact of the Dutch acquisition rose to 83.9 million pounds, from 36.5 million pounds in 2016.\nEcV is a metric adopted by European insurance companies to make their results more meaningfully comparable and provides a longer-term measure of value generated during a period.\n$1 = 0.7101 pounds Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:46:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
