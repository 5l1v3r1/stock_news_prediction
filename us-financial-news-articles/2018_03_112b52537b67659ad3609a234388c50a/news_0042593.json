REUTERS/Mohammad Shoib Militant group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which followed another blast that was claimed by the group in Kabul last week and killed about 30 people near a Shi’ite shrine as the city celebrated Nawruz, the Persian new year. \nRelated Coverage Islamic State claims attack in Afghanistan, provides no evidence: statement Deputy police chief Aminullah Amin said that two bombers had tried to enter the mosque but were challenged by security guards who opened fire on them. \n“Our Shi’ite brothers were praying in the mosque when two suicide bombers entered the mosque compound. Fortunately, the bombers were identified by Afghan police and local residents,” he said. \nAmin said that one of the bombers was shot by security guards while the second detonated his explosives. \n\nAfghan officials inspect the site of a suicide bomb attack outside a Shi'ite mosque in Herat, Afghanistan March 25, 2018.

REUTERS/Mohammad Shoib While sectarian violence in mainly Sunni Muslim Afghanistan was previously rare, a series of attacks over recent years, many claimed by Islamic State, have killed hundreds of Shi’ites, many from the Hazara ethnic minority. \nThe local affiliate of Islamic State first appeared in Afghanistan three years ago. As well as its main stronghold in the eastern region of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, fighters declaring allegiance to the group have been active in northern Afghanistan. \nThe group has also claimed numerous attacks in Kabul and other cities, though many experts doubt whether it has the capacity to conduct such attacks alone and believe it may have received help at times from other militant groups. \nThe violence has occurred alongside a general deterioration in security in Afghanistan as Taliban insurgents have fought government forces across much of the country, killing thousands of civilians every year. \nReporting by Jalil Rezaee; writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Jane Merriman and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T12:41:33.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
