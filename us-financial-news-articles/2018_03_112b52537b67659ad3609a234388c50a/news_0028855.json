The SEC is close to proposing the regulation, its own version of the Labor Department’s “fiduciary rule” that required brokers handling retirement accounts to always put their clients’ interest ahead of their own financial gain.\n“From my perspective, it’s the centerpiece,” SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said Thursday, referring to the new disclosure, after speaking at the Investment Adviser Association conference in Washington. Ms. Peirce, a Republican, cautioned the disclosure would need to be brief and easy to understand, in contrast to the long, elaborate brochure that money managers are required to give clients. “I’d like to have a very candid, short disclosure form,” she added.\nCritics of the SEC’s current standard for brokers say the regulations are too loose and need to be upgraded to protect unsophisticated investors from biased investment advice. Brokers are required to provide advice that is “suitable,” meaning it fits a client’s goals and risk tolerance. Brokers are typically paid on sales commissions, which can skew their recommendations toward products that pay them more.\nThe SEC’s proposed rule is likely to require brokers to provide advice that puts the client’s interest before their own financial incentives. Wall Street is eager to see how the SEC describes that duty in its proposal, because it will affect the range of products that brokers can recommend and potentially expose them to greater liability.\nWall Street is usually wary of new regulations, but brokers are eager for the SEC to issue a measure that would take the place of the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule. Brokerage firms say Labor’s rule, issued during the Obama administration, made it too costly for them to advise small investors and cut off investments that clients should be able to buy.\nLabor’s rule covered only retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs, as opposed to the nonretirement accounts that many investors use to trade. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said brokers and investors should face a common set of regulations regardless of the type of account they have.\nThe SEC’s rule proposal is also likely to restrict the ability of brokers to use titles such as “financial adviser,” Mr. Clayton has said . Some investor advocates say the name misleads clients into thinking that brokers have the same legal duties as money managers, who under law must put their clients’ best interest first.\nMoney managers, also known as investment advisers, have to comply with different regulatory standards than brokers do, even though they sometimes provide similar services to investors. Investment advisers have complained for years that the rules for brokers are too permissive and that, by using titles such as “financial adviser,” they confuse clients who don’t understand the difference between the two professions.\nThe SEC hopes to vote to propose its rule by the end of the second quarter of 2018 , according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Peirce said in an interview Thursday that she believes the five-member commission will vote on the proposal “relatively soon.” A period of public comment would follow before the agency could vote to adopt the measure as a final rule.\nThe Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which has lobbied the SEC to shape its rule, also expects the measure will require brokers to provide investors with a disclosure that spells out their legal duty to a client and where the broker may have conflicts of interest. Sifma hopes the SEC’s rule will provide the basis for the Labor Department to exempt brokers from its fiduciary rule.\n“I think the SEC as a concept is going to have some sort of more simple, high-level disclosure document that brokers would give right at the outset that would disclose fees, services, conflicts of interest,” Ira Hammerman, Sifma’s general counsel, said in a recent interview. “We are all anxious to see what they come out with.”\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:26:18.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
