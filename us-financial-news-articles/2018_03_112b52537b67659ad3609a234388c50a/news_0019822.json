The Acacia Group has invested capital and established new operational infrastructure to form two standalone companies which will be strongly positioned to accelerate growth and provide more value to customers.\nThe Acacia Group has split Intelligent Decisions into two standalone companies: ID Technologies , the products business which pairs partner technologies with supportive acquisition strategies to enable government agencies to achieve mission success, and Applied Insight , the professional services business with a diverse team of technology and process specialists dedicated to solving complex technology problems for customers.\n“We acquired Intelligent Decisions because of the outstanding reputation of its people among Intelligence Community (IC), DoD and civilian Federal agency customers and its alignment with our ‘enabling technology’ investment focus,” said Gavin Long, partner at The Acacia Group. “Having achieved this first step in our investment strategy, we are actively pursuing other acquisitions that provide differentiated capabilities, including advanced analytics and software development. Our mission is to create a leading middle-market company that operates at the nexus of people, technology and intelligence.”\nChris Oliver, who has held several key positions at Intelligent Decisions for the past decade, most recently as VP, Federal Sales, will serve as President of ID Technologies. Applied Insight will be led by Greg Walker, President, who joined Intelligent Decisions in 2008 and recently held the position of Senior VP, Professional Services. Both Oliver and Walker bring a wealth of operational and leadership experience in the Federal IT market.\nThe creation of ID Technologies and Applied Insight will enable both companies to compete on a level playing field in their respective markets and operate more efficiently through a shared services model to capitalize on growing opportunities across core practice areas including data analytics, application development, Cloud operations, cybersecurity, mobility and Internet of Things (IoT). Each business will have the freedom to develop new strategies, partnerships and propositions tailored to the specific contexts and goals of customers across the Federal government, and to cultivate and support a strong entrepreneurial culture.\nLong adds: “Our philosophy is founded on providing access to capital along with our business and corporate development expertise to empower entrepreneurs to fulfill their vision and achieve significant growth. Intelligent Decisions provides us with the platform upon which to realize that vision. The Federal space is particularly appealing as we see opportunities to invest in businesses that understand how people, process and technology can harmonize to positively impact the customer’s mission, and we look forward to announcing further additions to the Acacia portfolio in due course.”\nAbout Acacia Group\nThe Acacia Group is led by a seasoned team of investors and operators with a distinct investment strategy.
