(NASDAQ:EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) d­­iseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted its request for a small business waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) fee of approximately $2.4 million for the 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) for Evoke’s Gimoti™, nasal delivery formulation of metoclopramide for the treatment of symptoms associated with gastroparesis in women. The Company remains on track to file the Gimoti NDA next quarter.\n“FDA’s grant of the PDUFA fee waiver enables us to continue to focus our resources on finalizing the Gimoti NDA filing. As we review our 2018 budget, we are able to extend our cash runway into October 2018. We continue to remain conservative with our expenditures and with a projected NDA filing next quarter, we look forward to a potential U.S. product launch in 2019,” commented Dave Gonyer, President and CEO.\nAbout Evoke Pharma, Inc.\nEvoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The Company is developing Gimoti, a metoclopramide nasal spray for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent gastroparesis in women with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder afflicting millions of sufferers worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious digestive system symptoms. Metoclopramide is the only product currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis, and is currently available only in oral and intravenous forms. Gimoti is a novel formulation of this drug, designed to provide systemic delivery of metoclopramide through nasal administration.
