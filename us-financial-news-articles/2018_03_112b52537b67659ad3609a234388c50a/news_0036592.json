The Central Bureau of Investigation said the charges had been filed against five former Canara Bank officials including ex-chairman R.K. Dubey and one current official, as well as two directors of a Delhi-based private jewellery company. “It was...revealed during investigation that there was an alleged nexus between the bank officials with the private persons which led to the perpetration of the fraud,” the CBI said in a statement. Canara Bank did not immediately respond to request for comment.
