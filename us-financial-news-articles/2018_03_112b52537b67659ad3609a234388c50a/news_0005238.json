(NYSE: ALE).\nThe expansion of Thunder Spirit Wind, located near Hettinger, North Dakota, will boost the combined production at the wind farm to approximately 155 megawatts of renewable energy, and will increase Montana-Dakota's generation portfolio from 22 percent renewables to 27 percent.\n\"We are committed to investing capital resources to meet the needs of our customers and our growing legacy business,\" said David L. Goodin, president and CEO of MDU Resources Group. \"This project is a positive step in executing that plan and will be a great cost-effective addition to Montana-Dakota's generation portfolio.\"\nThe original 107.5-MW Thunder Spirit Wind project was constructed by ACE and included 43 turbines; it was purchased by Montana-Dakota in December 2015. The expansion calls for 16 turbines producing 48 MW.\nThe project's cost is approximately $85 million and is expected to be online in late 2018.\nMontana-Dakota originally signed a power purchase agreement with ACE for the expansion's generation, with an option to purchase the project. Montana-Dakota determined that owning the project was the least-cost option for its customers. The North Dakota Public Service Commission approved Montana-Dakota's request for an advance determination of prudence for purchasing the expansion in November 2017, noting that electricity produced at the site is expected to be more economical than energy purchased on the market.\n\"Our relationship with ACE on the first phase of Thunder Spirit Wind proved to be a winning formula. We need additional energy to meet our growing demands, and with the easements, interconnection to the grid and permits already in place from the first phase of Thunder Spirit Wind, it makes this a great project for our Montana-Dakota customers,\" said company President and CEO Nicole Kivisto.\nThe wind farm location is beneficial in that it allows Montana-Dakota to connect the project to its transmission system in an area the company already provides electric service, further enhancing the company's deliverability of power to its customers.\n\"We're proud that MDU again chose ACE to develop and build a second wind project that will benefit its customers, the state of North Dakota and the local Adams County economy. Wind energy is a valuable resource in North Dakota, and ALLETE Clean Energy is looking forward to applying our experience to bring the project to fruition,\" said Allan S. Rudeck Jr., president of ALLETE Clean Energy.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this release includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
