Harvard-educated Liu, 66, was the most prominent envoy to visit Washington recently to prevent the outbreak of a trade war. ** While most of the personnel changes on the government’s economic team were widely anticipated, the choice of Yi Gang as the new head of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) was unexpected. ** Yi’s nomination is “a bit unexpected as he holds a relatively low political ranking as the alternative member of CPC Central Committee,” said Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. The committee is the largest of the party’s elite decision-making bodies. ** “In terms of implication, we see policy continuation as Yi will support Liu He to drive economic reform. Both are the main driver to China’s reform in the past few years,” Xie said. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Shenzhen Geoway Co Ltd up 10.06 percent, Zhe Jiang Dong Ri Ltd Co, up 10.04 percent and SDIC Zhonglu Fruit Juice Co Ltd, up 10.03 percent. ** The largest percentage losers in the Shanghai index were Cultural Investment Holdings Co Ltd, down 9.99 percent, Shanghai Fukong Interactive Entertainment Co Ltd , down 9.98 percent and China Hainan Rubber Industry Group Co Ltd, down 7.35 percent.
