Thank you for the gift of LaVona. I did not see this coming. You did. You give new meaning to the word friend.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) The actress is almost unrecognizable in the movie behind a wig, large glasses and with a parakeet on her shoulder.\n“He wanted to show people what else I could do, that I could play someone this far away from myself and yet make her real and grounded,” Janney said last year.“I have to say it’s hard to say you had fun playing someone so awful, but it was a fun challenge.”\nJanney’s first passion was ice skating and she had hopes as a teenager of competing in the Olympics before an accident and the realization that she was too tall to succeed ended her dreams.\nShe later studied acting under Paul Newman at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and credits Newman’s late wife, actress Joanne Woodward with encouraging her career.\nReporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Peter Henderson and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T07:00:56.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
