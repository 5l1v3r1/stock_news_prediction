(NASDAQ: SILC) today announced that it expects to close several major, strategic new SD-WAN and NFV-related vCPE Design Wins from major telcos, the first of which it expects to announce in the near term. Given the significant size of each of these expected deals, their financial terms and the meaningful working capital that may be required to support them once they ramp up, the Company has decided today to suspend its dividend distributions to increase its available funds and to support its long-term growth.\n\"Although we cannot yet formally announce any of these potential wins, we have already begun working on them with our customers, who assume â€“ as do we - that the current situation will transform into a 'full win' within a short time. As such, we must make sure that we have all the financial resources to fulfill demanding supply commitments once these potential wins reach their full deployment run rate,\" commented Shaike Orbach, Silicom's President and CEO.\n\"These wins, once finalized, have the power to drive our growth for years to come. Taken individually, each one is expected to ramp over time to tens of millions of dollars per year while offering endless opportunities for further sales.\"\nMr. Orbach concluded, \"By building our financial reserves, we are readying ourselves to spring into action as soon as we get the final go-ahead. We are confident that this is the right strategy for building the Company to the next level, thereby serving the long-term interests of our shareholders.\"\nAbout Silicom\nSilicom Ltd. is an industry-leading provider of high-performance networking and data infrastructure solutions.
