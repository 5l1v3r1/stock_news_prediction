The latest estimate for investment in the year to June came in at A$114.6 billion, topping most analysts’ forecasts of A$112 billion.\nThe first, and very early, estimate for 2018/19 was for spending of A$84 billion and these plans tend to be revised up steadily over time.\n“The key point remains that investment is no longer the Achilles’ heel of the economy as firms are starting to flex their spending muscles,” said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics.\n“Despite the small disappointment, it is becoming clearer and clearer that investment will increasingly support GDP growth.”\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been sounding markedly more optimistic on investment thanks in large part to booming public spending on infrastructure, where the pipeline of work is at its highest level as a share of GDP in several decades.\nMining investment also looked to have stabilised after several years of steep decline, and other industries were finally taking up the slack.\nLeading the pack was the IT sector, with plans for a 40 percent expansion in spending in the year to June, followed by utilities, professional services and construction.\nCommercial property has been undergoing something of a renaissance, with tourism and student accommodation particularly strong, thanks to a big influx of Chinese visitors.\n“The key question for the broader outlook is whether this optimism and spending spills over to wages growth, household income and consumer spending – this will be crucial to lifting GDP growth significantly above its current pace,” Hunter said.
