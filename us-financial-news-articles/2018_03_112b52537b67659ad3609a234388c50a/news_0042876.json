Firefighter Michael Davidson, 37, was injured in the fire that broke out on Thursday and later died in a hospital, the New York Fire Department said on Facebook. “Horrific tragedy,” Mark Levine, a New York City councilman, wrote on Twitter. “We pray for his family and loved ones.” Two other firefighters were seriously injured while three civilians suffered minor injuries in the fire that began at about 11 p.m. local time in the basement of the historic and now closed St. Nick’s Jazz Pub, a local CBS affiliate reported.

In a statement to CBS, the film producers extended their condolences to Davidson, a father of four, and his family. “Our hearts ache in solidarity with his family,” they said of the 15-year veteran of the department. “The FDNY are real life super-heroes and have our boundless admiration and gratitude.” Dozens of movie crew members were working at the building when they noticed smoke on the set and called the fire department, the statement said.
