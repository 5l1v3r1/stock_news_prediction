If they have good conditions, open a factory.”\nA lot of small and middle-sized Chinese battery companies have already gone over to South or Southeast Asia because of the 4 percent consumption tax on lead-acid batteries in China, he noted. “It’s very hard for a lot of companies to bear. The pressure is very big,” he said.\nThe migration mirrors one in China’s scrap metal sector, where new restrictions on imports of solid waste and a need for importers to prove they are end-users of the material have prompted scrap firms to set up shop in South or Southeast Asia instead.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Tom Hogue and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T19:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:29:54.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
