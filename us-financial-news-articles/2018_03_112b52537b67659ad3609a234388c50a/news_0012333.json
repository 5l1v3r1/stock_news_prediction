(Nasdaq:CTMX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing investigational Probody™ therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, today reported full-year 2017 financial results and provided an operational update on the company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, CytomX had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $374.1 million. Based upon its current operating plan, the Company expects its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund operations into 2020.\n“The CytomX team continued tremendous execution during 2017, driving our transition to a clinical-stage company with the initiation of Phase 1/2 studies for two wholly-owned and one partnered program,” said Sean McCarthy, D.Phil., president and chief executive officer of CytomX Therapeutics.\n“During 2018, we expect initial data readouts from our PD-L1-targeting Probody therapeutic, CX-072, and our CD166-targeting Probody drug conjugate, CX-2009. We also expect to initiate clinical studies for two additional programs this year, resulting in five clinical-stage Probody therapeutic programs by year end. Our deepening pipeline of innovative therapeutics has the potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people with cancer,” continued Dr. McCarthy.\n2017 Business Highlights and Recent Developments\nPROCLAIM-CX-072 (PD-L1 Probody Therapeutic) Clinical Program\nCX-072 is a Probody therapeutic targeting PD-L1, a clinically- and commercially-validated anti-cancer target. Enrollment began in January 2017 in PROCLAIM-CX-072, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating CX-072 as monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy ® (ipilimumab) or Zelboraf ® (vemurafenib) in patients with cancer. Enrollment is complete in the monotherapy dose escalation arm evaluating CX-072 in patients with advanced unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas (Part A). Preliminary data from Part A is expected to be presented mid-2018. Patient enrollment was initiated at a single dose level in an expansion cohort in an undisclosed cancer with known sensitivity to PD-pathway inhibitors (Part D). Patient enrollment is ongoing in all other dose escalation arms of the study: Monotherapy expansion in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors at multiple dose levels (Part A2); Combination of CX-072 plus Yervoy ® (ipilimumab) in patients with advanced unresectable solid tumors or lymphomas (Part B); Combination of CX-072 plus Zelboraf ® (vemurafenib) in patients with V600E BRAF-positive melanoma (Part C).\nPROCLAIM-CX-2009 (CD166 Probody Drug Conjugate) Clinical Program\nCX-2009 is a Probody drug conjugate (PDC) that targets CD166, an antigen that is broadly and highly expressed in many types of cancer. Patient enrollment continues in the PROCLAIM-CX-2009 study, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial initiated in June 2017, evaluating CX-2009 as monotherapy in a subset of CD166-positive cancer types (Part A). Preliminary data from Part A is expected to be presented in the second half of 2018. Monotherapy expansion at select dose levels and in the same subset of cancers has been initiated in patients selected for the highest levels of CD166 expression (Part A2).\nBMS-986249 (CTLA-4 Probody Therapeutic) Clinical Program\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) presented preclinical safety and anti-tumor activity data for an anti-CTLA-4 Probody therapeutic designed to be a potentially safer ipilimumab. In fourth quarter of 2017, BMS initiated a Phase 1/2 study evaluating BMS-986249 alone and in combination with nivolumab in solid tumors that are advanced and have spread. BMS-986249 is the first Probody therapeutic to advance to the clinic under the companies’ strategic collaboration.\nCX-2029 (CD71 Probody Drug Conjugate) Preclinical Program\nCytomX, in collaboration with AbbVie, is advancing CX-2029, a CD71-directed PDC, through Investigational New Drug (IND) application-enabling studies. CD71, also known as the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), is highly expressed in a number of solid and hematologic cancers and has particularly attractive molecular properties for efficient delivery of cytotoxic payloads to tumor cells. CytomX expects to file an IND application for CX-2029 in the first half of 2018.\nCX-188 (PD-1 Probody Therapeutic) Preclinical Program\nCytomX is advancing CX-188, a PD-1-directed Probody therapeutic, through IND-enabling studies. PD-1 is the receptor for the PD-L1 ligand responsible for inhibiting T-cell activation in a variety of cancers and is a clinically- and commercially-validated anti-cancer target. CytomX expects to file an IND application for CX-188 in the second half of 2018.\nPartnerships\nAbbVie Partnership\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, CytomX received a $15 million milestone payment ($14 million net of associated license fees) from AbbVie in conjunction with meeting certain criteria allowing the initiation of GLP toxicology studies by CytomX for CX-2029, a CD71-directed PDC.\nAmgen Partnership\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, Amgen and CytomX entered into a strategic collaboration in immuno-oncology in the field of Probody T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (Pro-TCBs), including the co-development of a CytomX Pro-TCB against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a highly validated oncology target expressed on multiple human cancer types. Under the terms of the agreement, Amgen and CytomX will co-develop a Pro-TCB against EGFR-CD3 with CytomX leading early development. Amgen will lead later development and commercialization with global late-stage development costs shared between the two companies. Amgen made an upfront payment of $40 million and purchased $20 million of CytomX common stock. CytomX is eligible to receive up to $455 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones payments for the EGFR program and low-double digit to mid-teen percentage royalty payments on resulting EGFR products, and has the ability to opt into a profit share in the U.S. Amgen is also able to select three additional targets for Pro-TCB discovery and development. Should Amgen ultimately pursue all of these targets, CytomX will be eligible to receive up to $950 million in additional upfront and milestone payments and high-single digit to low-teen percentage royalty payments on any resulting products. CytomX also received the rights from Amgen to an undisclosed preclinical T-cell engaging bispecific program; Amgen is eligible to receive milestones and mid-single digit to low-double digit percentage royalty payments on any resulting products from this CytomX program.\nBristol-Myers Squibb Collaboration Expansion\nDuring the second quarter of 2017, CytomX and BMS expanded its foundational alliance to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies using the Probody platform, resulting in a $200 million upfront payment to CytomX. The expanded collaboration now provides BMS with the selection of up to ten oncology targets and two non-oncology targets. In the fourth quarter of 2017, CytomX earned a $10 million milestone payment from BMS upon IND clearance of BMS-986249.\nPfizer Collaboration\nOn March 6, 2018, CytomX received notification of Pfizer’s intent to terminate the companies’ research collaboration, option and license agreement. The Pfizer collaboration, entered into in 2013, included the selection of up to four PDC targets for the treatment of cancer. The initial PDC target was EGFR, which Pfizer previously discontinued, with certain rights reverting to CytomX. Collaboration programs against the second and third targets were terminated during the first quarter of 2018. Pfizer had previously declined its option to select a fourth target in the collaboration. None of the programs in the Pfizer collaboration had advanced to clinical candidate stage.\nFull-Year Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $374.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $181.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase reflects cash provided by operations resulting primarily from the $200 million of upfront payments received from BMS for alliance expansion, $40 million of upfront payments and $20 million of proceeds from stock sold as part of the Amgen agreement, and the $15 million milestone payment ($14 million net of associated license fees) received from AbbVie. These cash receipts were partially offset by cash used to fund operations.\nResearch and development expenses were $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $54.8 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a non-cash charge of $10.7 million of in-process research and development expense recognized related to the Amgen agreement; $10.0 million sublicense payment made to UCSB triggered by the $200.0 million upfront payment made by BMS in connection with our expanded collaboration; $2.1 million of UCSB sublicense fees accrued as a result of the Amgen agreement; $1.0 million of UCSB sublicense fees recognized for our achievement of certain milestones required to be met to begin GLP toxicology studies under the AbbVie agreement and the IND filing for the CTLA-4 directed Probody therapeutic by BMS; an increase of $8.5 million in pharmacology studies and clinical trial expenses resulting from the advancement of CX-072, CX-2009, and CX-2029 in 2017; an increase of $5.3 million in personnel-related expenses and allocation of IT and facilities-related expenses due to an increase in headcount; and an increase of $1.7 million in consulting expenses due to the commencement of clinical trials in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.1 million in manufacturing expenses for our CX-072 and CX-2009 programs due to manufacturing activities occurring in 2016 in preparation for clinical trials in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was predominantly due to an increase of $1.4 million in personnel-related expenses and an increase of $1.0 million in recruitment fees due to an increase in headcount and temporary labor; an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.0 million due to an increase in headcount and an increase in the value of our stock; and an increase of $1.2 million in consulting services expenses primarily due to an increase in tax and accounting compliance activities and investor relations expenses.\nTeleconference Scheduled Today at 5:00 p.m. ET\nConference Call/Webcast Information\nCytomX management will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET.
