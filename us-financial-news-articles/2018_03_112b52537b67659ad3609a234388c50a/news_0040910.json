(\"IGRS\") have approved the reorganization of IGRS with and into Cohen & Steers Global Realty Shares, Inc. (\"CSS\") (collectively, the \"Funds\"), effective at the close of business on March 23, 2018. With combined assets of approximately $1.1 billion, CSS will be in the top-10 in assets under management among actively managed global real estate securities mutual funds. 1\nThe reorganization brings together two highly ranked funds within the global real estate category, each with 4-star overall Morningstar ratings. Cohen & Steers believes that combining the Funds will benefit the shareholders of both IGRS and CSS by reducing annual operating gross and net expense ratios, increasing marketability and providing portfolio-management and operational efficiencies.\nThe Funds have substantially similar investment policies and the same investment objective of total return—consisting of capital appreciation and current income—which they seek to achieve through investment in equity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other REIT-like entities.\nCSS will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of IGRS in a tax-free transaction in exchange for an equal aggregate value of newly issued CSS Class I common shares. IGRS shareholders will receive Class I common shares of CSS in an amount equal to the aggregate net asset value of IGRS common shares, as determined at the close of business on March 23, 2018, less the shareholder's portion of the costs of the reorganization.\nCohen & Steers expects that after the reorganization, the administrative expenses of CSS will be less than the aggregate current expenses of each of the Funds operating separately, as fixed expenses will be spread over a larger asset base. Additionally, effective at the close of business on March 23, 2018, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Funds' Investment Advisor, has agreed to reduce the management fee for CSS from an annual rate of 0.80% of average daily net assets to 0.75% of average daily net assets. Cohen & Steers has also contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse expenses through June 30, 2019, so that the total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses) do not exceed 1.25% for Class A shares, 1.90% for Class C shares, 0.90% for Class F shares, 0.90% for Class I shares, 1.40% for Class R shares, 1.25% for Class T shares and 0.90% for Class Z shares.\nThe fixed expenses of the combined fund are set forth below, effective at the close of business on March 23, 2018:\nClass\nA\nClass\nC\nClass\nF (1)\nClass\nI\nClass\nR\nClass\nT (1)\nClass\nZ\nShareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment):\nMaximum Sales Charge (Load) Imposed On Purchases\n(as % of offering price)\n4.50%\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\n2.50%\nNone\nMaximum Deferred Sales Charge (Load) (as % of the\nnet asset value at the time of purchase or redemption,\nwhichever is lower)\nNone\n1.00% (2)\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nNone\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay\neach year as a percentage of the value of your investment):\nManagement Fee\n0.75%\n0.75%\n0.75%\n0.75%\n0.75%\n0.75%\n0.75%\nDistribution (12b-1) Fees\n0.25%\n0.75%\nNone\nNone\n0.50%\n0.25%\nNone\nOther Expenses\n0.12%\n0.12%\n0.12%\n0.12%\n0.12%\n0.12%\n0.12%\nShareholder Service Fee (3)\n0.10%\n0.25%\nNone\n0.06%\nNone\n0.08%\nNone\nTotal Other Expenses\n0.22%\n0.37%\n0.12%\n0.18%\n0.12%\n0.20%\n0.12%\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses (4)\n1.22%\n1.87%\n0.87%\n0.93%\n1.37%\n1.20%\n0.87%\nFee Waiver/Expense Reimbursement (4)\n(0.00)%\n(0.00)%\n(0.00)%\n(0.03)%\n(0.00)%\n(0.00)%\n(0.00)%\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses (after fee\nwaiver/expense reimbursement) (4)\n1.22%\n1.87%\n0.87% (5)\n0.90%\n1.37%\n1.20% (5)\n0.87%\n(1)\nClass F shares and Class T shares are currently not available for purchase.\n(2)\nFor Class C shares, the maximum deferred sales charge does not apply after one year.\n(3)\nThe maximum shareholder service fee for Class I shares and Class T shares is 0.10%.\n(4)\nCohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., the Fund's investment advisor (the \"Advisor\"), has contractually agreed to waive its fee and/or reimburse expenses through June 30, 2019 so that the Fund's total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes and extraordinary expenses) do not exceed 1.25% for Class A shares, 1.90% for Class C shares, 0.90 % for Class F shares, 0.90% for Class I shares, 1.40% for Class R shares, 1.25% for Class T shares and 0.90% for Class Z shares. This contractual agreement can be amended or terminated at any time by agreement of the Board of Directors of CSS and the Investment Advisor and will terminate automatically in the event of termination of the investment advisory agreement between the Investment Advisor and CSS.\n(5)\nThe total annual fund operating expenses for Class F shares and Class T shares are estimated.\nPerformance data Quote: d represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. The overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the risk-adjusted performance figures associates with a fund's 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.

Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, political and economic uncertainties, and differences in accounting standards. Some international securities may represent small- and medium-sized companies, which may be more susceptible to price volatility and less liquidity than larger companies. The Funds are classified as \"non-diversified\" funds under the federal securities laws because they can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund. However, the Funds must meet certain diversification requirements under the U.S. tax laws. No representation or warranty is made as to the efficacy of any particular strategy or fund or the actual returns that may be achieved.\nCohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc.
