Moscow has denied being behind it.\nRussia’s Ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov, urged the Irish government to “use common sense” and in an interview with RTE said he did not see any evidence that would point to the need to ruin very positive relations between Moscow and Dublin.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T07:21:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
