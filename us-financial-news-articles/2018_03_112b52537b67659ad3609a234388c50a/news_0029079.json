It added that as a store of value, they are akin to \"gambling in a casino.\"\nThe opinion piece does concede that with non-cash payments on the rise, an electronic solution of some form may be coming.\n\"While bitcoin and its cousins are something of a mirage, they might be an early sign of change, just as Palm Pilots paved the way for today's smartphones,\" the report said.\n\"Cash will not be king forever, even though it still rules in many parts of the world.\"\nNew research from the BIS, known as the central bank of central banks, showed non-cash payments in 25 major countries have roughly doubled in size, as a share of gross domestic product, since the turn of the century.\nCash is the only current way in which a person on the street can access money that is backed by a central bank. Should cash disappear from the street then an economy would be wholly reliant on the liquidity of commercial banks.\nThe piece contended that while a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could solve this risk, it could also disrupt the manner in which the financial system and economy currently works.\n\"A CBDC for all would challenge the current model of banks taking customer deposits and using that money to fund the lending that helps drive the economy,\" it said.\n\"The consequences for bank business models and financial stability would need to be carefully parsed.\"\nThe report also noted that such a currency would not be able to grant the same anonymity as cash, as it would lead to illegal use. That, it said, could create a different problem where central banks would hold unprecedented amounts of information about individuals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T16:26:44.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
