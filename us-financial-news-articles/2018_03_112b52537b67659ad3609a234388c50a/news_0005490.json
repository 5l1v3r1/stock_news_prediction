Complaints of abuse are frequent and, in order to save money, many migrant workers do not seek medical attention when they are ill.\nThe UAE embassy in New Delhi said the procedure for repatriating bodies includes securing a medical notification stating the cause of death.\nThe deceased person’s passport must also be submitted to authorities, along with official identification of the relative or sponsor - the employer, in the case of migrant workers - who is responsible for repatriation, said the embassy.\n“In many cases, the body lies in the morgue for days as the employer doesn’t come to claim it,” said Anuradha Vobbiliselty, an advocate who works with migrant workers in Dubai.\nReporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Jared Ferrie.
