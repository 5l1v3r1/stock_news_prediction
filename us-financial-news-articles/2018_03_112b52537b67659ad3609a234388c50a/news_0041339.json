Ms. Nixon, also a New Yorker in real life, has now announced she will challenge Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary. And at least on tax breaks for the wealthy, she’s showing the same welcome forthrightness. \nMs. Nixon is a progressive, and in this vein she slammed Mr. Cuomo during an interview with the Buffalo News for the “corruption Olympics that is Albany,” especially his economic development programs. Asked about the state tax breaks that go to her own industry, she said she’s looking into them but thought the $420 million credit for film and TV “doesn’t merit the investment.” She added, “I don’t think there’s any real truth that that enormous expenditure of money is making a significant enough difference in production to justify it.” \nSome states have ended such credits, but under Gov. Cuomo New York continues to bribe companies to come. An October dispatch in Crain’s noted that, since 2011, these subsidies included at least $5 million for Harvey Weinstein’s company. Mr. Weinstein was a Cuomo contributor. Ms. Nixon can have some campaign fun with that, and more power to her for targeting this Hollywood handout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T08:21:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
