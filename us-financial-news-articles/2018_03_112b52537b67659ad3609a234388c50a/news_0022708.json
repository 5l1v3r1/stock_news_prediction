Hoa was also stripped off his “people’s police” title by the nation’s president on Sunday, the ministry said.\nVietnam’s anti-graft push caught international attention last year when Germany accused the Southeast Asian nation of kidnapping a Vietnamese official from a Berlin park in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War. The man was eventually handed two life sentences for embezzlement.\nThe crackdown has also resulted in a 13-year prison term for a former politburo member, Dinh La Thang, and a death sentence for a former chairman of state energy firm PetroVietnam. Dozens of other officials received jail terms.\nReporting by Mai Nguyen, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T14:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T15:05:41.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
