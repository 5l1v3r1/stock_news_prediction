(Update: Pitaro has been named president .)\nI've asked Disney and ESPN reps for comment.\nPitaro would fill the vacancy created in December, when former ESPN CEO John Skipper surprised the media world by resigning, citing substance addiction.\nSince then, Pitaro has been at the top of most lists as Skipper's likely replacement: He's a favorite of CEO Bob Iger, and had previously been tapped as a likely successor to Skipper. At one point Pitaro was supposed to move from the Los Angeles area to ESPN's home base in Connecticut as Skipper's number two.\nInstead, Pitaro stayed on running Disney's consumer and digital group, which generated $4.8 billion in 2017, a 13 percent decrease from 2016.\nNow Pitaro is set to take an even bigger job, at a crucial time. He'll be running what used to be Disney's most important asset, and is still one of the most powerful forces in TV. But ESPN's subscriber base has been declining, as audiences cut the cord or don't sign up for cable in the first place, and it is on the hook for costly sports programming deals that continue to ratchet up.\nBoth Skipper and Iger have insisted that ESPN is in fine shape, because those sports deals let it command subscriber rates and audiences that other TV networks can't get.\nBut the network has gone through a series of layoffs to help its sagging margins. And the planned launch of ESPN Plus, a direct-to-consumer subscription service featuring niche sports is an incremental step, not full-scale solution to ESPN's woes.\nPitaro has been at Disney since 2010, when he came aboard as co-head of its interactive group. He outlasted his co-president John Pleasants, and eventually added the company's consumer products and licensing business to his portfolio.\nPitaro hasn't touched the sports business for years. Prior to Disney, he ran Yahoo 's media business, back when the company was still trying to decide whether it was a media company or a technology company (it never decided). And before that, he ran Yahoo's once-powerful sports vertical from 2006 until 2009.\nRead more from Recode:\nESPN boss John Skipper, one of TV's most important executives, is leaving at a crucial time\nCoinbase now has an M&A boss.
