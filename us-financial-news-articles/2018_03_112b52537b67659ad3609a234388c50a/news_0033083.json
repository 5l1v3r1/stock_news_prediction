The Bank reported pretax income for the year ended December 31, 2017, of $29.0 million compared to $24.6 million in 2016. The three Fed Fund rate increases during 2017 contributed to the favorable year over year earnings performance. Due to the Tax Reform Bill signed by the President on December 22, 2017, the Bank wrote down $6.9 million in deferred tax assets to tax expense. This adjustment resulted in a lower net income of $10.0 million for 2017 compared to $14.1 million net income in 2016.\nAs a result of the Bank’s ongoing strategic initiative to reposition the loan portfolio to a customer profile with higher profitability, total loans were $1.8 billion at December 31, 2017. Total deposits were $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017.\nCredit quality was outstanding through 2017. Credit quality is reflected in the percentage of non-accrual loans to total loans at 0.02% as of December 31, 2017. The allowance for credit loss ratio remains satisfactory at 1.86% as of December 31, 2017.\nCapital remained strong as evidenced by Tier 1 and Total risk-based capital ratios of 12.36% and 13.61%, respectively; both ratios exceed the minimum requirements of a well-capitalized institution of 8.00% and 10.00%, respectively.\nMessage from Naresh Sheth, President & COO\nNaresh Sheth, President and Chief Operating Officer, commented, “Mr. Kusakabe, Chairman & CEO, and I both observed that 2017 was a challenging year with severe lending competition which translated into very narrow margins. Despite this headwind, the Bank reported a historic high pretax income as we benefited from the three interest rate hikes. We remain committed to maintaining the Bank’s remarkable credit quality as evidenced by the less than $500,000 in nonperforming assets at yearend. Our Bank also continues to enjoy strong capital and liquidity and a solid customer base.\nOur continued strong credit quality and financial strength could be accomplished only because of our experienced senior management team, a core of experienced bankers and our dedicated personnel. This has allowed our Bank to maintain strong banking relationships with existing as well as many new customers. We continue our dedication to supporting the traditional service values of a financially strong and stable business bank by providing a full array of excellent products and services in a timely, flexible and responsive manner.\nMr. Kusakabe, Chairman & CEO, and I sincerely thank our customers for giving us an opportunity to serve them for 55 years and our staff for their dedication and valued service.\"\nManufacturers Bank has been operating mainly in Southern California, consistently delivering tailored financial solutions that enhance the economic well-being of its middle market customers.
