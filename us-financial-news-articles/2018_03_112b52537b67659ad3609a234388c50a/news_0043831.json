This was rejected and the company has been fighting the investors in British and UAE courts since then.\nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters that an English High Court injunction forbidding Dana from paying dividends because of the dispute would expire on March 29.\nThe company had $608 million in cash at the end of 2017, according to its financial statements. Last August Dana’s financial outlook improved when the government of Iraq’s Kurdistan region paid the company and its partners $1 billion under a settlement of a payments dispute and the consortium now plans to invest in boosting gas production there.\nDana has been in talks for months with at least some of its creditors on proposals to restructure its sukuk. One of the proposals envisaged Dana redeeming 10 percent with cash and rolling over 90 percent under new terms.\nThe proposed 10 percent paydown was one of the main sticking points in negotiations, sources told Reuters last month. Creditors want the company to redeem a higher proportion of the sukuk.\nA committee of sukuk holders did not immediately respond on Sunday to a request for comment on the dividend plan.\nAnother source close to the situation said that by offering a cash dividend to its shareholders, “Dana Gas is making the deal they offered to creditors a fait accompli — the cash is gone, take it or leave it”.
