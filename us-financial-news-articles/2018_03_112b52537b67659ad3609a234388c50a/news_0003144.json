DeRozan helped Toronto bounce back and take a four-point halftime lead, and both he and Miles came through in the final two quarters.\nToronto has won 10 of its past 11 games.\nMiles made 6 of 9 3-point attempts and finished 7 of 10 overall from the field. The Raptors were leading by one late in the game before Miles made a layup and a 3-pointer for a 94-88 lead.\nDeRozan then added baskets on back-to-back possessions, giving Toronto a 98-90 lead with just under one minute left.\nJonas Valanciunas and Fred VanVleet both scored 12 points for the Raptors.\nOtto Porter Jr. led the Wizards with 24 while Bradley Beal added 23.\nToronto rebounded from the slow start for a 51-47 lead at halftime. The Wizards rallied and took the lead again late in the third quarter before Miles drilled consecutive 3-pointers for a 77-74 lead heading to the fourth.\nThe Wizards had started quickly while Toronto could not score in the opening minutes. Washington got the game’s first six points and raced to an 18-4 edge before taking a 27-19 lead after one.\nToronto scored 32 in the second quarter as Washington went cold from the field.\nThe Washington Post reported that Wizards coach Scott Brooks said John Wall would be on the court soon for workouts, maybe on Friday or Saturday.\nWall had knee surgery in early February and was expected to be out six to eight weeks. This is the fourth week, but no definitive time for his return to playing was announced, and the Wizards now are 10-5 without him.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:34:47.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
