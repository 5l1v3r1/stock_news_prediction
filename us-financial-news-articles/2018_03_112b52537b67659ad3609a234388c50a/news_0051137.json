All three were sent home from South Africa.\n“As a result of last weekend’s events in Cape Town involving members of the Australian men’s cricket team and following the sanctions made by Cricket Australia, ASICS has terminated its sponsorship contracts with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, effective immediately,” the company said on its official Twitter feed on Thursday.\nThe company did not give further details about its decision, and did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\nASICS was the second sponsor in two days to abandon Warner over the incident. Electronics maker LG had already said it would not be giving the 31-year-old a new sponsorship deal.\nSeveral of Cricket Australia’s major sponsors, including cereal maker Sanitarium, have said they would await the results of a full investigation into the scandal before deciding on the future of their deals with the governing body.\nSanitarium was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
