These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a more representative understanding of underlying operational results and trends as well as the Company’s operational performance. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Please refer to the accompanying financial schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures. We round amounts in these schedules to millions and calculate all percentages and per-share data from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. As a result, certain amounts may not foot, crossfoot, or recalculate based on reported numbers due to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31.\nFirst Quarter Summary\nBroad-based total revenue growth of 19.7% driven predominantly by acquisitive revenue within the Education and Technology & Manufacturing segments. Organic revenue growth of 3.0% led by new wins and business expansions in the Business & Industry and Aviation segments. Lower Technical Solutions revenue due to the timing of backlog. The booking of a Technical Solutions cross-sell in a Georgia school district, exemplifying the Company’s focus on cross-selling into its Education customers. Growth of 50.0% in income from continuing operations per diluted share driven primarily by a one-time tax benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a reduction of the Company's overall corporate tax rate, partially offset by higher restructuring costs related to the 2017 acquisition of GCA Services Group (\"GCA\"). Lower adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share reflecting increased interest expense, amortization and higher share count related to the GCA acquisition, which offset higher operating segment contribution and a lower overall corporate tax rate. Net income growth to $27.8 million compared to a loss of $56.8 million in the year ago period, which includes discontinued operations. Higher adjusted EBITDA of $65.1 million, or a margin rate of 4.1%, compared to $48.1 million, or a margin rate of 3.6% last year.\nFirst Quarter Results\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reported revenues of approximately $1.6 billion driven by the acquisition of GCA, and organic growth stemming from new domestic and international janitorial wins, janitorial and parking-related business expansions, and higher Work Order (tag) revenue within the Business & Industry segment. The Aviation segment also experienced strong organic growth stemming from parking, cabin cleaning, and expansion of catering logistics. Organic revenue growth was partially offset by lower revenue within the Technical Solutions segment. Acquisitions provided $253.9 million of incremental revenues during the quarter primarily related to GCA, which is predominantly reflected in the Education and Technology & Manufacturing segments in the amounts of $140.5 million and $58.6 million, respectively.\nOn a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $28.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $16.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share last year. Income from continuing operations versus last year reflects a significant benefit stemming from The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017. Due to this new legislation, the Company recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $21.7 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities which was partially offset by a tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. Income from continuing operations for the quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis reflects higher amortization expense as a result of the GCA acquisition, which is embedded in each of the Company's reportable segments. Additionally, the Company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with higher interest expense and 66.3 million weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis due to the GCA transaction.\nIncome from continuing operations was primarily impacted by incremental revenue contribution in the Education and Technology & Manufacturing segments associated with the Company's GCA acquisition. These results were partially offset by higher corporate-related expenses primarily related to restructuring charges associated with GCA and investments in IT.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $17.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $21.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The positive impact from a reduction in the Company's corporate tax rate and increased revenue contribution from GCA were offset by the aforementioned expenses and share count dilution attributable to the GCA acquisition. These results exclude items impacting comparability. A full description of items impacting comparability can be found in the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $27.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $56.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $65.1 million compared to $48.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 4.1% versus 3.6% last year.\nMr. Salmirs continued, \"Our new reportable segments reflect an integrated ABM. With leadership in place and business plans taking shape, we are excited about the long-term potential for our Industry Groups. We are seeing early signs of cross-selling and continue to invest in our business development platform for greater efficiency and expansion.\"\nLiquidity & Capital Structure\nThe Company ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit, of $1.3 billion.\nTotal debt to proforma adjusted EBITDA was approximately 4.0x.\nIn addition, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per common share for a total distribution of $11.5 million.\nDeclaration of Quarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.175 per common share payable on May 7, 2018 to shareholders of record on April 5, 2018. This will be the Company's 208 th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.\nGuidance\nThe Company now expects GAAP income from continuing operations of $1.88 to $1.98 per diluted share compared to its previously issued guidance of $1.33 to $1.43. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.10 per diluted share for the 2018 fiscal year compared to its previously issued guidance range of $1.70 to $1.80. The Company's revised guidance outlook is primarily a result of the impact related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the exception of the 2018 Work Opportunity Tax Credits and anticipated excess tax benefits on stock-based awards, this guidance does not include any potential benefits associated with certain other discrete tax items and other unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company intends to continue reviewing the required analyses and accounting surrounding this tax impact throughout fiscal 2018. As such, the Company may further refine these estimates.\nMr. Salmirs concluded, \"Given the benefit we will see from tax reform this year, we are pleased to have increased our guidance outlook. As previously discussed, we plan to use these tax proceeds to primarily deleverage, which aligns with our capital allocation priorities.\"\nConference Call Information\nABM will host its quarterly conference call for all interested parties on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 at 8:30 AM (ET).

We make related to future expectations, estimates, and projections that are uncertain and often contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “likely,” “may,” “outlook,” “plan,” “predict,” “should,” “target,” or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those expressed in our include: (1) we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of GCA Services Group (“GCA”); (2) we have incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the acquisition of GCA. To service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We also depend on the profitability of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs. If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required to service our indebtedness or we may be required to suspend certain discretionary payments, including our dividend; (3) changes to our businesses, operating structure, financial reporting structure, or personnel relating to the implementation of our 2020 Vision strategic transformation initiative, including our move to our Enterprise Services Center, may not have the desired effects on our financial condition and results of operations; (4) our success depends on our ability to gain profitable business despite competitive pressures and to preserve long-term client relationships; (5) our business success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management; (6) our use of subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform work under customer contracts exposes us to liability and financial risk; (7) our international business involves risks different from those we face in the United States that could have an effect on our results of operations and financial condition; (8) unfavorable developments in our class and representative actions and other lawsuits alleging various claims could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (9) we insure our insurable risks through a combination of insurance and self-insurance and we retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with expected losses under these programs, which exposes us to volatility associated with those risks, including the possibility that changes in estimates of ultimate insurance losses could result in a material charge against our earnings; (10) our risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for personal injury or property loss; (11) impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (12) changes in general economic conditions, including changes in energy prices, government regulations, or changing consumer preferences, could reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (13) our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuations of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax treaties, laws, and regulations, including the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which effected significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system; (14) we could be subject to cyber-security risks, information technology interruptions, and business continuity risks; (15) a significant number of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that could expose us to potential liabilities in relationship to our participation in multiemployer pension plans, requirements to make contributions to other benefit plans, and the potential for strikes, work slowdowns or similar activities, and union-organizing drives; (16) if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be negatively impacted, which could harm our operating results and investors’ perceptions of our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock; (17) our business may be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions; (18) catastrophic events, disasters, and terrorist attacks could disrupt our services; and (19) actions of activist investors could disrupt our business. The list of factors above is illustrative and by no means exhaustive. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties we face is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2017 and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including all amendments to those reports). We urge readers to consider these risks and uncertainties in evaluating our We caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any such , which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any , whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement ABM’s consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted share as adjusted for items impacting comparability, for the first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends as well as ABM’s operational performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the first quarter of fiscal years 2018 and 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods.

(a) The Company adjusts income from continuing operations to exclude the impact of certain items that are unusual, non-recurring, or otherwise do not reflect management's views of the underlying operational results and trends of the Company.\n(b) Represents adjustments to our self-insurance reserve for general liability, workers’ compensation and automobile claims related to prior period accident years. Management believes these prior period reserve changes do not illustrate the performance of the Company’s normal ongoing operations given the current year's insurance expense is estimated by management in conjunction with the Company's outside actuary to take into consideration past history and current costs and regulatory trends. Once the Company develops its best estimate of insurance expense premiums for the year, the Company fully allocates such costs out to the business leaders to hold them accountable for the current year costs within operations. However, since these prior period reserve changes relate to claims that could date back many years, current management has limited ability to influence the ultimate development of the prior year changes. Accordingly, including the prior period reserve changes in the Company's current operational results would not depict how the business is run as the Company holds its management accountable for the current year’s operational performance.
