Has the reaction function of the Fed changed or will it change under Powell?”\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, was last at 2.8898 percent after spiking as much as 2.9250 percent on Tuesday.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a measure of short-term stock market volatility, rose to a session high 18.93.\nA string of retail earnings drove gains in the S&P retail index, which was up 0.87 percent.\nShares of Booking Holdings, which rose 9.4 percent after the company reported a better-than-expected profit, was the biggest driver on the index.\nOnline retailer Etsy jumped 18 percent after its revenue beat estimates, and off-price apparel seller TJX rose 6.5 percent after reporting upbeat same-store sales.\nLowe’s fell 6.6 percent after the No.2 home improvement chain’s quarterly profit and margins missed estimates.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,456 to 1,319.
