Hall, who missed three games with a thumb injury, has scored in 25 straight games overall.\nSami Vatanen also scored a goal and Cory Schneider had 24 saves for New Jersey (33-25-8), which lost its third straight game and for the fifth time in seven games.\nAfter a scoreless first period which featured a handful of highlight-reel saves by Fleury, the teams combined for five goals in the second period. Perron started the scoring when he bounced in a rebound from the slot of a Jon Merrill blast from the left point for his 16th goal of the season.\nNew Jersey tied it four minutes later on Vatanen’s one-timer off a pass from Hall that beat Fleury on his glove side. Engelland, with help from a screen by Tomas Nosek, then rifled in a shot from the top of the right circle for his fourth goal of the season.\nTatar, acquired in a trade with the Detroit Red Wings on Monday, increased the Vegas lead to 3-1 when he sent a rebound of a Perron shot in off Schneider’s glove for his first goal with the Golden Knights and 17th of the season. But Hall answered just 12 seconds later with his 30th, stealing the puck from defenseman Colin Miller behind the net and quickly scoring on a wraparound through Fleury’s pads.\nNew Jersey pulled Schneider with 1:40 left but managed just two shots, the last one on a one-timer from the left circle by Kyle Palmieri just before the final buzzer that Fleury blocked.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:18:07.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
