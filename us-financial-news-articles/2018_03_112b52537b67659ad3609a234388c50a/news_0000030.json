Doctors prescribed a beta blocker to calm his nerves and Antabuse, a drug that would keep him from drinking. \n“I was in shock, and I stayed in shock for a long time,” Hammond told the Post . “Everything wiped out. The brand, me, what I do. Corporate appearances canceled. It was a hell of a shock, and all of it was apparent to me in one breath. That ends me.” \nLorne Michaels, creator and producer of SNL , said the change was made to reflect who Trump became on the campaign, versus The Apprentice- era Trump Hammond perfected. The decision paid off in the ratings . Last season’s premiere brought the show 11.8 million viewers, the most it has had in over 20 years. \nEven Hammond (who is still with SNL , now as the show’s announcer), acknowledges the logic behind Michaels’ decision, though he still seems upset over losing the role. \n“You’re not running the March of Dimes,” he told the Post . “You’re kind of running a business empire. When things happen it’s hard for it not be personal, but sometimes it isn’t.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T21:28:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
