The Uber Freight app seeks users and trucks that are already hauling freight, however, and most of those are in high demand in a U.S. shipping market that’s weighed down by a lack of drivers to handle big rigs.\nAnalysts say Uber Freight needs scale in its services to attract business and compete in a market crowded with freight brokers—companies that match industrial shipments to trucks and drivers looking for freight loads. But it needs more truck drivers on its app in order to gain that scale.\n“It’s all about getting capacity,” said Evan Armstrong, president of logistics-consulting firm Armstrong & Associates. “You never want to have to turn down a load to a customer because you can’t find a truck.”\n‘ You never want to have to turn down a load to a customer because you can’t find a truck. ’\n—Evan Armstrong, Armstrong & Associates. In an effort to attract drivers, Uber Freight this week launched an incentive program offering discounts on fuel, tires, maintenance and the purchase of new and used vehicles. Drivers who use the Uber Freight app to book a load at least once a month are eligible for the discounts under agreements Uber struck with various service providers.\nUber Freight also touts its ability to pay drivers quickly—”within a few days,” according to Eric Berdinis, product manager for the app.\nMr. Armstrong said the speed with which Uber can pay its drivers can be a key factor in a competitive market. “That’s one thing they have to do, a quick-pay operation where they pay drivers in a fast fashion, especially with carrier capacity being so tight,” he said.\nDiscount incentives like Uber Freight’s new “Plus” program are already offered by other brokers or through membership in the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association, analysts said.\nA general shortage of truck capacity in the U.S. was exacerbated late last year when a federal rule went into effect requiring drivers’ hours on the road be tracked electronically through devices installed in their cabs. At the same time, strong consumer and industrial activity has kept freight networks busy, leading to capacity constraints and higher shipping costs as truckers raised freight rates.\nAlso in Logistics\nTrucking Acquisitions Put New Spotlight on Fleet Values March 20, 2018 KeepTruckin Raises $50 Million to Back Truck Technology Expansion March 20, 2018 Chinese Shipyards See Surge in Orders, Margins Remain Thin March 19, 2018 Knight-Swift Buys Trucker Abilene Motor Express March 16, 2018 Uber is looking to crack into a U.S. freight transportation management market that Armstrong & Associates estimates was worth about $62 billion in 2016. The business includes a handful of operators that handle billions of dollars of business annually, including C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., XPO Logistics Inc. and Echo Global Logistics Inc. But a large share of shipments is handled by hundreds of small freight brokers that may have only a handful of employees.\nThe larger operators are investing heavily in technology, including apps for smartphones that function like Uber’s app. Greenwich, Conn.-based XPO this week said it had extended capabilities for its load-matching app to Europe.\nUber Freight launched in Texas about a year ago and has expanded to all 48 of the lower U.S. states. The company says 70% to 80% of its freight is on routes under 500 miles.\n“Just as Uber was able to provide opportunities for drivers to go out on their own and be in control of their earnings, we see the same kind of trend happening in the freight industry,” Mr. Berdinis said.\nWrite to Erica E.
