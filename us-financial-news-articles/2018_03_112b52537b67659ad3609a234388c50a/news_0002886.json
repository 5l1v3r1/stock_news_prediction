The important message we try to put across to ministers is we are only a year away now; the clock’s running pretty fast,” Williams said in a video conveyed to Airbus’s 14,000 UK staff via YouTube.\nDue to long lead times, Airbus is facing immediate decisions on whether to increase spending on parts in order to build up an extra buffer stock to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019, he said.
