The brokerage has an “outperform” rating on the stock with a target price of 170 pence.\nAnalysts at Peel Hunt, who raised their 2018 forecasts by 10 percent, said CMC’s latest statement emphasises the strength of its platform. They expect to see a re-rating in CMC shares as the current regulatory overhang dissipates.\nReporting by Noor Zainab Hussain and Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T12:53:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
