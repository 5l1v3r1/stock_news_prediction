It looks to influence from within, often seeking board positions at the businesses in which it invests.\nIn January, Autoliv reported fourth-quarter earnings above expectations, and forecast underlying sales would grow faster than analysts’ expect in 2018 as it starts to deliver on the order boom of recent years.\n“This is an extremely well-run company, with strong cashflow and good profitability,” said Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau, who has an“accumulate” rating on Autoliv.\n“But Cevian seem to be viewing this in the same way that we do, that this split is not fully discounted and that further value will be created.”\nReporting by Johannes Hellstrom Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:36:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
