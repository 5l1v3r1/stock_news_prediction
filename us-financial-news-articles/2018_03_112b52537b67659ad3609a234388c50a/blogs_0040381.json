The three-year mapping effort showed plastic pollution in the world's oceans is \"increasing exponentially\" since measurements began in 1970.\n\"We were surprised by the amount of large plastic objects we encountered,\" Julia Reisser, chief scientist of the study, said in a statement. \"We used to think most of the debris consists of small fragments, but this new analysis shines a new light on the scope of the debris.\"\nThe patch is not a solid mass of plastic. Nonetheless, it includes 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic and its weight is thought to be the equivalent of 500 jumbo jets.\nScientific Reports, The Ocean Cleanup The results, published today in Scientific Reports, reveal that the GPGP, defined as the area with more than 10 kg of plastic per km2, measures 1.6 million square kilometers, three times the size of continental France. Of the estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, microplastics — small plastic pieces less than 5 millimeters long — accounted for about 8 percent of the total trash afloat an area of 1.6 million square kilometers.\nThe study's use of boats and aerial surveys could help to explain why the latest estimates are much higher than in the past. Nonetheless, rapidly increasing levels of plastic pollution in recent years is also likely to be a significant factor.\nOn Wednesday, the Foresight Future of the Sea Report forecast the amount of plastic in the world's oceans could be set to triple over the next decade unless litter is curbed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T17:12:22.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
