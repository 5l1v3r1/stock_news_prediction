The population of the province is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while Iran is mostly Shi’ite.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T16:27:01.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
