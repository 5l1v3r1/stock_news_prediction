Edited by the Center's Director of Academic Initiatives, Charles Chaffin, Ed.D., it is available in bookstores and through major online retailers. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (NYSE: JWA and JWB), the book is the second in a series for faculty, students, practitioners, and researchers who work within the profession or discipline of financial planning.\n\"Client Psychology marries multiple academic disciplines to define a path forward for new client research and most importantly, helping financial planning practice become more client-centered,\" said Dr. Chaffin. \"Client Psychology defines an entirely new area of research and practice, builds upon the financial planning body of knowledge, and is a practical resource for students and practitioners.\"\nThe 336-page book explores the biases, behaviors, and perceptions that impact client decision-making and overall financial well-being. Informed by research from practitioners, it outlines the theory behind many of these areas while also explicitly stating how they directly impact financial planning practice.\nThis book is the second in a series. Over the next four years, the series will include a number of content areas within and beyond financial planning, helping to expand the body of knowledge for practitioners while fueling research and preparing the next generation of financial planners to serve the public.\nABOUT CFP BOARD\nThe mission of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. is to benefit the public by granting the CFP ® certification and upholding it as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.
