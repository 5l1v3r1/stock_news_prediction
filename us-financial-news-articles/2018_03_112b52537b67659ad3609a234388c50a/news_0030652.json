For a reconciliation of Pro-Forma Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income/(loss) and discussion of why we consider Pro-Forma Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures, see the financial tables accompanying this release and the paragraph below entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nWeldon Spangler, Chief Executive Officer of Papa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc., stated, “While we continue to be disappointed with reported comparable store sales performance, I am pleased with the progress we made in the fourth quarter against our new strategic initiatives, and the sequential improvement we’ve begun to see in our business. We are confident that we will return this brand to growth and profitability through our initiatives designed to improve both convenience and relevance to consumers. We believe the consumer-facing initiatives we are pursuing, including the transition to Olo’s digital platform and the rollout of delivery, as well as the work we’re doing on brand positioning and messaging, will complement our continuing initiatives focused on serving our franchise owners, and building internal people-capability and process. We expect these efforts to drive positive brand momentum in 2018 and beyond.”\nSpangler added, “Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter we entered into preliminary agreements to refranchise stores in three markets to existing franchise owner groups and expect the transactions to close in the second and third quarters. We continue to pursue additional refranchising transactions as we return to a 95% franchise system, and expect to have no more than 60 company-operated stores by the end of the year.”\nKey Operating Metrics\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended January 1, 2018 January 2, 2017 January 1, 2018 January 2, 2017 Domestic comparable store sales: Franchised stores -2.6 % -7.5 % -3.8 % -5.0 % Company-owned stores -2.3 % -11.1 % -5.5 % -7.3 % Combined -2.6 % -7.8 % -4.0 % -5.2 % System-wide sales ($’s in 000s) $ 223,815 $ 247,287 $ 846,864 $ 898,709 Adjusted EBITDA ($’s in 000s) $ 9,338 $ 7,228 $ 19,844 $ 21,696 Store Count Franchised 1,338 1,369 1,338 1,369 Company-owned 145 168 145 168 International 40 40 40 40 System-wide 1,523 1,577 1,523 1,577 We use a variety of operating and performance metrics to evaluate the performance of our business. Below is a description of our key operating metrics:\nComparable Store Sales represents the change in year-over-year sales for domestic comparable stores. A comparable store is a store that has been open for at least 52 full weeks from the comparable date (the Tuesday following the opening date). As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, we had 1,443 and 1,434 domestic comparable stores, respectively.\nSystem-wide Sales include net sales by all of our company-owned and franchisee-owned stores.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest expense, provision for (benefit from) income taxes and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments to reflect the elimination of various expenses that we consider not indicative of ongoing operations. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income/(loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the financial tables accompanying this release.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nBased on current information, Papa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc. is offering the following guidance for fiscal 2018, which ends on December 31, 2018:\nDomestic system-wide comparable store sales growth flat to low single digits, including a low single digit decline in Q1; Year-End Company-owned store count no more than 60 units; Domestic franchise new store openings of approximately 10 units; Selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $26 million, excluding expected non-recurring costs totaling around $3.8 million; Adjusted EBITDA of at least $21 million; Cash Used in Investing Activities of no more than $1 million; Cash Flow from Operations less Cash Used in Investing Activities of around $12 million, exclusive of dispute resolution payments of approximately $4 million; Full-year effective book tax rate of approximately 25.5%; and Diluted share-count of approximately 16.9 million.\nNote that the 2018 Financial Outlook does not reflect the effects of two new accounting standards (ASC topic 606 – Revenue from contracts with customers and ASC topic 842 – Leases) that we expect to adopt for 2018 financial reporting or the refranchising of Company-owned stores in the year. We expect to update the financial outlook to reflect the full impact of these accounting changes when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and will update the financial outlook for the effects of refranchising when we have greater certainty around specific deal points and timing.\nConference Call\nPapa Murphy’s Holdings, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter financial results on Wednesday, March 14, 2018 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time.

Forward-looking statements give the Company's current expectations and projections relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “guidance,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “confident,” “may,” “should,” “can have,” “likely,” “future” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events.\nForward-looking statements in this press release include statements relating to the Company’s projected comparable stores sales growth or decline, projected Company-owned store count, projected new store openings, projected selling, general and administrative expenses, including projected non-recurring costs, projected Adjusted EBITDA, projected refranchising activities, projected cash used in investing activities, projected cash flow from operations, projected effective tax rate, projected diluted share count, and future financial or operational results and business strategy, including the expected effects of our strategic initiatives.\nAny such are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company's control) and assumptions. Although the Company believes any are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any . Please refer to the risk factors discussed in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2018 (which can be found at the SEC’s website www.sec.gov ); each such risk factor is specifically incorporated into this press release. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company's actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in any .\nAny forward-looking statement made by the Company in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company is also providing with this press release the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro-Forma Net Income are not derived in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income should not be considered by the reader as an alternative to net (loss) income (the most comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income). The Company’s management believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro-Forma Net Income are helpful as indicators of the current financial performance of the Company because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro-Forma Net Income reflect the additions and eliminations of various income statement items that management does not consider indicative of ongoing operating results. We have provided reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro-Forma Net Income to GAAP net (loss) income in the financial tables accompanying this release.\nThe Company is also providing with this press release a forward looking estimate of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA. We do not, however, provide a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying various adjustments that are necessary for this reconciliation and, accordingly, the reconciling information cannot be obtained without unreasonable effort.\nPAPA MURPHY’S HOLDINGS, INC.
