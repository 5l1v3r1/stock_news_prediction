Sales of physical media declined 4% in 2017 from the year before, while digital downloads took a much larger 25% drop, according to the RIAAs recently-released 2017 year-end report . \nMeanwhile, paid music subscriptions to services like Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and Tidal grew 50% in 2017. That increase in streaming was enough to help the music industry report a 16.5% overall increase in sales to $8.7 billion, marking the first time since 1999 that U.S. music revenues grew materially for two years in a row. \nThat said, the music industry is still a long way from its zenith. While its 2017 revenue numbers matched its sales in 2008, it is still 40% below peak levels.
