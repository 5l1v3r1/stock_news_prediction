This must happen at speed and scale. Businesses that are able to find the right balance of technology, talent and human connection will be those that will succeed in this Skills Revolution.\"\nOf over 59,000 employers surveyed across 44 countries and territories, confidence levels have strengthened year-on-year in 25 countries, weakened in 13 and remained the same in five.\nGlobal Hiring Plans by Region\nEMEA: Staffing levels are expected to grow in 25 of 26 countries surveyed in the EMEA region, with the only negative Outlook across all countries and territories surveyed reported in Italy (-1).\nEmployers reporting the strongest Outlooks are in Croatia (+29) (added to the global survey for the first time**) followed by Hungary (+18), Greece (+16) and Turkey (+16) In the Netherlands, jobseekers can expect the strongest hiring prospects in ten years (+8) led by growth in the Construction sector In Germany, employers are reporting the strongest hiring intentions in six years (+8) driven by strong demand for skilled Manufacturing workers as companies undergo digital transformation In the UK, employers have recorded their most optimistic jobs forecast in over a year. Job prospects look bright in the Hospitality sector, up fourteen points since this time last year, with employers looking to fill vacancies ahead of Brexit in an industry that is heavily dependent on immigration The Outlook in France (+4) increases two percentage points quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The strongest forecast comes from large employers with those in Construction reporting some of the most optimistic Outlooks In Italy employment levels are forecast to decline in six of the ten industry sectors surveyed as employers adopted a watch and wait approach in anticipation of the general election which took place in early March\nAsia Pacific: Employers in all eight countries and territories expect staffing levels to increase with hiring sentiment strongest in Taiwan (+26), followed closely by Japan (+24). The most cautious Outlook in the region is reported in China (+8).\nHiring confidence in Japan remains strong and stable with employers reporting the most optimistic forecast since 2007 for the second quarter in a row Despite the positive uptick in India's hiring intentions over the past two quarters, confidence has fallen as employers report an Outlook of +16, down five percentage points quarter-over-quarter China's subdued hiring pace continues at the same level for the third consecutive quarter but improves four percentage points from Q2 2017.
