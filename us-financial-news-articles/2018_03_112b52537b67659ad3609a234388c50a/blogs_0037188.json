The survey was brought to the attention of longtime Nike CEO Mark Parker , who initiated a formal review that resulted in the resignation of two top-ranking executives.\nRich Lam/Getty Images A soccer fan grabs a shoe at The Nike Underground, a pop-up experience in downtown Vancouver. Last week, Parker sent an internal memo to staff announcing that Trevor Edwards, the president of Nike Brand and possibly Parker's eventual successor, would be leaving the company in August. In the memo, obtained by The Wall Street Journal , Parker wrote that Edwards' departure followed reports of \"behavior occurring within our organization that do not reflect our core values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment.\"\nParker also called the employees who chose to come forward \"strong and courageous.\" Nike declined to comment to CNBC Make It on the situation.\nAccording to regulatory filings reported by Bloomberg , Edwards will receive $525,000 over the year following his departure, due to a noncompete agreement.\nLLUIS GENE/AFP/Getty Images Trevor Edwards More recently , Nike announced that Jayme Martin , vice president of global categories and Edwards' top lieutenant, would also be resigning.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Edwards and Martin are accused of protecting male employees who demeaned women and bullied individuals from foreign countries.\nGeneral Counsel Hilary Krane and EVP of Human Resources Monique Matheson are the only female members of Nike's nine-person executive team , and Elizabeth Comstock and Michelle Peluso are the only women on Nike's 13-person board of directors .\nParker has selected Nike veteran Elliott Hill to take over for Edwards.\nLike this story?
