Amazon is also tracking how the Kohl's partnership affects its own business, he said.\nAnd if Kohl's were to ever consider expanding the Amazon capabilities to its 1,000-plus stores, the partnership would have to be mutually beneficial, he added.\n\"It has to work for them as well,\" Mansell told Cramer. \"I'm sure they have their own criteria that they're looking at to see whether or not it's a success. But I think the core idea, which is to come up with innovative ways to drive more people into our stores, that's the big idea.\"\nMansell also acknowledged that Amazon products and returns are far from the only things driving traffic into Kohl's stores.\nWith the windfall from the tax overhaul, Kohl's has started investing more in its omni-channel strategy and testing \"flexible formats\" at its locations by filling vacant real estate with grocery or convenience stores, the CEO said.\nThe company has also been able to stave off closing stores like many of its competitors because its stores are located outside of the mall.\nOn the consumer side, Kohl's has also seen increased interest in its health and wellness offerings, including but not limited to activewear brands Nike, Adidas and Under Armour.\n\"Health and wellness is big throughout the store,\" Mansell said. \"We know that that's how America wants to live in the future, and if we can become the destination for active and wellness, we think we've got a long-term strategy.\"\nWatch Kevin Mansell's full interview here: show chapters Kohl's CEO says 'big idea' behind Amazon partnership is driving traffic 21 Hours Ago | 09:32 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Amazon.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
