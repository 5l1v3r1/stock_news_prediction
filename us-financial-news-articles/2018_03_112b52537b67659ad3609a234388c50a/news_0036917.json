Subsequent to the merger, the current offices of Premier will continue to operate as “Premier Community Bank of Florida, a division of National Bank of Commerce” under Premier’s existing management team. The transaction is expected to result in a combined institution with approximately $3.4 billion in assets.\n“We are excited to announce the merger with Premier,” said Richard Murray, IV, President and Chief Executive Officer of NCC and NBC. “We have known Jim Kuhlman and followed his career for several years, and we look forward to the opportunity to work with him and his team to build a great company together. We believe Premier’s growing core deposit base, led by its community/homeowners’ association deposit business and core banking business, will be of great value to our company.”\nJames F. Kuhlman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Premier, also commented on the announcement, saying, “We are very pleased to announce our affiliation with NCC and NBC. We believe that this combination will allow us to better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and communities through greater size, strength and decentralized structure. The continued use of the Premier Community Bank name is a strong commitment to the latter.”\nUnder the terms of the definitive agreement, each share of common stock of Premier issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.4218 shares of NCC common stock and $0.93 in cash. Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Premier common stock will be assumed by NCC and become an option to purchase shares of NCC common stock, with the exercise price and number of shares underlying the option adjusted according to a conversion ratio of 0.4440. NCC expects the transaction to result in minimal tangible book value per share dilution, with an expected earn-back period of less than one year.\nThe boards of directors of NCC, NBC and Premier have approved the transaction.
