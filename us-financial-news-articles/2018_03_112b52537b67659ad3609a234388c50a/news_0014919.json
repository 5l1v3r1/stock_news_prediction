On February 8, 2017, Goldman Sachs increased its equity commitment to Restore West, LLC's Multifamily Acquisition Fund to $27 million, enabling Restore West to significantly increase its acquisitions and improve affordable housing throughout the Wasatch Front. Restore West will also be expanding its multifamily acquisition effort this year into Arizona, Colorado, Idaho and Nevada.\nOver the past five years, Restore West and Goldman Sachs have invested over $150 million to acquire and renovate over 500 single-family homes and eight multifamily properties totaling over 450 units.
