Smurfit Kappa, Europe’s largest producer of paper-based packaging, said on Tuesday that its shareholders would receive a combination of cash and a minority holding in the combined business under International Paper’s proposal. “The Board of Smurfit Kappa has unanimously rejected this unsolicited and highly opportunistic Proposal. It does not reflect the Group’s true intrinsic business worth or its prospects. We strongly advise shareholders to take no action,” Smurfit Kappa chairman Liam O’Mahony said in a statement.
