Ahmed Hamed was part of a group that crossed illegally into Hungary on Sept. 16, 2015 and also spoke to the crowd using a loudspeaker before hundreds of migrants forced open the border gate and police fired water cannon and teargas. A Reuters photographer in the courtroom at the court in the southern town of Szeged said the man, who was guarded by masked police, received the sentence calmly.
