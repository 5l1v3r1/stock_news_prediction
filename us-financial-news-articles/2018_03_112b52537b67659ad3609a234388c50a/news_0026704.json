(NASDAQ:PRPO), announced today it has settled its lawsuit with Crede Capital Group LLC, restructuring the final substantial liability of legacy payables inherited as part of the merger with Transgenomic in June 2017. These liabilities have been reduced from approximately $19 million at the merger, to approximately $7 million (a reduction of close to 65%).\nAs part of the settlement, Precipio will pay to Crede a total of $1.925 million over a period of 15 months, with most payments payable at Precipio’s option either in cash, stock, or as a combination of both.\nWith this settlement, close to 95% of the $19 million in legacy liabilities inherited as part of the merger with Transgenomic in June 2017 will have been settled.\nPurchase Price of the Merger\nPrior to the merger, Transgenomic had in excess of $19 million in legacy liabilities, which was owed to approximately 300 creditors. Because the merger was executed as a stock swap, the $19 million of liabilities comprised the largest portion of the purchase price of Transgenomic, which was assumed by the surviving entity, Precipio, Inc.\nResumption of Business Growth\nFollowing considerable negotiation, the predominance of the debt has been restructured with a remaining balance of approximately $7 million, a substantial portion of which will be paid over the next four years.\nPrecipio’s management has been adamant about addressing these legacy liabilities in a manner equitable both to creditors and to Precipio’s shareholders, to enable Precipio’s long term growth.\nPrecipio and the vast majority of those creditors have successfully reached settlements that enabled the company to balance paying off the cash component of the merger, while preserving resources to complete the merger and grow the business. Q4-2017 represented a turning point for the Company when it was able to resume business growth after a post-merger restructuring period.\n“This is an important milestone because it signifies an end to the restructuring phase and a return to focus entirely on business growth. I would like to thank all the creditors for their willingness to work with us to arrive at settlements that enable them to receive some form of recovery, while enabling the company to grow.” commented Ilan Danieli, Precipio’s CEO. “Furthermore, our financial team has worked diligently to achieve settlements that have significantly reduced the inherited liabilities from the merger. Arriving at successful settlements such as this one will allow management to fully focus time and resources on growth of the business.” concluded Mr. Danieli.\nAbout Precipio\nPrecipio has built a platform designed to eradicate the problem of misdiagnosis by harnessing the intellect, expertise and technology developed within academic institutions and delivering quality diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide.
