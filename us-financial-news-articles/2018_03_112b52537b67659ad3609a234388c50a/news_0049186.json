Riley FBR in Boston.\n“In general, the market is trapped between two narratives.”\nThe yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to seven-week lows of 2.7662 percent on rising demand for safe havens.\nEconomic data released on Thursday did little to change the expectations on interest rate hikes.\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in February, after a 0.3 percent advance in January. Core PCE, the Federal Reserve’s favored gauge of inflation, rose 1.6 percent on an annualized basis, in line with economists’ expectations.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in January.\nAt 8:35 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 75 points, S&P 500 e-minis rose 9.25 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 38.5 points.\nThe S&P 500 is down 2.56 percent and the Dow 3.5 percent, on track for their worst quarterly performances in more than two years.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq’s slim 0.66 percent rise is keeping it on course for its seventh straight quarter of gains.\nGameStop shares fell 10.8 percent after the company provided disappointing full-year sales forecast.
