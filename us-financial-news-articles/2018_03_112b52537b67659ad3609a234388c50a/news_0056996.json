That has led to market volatility and we’ll see more of that,” said Mark Esposito, president of Esposito Securities LLC.\nGlobal investors have cut their equity exposure to a four-month low in March, while reducing their holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years, spooked by trade tensions and the rout in technology sector.\nAt 11:03 a.m. ET, the Dow was up 1.19 percent at 24,131.76, the S&P 500 gained 1.18 percent to 2,635.85 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.37 percent at 7,044.63.\nTrading volumes were light, ahead of the long Easter weekend.\nEconomic data released on Thursday did little to change the expectations of interest rate hikes.\nCore personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge, rose 1.6 percent on an annualized basis through February, in line with economists’ expectations.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in January.\nAmazon fell more than 1 percent after President Donald Trump blasted the company with a list of complaints, a day after news website Axios reported that Trump wants to rein in the company’s growing power using federal antitrust laws.\nGameStop shares fell 10.8 percent after the company provided disappointing full-year sales forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 4.32-to-1 ratio and for a 3.34-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
