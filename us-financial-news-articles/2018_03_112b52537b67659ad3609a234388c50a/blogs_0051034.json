Certainly the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, wouldn't you say?\" Trump said to an audience in Ohio.\n\"And we'll see how it all turns out. If it's no good, we're walking, and if it's good, we will embrace it,\" Trump said. \"South Korea has been wonderful, but we're probably going to hold that deal up for a little while, and see how it all plays out.\"\nU.S. diplomats have emphasized that any tete-a-tete between the president and North Korean leader Kim would be simply a meeting, and not a formal negotiation on North Korea's weapons program or its long-term status in the global trade and banking systems, where it remains under heavy sanctions.\nBut Trump suggested in tweets Wednesday that there was a \"good chance\" of achieving \"peace and denuclearization\" with Kim.\nTRUMP TWEET\nTRUMP TWEET\nThe deal outlined by U.S. officials on Tuesday would effectively cut South Korea's steel exports to the U.S. by about 30 percent.

The two nations also reached a side deal aimed at deterring competitive currency devaluation by South Korea.\n\"We've redone it, and it's going to level the playing field on steel and cars and trucks coming into this country,\" Trump said Thursday.\nThe president was giving remarks at an event to push his infrastructure plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T21:52:19.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
