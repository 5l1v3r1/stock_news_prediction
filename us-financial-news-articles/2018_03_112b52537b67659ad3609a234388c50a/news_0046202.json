And the strength in the fixing drove the spot yuan higher.\nThe onshore yuan opened at 6.2579 per dollar and surged to a high of 6.2523 at one point in early trade, the strongest level since Feb. 7.\nThe spot yuan rate was trading at 6.2646 as of 0152 GMT, 161 pips firmer than the previous late session close and 0.27 percent stronger than the midpoint.\nReporting by Winni Zhou and John Ruwitch; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T08:39:08.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
