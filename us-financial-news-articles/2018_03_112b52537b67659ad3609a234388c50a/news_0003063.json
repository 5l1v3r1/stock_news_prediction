There have been no new accusations since then.\n“These are things of the past and we want to clearly separate the past from the present and defend the Ministry’s point of view that we are doing things correctly and transparently,” he said.\nThe ministry sent information clarifying the nature of the new accusations to trade partners and instituting certain “self embargos” as precautionary measures, he said. On Monday, the ministry suspended operations at four BRF plants.\nAmong plans to continue overhauling and modernizing the Brazil food safety system, the country is carrying out a plan to centralize inspections of slaughterhouses, Maggi said. Brazil will be divided into 10 regions with slaughterhouses in each region under the authority of an agent from the federal Animal Surveillance and Inspection Services, he said.\nReporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:58:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
