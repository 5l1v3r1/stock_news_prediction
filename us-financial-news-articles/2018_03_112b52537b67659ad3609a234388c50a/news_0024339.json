But the directors of Wynn Resorts were not powerless…They were the only people with the knowledge and ability – and the duty to the company – to investigate and stop Steve Wynn’s misconduct. They chose, instead, to be complicit with Steve Wynn and use company resources to attempt to cover up his behavior out of self-interest.”\nA Wall Street Journal article from late January revealed that Wynn paid a $7.5 million settlement to a former employee who alleged Wynn forced her to have sex with him in 2005, spurring dozens of similar accusations.\nThe Board became aware of the settlement sometime after 2009, but did not take action until February 2, 2018, when it announced its own internal investigation headed up by O’Melveny & Myers. When Wynn resigned on February 6, 2018, Wynn Resorts abruptly canceled the investigation and fired O’Melveny.\nWynn Resorts’ stock price plunge 10% as a result of Wynn’s misconduct, and Wynn Resorts also faces ongoing investigations by gaming regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau.\nWhat You Can Do\nIf you are a Wynn Resorts shareholder, you may have legal claims against Wynn Resorts’ directors and officers. If you wish to discuss this investigation, or have questions about your legal rights, please call attorney Amber Eck at 619-342-8000 or e-mail her at ambere@haelaw.com .
