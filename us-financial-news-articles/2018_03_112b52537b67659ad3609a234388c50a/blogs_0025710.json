Noto recently left Twitter to take on a role as CEO of online finance company SoFi.\nNow, Twitter is focused on what drew Segal to the company in the first place: helping its users find out what's happening in the world that's important to them.\nEven so, Segal admitted that he never expected to see headlines like \" Rex Tillerson learned he was fired from President Trump's tweet \" before he joined the company.\n\"When I see Jim Cramer's got a million followers on Twitter and all the news that breaks on Twitter every day, I'm blown away,\" Segal told Cramer. \"It's a lot of what attracted me to the company, a sense of mission that this is where people go to find out what's happening in the world and it's where people go to break news as well.\"\nBut Segal still sees several areas ripe for improvement at Twitter: machine learning, the health of the platform, video engagement and business solutions.\nThe CFO said Twitter still has a lot of work to do in surfacing relevant content for users, whether it's local news or headlines from far away that they still care about.\nThe issue of relevance ties into Twitter's next prerogative: the health of the platform. To that end, Segal said Dorsey has been pushing the removal of trolls and hate-fueled bots that can tarnish and delude conversations on the app.\nTwitter has also been focusing on live, user-generated and professionally produced video content, Segal said.\n\"Video's a big part of the overall strategy,\" he told Cramer. \"If we want to help you know what's happening in the world that you might care about and if we want to help you share what's important to you, video's going to be a big component of it.\"Similarly, it's part of creating the data that we then are able to sell to companies.\"\nMaking companies aware of the value of Twitter will be another leg of the company's mission, the CFO said.\n\"We've got all these local businesses that are on Twitter, but they're not advertising on Twitter the way that they might on other platforms, mostly because we just haven't made it easy for them,\" Segal said. \"We've done a lot of work there recently to create a subscription product for them so that they can advertise easier on Twitter, but there's still a lot of work to do to get more of them on Twitter today.\"\nWatch Ned Segal's full interview here: show chapters Twitter CFO: We have a lot of work to do, but everybody in the world can benefit from our platform      20 Hours Ago | 08:21 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
