(“Glass Lewis”), a leading independent proxy voting advisory firm, has recommended that shareholders vote on the GREEN proxy card and refrain from giving Cornwall Capital Management LP (“Cornwall”) control of the Company's Board of Directors (the “Board”).\nIn reaching this conclusion, Glass Lewis acknowledged the Cornwall nominees’ lack of relevant experience and timberland knowledge, as well as their lack of a detailed strategic plan for the Company. The report also highlights the current board’s “intimate knowledge of the timber industry and the Company’s assets, operations and strategies.” 1 Glass Lewis supported the majority of the Company’s slate, saying:\n\"We don't believe Cornwall has established a sufficient case, nor has it proposed an alternative strategic plan or fully qualified board slate, to justify shareholder support for all three of its board nominees, the election of whom would result in Cornwall's designees gaining majority control of the Keweenaw board.\" Discussing the dissident slate, Glass Lewis notes that, “with two nominees having been either a principal or an advisor of Cornwall in the past, and the other nominee an analyst and portfolio manager at another investment firm, we note that timber or forestry experience is nowhere to be found on the Dissident's slate. Indeed, none of Cornwall's nominees has relevant industry experience.\" “As the board rightly points out, a group of financial experts would seem ill-equipped to formulate or oversee the execution of an alternative timber management strategy or operational strategy for the Company, which likely explains why Cornwall failed to include a detailed timberland strategy in its four-point plan.”\nBrian Glodowski, President and CEO of Keweenaw, said, “We are very pleased that Glass Lewis has recommended that Keweenaw shareholders vote on the Company’s green proxy card and refrain from giving Cornwall control of the Board. Further, we agree with Glass Lewis’ assertion that knowledge of the timber business and Company's assets, operations and strategies are crucial qualifications for the Board. However, while we respect Glass Lewis’ views, we disagree with Glass Lewis’ recommendation to withhold voting for Keweenaw’s highly-qualified nominee, James G. Angelakis. With his strong operational and financial background, Mr. Angelakis is well-positioned to help the Board execute on its strategic plan for the Company. As previously stated, we remain fully committed to seeking the full election of your Company’s slate, and we look forward to continuing to make our case to shareholders in advance of the Annual Meeting.”\nIf you have any questions, or need assistance voting your GREEN proxy card, please contact:\nOkapi Partners LLC\n1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24th Floor New York, NY 10036 Telephone for Banks, Brokers, and International Shareholders: +1 212-297-0720 Shareholders may call toll-free (from the U.S. and Canada): 877-796-5274 Email: info@okapipartners.com\nAbout Keweenaw Land Association, Limited\nKeweenaw is a forest products and land management company located in Ironwood, Michigan.
