The charge came after he was named a customer in a 2016 cocaine ring indictment in New York. Chipotle placed him on leave for a few months before he returned to the job.\nChipotle, which has failed to recover from a series of food safety scares, is seeking to rebuild its business and lure customers back. The Denver-based company recently hired Taco Bell executive Brian Niccol as its new CEO. His first day was March 5.\n\"Mark has been a valued member of our leadership team and played an integral role in shaping and defining the Chipotle brand, and we thank him for his contributions,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC. \"We have a very talented marketing team in place and we'll continue our existing programs while we finalize the plans for a new CMO.\"\nShares of Chipotle slipped nearly 2 percent on Wednesday. \n--CNBC.com contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T17:47:52.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
