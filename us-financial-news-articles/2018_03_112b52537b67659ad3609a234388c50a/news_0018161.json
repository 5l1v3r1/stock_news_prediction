His departure is seen strengthening the hands of those advocating a protectionist agenda.\nAlso driving losses were a set of weak results and forecasts from Dollar Tree and Ross Stores.\nDiscount store operator Dollar Tree slumped 14 percent after reporting disappointing holiday quarter results, while off-price retailer Ross Stores fell 7.4 percent after its full-year profit forecast came in largely below expectations.\nNetflix’s 1.2 percent drop after a “hold” rating from Stifel dragged the S&P consumer discretionary index down 0.84 percent.\nAt 9:32 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 233.36 points, or 0.94 percent, at 24,650.76. The S&P 500 fell 0.69 percent to 2,709.19 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.59 percent to 7,328.45.\nThe ADP’s National Employment Report showed that private employers added 235,000 jobs in February, compared with Reuters estimate of 195,000.\nA more comprehensive report that includes hiring in both public and private sectors is due on Friday.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,005 to 457. On the Nasdaq, 1,765 issues fell and 502 advanced.
