Another market participant said the Templeton fund trimming the KTBs this week isn’t a surprise as the fund has been frequently selling Korean bonds at the end of each quarter as part of its portfolio adjustment. $1 = 1,065.9900 won Reporting by Yena Park, Cynthia Kim", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T10:50:44.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
