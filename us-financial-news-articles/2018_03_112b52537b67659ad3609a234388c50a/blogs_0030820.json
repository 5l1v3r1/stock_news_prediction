So we will expand our ‘black list’ with another group of Americans,” Ryabkov was cited as saying.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam \nHe added that Moscow did not rule out extra measures in response to new sanctions for alleged interfering in U.S. elections and cyber attacks, which Russia denies. \nMoscow still wants to maintain a dialogue with Washington and takes counter-measures due to “American political stubbornness”, RIA cited the diplomat as saying. \n“Those (American) politicians are playing with fire by destroying Russian-American relationship because simultaneously they shake global stability,” Ryabkov said, according to RIA.
