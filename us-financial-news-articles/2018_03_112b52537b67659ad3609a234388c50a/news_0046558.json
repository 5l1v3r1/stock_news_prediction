REUTERS/Eason Lam/File Photo The move comes as FIT Hon Teng seeks a greater presence in new applications like car camera modules that are used in driverless cars, and hopes to tap into markets including medical, Internet-connected devices and green technology. Belkin offers a wide range of consumer electronics products that are sold throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Asia and Europe and, according to FIT Hon Teng, the company has a strong growth potential. “The rapid rise of ‘smart home’ products, and the near-term projections for the market, provide significant additional tailwinds to future growth,” FIT Hon Teng said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Shares in the company were up 1 percent in afternoon trade, in line with the broader index .HSI . FIT Hon Teng raised $342 million in an initial public offering last year and has said it is looking to expand in North America after building a presence in Asia and South America. It is a unit of Foxconn, the world’s largest contract manufacturer and major Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) supplier, which is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd ( 2317.TW ).
