Although 600 other firms it had targeted had yet to act.\nReporting by Simon Jessop; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:16:59.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
