JWN -2.15% experienced their second setback in trying to take the company private on Monday, when a special committee of the board rejected their roughly $8 billion buyout offer as too low.\nThe buyout group, which includes private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, offered $50 a share, a price below the company’s latest closing price. As part of the deal, the group would also buy 21% of the family’s current stake, allowing the heirs to cash out about $550 million of their ownership in the retail chain.\nThe family’s shares are mostly held by Bruce Nordstrom, a grandson of the founder and a former CEO, and his sister Anne Gittinger. The group also includes Bruce’s sons, Blake, Peter and Erik, who hold the title of co-president, and James Nordstrom, their cousin, who is president of stores. Together, the six family members own about one-third of the company’s stock.\nNordstrom shares have traded between $37.79 and $54 over the past 12 months. As recently as 2015, the stock traded above $80 a share but like other retailers investors have soured on the department store operator. It closed Monday at $51.90.\nIn a letter to the special committee dated March 5, the family said its offer represented a 24% premium over the stock’s closing price of $40.48 on June 7, the day before the family announced it would attempt to take the company private. \nThe family said a go-private transaction would give the company the flexibility it needs to “navigate a challenging retail landscape at a critical time when the public market for retail stocks is highly volatile and increasingly focused on short-term results and risks.”\nThe family suspended its efforts in October after failing to raise enough financing for the leveraged buyout ahead of the holidays. \n“This should not be a take under situation,” said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management, which owns nearly 900,000 Nordstrom shares. “It seems like they want to pay a zero premium, and that seems like a tough place from which to negotiate. I would think they would want shareholders to applaud them on their way out the door.”\nThe special committee said it had directed its advisers and company management to not allow the group to conduct further due diligence unless it “promptly and substantially” improves its offer.\nFounded in Seattle in 1901 by a Swedish immigrant, Nordstrom is one of the few department store chains still under family management. The company has been investing heavily to try to adapt to the rise in online shopping . While some of its innovations—including opening a store in Los Angeles that doesn’t actually carry any clothes—have won it kudos from customers, analysts say it’s unclear whether the moves will pay off.\nNordstrom had net income of $437 million on revenue of $15.1 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 3. It ended the period with $2.68 billion in long term debt.\nWrite to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T00:58:09.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
