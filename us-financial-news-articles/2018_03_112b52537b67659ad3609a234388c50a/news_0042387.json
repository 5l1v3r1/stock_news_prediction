REUTERS/Henry Nicholls “There’s now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ actually built Ripon, which is the software that utilised the algorithms from the Facebook data,” Wylie told the British Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\nAggregateIQ told Reuters on March 24 that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.\nIt said it works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements and had never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity.\nCambridge Analytica said on Tuesday that it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data procured by a Cambridge academic with AggregateIQ. It said it had not had any communication with AggregateIQ since December 2015.\nReporting by Alistair Smout, Andy Bruce and Eric Auchard, editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T14:11:50.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
