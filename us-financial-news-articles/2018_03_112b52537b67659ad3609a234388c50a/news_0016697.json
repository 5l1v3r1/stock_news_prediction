If he’s not in the running the market seems to like that.”\nAt 11:29 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 175.23 points, or 0.7 percent, at 24,708.89, the S&P 500 was down 13.03 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,715.09 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.65 points, or 0.23 percent, at 7,355.35.\nWorries over the threat to global trade that U.S. moves would represent have dominated Wall Street trading for almost a week.\nTrump showed no sign of backing down in his first tweet on Wednesday, while China raised its concerns at the World Trade Organization, where 17 other WTO members also voiced misgivings.\nSpokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the White House was on track to announce tariffs by the end of this week.\n“With Cohn’s departure you’ll think it’s going to make it a little bit easier for Trump to push it through,” said Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research.\n“It is a one-day knee jerk reaction because somebody very capable is going to replace Cohn.”\nCohn, the architect of a tax overhaul passed in December, was seen as a stabilizing force within the Trump administration. His departure is seen strengthening the hands of those advocating a protectionist agenda.\nThe losses were broad-based, but shares of manufacturing titans Boeing and Caterpillar were hit hard, slipping about 1 percent on worries about higher input costs and trade barriers outside the United States.\nGeneral Electric dipped 1.54 percent after Deutsche Bank analysts warned of the potential impact from Trump’s planned tariffs on steel and aluminum.
