The weapon is thought to be a BB gun, which is shooting pellets from a vehicle. “[The shooter has] damaged windows, they’ve dented the exterior of the vehicles,” CHP Golden Gate Division Commander Ernest Sanchez told the news site. No injuries have been reported. \nIn order to catch the culprit or culprits, the CHP has deployed decoy buses to patrol Interstate 280. The agency is also getting help from the FBI, as well as offering a $10,000 reward in exchange for information about the person or people responsible. \nApple (aapl) and Google (googl) did not immediately respond to Fortune ‘s request for comment.
