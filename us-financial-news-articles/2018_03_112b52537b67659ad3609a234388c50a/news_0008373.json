REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo Patricio Wills, a TV veteran who has worked with Spanish-language broadcasters Telemundo and Univision, will serve as president of Televisa Studios, the company said in a statement.\nTelevisa, the world’s largest producer of Spanish-language TV programming, launched a revamp of its content production last year.\nPreviously, Wills worked with Televisa to produce the crime drama“The Pilot”, one of the broadcaster’s most successful programs last year. He will report to Isaac Lee, chief content officer for Televisa and Univision.\nLike many broadcasters, Televisa has been grappling with the rise of online streaming services, and suffered a steep drop in advertising revenue last year.\nIn January, longtime chief executive Emilio Azcarraga was succeeded by Alfonso de Angoitia and Bernardo Gomez, who are serving as co-chief executives.\nLast month, the broadcaster announced that it will begin producing original content to be distributed on Amazon.com Inc’s on-demand video streaming service.\nReporting by Julia Love; Editing by Susan Thomas\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:18:13.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
