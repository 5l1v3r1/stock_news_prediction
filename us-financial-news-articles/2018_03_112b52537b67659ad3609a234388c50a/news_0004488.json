(NASDAQ:DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company's revenue grew to $144.4 million, an increase of 6.9% year-over-year.\nOn February 22, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.055 per share per common share payable to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2018, to be paid on April 13, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet Revenue increased 6.9% to $144.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $135.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the 22 centers acquired during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss increased to $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in a non-cash Income Tax expense of $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the reevaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets based on the U.S. Federal Tax Rate of 21.0%.\nSee below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.\nChanges to the Board of Directors\nThe Company is sad to announce the unexpected passing of Wallace E. Olson, a director of the Company since 2002. Mr. Olson formerly served as Chairman of the Board of Directors and was a member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee.\nWilliam C. O’Neil, Jr., a director of the Company since its inception, has notified the Company that he will not stand for re-election at the 2018 annual meeting and will retire from the Board effective immediately after the annual meeting. Mr. O’Neil is currently the chairman of the Compensation Committee and a member of both the Audit Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee. The decision by Mr. O’Neil to retire is not based on any disagreement with the Company.\nEffective March 2, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the size of the Board from seven to eight directors, which coupled with Mr. Olson's death created two vacancies. The Board appointed Ben R. Leedle, Jr. and Leslie K. Morgan as new Directors, effective March 2, 2018, filling the vacancies. Neither Mr. Leedle nor Ms. Morgan has any related party transactions with the Company. Both Mr. Leedle and Ms. Morgan, along with the other directors except for Mr. O'Neil, will be presented to the shareholders for election as directors at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.\nMs. Morgan, age 40, is the general partner of the Olson Family Partnership, is Wallace Olson's daughter, and is the co-founder of CareAssist, Inc., a licensed personal support services agency that provides non-medical home care in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She and her husband founded the company in 2008. Prior to joining CareAssist, Ms. Morgan was a benefits consultant with Unum and a securities associate with A.G. Edwards, both in Chattanooga Tennessee. Ms. Morgan earned her B.S. from University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2002.\nMr. Leedle, age 57, is currently the CEO of Blue Zones, LLC, a health innovation company dedicated to creating healthy communities across the United States. Mr. Leedle served as Chief Executive Officer of Healthways, Inc. (now Tivity Health, Inc.) from September 2003 until May 2015. He is also engaged as strategic advisor, director, and investor for several companies including BeHealth Solutions, a digital therapeutics company, Equality Health, a health plan for disparate populations, and Health Velocity Capital, a health technology and services innovation partner to entrepreneurs and investors.​\nCEO Remarks\nCommenting on changes to the Board of Directors, Kelly Gill, Diversicare's CEO, stated, “We are deeply saddened to announce the unexpected passing of our dear friend Wally, who has been a long-time supporter of the Company and an active Board Member. Additionally, we thank Bill for his many years of service to the Company. He has been a great advocate of the Company since its inception in 1994 and we will miss his contributions to the Board. We are excited to have Leslie and Ben join the Board and are confident that their experiences and backgrounds will make both of them strong additions to our Board at this critical time for our company. We believe they will provide valuable insight as we continue to grow as a company.\"\nCommenting on the results, Kelly Gill stated, \"For the quarter we faced challenges widely seen in the industry related to skilled mix and occupancy; however, we made strides to limit the impact of these headwinds on our financial and operational performance.\"\nMr. Gill noted, \"Our reported results for the fourth quarter of 2017 reflect a significant one-time non-cash income tax expense of $5.5 million related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We anticipate the new legislation to be beneficial, and future tax savings will be invested back into the Company to strengthen current operational and financial results, as well as fund our growth.\"\nMr. Gill continued, \"We continue to make overall progress across the Company with our quality of care outcomes measured under the 5 Star Rating System. I am particularly pleased to see an improvement in quality for the centers we acquired in 2016. As a key focus of our investment strategy, we continue to make ongoing investments in our newly acquired centers, which demonstrates our repeated ability to drive value into underperforming properties.\"\nMr. Gill highlighted, \"Our acquisitions from 2017 and 2016 have proved to be accretive, contributing $188.2 million of revenue during 2017, and EBITDA grew by 86.2% to $19.2 million compared to 2016.\"\nMr. Gill concluded, \"Once again I am very thankful for our dedicated and hardworking team members, who are the driving force behind the seamless transitions of newly acquired centers and the success of overall portfolio.\"\nOther Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2017\nThe following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Skilled nursing occupancy 79.7% 80.3% As a percent of total census: Medicare census 10.6% 11.4% Managed Care census 4.1% 3.2% As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 24.7% 26.9% Medicaid revenues 53.7% 52.4% Managed Care revenues 7.6% 6.2% Average rate per day: Medicare $ 457.02 $ 458.47 Medicaid $ 178.29 $ 173.05 Managed Care $ 374.25 $ 373.98\nPatient Revenues\nPatient revenues were $144.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $135.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Golden Living operations in Alabama and Mississippi during the fourth quarter of 2016 and Park Place during the third quarter of 2017. The following table summarizes the revenue increases attributable to our portfolio growth (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Change Same-store revenue $ 97,294 $ 97,827 $ (533 ) 2016 acquisition revenue 44,764 37,173 7,591 2017 acquisition revenue 2,309 — 2,309 Total revenue $ 144,367 $ 135,000 $ 9,367 The overall increase in revenue of $9.4 million is primarily attributable to the incremental increase in revenues from the 2016 acquisitions of $7.6 million. Additionally, the Park Place acquisition in the third quarter of 2017 contributed $2.3 million in revenues. The increase from the acquisition activity was partially offset by a decrease in same-store revenue of $0.5 million which is explained in more detail below.\nThe average Medicaid rate per patient day for same-store nursing centers in 2017 increased 3.8% compared to 2016, resulting in an increase in revenue of $1.8 million. This average rate per day for Medicaid patients is the result of rate increases in certain states and increasing patient acuity levels. The average Medicare rate per patient day for same-store nursing centers in 2017 decreased 1.1% compared to 2016, resulting in a decrease in revenue of $0.3 million.\nOur total average daily census increased by approximately 5.3% for the full portfolio compared to 2016 on a consolidated basis, but was primarily attributable to the aforementioned acquisition activity. On a same-store basis, our Medicare and Private Pay average daily census for 2017 decreased compared to 2016, resulting in decreases in revenue of $1.9 million, or 8.4%, and $1.3 million, or 13.9%, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in Medicaid average daily census resulting in increased in revenue of $0.4 million, or 0.9%.\nExpenses\nOperating expense increased to $116.2 million in 2017 from $106.5 million in 2016, driven by the $35.1 million in operating costs at the Golden Living nursing centers added in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1.8 million in operating costs at Park Place added in the third quarter of 2017. Operating expense increased to 80.5% of revenue in 2017, compared to 78.9% of revenue in 2016.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Change Same-store operating expenses $ 79,312 $ 78,500 $ 812 2016 acquisition operating expenses 35,096 27,988 7,108 2017 acquisition operating expenses 1,777 — 1,777 Total operating expenses $ 116,185 $ 106,488 $ 9,697 The largest component of operating expenses is wages, which increased to $68.3 million in 2017 from $63.2 million in 2016, an increase of $5.1 million, or 8.0%. While wages increased overall, wages as a percentage of revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 47.3% as compared to 46.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 0.5%.\nOn a same-store center basis, operating expenses slightly increased by $0.8 million, which is attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of $1.0 million, which was slightly offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in health insurance costs.\nLease expense increased to $13.7 million in 2017 from $12.4 million in 2016, an increase of $1.3 million, or 10.5%. The increase in lease expense was driven by $1.2 million from the assumption of the Golden Living centers in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of having a full year of operations in 2017.\nProfessional liability expense was $2.8 million in 2017 compared to $2.5 million in 2016, an increase of $0.3 million, or 11.1%. As centers have been acquired in 2016 and 2017, the Company has accessed commercial insurance markets, which accounts for a significant portion of the growth in professional liability expense in the current year. We were engaged in 72 professional liability lawsuits as of December 31, 2017, compared to 67 as of December 31, 2016. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $0.5 million and $1.7 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Professional liability expense and cash expenditures fluctuate from year to year based respectively on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies, the premium costs of purchased insurance, and on the costs incurred in defending and settling existing claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the accrual for professional liability.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $8.0 million in 2017 compared to $9.2 million in 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 13.0%. The overall decrease in general and administrative expenses were attributable to corporate wages and payroll taxes, accounting fees and acquisition costs of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was approximately $2.8 million in 2017 and $2.2 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 is primarily due to $0.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses related to the assumed Golden Living operations in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGain on bargain purchase of $0.9 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the Park Place acquisition in July 2016.\nInterest expense has increased to $1.7 million in 2017 compared to $1.4 million in 2016, an increase of $0.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to higher debt balances in 2017 as a result of additional borrowings made during the change in ownership processes for the newly acquired centers in Alabama and Mississippi, and the amendment of the term loan facility that occurred in June 2017.\nAs a result of the above, continuing operations reported income before taxes of $0.1 million in 2017, as compared to income of $2.2 million in 2016. The provision for income taxes was $6.1 million in 2017 and $0.8 million in 2016. The basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $0.94 and $0.94 in 2017, respectively, compared to a basic and diluted income per common share from continuing operations of $0.23 and $0.22 in 2016, respectively.\nReceivables\nOur net receivables balance increased $2.7 million to $64.9 million as of December 31, 2017 from $62.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to the twenty-two newly leased Golden Living centers in Alabama and Mississippi.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call has been scheduled for Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 4:00 P.M.

These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related, debt retirement, lease termination and lease deferral costs. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition-related costs, lease termination costs, lease deferral costs, debt retirement costs and income (loss) from discontinued operations. Funds Provided by Operations is defined as net income from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of professional liability and other non-cash charges. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred tax benefit and other non-cash charges.\nOur measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses and separation costs. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred taxes and other non-cash items. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nDIVERSICARE HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC.
