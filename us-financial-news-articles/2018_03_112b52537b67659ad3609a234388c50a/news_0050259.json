He noted that Dish’s Sling online streaming service tries to keep costs low by offering fewer networks.\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon asked Schlichting if Dish has data to prove that certain networks are not popular with viewers. When Schlichting said Dish does have that data but it does not affect negotiations, Judge Leon showed surprise.\nBefore the trial started on Tuesday, the judge held closed talks with attorneys about what testimony Schlichting could give in open court.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice called Turner CEO John Martin as a witness late in the day, and his testimony will continue Wednesday.\nReporting by Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T03:33:45.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
