(NASDAQ: MIII) (the \"Company\") announced today that it has entered into several additional financing agreements to offset redemptions in anticipation of the special meeting of the Company's stockholders to approve the Company's proposed business combination with IEA Energy Services LLC (\"IEA\").\nThe Company has entered into commitment agreements or backstop agreements with a total of 11 investors who have agreed to support the transaction by either not redeeming shares of common stock of the Company (\"Common Stock\") owned by such investors, rescinding their election to redeem shares of Common Stock owned by such investors, purchasing shares of Common Stock from other stockholders that elected to redeem and causing the redemption election to be rescinded or purchasing shares directly from the Company. In addition, the Company has negotiated and expects to enter into an additional agreement in principal with an additional party who has agreed to purchase shares of Common Stock from stockholders that have elected to redeem and who will withdraw their redemption elections, resulting in approximately $11.0 million of additional proceeds in the trust account of the Company. Giving effect to these transactions, investors have agreed to purchase new shares of Common Stock or not redeem shares of Common Stock in connection with the closing of the business combination resulting in cash available to fund the purchase price in the proposed business combination of approximately $73.0 million. Certain of these transactions have previously been disclosed in the Company's or the Sponsors' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nPursuant to certain of these commitment agreements and backstop agreements, M III Sponsor I LLC and M III Sponsor I LP (the \"Sponsors\") have agreed to transfer approximately 217,256 founder shares to certain investors and have also agreed with certain existing investors in the Sponsors to allocate additional equity interests in the Sponsor to such investors. The Company has also agreed to issue an aggregate of 1.5 million warrants to purchase 0.75 million shares of Common Stock (and the Sponsors will forfeit a number of founder shares with an approximate economically equivalent value). Certain of these transactions have previously been disclosed in the Company's or the Sponsors' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nBoth the Seller and the Company have waived the condition to closing of the business combination that at least $100.0 million of cash be available from the trust account or sales of additional equity at closing, subject to certain limitations further described in the Company's supplement to the Proxy Statement filed today.\nThe Sponsors have agreed with Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, LLC (the \"Seller\") that they will forfeit to the Company for cancellation 425,000 founder shares at closing. The Sponsors have agreed to forfeit up to an additional 525,000 founder shares in the future to the extent the Seller does not receive the full 9,000,000 \"earnout shares\" pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement based upon the combined company achieving its EBITDA targets for 2018 and 2019. The Company will issue to the Seller a number of new shares of Common Stock equal to the number of founder shares forfeited by the Sponsors at closing or in the future.\nIn addition, at the closing of the business combination, the combined company expects to borrow approximately $21 million under the revolving credit facility and $24 million under the term loan facility.\nMohsin Y. Meghji, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, remarked, \"We are grateful for the support of the investors who have expressed their confidence in the long-term growth prospects of the Company and we look forward to moving forward with the completion of our business combination with IEA now that we have all of the required capital in place. We believe overall business trends in the renewable energy markets remain strong and we continue to believe that IEA is on track to meet its financial targets for 2018.\"\nThe Company has decided to postpone the special meeting until Wednesday, March 21, 2018 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time to allow sufficient time to finalize these agreements. The record date for the meeting has not changed. The special meeting will be held at the offices of Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10105. Assuming that the Company's stockholders vote to approve the business combination, we expect that all conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived and that the business combination will close within one week thereafter.\nNo action is required by any Company stockholder who has previously delivered a proxy and who does not wish to revoke or change such proxy.
