Quoting people briefed on the plans, AP said countries will be granted exemptions from the tariffs if they can address the threat their exports pose to the United States. Trump will sign proclamations ordering import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum at a White House ceremony later on Thursday.
