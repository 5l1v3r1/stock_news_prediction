(OTCQX: ICTV), (CSE: ITV), a digitally focused, direct response marketing and branding company focused on the health, wellness and beauty sector, today announced the signing of an asset purchase agreement with Therma Bright Inc., a British Columbia corporation, to sell certain assets relating to the ClearTouch® nail phototherapy device and no!no! skin phototherapy device, excluding any rights to the trademark or name “no!no!®” or “no!no!SKIN®,” for a purchase price of $2,250,000.\nThe purchase price to be paid by Therma Bright is payable as follows: (i) $750,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments, on the closing date; (ii) $500,000 in cash, payable on or before December 31, 2018; (iii) $500,000 in cash, payable on or before December 31, 2019; and (iv) $500,000 in cash, payable on or before December 31, 2020. Therma Bright also has the right to prepay the purchase price in full on or before June 30, 2019 and receive a $200,000 reduction of the purchase price. In order to guarantee the future payments, Therma Bright granted ICTV a security interest on the US patent and trademark on the assets being sold.\nThe ClearTouch® and no!no!SKIN® assets were acquired by ICTV on January 23, 2017 as part of the acquisition of our no!no! hair brand. Since the acquisition, ICTV has been required to maintain medical device certifications for ClearTouch and no!no!SKIN® in the United States and other territories. None of the other beauty devices, such as DermaWand® and no!no!® hair, require such certifications as they are classified as cosmetic devices. By selling these assets, ICTV will be able to reduce overhead costs that were required to maintain such certifications.\nIn addition to the asset purchase agreement, ICTV entered into a sales representative agreement with Therma Bright, whereby ICTV will provide sales, promotion and marketing, and after-sale services for the acquired assets. ICTV will be paid 10% of net collected sales of the ClearTouch® nail phototherapy device and no!no! skin phototherapy device sold under trademarks other than the no!no!®” or “no!no!SKIN® , and 50% of net collected sales of no!no! skin phototherapy device sold under any of the no!no! ICTV registered trademarks. The term of the sales representative agreement is twelve months, which will automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless terminated in accordance with the terms therein.\nRichard Ransom, President of ICTV Brands, stated, “I am very pleased to announce the sale of the ClearTouch® assets to Therma Bright. The ClearTouch® assets that were acquired with our no!no! ® brand do not fit into the cosmetic beauty device portfolio that ICTV is building. The opportunity to monetize these assets provides capital to further grow our other core brands. Our team is also very excited to be able to utilize the power of our global consumer products platform by offering the service of marketing and selling ClearTouch® on Therma Bright’s behalf around the world.”\nICTV Brands, Inc.\nICTV Brands, Inc. sells primarily health, beauty and wellness products as well as various consumer products through a multi-channel distribution strategy.
