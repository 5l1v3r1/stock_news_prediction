BENTELER Automotive Farsund's casting business consists of a highly automated aluminum foundry in Farsund, Norway, designing and producing safety critical, lightweight aluminum structural castings.\n\"We are pleased to have completed our acquisition of the Bentler Automotive Farsund business, as this acquisition accelerates our vertical integration in Europe, provides customer and product diversification and further enhances our technical capabilities in our business,\" said Doug DelGrosso, Chassix's President and CEO. \"We welcome the Farsund team to Chassix and look forward to working collaboratively to continue to provide high quality, innovative products to our collective customers.\"\nFor BENTELER, the decision to sell BENTELER Automotive Farsund was the result of an in-depth analysis of the company's business portfolio. BENTELER will continue to develop lightweight solutions for its customers. Doing so, BENTELER will leverage its in-house core business of steel and aluminum processing based on more than 140 years of experience. When needed, BENTELER will source aluminum casting products through the cooperation with external partners such as Chassix. CEO Laurent Favre explains: \"The automotive market is rapidly changing. Our ability to anticipate trends and to offer relevant solutions for upcoming opportunities will be key to our companies' success. The divestment of the BENTELER Automotive plant in Farsund will allow us to further develop our core business.\" Hence, BENTELER will continue to develop electric mobility and provide full system solutions which automotive customers increasingly outsource. At the same time, BENTELER will keep on investing into growing markets such as China and will leverage future trends such as digitalization and cooperation with start-ups.\nThe Farsund business will operate under the name Chassix Norway AS.\nAbout Chassix:\nHeadquartered in Southfield, Michigan, Chassix is a leading global, vertically integrated manufacturer of aluminum and iron cast and machined chassis, powertrain and sub-frame automotive components, forming strength in the industry by providing tailor-made engineering and manufacturing solutions for safety-critical products through strong, long standing customer relationships with our innovative and collaborative global teams uniquely positioned to capitalize on adjacent markets and light weighting industry trends.\nChassix had 2016 sales of $1.2 billion.
