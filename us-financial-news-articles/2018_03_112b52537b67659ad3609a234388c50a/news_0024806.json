(NYSE American:PZG) (\"Paramount”) reported today that the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (“DOGAMI”) and the Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) have approved and accepted the first two baseline environmental reports required for the permitting of Paramount’s proposed Grassy Mountain gold mine in Oregon.\nThe baseline air quality report and the baseline visual resources report were submitted to the state of Oregon on January 18, 2018 and December 22, 2017 respectively. Final approval for both reports was received on February 28, 2018.\nParamount CEO Glen van Treek commented: “We are very encouraged by the quick turnaround time and the fact that these reports have been approved and accepted without change. This excellent response from Oregon State regulators supports our permitting timeline which has us submitting our consolidated permit application to the DOGAMI in mid-2018.” Once this application has been accepted as complete and a notice to proceed has been issued by state regulators, a permit decision should be expected within days.\nLast year, Paramount established a methodology and work plans for the preparation of updated baseline studies in consultation with the DOGAMI. The updated studies were required to cover a larger area for the proposed Grassy Mountain mine and its facilities as well as revisions to access roads. Paramount and its consultants have subsequently been acquiring baseline data and filing reports to meet DOGAMI’s data requirements in accordance with these work plans. To date, a total of 11 baseline reports have been filed with DOGAMI for review by their staff and the specific state agency responsible for the subject matter of the report. “The permitting process is proceeding as planned, thanks in large part to the co-operation of state officials,” said Van Treek.\nParamount expects to complete a Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”) for the proposed underground mine at its Grassy Mountain Gold Project in late March or early April. The PFS is a key component of the consolidated permit application. The PFS is expected to report the project’s first proven and probable reserves.\nThe proposed Grassy Mountain project is located on 100%-owned private land which was recently acquired by Paramount and announced on February 20, 2018 .\nAbout Paramount Gold Nevada Corp.\nParamount Gold Nevada is a U.S. based precious metals exploration and development company. Paramount’s strategy is to create shareholder value through exploring and developing its mineral properties and to realize this value for its shareholders in three ways: by selling its assets to established producers; entering into joint ventures with producers for construction and operation; or constructing and operating mines for its own account.\nParamount owns 100% of the Grassy Mountain Gold Project which consists of approximately 9,300 acres located on private and BLM land in Malheur County, Oregon. The Grassy Mountain project contains a gold-silver deposit (100% located on private land) for which a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) has been prepared and key permitting milestones accomplished. For the PEA, click here . Additionally, Paramount owns a 100% interest in the Sleeper Gold Project located in Northern Nevada. The Sleeper Gold Project, which includes the former producing Sleeper mine, totals 2,322 unpatented mining claims (approximately 60 square miles or 15,500 hectares).\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release and related documents may include \" \" and “forward-looking information” (collectively, “ ”) pursuant to applicable United States and Canadian securities laws.
