We all welcome Lello to the Company and look forward to the next three years as we move towards becoming a gold producer. ”\nPeter “Lello” Galassi\nMr. Galassi is a retired US Air Force Officer and Engineer with extensive experience in systems development, acquisition and project management and construction in leading greenfield mining projects in remote areas of the world. His breadth of knowledge and capacity ranges from multi-million to multi-billion-dollar projects.\nBetween 2004-2008, Lello was the project manager of the Tenke Fungurume Project, a Phelps Dodge greenfield copper and cobalt mine development in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This US$2 billion project was developed from concept studies to first copper cathode production in January 2009.\nIn 2009, Mr. Galassi worked for Rio Tinto Iron Ore Expansion Projects, a group of Rio Tinto focused on developing new greenfield mines and plants in NW Australia. He led the project studies teams and engineering contractors in developing a new mine, new bulk material port loading facility and new heavy haul rail systems for the Turee Syncline Project and for expansions at the Dampier Port facilities.\nIn late 2010, Lello was asked by Rio Tinto to lead the very-large African Guinea Simandou Iron Ore Project as a Project Director – General Manager. This US$18 billion greenfield project scope included a new mine, new processing plant, over 750 km of new heavy haul rail and machinery, a new deep water port facility, and all supporting systems including camps, warehouses, power generation, airfields and construction support port facilities.\nIn 2013, Mr. Galassi took a position as COO and Project Director of the Aurora Gold Mine Project for Guyana Goldfields. This greenfield project had a capital value of approximately US$300 million and was a joint effort of Guyana Goldfields, financial institutions, and the International Finance Corporation. The project commenced in Q2 2013 with successful completion and first-gold pour in Sep 2015.\nFollowing the Aurora Project, from 2015-2018, he assumed a position as project director for the Phoenix Projects, a combination of brownfield and greenfield mining projects in Barcelona, Spain. The projects included a new 5 km long underground access ramp to the mine, new processing plants for potash and salt derivatives, new rail systems and a new greenfield bulk material handling/ storage port facility in the Barcelona Port. These projects had a combined value of US$500 million.\nSabina Gold & Silver Corp.\nSabina Gold & Silver Corp. is well-financed with approximately C$94.5million in cash and equivalents, and is an emerging precious metals company with district scale, advanced, high grade gold assets in one of the world’s newest, politically stable mining jurisdictions: Nunavut, Canada.\nSabina released a Feasibility Study on its 100% owned Back River Gold Project which presents a project that has been designed on a fit-for purpose basis, with the potential to produce ~200,000 ounces a year for ~11 years with a rapid payback of 2.9 years (see “Technical Report for the Initial Project Feasibility Study on the Back River Gold Property, Nunavut, Canada” dated October 28, 2015) (the “Study”). At a US$1,150 gold price and a 0.80 (US$:C$) exchange rate, the Study delivers a potential after tax internal rate of return of approximately 24.2% with an initial CAPEX of $415 million.\nThe Project received its final Project Certificate on December 19, 2017. The Project is now in the final regulatory and licensing phase.\nIn addition to Back River, Sabina also owns a significant silver royalty on Glencore’s Hackett River Project. The silver royalty on Hackett River’s silver production is comprised of 22.5% of the first 190 million ounces produced and 12.5% of all silver produced thereafter.\nFor further information please contact:\nNicole Hoeller, Vice-President, Communications: 1 888 648-4218\nnhoeller@sabinagoldsilver.com\nForward Looking Information\nThis news release contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable securities laws (the “forward-looking statements”), including our belief as to the extent, results and timing of and various studies relating to engineering studies, infrastructure improvement activities, exploration results and permitting and licensing outcomes.
