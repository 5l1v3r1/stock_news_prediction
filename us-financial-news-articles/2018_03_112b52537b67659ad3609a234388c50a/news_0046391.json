The Company operates through physical stores, the internet, and other distribution channels worldwide.\nOn September 8, 2016, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a Consent Order with a Stipulation to its entry signed by Mary Mack, Executive Vice President of Wells Fargo Bank, detailing fraudulent practices at the Company, which were centered on a corporate culture intent on growing its cross-selling opportunities and unlawfully and without its customers’ consent opening millions of unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts, and imposing a fine of more than $185 million.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Wells Fargo had charged more than 800,000 customers for unneeded auto insurance, the expense of which pushed approximately 274,000 Wells Fargo customers into delinquency and resulted in almost 25,000 vehicle repossessions; (ii) the foregoing conduct, when it came to light, would foreseeably subject Wells Fargo to heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or enforcement actions; and (iii) as a result, Wells Fargo’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn July 27, 2017, post-market, The New York Times published an article entitled “Wells Fargo Forced Unwanted Auto Insurance on Borrowers.” Citing an internal report prepared for Wells Fargo’s executives, the article reported that “[m]ore than 800,000 people who took out car loans from Wells Fargo were charged for auto insurance they did not need,” that “[t]he expense of the unneeded insurance . . . pushed roughly 274,000 Wells Fargo customers into delinquency and resulted in almost 25,000 wrongful vehicle repossessions,” and “that the bank owed $73 million to wronged customers.”\nFollowing publication of this article, Wells Fargo’s share price fell $1.41, or 2.58%, to close at $53.30 on July 28, 2017.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members.
