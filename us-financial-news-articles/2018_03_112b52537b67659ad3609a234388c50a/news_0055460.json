Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan addresses the bank's annual news conference in Frankfurt, Germany, February 2, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski Paul Achleitner, chairman of the board, has initiated a search to replace John Cryan, the British chief executive officer who has been in office less than three years, the people said on condition of anonymity. A separate senior official cautioned that there was little the bank could do to quickly improve sentiment. The headquarters of Germany's Deutsche Bank are seen early evening in Frankfurt, Germany January 31, 2017. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach “We cannot cut costs short term without sacrificing revenue going forward,” the banker said on condition of anonymity. “What we are working on is changing long-term processes. That’s a real way to cut costs, but this takes time.” The CEO search, which is in the early stages, and the call for patience come after a flurry of negative headlines for the bank in recent weeks. The bank said its loss in 2017 was larger than initially reported, and it warned about headwinds in the first quarter. The Times newspaper reported on Monday that Deutsche Bank was seeking to replace Cryan amid an intensified boardroom row over the bank’s future and alarm at its performance.
