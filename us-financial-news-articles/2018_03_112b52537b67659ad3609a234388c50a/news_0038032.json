They also allege the companies mounted campaigns to downplay the risks of global warming and discredit research that human activity was to blame.\nThe companies have asked Alsup to dismiss the lawsuits. Federal law controls fossil fuel production, and Congress has encouraged oil and gas development, they said in court documents. They added that the harm the cities claim is \"speculative\" and part of a complex chain of events that includes billions of oil and gas users and \"environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.\"\n\"The relief that plaintiffs seek would require a single judge sitting in San Francisco to unilaterally change the nation's energy and environmental policies,\" Joshua Lipshutz, an attorney for Chevron, said on a call with reporters.\nThe lawsuits say the companies have created a public nuisance and should pay for sea walls and other infrastructure to protect against the effects of climate change — construction that could cost billions of dollars.\nNew York City, several California counties and another California city have filed similar suits.\nSan Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera said the city looks forward to providing the \"objective history of climate change science.\"\n\"We'll see whether big oil acknowledges the scientific consensus and its role in causing climate change or doubles down, once again, on deception,\" he said in a statement.\nChevron will not engage in a debate about climate change, but instead present the conclusion of an international panel of scientists which said it is extremely likely that humans are the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-1900s, said Avi Garbow, another attorney for Chevron.\nAlsup said in a court filing about Wednesday's tutorial that he wants to know whether the collective heat from burning fossil fuels contributes to warming and if so, how. He also wants to know the main sources of carbon dioxide that account for the buildup of the gas in the atmosphere.\nDeciding the lawsuits in favor of Oakland and San Francisco would be \"revolutionary\" and open the door to myriad similar lawsuits, so Alsup may want to establish a strong base of scientific knowledge on climate change, said David Takacs, a professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law who studies climate change.\n\"He has to dot his i's and cross his t's,\" he said. \"It has to be a long public display that 'The science is making me rule on behalf of the plaintiffs.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T10:13:09.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
