It added that it was extending the offer until March 29.\nGKN shares advanced 3.3 percent to close at 435.1 pence in London. That is higher than the level of Melrose’s offer, which currently values GKN at about 414.8 pence per share based on the Melrose share price, which was up 4 percent at 224.7 pence.\nDana shares climbed 4.1 percent to $27.27.\nIMPROVED OFFER? “We might need to revisit our offer, I think that’s what the market is telling us,” a source close to Melrose said.\nAccording to UK rules, Melrose has until March 19 to improve its bid. But because the Easter break truncates the timetable it effectively has until March 15 to sweeten its offer terms.\nThe deal with Dana “provides significantly greater value for GKN’s shareholders than the Melrose offer”, GKN said.\nIt added that the merger gives Driveline an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $6.1 billion, based on Dana’s closing share price of $26.20 on Thursday. The tie-up is expected to deliver annual cost savings and other benefits worth $235 million within three years, it said.\nTogether with GKN’s plan to sell its powder metallurgy business, the deal will leave the company focused on aerospace, supplying parts for aircraft including the Black Hawk military helicopter and Eurofighter Typhoon.\nGKN was left vulnerable to bid approaches after two profit warnings in October and November that were caused by problems at its U.S. aerospace business and sent its share price tumbling.\nDana approached GKN late in 2017 and the pair began talks early this year, the British company disclosed on Friday. Its aerospace division has also attracted a number of suitors since January, but the GKN board decided their proposals undervalued the business and did not pursue them, the company added.\nSHAREHOLDER CHOICE If the Driveline deal is successful Dana will become a UK domiciled company, though it will remain headquartered in Ohio and its shares will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It will also be led by James Kamsickas, Dana’s current CEO.\nGKN shareholders will need to approve the merger, which means they will have to weigh its merits against a Melrose deal.\nThat will include considering whether they want to hold a stake in New York-listed Dana or London-listed Melrose.\n“Following the (Dana) transaction, GKN shareholders will own 47 percent of a $14 billion revenue global automotive group and will retain ownership of GKN’s outstanding remaining businesses,” said GKN Chairman Mike Turner.\nHowever, Melrose argued that many GKN investors would neither wish nor be able to hold U.S. stock.\n“A hasty sale of one of Britain’s most important businesses will leave it listed overseas, run by a foreign management team and rebranded as a U.S. business,” Melrose Chairman Christopher Miller said.\n“In our view it is structured in a way prejudicial to GKN shareholders’ interests.”\nSeparately, the trustees of GKN’s group pension said the arrangements agreed as part of the Driveline transaction provide “appropriate mitigation to the schemes”.\nCredit Suisse and Barclays are advising Dana, while the U.S. company’s board is being advised by PJT Partners. GKN is working with JP Morgan, Gleacher Shacklock and UBS.\nReporting by Ben Martin in London and Noor Zainab Hussain; Editing by Keith Weir, Elaine Hardcastle and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:39:46.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
