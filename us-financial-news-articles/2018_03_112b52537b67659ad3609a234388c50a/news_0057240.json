From this point anything else is icing on the cake,” Spieth said. \nRose was also pleased. \n“My iron play has been a bit sharper and when I have missed a green my short game has been on point,” said the Englishman. \n“That’s what I’ve most been pleased about heading into next week, how the short game’s looking. \n“For me (this week is) about getting a bit clearer on my shots, visualizing them a bit better, getting a bit more committed to my shots. \nThree-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson triple-bogeyed the 18th, hitting two balls into the water to fall six strokes behind. \n“I didn’t strike it very well but I putted phenomenal to stay in it,” Mickelson said. “Today was an off day.” \nThe Houston winner will earn the last spot in the Masters, if not already exempt, and Hossler is among those dreaming of a late ticket to the year’s first major. \n“I’ve been a little bit more aggressive with my wedges so far and been able to get some really makeable birdie putts, some of them inside a foot, so that’s been great,” said the 23-year-old from California. \nHe has not finished better than seventh in 25 starts on tour.
