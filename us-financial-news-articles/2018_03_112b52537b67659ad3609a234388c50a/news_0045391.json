Liberty’s Polish unit UPC Polska was to buy Multimedia’s cable television business for about 3 billion zlotys ($876 million) in cash.\nThe final price was to be subject to potential downward adjustments for the operational and financial performance of Multimedia prior to closing.\n“We have withdrawn from the transaction to acquire Multimedia Polska after failing to agree on revised commercial terms with the sellers that take into account current regulatory and market conditions,” Liberty Global said in a statement.\n“We remain confident in the business prospects of our Polish operation and will consider other accretive consolidation opportunities as and when they arise,” the company said.\nLiberty Global hoped to significantly increase its scale in Poland, where it is already one of the largest cable operators.\n“Due to the lack of possibility to make final trade and business arrangements, the parties have unanimously decided to terminate the agreement,” Multimedia Polska said in a separate statement.\nReporting by Marcin Goettig; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-23T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:23:29.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
