The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said in a statement that local union leaders would meet in the next two weeks to review the tentative pact “and approve sending it out for a membership ratification vote.”\nWith $2 billion in revenue last year, ABF Freight System was the seventh-largest operator in the less-than-truckload business, according to industry analyst SJ Consulting Group. Truckers in the sector haul freight loads from several different companies on the same truck, often for retailers moving goods between distribution centers and stores.\nThe new tentative agreement came earlier than the last contract in 2013. That pact was agreed to in May 2013, only after the previous contract had expired and the two sides struck a series of interim extensions to keep drivers working during negotiations.\nAs part of the new pact, the union and ABF agreed to extend the current agreement while the ratification process goes forward.\nShares in Arcbest, which had declined more than 11% over the past week, were up 2.5% in trading Thursday to $32.25.\nWrite to Paul Page at paul.page@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T02:54:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
