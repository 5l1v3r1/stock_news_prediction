The price index is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, and has been below the central bank’s 2 percent target since mid-2012.\nAmazon.com climbed 1.0 percent, recovering from a 4.6 percent drop after President Donald Trump criticized the online retailer via Twitter early Thursday, claiming without evidence that the company pays “little to no taxes to state & local governments.”\nStocks shot up earlier in the week as comments from officials in the United States and China suggested the world’s two largest economies would renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances, averting a trade war.\nBut trade war fears led global investors to cut their equity exposure to a four-month low in March and reduce their holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years, according to a Reuters poll.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 5.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.57-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
