He mocked U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October for \"wasting his time\" trying to talk to North Korea.\nEarlier Thursday, Tillerson had said on a visit to Africa that although \"talks about talks\" might be possible with Pyongyang, denuclearization negotiations were likely a long way off.\n\"Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze,\" Trump said in a message on Twitter on Thursday night. \"Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time.\"\nTrump added: \"Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached.\"\nA meeting between Kim and Trump, who have exchanged bellicose insults in the past year that have  \n\"Kim pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests,\" Chung said, apparently referring to a suspension during the duration of any talks.\n\"He expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,\" he said.\n  President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama.\nUnder Clinton in October 2000, then-U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held talks in Pyongyang with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un.\nU.S. officials and experts, speaking to Reuters before Thursday's announcement, had cautioned that North Korea could buy time to build up and refine its nuclear arsenal, including a warhead able to survive re-entry into the Earths atmosphere, if it manages to drag out any talks with Washington.\nJOINT MILITARY EXERCISES\nChung and National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon flew to Washington to explain North Korea's stance on possible future talks with Washington and the prospect of Pyongyang suspending nuclear tests if the security of the North's government is assured.\nIn what would be a key North Korean concession, Chung said Kim \"understands that the routine joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue.\"\nPyongyang had previously demanded that such joint drills be suspended in order for any U.S. talks to go forward.\nTrump in the past has derided the North Korean leader as a maniac, referred to him as little rocket man and threatened in a speech to the United Nations last year to \"totally destroy\" his country of 26 million people if it attacked the United States or one of its allies.\nKim had responded by calling the U.S. president a mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\nTrump has also been scathing in his criticism of previous U.S. administrations for not doing more to rein in the North Korean government.\n\"He believes that he has them on the ropes, or at a disadvantage right now. They only made the gesture because they feel the pressure badly and so this a good time,\" a second senior administration official said.\nBut U.S. officials may also be wary since North Korea has yet to weigh in directly on its diplomatic offer and previous overtures from Pyongyang have sometimes carried demands that Washington has found impossible to accept, such as the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he confirmed in telephone talks with Trump that pressure still needed to be applied worldwide on North Korea.\nAbe also told reporters he hoped to visit the United States as early as next month to meet Trump to discuss North Korea, among other issues.\n\"We welcome the change in North Korea's stance\", Abe said. \"Japan and the United States will not waver in its firm stance that they will continue to put maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete action towards the complete, verifiable and irreversible end to nuclear missile development.\"\nA senior administration official said Trump agreed to meet Kim because Kim is the \"one person who is able to make decisions under their authoritarian, uniquely authoritarian, or totalitarian system,\" a senior administration official said.\n  noted there had still been no public comment from North Korea about the content of Mondays meeting with the South Korean delegation.\n\"Lets hear from the North Koreans themselves what they are proposing and what they are willing to do. There is plenty of reason to be cautious, given their track record,\" Russel said. \"Second, lets read the fine print. The North has made peace overtures in the past that did not hold up under scrutiny.\"\nTensions over North Korea rose to their highest in years in 2017,   programs   to hold their first summit since 2007 in late April.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said sanctions should not be eased for the sake of talks and that nothing less than denuclearization   Jeff Mason, David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, Steve Holland, Yara Bayoumy and John Walcott in WASHINGTON; Christine Kim in SEOUL; additional reporting by Eric Beech, Mohammad Zargham, Susan Cornwell in WASHINGTON and Chang-Ran Kim in TOKYO; Editing by Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T07:22:13.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
