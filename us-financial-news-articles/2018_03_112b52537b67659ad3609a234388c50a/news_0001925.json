At the start of 2016 before Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass LNG export terminal entered service in February of that year, the United States was not exporting LNG.\nSabine Pass is still the only LNG export facility operating in the country, but by the end of the year, the nation’s LNG export capacity is expected to rise from 3 billion cubic feet now to 4.6 bcfd.\nOne bcfd is enough gas to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes.\nOver the next few years, the nation’s LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 9.4 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.1 bcfd by the end of 2020 as facilities currently under construction enter service.\nIn addition, there are dozens of projects under development that hope to get contracts from customers so they can also get built. It is these projects that the manufacturing trade group is targeting.\nThe companies developing new LNG projects include units of Cheniere, Tellurian Inc, Energy Transfer Partners LP, Exxon Mobil Corp, Pembina Pipeline Corp, Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd, Kinder Morgan Inc and Sempra Energy.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; writing by Apeksha Nair; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:39:17.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
