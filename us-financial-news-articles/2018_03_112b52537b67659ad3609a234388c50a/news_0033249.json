That increase is anticipated even if federal restrictions are loosened more slowly than growth advocates desire. \nThe agency also sees the ranks of commercial-drone pilots climbing past 300,000 over the same period, up from roughly 70,000 currently. Under what the FAA considers the most likely scenario, both the number of commercial drones and their pilots are anticipated to substantially exceed totals for private aviators and associated manned aircraft. \nIf drone deregulation gains as much traction as White House, FAA and industry officials envision, the agency estimates overall commercial-drone numbers could top 600,000 by the start of the next decade, about three times the country’s general aviation fleet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T23:35:15.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
