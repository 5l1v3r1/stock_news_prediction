In our view, a 3 percent yield for the 10-year U.S. Treasury is a warning level, and 3.5 percent is clearly an alert threshold,” Blanque told clients.\n“If reached too fast, this is unlikely to be sustained without a second wave of market correction.”\nBlanque added that an aggressive and rapid rise in interest rates would impact price valuations, pressuring indebted companies and earnings as well as emerging markets.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was trading at 2.85 percent US10YT=RR on Wednesday.\nReporting by Sujata Rao; editing by Dhara Ranasinghe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:04:03.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
