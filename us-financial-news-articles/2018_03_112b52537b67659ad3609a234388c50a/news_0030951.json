Included in the 2017 year-to-date income is a previously reported one-time gain in investment income of $1,466,000 on the sale of a majority of the company’s minority equity ownership in a privately-held technology company in the FinTech industry.\nRevenue was $2,546,000 and $9,302,000 in the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively, representing growth of nine percent and fourteen percent, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2016. The growth for the quarter and the year is attributable to an increase in our processing services customer base, an increase in the volume of transaction processing services and an increase in our maintenance technical and software support services, partially as a result of an increase in our license customer base.\nLoss from operations was $704,000 and $1,403,000 in the three month and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to losses of $136,000 and $687,000, respectively, in the same periods in 2016. Although revenue increased nine percent and fourteen percent for the quarter and year-to-date periods of 2017, as compared to the same periods in 2016, the company recorded a greater loss from operations in both 2017 periods, compared to the comparable 2016 periods, primarily due to a planned increase in R&D expenditures as the company continues expanding its development efforts via offshore staff additions, as well as, opening an office location in Mumbai, India to house key technical resources to enable continued enhancements to the features and functionality of its product offerings.\n“2017 unfolded about where we expected it to be. We made continued solid progress in several areas that support our effort to achieve the scale we need to realize returns expected of FinTech companies,” commented Leland Strange, CEO of Intelligent Systems. “I believe we will continue to grow revenue in 2018 at a minimum to be on par with last year’s growth. We have on-going efforts that could result in significant revenue and profit increases; however, there is no certainty that these efforts will be successful and expenses may increase prior to our ability to recognize revenues. It will take time for some of our recent relationships to mature and their growth may not make a real impact until next year. We expect to continue growing while not taking risks that could hurt over the long haul as reputation is critical for financial software enterprises.”\nInvestor Conference Call Today\nThe company is holding an investor conference call today, March 15, 2018, at 11 AM Eastern Time.
