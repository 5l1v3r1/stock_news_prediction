Last year, media reported that seven listed banks planned to adjust their provision coverage ratio to between 130 to 140 percent.\nThe CBRC also plans to set the loan provision ratio at 1.5 to 2.5 percent from 2.5 percent for commercial banks, said the two sources who saw a document detailing the changes.\nIn adjusting provisions, regulators should take into account each bank’s individual circumstances, capital ratios and the extent of bad loan write-offs among other things, they added.\nChina aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year, the same as in 2017, while pressing ahead with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system, Premier Li Keqiang said Monday.\nChinese commercial banks’ non-performing loan ratio steadied at 1.74 percent at the end of December, unchanged from the end of the third quarter, the CBRC said last month.\nBy value, NPLs hit 1.71 trillion yuan ($269.78 billion) at end-2017, up from 1.67 trillion yuan at the end of September. But many analysts suspect Chinese banks are carrying much more bad debts on their books.\n$1 = 6.3386 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Li Zheng and Engen Tham; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:24:05.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
