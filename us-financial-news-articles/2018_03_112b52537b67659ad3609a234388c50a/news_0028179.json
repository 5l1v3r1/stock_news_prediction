(the \" Company \" or “ Scythian ”) (TSXV:SCYB) (Frankfurt:9SB) (OTC – Nasdaq Intl:SCCYF) announces that, further to its press release on March 9, 2018 whereby the Company announced shareholder approval of an up to eight for one (8-for-1) stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares (the “ Stock Split ”), the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the Stock Split will be effected on a 4-for-1 basis, to ensure the Company continues to meet Nasdaq minimum pricing for its pending listing. Accordingly, each holder of common shares will receive 4 common shares in exchange for every common share currently held. The Stock Split will increase the number of issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from 7,083,397 to 28,333,588. The Stock Split is subject to regulatory approval from the TSX Venture Exchange and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\nJonathan Gilbert, CEO of the Company, commented, “We believe that the stock split and the resulting increase in the number of shares outstanding will encourage greater market liquidity and wider distribution of our shares among a broader investor base.”\nScythian is also pleased to announce the appointment of Vic Neufeld as the Company’s new Chairman of the Board of Directors, replacing Jonathan Gilbert, who will remain as Chief Executive Officer and as a Director.
