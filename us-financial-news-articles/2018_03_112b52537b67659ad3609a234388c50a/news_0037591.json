But, be sure to hold on to statements you may need for your taxes, such as charitable contributions. Same rule applies for utility and phone bills: once you've paid them feel free to shred, unless they contain tax-deductible expenses.\nShort Term Relationship (About 1 Year) : Hold on to bank and investment statements for a year, and be sure to flag any taxable investments. However, hold on to records that are related to home improvements and major purchases until you dispose of the asset. Similarly, you should hold on to medical records for at least a year.\nLucky Number 7 : Because the IRS has seven years to audit your returns if the agency suspects you made a mistake, it's recommended to keep your returns, and all supporting documents, for seven years. If you work with a tax preparer, ask whether they will maintain electronic copies of all returns filed.\nDeclutter for the Win : If you have any orphan accounts, consider consolidating them – same for old retirement or investment accounts. Combining accounts streamlines your financial life, makes it easier to monitor your entire portfolio and ensures that your money is properly diversified.\nA CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional can help Americans determine which documents are important to keep for future reference and how to consolidate accounts.\nABOUT CFP BOARD\nThe mission of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. is to benefit the public by granting the CFP® certification and upholding it as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.
