It earlier dropped to $1,307.51, its lowest since March 1. U.S. gold futures for April delivery eased by 0.08 percent to $1,311.30.\n\"We have a band of support at $1,300-$1,307 — there's the 100-day moving average coming in, there's the previous low and $1,300 is the big psychological level,\" Hansen said.\nSaxo Bank retains a bullish stance but would turn neutral if gold fell below $1,285, he added. The two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting begins on Tuesday, with the U.S. central bank expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year on Wednesday.\nWith an increase of 25 basis points seen as a done deal, one key focus is whether Fed policymakers forecast four rate hikes this year instead of the three projected at the December meeting.\n\"I think the overall economic recovery is good enough for the (U.S.) central bank to consider a faster pace of normalisation of monetary policies,\" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.\nGold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which reduce its appeal compared with interest-bearing investments. Gold speculators cut their net long position by 16,153 contracts to 145,659 contracts, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data shows. This was the smallest net long position since early January.\nAmong other precious metals, silver was down 0.34 percent at $16.245 per ounce and palladium fell 0.4 percent to $990.50 per ounce.\nPlatinum rose 0.3 percent at $945.80 per ounce after falling to its lowest since Jan. 3 at $936.50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T05:36:15.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
