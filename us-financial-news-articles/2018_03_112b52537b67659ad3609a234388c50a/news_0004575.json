Few fund managers have dared to initiate new short positions.\nShort positions across the whole of the petroleum complex total just 137 million barrels. Short positions in NYMEX WTI have fallen to just 30 million barrels, the lowest since July 2014.\nFund positioning remains very stretched with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of almost 10:1, but down from almost 12:1 at the end of January.\nDespite the profit-taking, oil prices have steadied, probably owing to a combination of strong consumption growth, a continued fall in oil inventories, and supportive comments from senior OPEC leaders.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, has confirmed that it intends to maintain production restraint throughout the remainder of 2018, even if that risks over-tightening the market.\n“If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little it, so be it. Rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information ... stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them,” the kingdom’s energy minister said on Feb. 14.\nSaudi officials have indicated they want to change the organization’s target for inventories from the five-year average, which is close to being achieved, to something more ambitious.\nThis represents a significant hardening of OPEC’s policy and has partially reversed the recent slide in benchmark Brent prices, which was probably the intention.\nBut with the market still looking very stretched, especially on the crude side, OPEC may need to sustain its verbal intervention to reassure investors and keep prices firm.\n(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.
