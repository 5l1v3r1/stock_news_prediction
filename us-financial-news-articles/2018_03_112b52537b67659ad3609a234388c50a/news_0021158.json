Revenue growth, which was roughly flat in 2017, should grow 5 to 7 percent a year, the company said.\nThe plan, released alongside a strategy plan by parent Telecom Italia SpA, largely reaffirmed the Brazilian unit’s ongoing strategy of expanding quickly in high-end broadband and mobile segments, while cutting costs and investing selectively to keep capital and operational costs down.\nTIM Participações has been an analyst and investor favorite, with its shares jumping over 70 percent in 2017 as solid cost control and a focus on high-end consumers boosted profits. Its 2018 to 2020 plan will likely test the sustainability of its “more with less” strategy in a capital-intensive business.\nAs part of the plan, TIM plans to aggressively expand its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service, a type of ultra fast broadband, to a total of 13 cities, up from two cities currently.\nThe company also said it expects to expand its 4G service to at least 4,000 cities by 2020, bringing 4G coverage to 96 percent of Brazil’s urban population.\n$1 = 3.21 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery Editing by Diane Craft and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T06:14:24.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
