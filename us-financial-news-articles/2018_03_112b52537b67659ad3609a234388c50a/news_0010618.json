On Monday, Trump tweeted that “tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.”\nGuajardo said on Tuesday that if the U.S. government were to push ahead with metals tariffs that included Mexico, the country would be forced to respond with politically targeted tit-for-tat responses.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “There’s a list (of U.S. products) that we are analyzing internally, but we won’t make it public, we’re going to wait,” Guajardo said.\nRelated Coverage Trump, Canada's Trudeau discussed trade, NAFTA in call: White House He also said that in a meeting in Washington last week, in which he met Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, he told the U.S. official that Mexico should not be included in the proposed tariffs.\n“We’re allies in national security ... our industries are highly integrated, we buy more (U.S.) steel than we sell, and so there’s no point in shooting oneself in the foot,” he said.\nReporting by Gabriel Stargardter and Veronica Gomez; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, David Gregorio and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T16:03:09.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
