(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CCRN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:\nDollars in thousands, except per share amounts.\nQ4 2017\nVariance\nQ4 2017 vs\nQ4 2016\nFull Year\n2017\nVariance\n2017 vs\n2016\nRevenue $219,674 (1)% $865,048 4% Gross profit margin*\n26.5% 60 bps\n26.4% (20) bps\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$27,950 455% $37,513 371% Diluted EPS $0.77 $1.01 $1.01 $0.86 Adjusted EBITDA* $12,301 2% $43,403 (3)% Adjusted EPS* $0.17 $(0.03) $0.61 $(0.08) Cash flows from operations $16,803 891% $45,508 51% * Refer to accompanying tables and discussion of Non-GAAP financial measures below.\nThe Company experienced weaker than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily in its Nurse and Allied Staffing business with fewer overall placements and a lower renewal rate. The Company also experienced a higher than expected reduction in premium rate business, as well as greater disruptive effects from Hurricane Irma on fourth quarter placements. While the Company expects some of the impact associated with lower renewal rate and premium rate business to continue to affect results in the first quarter of 2018, it believes these pressures are ultimately short-term in nature, the overall trends for the business are strong, and performance will improve as it moves further into fiscal year 2018. Already, in the first quarter, the Company is seeing an uptick in its renewal rate and an increase in orders. The Company also expects to see additional improvement in its Advantage RN business throughout 2018, which it believes will continue to support higher capture rates within its Managed Service Programs and support its long-term strategy.\n“Cross Country has experienced tremendous growth over the last four years and we expect to see growth continue as we progress into 2018, led by our high growth, high margin education healthcare staffing business,” said CEO William J. Grubbs, “While we expect near-term pressures on top-line growth to dissipate, management has also moved decisively to focus attention on improving costs and operational excellence, as demonstrated by the recent changes to our organizational structure, including the creation of a new Chief Operating Officer role, which we believe will drive greater focus, accountability, and agility in our decision-making and overall performance.”\nFourth quarter consolidated revenue was $219.7 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Consolidated gross profit margin was 26.5%, up 60 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $28.0 million, impacted by noncash items including nonrecurring net income tax benefits of $34.5 million, partly offset by Physician Staffing impairment charges of $14.4 million ($12.1 million after taxes), compared to a net loss of $7.9 million in the prior year, including a noncash loss on the derivative liability of $14.2 million. Diluted EPS was $0.77 per share compared to a loss of $0.24 per share in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.3 million or 5.6% of revenue, as compared with $12.0 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the current quarter as compared to $0.20 in the prior year and $0.23 in the prior quarter.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, consolidated revenue was $865.0 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Consolidated gross profit margin was 26.4%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $37.5 million, compared to $8.0 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $43.4 million or 5.0% of revenue, as compared with $44.7 million or 5.4% of revenue in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.61 compared to $0.69 in the prior year.\nFourth quarter and full year results were impacted by noncash items including a $42.5 million income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of substantially all of the Company’s valuation allowances on its net deferred tax assets, $14.4 million of impairment charges related to Physician Staffing, and $8.0 million of income tax expense attributable to the Company’s re-measurement of its deferred tax assets under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Given the significant complexity of the new tax legislation, the Company’s estimate of the impact may be refined during 2018.\nQuarterly Business Segment Highlights\nNurse and Allied Staffing\nRevenue from Nurse and Allied Staffing was $193.7 million, a slight decrease from the prior year, and a decrease of 3% sequentially. Contribution income was $19.2 million, up from $18.1 million in the prior year. Average field FTEs increased to 7,521 from 7,156 in the prior year. Revenue per FTE per day was $280 compared to $295 in the prior year, primarily reflecting a change in the mix of business.\nPhysician Staffing\nRevenue from Physician Staffing was $22.6 million, a decrease of 9% year-over-year and sequentially, with the year-over-year decrease due to changes in mix and the sequential decline due to volume. Contribution income was $1.0 million, down from $2.3 million in the prior year. Total days filled were 15,115 as compared with 14,521 in the prior year, with growth in advanced practices partly offset by declines in physician specialties. Revenue per day filled was $1,489 as compared with $1,599 in the prior year, representing the impact of a shift in mix of specialties within physician staffing and growth in advanced practices, which generally have a lower daily bill rate.\nOther Human Capital Management Services\nRevenue from Other Human Capital Management Services was $3.4 million, a decrease of 8% year-over-year and an increase of 8% sequentially. Contribution loss was $0.2 million compared to a loss of $0.3 million in the prior year.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet Highlights\nCash flow provided by operating activities for the current quarter was $16.8 million compared to cash used of $2.1 million in the prior year. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the full year was $45.5 million compared to $30.1 million in the prior year. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $25.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and a $100.0 million term loan outstanding. There were no borrowings drawn on its $115.0 million revolving credit facility, and $21.6 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving $93.4 million available for borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nOutlook for First Quarter 2018\nThe guidance below applies only to management’s expectations for the first quarter of 2018. Though the Company does not provide full year guidance, organic growth for the full year and continued margin improvements are expected based on continued favorable market conditions and demand for its services. In addition to the normal operating leverage from anticipated revenue growth, the Company will be undertaking actions to further align its cost structure for improved profitability towards achieving its near-term goal of 8% Adjusted EBITDA margin. For the full year, the Company will also be launching a significant initiative to replace its legacy system supporting its largest business, travel nurse staffing.\nQ1 2018 Range Year-over-Year Sequential Change Change Revenue $205 million - $210 million (1)% - 1% (7)% - (4)% Gross Profit Margin 25.5% - 26.0% (20) bps - 30 bps (100) bps - (50) bps Adjusted EBITDA $6 million - $7 million (7)% - 8% (51)% - (43)% Adjusted EPS $0.01 - $0.03 $(0.04) - $(0.02) $(0.16) - $(0.14) The estimates above are based on current management expectations and, as such, are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. The quarterly guidance reflects approximately 70 to 80 basis points associated with the annual payroll tax reset. The above ranges do not include the potential impact of any future divestitures, mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations, any impairment charges or valuation allowances, any acquisition-related measurement period adjustments, changes in debt structure, or any material legal or restructuring charges.

(b) Acquisition and integration costs are primarily related to legal and advisory fees for the Advantage RN, LLC acquisition that closed effective July 1, 2017. (c) Restructuring costs related to severance and lease consolidations incurred as part of our separate and discrete cost savings initiatives. (d) Impairment charges (noncash) of $14.4 million ($12.1 million after taxes) related to goodwill and trade names of Physician Staffing are included in the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. The year ended December 31, 2016 includes noncash impairment charges of $24.3 million ($17.3 million after taxes) related to Physician Staffing goodwill, trade names, and customer relations. (e) Loss (gain) on derivative liability represents the change in the fair value of embedded features of our Convertible Notes up until their repayment. (f) Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 is related to the Company's settlement of its convertible notes on March 17, 2017. Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to the write-off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs as well as transaction fees and expenses related to the extinguishment of the Company's subordinated term loan. (g) Income tax benefit for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily a result of a release of valuation allowances on the Company’s deferred tax assets totaling $42.5 million, offset by an $8.0 million reduction in the Company’s net deferred tax assets (relating to the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). (h) When applying the if-converted method to its Convertible Notes, 723,519 shares were included in diluted weighted average shares for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 3,521,126 shares were included for the year ended December 31, 2016. (i) Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measure, is defined as net income attributable to common shareholders before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, loss (gain) on derivative liability, loss on early extinguishment of debt, other income, net, equity compensation, and includes net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiary. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and as one performance measure in its incentive programs for certain members of its management team. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, closely matches the operating measure typically used in the Company's credit facilities in calculating various ratios. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by the Company's consolidated revenue. (j) Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders per diluted share before the diluted EPS impact of acquisition-related contingent considertion, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, loss (gain) on derivative liability, loss on early extinguishment of debt, and non-recurring income tax adjustments. Adjusted EPS should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EPS because it believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful supplement to its reported EPS as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EPS as one performance measure in its annual cash incentive program for certain members of its management team. Management believes it provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance from period to period and is more representative of the future earnings capacity of the Company.\n(k) Due to the Company previously maintaining a full valuation allowance, there was no tax impact on non-GAAP measures with the exception of the impact of impairment charges on goodwill. (l) Segment data provided is in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the FASB ASC. (m) Contribution income is defined as income or loss from operations before depreciation and amortization, acquisition-related contingent consideration, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, impairment charges, and corporate expenses not specifically identified to a reporting segment. Contribution income is a financial measure used by management when assessing segment performance. (n) Unallocated corporate overhead includes corporate compensation and benefits, and general and administrative expenses including rent and utilities, computer supplies and expenses, insurance, professional expenses, corporate-wide projects (initiatives), and public company expense. (o) Gross profit is defined as revenue from services less direct operating expenses. The Company's gross profit excludes allocated depreciation and amortization expense. Gross profit margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue from services. (p) FTEs represent the average number of Nurse and Allied Staffing contract personnel on a full-time equivalent basis. (q) Average revenue per FTE per day is calculated by dividing the Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue per FTE by the number of days worked in the respective periods. Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue also includes revenue from the permanent placement of nurses. (r) Days filled is calculated by dividing the total hours invoiced during the period by 8 hours. This method does not reflect the impact of revenue generated from permanent placements, reimbursed expenses, discounts and allowances, and the impact from accruals and adjustments recorded for financial statement purposes. (s) Revenue per day filled is calculated by dividing revenue invoiced by days filled for the period presented.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006476/en/\nCross Country Healthcare, Inc.\nWilliam J.
