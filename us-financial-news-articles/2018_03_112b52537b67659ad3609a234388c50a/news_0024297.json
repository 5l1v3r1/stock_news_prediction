Morgan Private Bank's Jack Caffrey told CNBC's \" Futures Now \" on Tuesday. \"That's what investors and traders have to always dial back and forth between â€” what's news, what's noise.\"\nThe firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson coupled with the possibility of more severe tariffs on China from the Trump administration sent benchmark indexes sharply lower on Tuesday.\nA wave of policy change from D.C. has set markets on edge in recent weeks. Those changes include the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs, new Federal Reserve leadership in Jerome Powell and the resignation of top economic adviser Gary Cohn from the Trump administration.\n\"Whether it's policy, whether it's the personnel behind the policy or whether it's even just the outlook, that winds up being incorporated into valuations in the shorter term,\" said Caffrey.\nAs political uncertainty threatens to disrupt the market rally, Caffrey says investors should focus on the fundamentals as the real market driver.
