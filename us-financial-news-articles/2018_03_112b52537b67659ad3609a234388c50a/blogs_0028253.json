That is the highest since January 2014.\nHigher interest rates caused applications to refinance a home loan to fall 2 percent for the week and 18 percent from a year ago, when rates were lower. The refinance share of all mortgage applications fell to 40 percent, the lowest since 2008.\nMortgage applications to purchase a home did manage to eke out a slight gain, up 3 percent for the week and also up 3 percent from a year ago.\n\"Although the purchase market continues to be constrained by a lack of supply, applications for home purchase loans increased to the highest level in over a month, as demographic and economic conditions remain favorable for housing demand,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist.\nThe shortage of existing homes for sale has more buyers looking to new construction. Mortgage applications to purchase a newly built home rose 4.6 percent in February from a year ago.\nHousing is more expensive today than it has been in a decade, and a decade ago credit was a lot easier to get. The average monthly mortgage payment is now up nearly 13 percent from a year ago, according to Realtor.com â€” a combination of higher home prices and higher interest rates.\nWhile there is plenty of demand for homes, it is mostly on the low end of the market, where supply is leanest, so buyers are having to increase their purchase budgets if they can, along with paying higher rates. That is resulting in fewer sales overall.\n\"Buyers can expect to see more of their paychecks go to their mortgage payments this year,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. \"This spring's homebuyers will have to decide: Do they give up some desired home features to get into that lower price range, or do they dig deeper into their wallets?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T13:13:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
