Putin won a landslide victory in Sunday’s presidential election, extending his rule over the world’s largest country for another six years at a time when his ties with the West are on a hostile trajectory. “I congratulated him on the victory, the electoral victory,” Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “The call had to do also with the fact that we will probably get together in the not too distant future so we can discuss arms, we can discuss the arms race.” The White House later said there were no specific plans for a summit meeting. Speaking of the arms race, Trump said: “We will never allow anybody to have anything even close to what we have.” Trump’s administration last week accused Russia of hacking into America’s energy grid and approved the first sanctions on Russian entities and individuals for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The United States also joined Britain, France and Germany in demanding that Russia explain a military-grade nerve toxin attack in England on a former Russian double agent, with Trump saying last week: “It certainly looks like the Russians were behind” the incident. Trump, who vowed to improve relations with Russia on taking office 14 months ago, has been under pressure from Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, to take a tougher stance on Putin, his inner circle and scores of Russian oligarchs. Republican U.S. Senator John McCain chastised Trump for the congratulatory call. “An American president does not lead the Free World by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,” McCain said in a statement.

Moscow and Washington are at odds over Ukraine and Syria, while U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election, something Moscow denies, continue to cast a shadow over ties. Trump has said there was no collusion between his presidential campaign and Russians. Putin and Trump agreed on the need to work together to avoid a possible arms race, the Kremlin said, adding: “Special attention was devoted to working through the question of a possible high-level meeting.” Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T17:15:03.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
