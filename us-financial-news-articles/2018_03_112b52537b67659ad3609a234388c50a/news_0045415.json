Under his leadership, JLL provides integrated facility management services for healthcare and life science facilities across the country, including many major healthcare systems. Bulgarelli’s client experience includes: Kindred Healthcare, Adventist Health and Main Line Health and many Fortune 100 companies. He oversees 1,500 dedicated healthcare professionals who serve 540 hospitals and their ambulatory portfolios across the U.S. Prior to his current role, Bulgarelli was Executive Managing Director, Healthcare Solutions, where he oversaw the establishment and management of an integrated healthcare services business, one of JLL’s fastest growing businesses.

Following the acquisition, the Ventas MOB business has grown by more than seven times, reaching nearly 20 million sq. ft. in 32 states and covering more than 400 relationships with leading health systems. In September 2016, Ventas acquired its university-based life science business and has since grown its overall life science footprint by nearly 40 percent, with cumulative investments approximating $2 billion.\n“Todd is an icon in the medical office space,” said Cafaro. “It has been a great privilege to partner with Todd over the last eight years as he led the growth and operations of our world-class medical office franchise with integrity and an unwavering focus on supporting clients, patients and physicians. Todd has an exceptional legacy and I thank him from all of us at Ventas for his countless contributions to our company and our team.”\n“I am proud of our team’s accomplishments over the last 25 years as we paved the way for the MOB space as a highly valuable institutional asset class,” said Lillibridge. “Pete inherits a strong business, excellent portfolio and great team as he joins us. We have selected a strong executive in Pete, whose deep healthcare, life science and university relationships, pertinent experience and focus on customers will help to sustain our long track record of growth, innovation and value creation.”\nVentas, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a leading real estate investment trust.
