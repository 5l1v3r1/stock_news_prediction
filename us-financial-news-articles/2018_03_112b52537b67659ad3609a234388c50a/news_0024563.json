Apple uses the event to introduce developers to new tools that run on its operating systems. The first devices that launch with the new software typically debut later. An iPhone with iOS 12 probably won't launch until September, if Apple follows its typical launch schedule. Expect new features for Apple TV, the Apple Watch and perhaps even Apple's new smart speaker, HomePod.\nIn the past, Apple has also occasionally used the event to show off new hardware. Last year, for example, Apple also announced a new 10.5-inch iPad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T19:31:39.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
