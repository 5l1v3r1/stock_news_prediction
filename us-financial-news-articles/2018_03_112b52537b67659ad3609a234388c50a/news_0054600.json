REUTERS/Ashlee Espinal Prosecutors made their request in a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and are also seeking a $2 million fine.\nThe request came four weeks after Ng’s lawyers urged that their 69-year-old client be sentenced to time served, and allowed to return to his family in China.\nLawyers for Ng did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ng’s sentencing by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick is scheduled for May 11. Probation officials recommended a six-year prison term.\nNg was convicted on all six counts he faced, including bribery, money laundering and corruption, after a four-week trial and less than a day of jury deliberations.\nProsecutors accused him of paying more than $1 million of bribes to officials including the late former U.N. General Assembly President John Ashe.\nThey said Ng hoped the conference center, which was never built, would pave the way for luxury housing, hotels, a shopping mall, marinas and a heliport, turning Macau into the “Geneva of Asia” and winning himself fame and greater riches.\n“The defendant, a sophisticated, international businessman, repeatedly used his wealth and power to seek to corrupt decision-making at the United Nations,” prosecutors said in Friday’s filing. “That was a choice. It warrants substantial and meaningful punishment.”\nDefense lawyers have said Ng’s goals were consistent with the types of public-private partnerships that the United Nations favors, and that other diplomats abused Ng’s trust.\nIn their sentencing request, they called it “far more reasonable” to conclude that Ng’s motivations were patriotic and philanthropic.\nThey also said there was “no chance of recidivism,” and that Ng could assure the court that once in China, he would not seek to return to the United States or conduct business there.\nNg has been allowed to live in his Manhattan apartment under 24-hour guard on $50 million bail. He was arrested in 2015.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T01:44:34.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
