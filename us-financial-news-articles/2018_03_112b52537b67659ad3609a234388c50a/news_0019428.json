REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo Eurostat confirmed its earlier estimate that the economy of the 19 countries sharing the euro zone grew by 0.6 percent month-on-month and by 2.7 percent year-on-year.\nThat followed expansion of 0.7 percent and 2.7 percent respectively in the third quarter.\nOverall in 2017, euro zone GDP rose 2.3 percent, Eurostat said, the fastest rate of growth since a 3.0 percent rise in 2007. It had previously estimated 2017 growth at 2.5 percent. It said its revision was due to the removal of calendar day adjustments.\nThe fourth-quarter expansion was on a par with that of the United States quarter-on-quarter and above the U.S. year-on-year growth rate of 2.5 percent.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:00:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
