In conjunction with this release, the Company has posted an updated investor presentation to its website at www.eclipseresources.com .\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nAverage net daily production was 311.7 MMcfe per day, consisting of 74% natural gas and 26% liquids. Realized an average natural gas price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives and firm transportation expenses, of $2.55 per Mcf, a $0.38 per Mcf discount to the average monthly NYMEX settled natural gas price during the quarter. Realized an average oil price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives, of $49.61 per barrel, a $5.66 per barrel discount to the average WTI oil price during the quarter. Realized an average natural gas liquids (“NGL”) price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives, of $31.16 per barrel, or approximately 56% of the average WTI oil price during the quarter. Per unit cash production costs (including lease operating, transportation, gathering and compression, production and ad valorem taxes) were $1.49 per Mcfe, including $0.34 per Mcfe in firm transportation expenses. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $13.1 million; and Adjusted EBITDAX 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $53.5 million.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights:\nAverage net daily production was 310.7 MMcfe per day, consisting of 77% natural gas and 23% liquids. Realized an average natural gas price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives and firm transportation expenses, of $2.76 per Mcf, a $0.35 per Mcf discount to the average monthly NYMEX settled natural gas price during the year. Realized an average oil price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives, of $46.04 per barrel, a $4.76 per barrel discount to the average WTI oil price during the year. Realized an average natural gas liquids price, before the impact of cash settled derivatives, of $23.62 per barrel, or approximately 46% of the average WTI oil price during the year. Per unit cash production costs (including lease operating, transportation, gathering and compression, production and ad valorem taxes) were $1.35 per Mcfe, including $0.34 per Mcfe in firm transportation expenses. Net income for the year was $8.5 million; and Adjusted EBITDAX 1 for the year was $189.1 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 were $314.1 million, including $246.4 million for drilling and completions, $10.5 million for midstream expenditures, $55.9 million for land-related expenditures, and $1.3 million for corporate-related expenditures Proved reserves grew 211% over the previous year to approximately 1.46 Tcfe at SEC pricing and by 19% to approximately 1.46 Tcfe based on forward NYMEX strip pricing; Finding and Development costs, including revisions, for fiscal 2017 decreased to $0.26 per Mcfe, utilizing drilling and completion costs, and $0.31 per Mcfe including all capital uses.\n1 Non-GAAP measure. See reconciliation for details\nBenjamin W. Hulburt, Chairman, President and CEO, commented on the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, “During 2017, Eclipse Resources had substantial operational and strategic success leading to an expansion in our asset base, a substantial increase in cash flow and the addition of a strategic joint venture partner. Through these actions, we increased our acreage footprint by 57%, generated 85% year over year growth in EBITDAX, to a company record of approximately $189 million and commenced a $290 million joint venture process.\nAs we highlighted during our analyst day, the strategic shift toward increasing activity in our liquids area has allowed us to capture the benefit of the recovery in oil prices and to exceed our full year 2017 guidance for both oil and NGL production. In 2018, the Company plans to turn 13 gross (9 net) Utica Condensate wells with an average lateral length of 16,325 feet to sales, resulting in over 40% oil production growth year over year. The first of which was very recently put to sales with an initial production rate of approximately 2,000 BOE per day consisting of 60% in total liquids, including approximately 735 barrels of oil, from a well with a completed lateral length of 15,600 feet. As the well is continuing to unload water and undergoing our managed flowback procedure we expect the well’s production to continue to increase by approximately 15-20% before hitting peak production over the next two weeks. We expect to put the two remaining wells on the pad with similar lateral lengths to sales over the course of the coming week. In addition, the Company has recently turned to sales two Marcellus Condensate wells with initial production characteristics exceeding expectations on Mcfe basis, and we will continue to evaluate the performance of these wells.\nAs 2018 continues to unfold, we will focus on corporate level returns and seek to improve these returns by focusing on optimization of our drilling and completions approach on a pad by pad and well by well basis. This approach will seek to vary items including proppant concentrations, stage spacing, cluster spacing, lateral length, intra-lateral spacing, wells per pad, first well spud to pad turn to sales cycle time, and most importantly the interrelationship between each of these variables as a means of maximizing returns on each well we drill rather than trying to maximize production or EURs at any cost. At the corporate level we then focus on full cycle returns which incorporate land, G&A, and hedges to ensure we are exceeding our weighted average cost of capital. We have tied our compensation structure to this approach as well which requires a frequent “lookback” on actual results to calculate our full cycle internal rate of return on every well using actual timing of capital and turn to sales, drilling and completion costs, cash flows and incorporating our best estimate of forward cash flows at current forward strip prices. We will also continue to produce our wells in a way that maximizes rate while maintaining the fracture network to accelerate cash flows up to the point where we believe we would begin to impact well performance.\nDuring 2018, we plan to drill 33 gross wells with an average lateral length of approximately 16,800 feet, 73% of which are expected to be “Super-Laterals” with lateral extensions exceeding 15,000 feet. This represents a 24% increase in average lateral footage per well over 2017 and remains well above any of our peers. While leading the industry on lateral lengths should allow us to continue to lower our cost per foot of lateral, we have also taken significant steps to manage our well costs through innovation, including reduced plug drill out times, expanding the use of a bi-fuel fleet, the continued evolution of engineered completions and the optimization of proppant loading.\nDespite a significant amount of volatility during the fourth quarter of 2017 in natural gas prices, we have again been able to deliver a strong natural gas realized price, as recent firm transportation projects have created incremental unutilized capacity and new buyers needing to fill this capacity. We have also taken advantage of this volatility by adding to our hedge portfolio, with the goal of retaining upside participation if the natural gas price increases. Lastly, I am extremely pleased with our team’s continued ability to find creative solutions to build our business, from the execution of our previously-announced joint venture agreement with Sequel Energy to our accretive acquisition of the Flat Castle acreage, which marks another year of accomplishments that we believe have put us on a path for a successful future.”\nOperational Discussion\nThe Company’s production for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is set forth in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Production: Natural gas (MMcf) 21,178.5 16,563.9 87,404.2 60,921.9 NGLs (Mbbls) 711.0 721.1 2,713.7 2,446.2 Oil (Mbbls) 539.2 433.4 1,622.4 1,343.8 Total (MMcfe) 28,679.7 23,490.9 113,420.8 83,661.9 Average daily production volume: Natural gas (Mcf/d) 230,201 180,042 239,464 166,453 NGLs (Bbls/d) 7,728 7,838 7,435 6,684 Oil (Bbls/d) 5,861 4,711 4,445 3,672 Total (MMcfe/d) 311.7 255.3 310.7 228.6 Market Conditions\nPrices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows.
