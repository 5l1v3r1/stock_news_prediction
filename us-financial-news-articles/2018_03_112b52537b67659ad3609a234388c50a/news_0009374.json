The draft includes banning the usage of palm oil in motor fuels from 2021.\nMah said Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest producer of the oil used in everything from soap to foodstuffs, would withhold cooperation on trade talks if the E.U. move is confirmed. A significant portion of the palm oil exported to the E.U. is used as feedstock to make biofuel, leaving Malaysia’s producers fearing overall demand will fall.\n“There will be no trade negotiations until we solve the palm oil issue,” Mah said in a speech, describing the E.U.’s plan as “discrimination”.\nThe European Union is the world’s second-largest palm oil importer after India, having bought 6.7 million tonnes in 2016/17, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.\nCommenting on India’s recent move to increase import duties on palm oil, Mah said the trend of increasing duties is a protectionist policy.\n“We will write to our Indian counterparts to ask them to consider,” he told, speaking to reporters at a news conference after his speech.\nIndia has raised import tax on crude and refined palm oil to the highest level in more than a decade, the government said in a statement last Thursday, in a move designed to support local farmers.
