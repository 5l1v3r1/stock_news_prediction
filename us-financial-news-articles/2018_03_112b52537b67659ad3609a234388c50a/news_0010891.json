The affected employees all will return to work â€” either at Michigan Assembly or at another Ford facility.\"\nThe Ranger, a half-sized pickup, is expected later in 2018 and the Bronco, an SUV, in 2020. Ford produced the Bronco for three decades before pulling the model in 1996. It sold the Ranger in North America until 2011, and has since made the truck for some international markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T17:15:38.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
