To support these efforts, Nordstrom announced it has closed deals to acquire two leading retail technology companies: BevyUp, the innovators behind a digital selling tool, and MessageYes, a platform rooted in conversational commerce.\n\"The retail environment is changing faster than ever, but the value of service, speed, convenience and newness remain constant,\" said Brian Gill, technology senior vice president at Nordstrom. \"To continue to be successful into the future, we need to invest in technologies that will enable us to deliver on those qualities and better serve customers in a digitally-connected world.\"\nThe two deals are a part of the retailer's innovative approach to creating a seamless shopping experience for customers. To serve customers on their terms, Nordstrom is looking at ways technology can support the evolution of the customer experience.\n\"We're investing in providing our salespeople with a mobile suite of capabilities that enables them to be relevant, informative and accessible to our customers,\" said Gill. \"As a leader in retail technology and an existing Nordstrom partner, BevyUp is uniquely positioned to help us deliver for our people and our customers.\"\nBevyUp's digital selling platform will be incorporated into a new, integrated mobile Nordstrom employee app that will be rolled out in the coming year.\n\"BevyUp was founded on the simple idea that retailers could develop meaningful connections with their customers. We've helped revolutionize the customer experience by extending a salesperson's relationships beyond the confines of brick-and-mortar stores. Becoming a part of the Nordstrom team gives us the opportunity to take our combined efforts even farther,\" said Mauricio Cuevas, founder and CEO of BevyUp.\n\"MessageYes marks a meaningful addition to our existing depth of talent and experience in engineering, data science and machine learning – all skills that are essential to our future growth,\" said Gill. \"We share the same vision for the future of retail, and their team will accelerate our efforts to deliver a meaningful, personalized experience for our customers.\"\n\"Personalized shopping has long been our focus, and it's something that's been core to Nordstrom since they were founded back in 1901,\" said Dave Cotter, founder and CEO of MessageYes. \"Nordstrom has succeeded in building emotional relationships with their customers – creating connections that go well beyond a transaction.
