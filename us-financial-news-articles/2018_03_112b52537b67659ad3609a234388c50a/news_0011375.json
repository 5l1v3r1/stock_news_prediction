Output hit a record 10.057 million bpd in November, according to the U.S. Energy Department.\nBMI Research said in a note to clients on Tuesday that it has revised its 2018 Brent crude price forecast upward to $67 a barrel due to \"accelerated market rebalancing and strong sentiment-driven support.\"\n\"We maintain that firming global demand and weaker supply growth will support crude prices over 2018,\" the note added.\nElsewhere, Libya's El Sharara oil field resumed operations on Monday. The field, operated by Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC), was shut down on Sunday after a landowner closed a valve on a pipeline crossing his land.
