Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, will accelerate investment in 2014 to open more new stores after results last year were hit by falling currencies outside the euro zone and the cost of revamping flagship stores.REUTERS/Andrea Comas Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 2.3 percent year-on-year increase. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent monthly rise and a 2.1 percent annual gain.\nEurostat also revised upwards the data for December to -1.0 on the month and 2.1 percent on year from -1.1 and 1.9 percent respectively.\nThe data showed the year-on-year number in January was mainly influenced by a 3.8 percent rise in the sales of non-food products, an acceleration from 3.0 percent in December. Of those non-food products, sales via mail order and over the internet jumped 8.8 percent, up from a 7.5 percent rise in December.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:08:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
