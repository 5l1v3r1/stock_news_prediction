Spainâ€™s loss meant Romania finished second in the standings behind already-qualified Georgia and the Romanians join Japan, Ireland and Scotland in World Cup Pool A. Japan and Romania meet in the first match of the World Cup at the Tokyo Stadium on Sept. 20, 2019. The final team in Pool A will be decided via a two-legged playoff in June between Samoa and the runners-up of European qualifying. Spain need to beat Portugal in a playoff to make the two-legged tie against Samoa in order to reach the World Cup. If they beat Portugal but lose to Samoa, Spain will play in a four-team repechage event in November in a last attempt to make the tournament for the second time following their appearance in 1999.
