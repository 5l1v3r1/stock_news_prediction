Bach, CFA®, CFP®, was recently promoted to vice president and will head up operations at the new RMB office, located at 3800 American Blvd. West, Suite 780 in Bloomington, Minn. Bach, who was raised in Minnesota and is a Minnetonka High School graduate, joined RMB in 2014 while living in Chicago. After years of frequent travel to meet with clients, Bach welcomed the opportunity to move back to the area and help expand RMB’s footprint.\n“We’ve had advisors coming back and forth to this area regularly for about a decade and decided it was time to put down roots,” said Dimitri Eliopoulos, RMB partner and managing director. “In a market like Minneapolis-St. Paul, we believe we stand out as an independent firm that blends expertise in financial planning with sophisticated, customized investment solutions. Combining this with Chris’s passion, dedication, and connection to the community should continue to open many doors for us here.”\nOutgrowths of RMB’s wealth management business include retirement plan consulting, corporate executive services, and a growing family office services practice, which is partially due to its recent combination with Milwaukee-based Jacobus Wealth Management (“JWM”). Chris’s father Peter Bach, CPA, former chairman and CEO of JWM and now managing director at RMB, will assist the new location in a business development role as he splits his time between Milwaukee and Minneapolis.\n“I see it as a triple win for clients, the firm, and me personally,” said Chris Bach. “I get to spend more time with my clients, who are really excited about our commitment to the Twin Cities, and the opportunity to be even closer to their advisory team. I’m now able to increase my involvement as an active member of the business and social community here, which will help create opportunities to introduce more people to RMB. My wife and I are thrilled to be back in our hometown where we met as high school sweethearts, raising our newborn son in close proximity to very happy grandparents.”\nPrior to joining RMB, Chris Bach served as a senior analyst for HSBC North America Holdings. He holds a bachelor’s degree in finance from Indiana University and is a CFA® charterholder and a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional.\nCFA® and Chartered Financial Analyst® are registered trademarks owned by CFA Institute.\nCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. owns the certification marks CFP®, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER TM and federally registered CFP (with flame design) in the U.S., which it awards to individuals who successfully complete CFP Board's initial and ongoing certification requirements.\nABOUT RMB CAPITAL\nRMB Capital is an independent investment and advisory firm.
