The Board reached that decision following his notification to the Board that he has decided to explore the possibility of making a proposal to acquire Qualcomm. The Board will consist of 10 directors effective as of the holding of the annual meeting.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Broadcom's takeover proposal, Qualcomm is focused on executing its business plan and maximizing value for shareholders as an independent company.

The Board is grateful to Dr. Jacobs for his decades of service and for the commitment, experience and vision he has brought to that service. The Board thanks him for his many contributions to Qualcomm.\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.
