As a result, it has slashed costs and ticket prices.\nThis year will be the first in which all the attractions are fully open.\n“I am optimistic, personally, about the performance for the beginning of the year,” Mohamed Almulla, chief executive and managing director, said in an interview. “It’s a long-term investment. The park is not something we can turn around easily.”\nHe said visitor numbers were positive, without elaborating, following a December in which the park achieved the highest daily visitation to date. For the fourth quarter visits were 795,746, up from 478,987 in the previous quarter.\nIt said the 1.12 billion dirhams in losses for 2017 included 478 million dirhams in non-cash depreciation expenses which it said was normal for a large-scale project.\nDXB Entertainments, of which Qatar Holding is also a shareholder, said the debt restructuring includes a three-year moratorium on principal repayments and covenant testing as well as a revised repayment schedule. DXB Entertainments will continue paying interest on the debt as per the original agreement.\nIt is the second Dubai-based entertainment operator taking steps to restructure its debt. Ilyas & Mustafa Galadari Group (IMG), the Dubai-based operator of the world’s largest indoor theme park, is in talks with banks to restructure a 1.2 billion-dirham syndicated loan, Reuters reported last month.
