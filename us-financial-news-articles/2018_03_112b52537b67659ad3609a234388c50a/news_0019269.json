The bank’s troubles mainly related to bad commercial property loans, many of which were acquired through its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 2009.\nLast June, Co-op Bank agreed a 700 million pound ($973 million) financial rescue package with its leading hedge fund investors, the bank’s second major rescue deal in five years following its near-collapse in 2013.\nThe Treasury said the investigation should look at a range of criteria encompassing how the FSA evaluated Co-op Bank’s suitability for the bid and whether it should have intervened.\nThese include looking into the FSA’s stress-testing and analysis of the bank, the bank’s impairment profile and whether the regulator could have acted differently.\n“Since it was established in 2013, the PRA has been committed to learning the lessons of the past and the findings of this review will help the PRA meet its objectives in future,” the PRA said in a statement, welcoming the Treasury’s order.\nThe Treasury said the PRA should conduct the investigation within one year from the date of Zelmer’s appointment.\n$1 = 0.7221 pounds Reporting by Emma Rumney, writing by Sinead Cruise and Emma Rumney, editing by Jason Neely and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:46:36.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
