Supplies are limited in the market,” he said.\nIn January, imports fell 14 percent from the same month the previous year to 41.3 tonnes.\nIn March, imports could rise back above 80 tonnes due to Akshay Tritiya festival next month, a gold dealer with a separate private bank said.\nIndians will celebrate Akshay Tritiya festival in mid-April, when buying gold is considered auspicious.\n“Wedding season will pick up from next month. That will also boost demand,” the gold dealer said.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:17:51.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
