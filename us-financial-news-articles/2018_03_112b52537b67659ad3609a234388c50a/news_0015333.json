Despite women’s growing importance to China’s economy, they still lack equality of opportunity in business and politics, according to women’s rights activists.\nChinese women earn 22 percent less than men per month, with the gap being wider in higher level positions, which are more often occupied by men, the Chinese jobs website Zhaopin said in a report. Only a quarter of Chinese lawmakers are women.\n“The mainstream of Chinese society has not talked about real women’s rights issues on International Women’s Day for a long time,” said Xiao Meili, a well-known feminist activist.\n“They don’t even dare use the three words ‘funujie’,” she said, referring to the original name of “Women’s Day” in China, which has connotations of working women.\n“They always say ‘Queen’s Day’ or ‘Goddess Day’, as if this is the day when everyday women finally have the chance to be doted on. It’s just consumerist feminism,” added Xiao.\nInstead of shopping, Chinese women should take action to combat sexual harassment as part of a Chinese #MeToo-style movement, the Beijing-based Feminist Voices group, said on the popular Chinese social media app WeChat.\nChinese students, professors and women’s rights activists have been calling for more to be done to stamp out sexual harassment on college campuses, after a viral public accusation of sexual harassment was made by a graduate of Beijing’s Beihang University against her former professor.\nReporting by Stella Qiu and Christian Shepherd; Additional reporting by Zhang Min and Cate Cadell; Editing by Philip McClellan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T09:13:49.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
