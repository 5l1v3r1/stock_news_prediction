Interested parties may view this letter here .\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue decreased 2% to $533,000, compared to $543,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting a decrease in third party revenue due to the sale of a building in Tempe, AZ in March 2017, offset by an increase in revenues generated from related party leases. Operating expenses decreased 50% to $329,000, down from $652,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Income from operations was $204,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a loss from operations of $109,000 for the fourth quarter last year. Net income was $189,000, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(166,000), or $(0.01) per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.
