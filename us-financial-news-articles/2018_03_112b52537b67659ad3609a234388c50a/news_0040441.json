Drawing from his past experience in government, Camacho, the former Philippine secretary of finance, said strong leaders were necessary for the implementation of economic reforms.\nIn particular, Camacho said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's strong leadership gave him the ability to push for radical reforms that would have been \"inconceivable\" under previous administrations, including a highly awaited tax reform.\nDuterte has enjoyed strong support in the country, with Reuters reporting in January that satisfaction with the president's administration rose to record levels in a December poll. Still, the Philippine leader has drawn criticism for his violent war on drugs and human rights track record.\n— CNBC's Nyshka Chandran contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T09:27:25.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
