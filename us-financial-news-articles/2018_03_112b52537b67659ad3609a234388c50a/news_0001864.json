It's been a very, very unfair trade situation.\"\nIn an interview with \" Closing Bell ,\" Burns said, \"The president continues to go after the European Union and describe them as strategic competitor rather than partner.\"\n\n\"This is a really difficult place for the United States to be, and it's not a good place to be. These are our allies in Europe,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, it is China that's the major trade violator in the world, said Burns, who served as U.S. ambassador to NATO and was the State Department's third-ranking official during George W. Bush 's presidency. He also advised the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. \n\"The president just doesn't have it quite right. I understand … he's trying to treat China respectfully because he needs them on North Korea ,\" he said. \"You've got to be a little bit more honest and transparent about our long-standing trade differences with the Chinese government.\"\nDuring the news conference Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. has a deficit of about $500 billion a year with China. \"We're doing things with China which are very strong, but they understand it,\" he said.\nThe tariff talk has spurred fears of a trade war. When asked if that would happen, Trump said, \"We'll have to see,\" but added, \"When we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad.\"\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Burns' remarks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T01:15:32.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
