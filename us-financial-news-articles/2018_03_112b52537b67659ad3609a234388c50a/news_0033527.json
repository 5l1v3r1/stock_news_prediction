Many stock futures were also down, including were Eurostoxx futures and Dax futures “There are some technical problems for the T7 system which has caused some delays. It’s under investigation currently and we will have updates on our production newsboard. As of now I have no further details on when it will be resolved,” said a Eurex representative.
