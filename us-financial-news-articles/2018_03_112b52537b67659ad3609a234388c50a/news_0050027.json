But he warned that congressional testimonies or publishing lists of candidates could “preclude a set of very high accomplished and qualified candidates from even entering the pool.”\n“That’s human nature,” he said. “I don’t think you’re going to be able to change that.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T01:06:04.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
