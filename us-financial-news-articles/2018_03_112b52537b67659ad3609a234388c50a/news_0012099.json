He’s hit the scoresheet in 26 straight games played - a three-game hiatus due to a knee injury breaking up the run - in which he’s collected 18 goals and 38 points.\nGoalie Keith Kinkaid made 29 saves in the win at Prudential Center, which snaps New Jersey’s three-game losing skid, on a night his teammates provided an offensive onslaught.\nStefan Noesen opened the scoring 8:25 into the tilt. Zajac gained the puck deep in the offensive zone and passed it to Will Butcher for the point shot that Noesen deflected behind Montreal goalie Charlie Lindgren.\nBlake Coleman doubled the lead at 16:33 with a rebound goal. Butcher’s point shot was stopped but the besieged Canadiens netminder couldn’t corral it and Coleman was on the spot.\nThen Zajac collected two man-advantage markers 100 seconds apart. His first at 18:08 was another redirection of a point shot - this one coming off the stick of Kyle Palmieri - that went through the legs of Patrick Maroon as he set the screen. Zajac’s second came when Lindgren stopped Hall’s shot but had no chance on the rebound offering that was fired top corner with 11.3 seconds remaining in the frame.\nAfter Montreal’s Brendan Gallagher put the visitors on the board just past the midway point with his third goal in four games, Patrick Maroon netted New Jersey’s third power-play goal of the game in as many opportunities at 11:36. Brian Boyle made it a 6-1 game at 16:14.\nWhile the Devils pulled their foot off the gas, Montreal made it respectable thanks to a couple of goals by Jacob de la Rose, one coming with 15.7 seconds left in the second period and the other with 5:20 remaining, and Byron Froese rounded out the scoring with 59 seconds remaining.\nLindgren stopped 27 shots for Montreal.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:27:20.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
