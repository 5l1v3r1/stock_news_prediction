Shares of miner Vale SA subtracted the most points from Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index as soft Chinese demand hammered iron ore futures. Concerns of a global trade war also hurt demand for commodity-linked assets, especially after China warned it will respond \"as necessary\" should such a conflict emerge with the United States. Nervousness around U.S. President Donald Trump's recent plan to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum exports has kept a lid on gains in emerging markets as investors refrained from making risky investments. Shares in Embraer SA dropped 3.8 percent after the planemaker reporter lower-than-expected quarterly profits due to weaker deliveries to airlines and writedowns. Retailers with a heavy online presence, such as Magazine Luiza SA and Via Varejo SA, also fell after Reuters reported that Amazon.com Inc is discussing plans to stock and sell products from consumer electronics to perfume in the country. Shares of Localiza Rent a Car SA, however, jumped 6.7 percent to an all-time high after fourth-quarter net income surged 27 percent. Latin American currencies seesawed as investors awaited new developments regarding Trump's protectionist plans. Such concerns also drove prices of copper lower, pushing the Chilean peso to a one-month low.
