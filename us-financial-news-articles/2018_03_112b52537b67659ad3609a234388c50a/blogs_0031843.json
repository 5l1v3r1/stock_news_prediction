The five passengers who were wearing harnesses drowned. Only the pilot escaped. \n“Operators, pilots, and consumers should be aware of the hazard presented by supplemental restraint devices in the event of an emergency evacuation during ‘doors off’ flights,” the FAA said in a statement Friday. \nThe FAA said that helicopter operators must suspend the use of such harnesses until ways can be found to mitigate risks posed by restraints that can’t be released quickly in an emergency. The agency also said it would review its policies on such flights to see if there are other “safety gaps” for passengers. \nDoors-off flights, which have gained in popularity, offer unencumbered views and are popular for photography, but they require the complicated safety harnesses. \nThe parents of one of the victims of the crash, 26-year-old Trevor Cadigan, have filed a lawsuit against Liberty Helicopters , of Kearny, N.J., saying the company was “grossly negligent and reckless” for placing him in a harness from which it was difficult to escape. \nThe National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the harnesses. It is also probing why the helicopter was forced to land on the river and why the helicopter’s inflatable pontoons didn’t keep the aircraft from rolling over. \nSo far, investigators found nothing wrong with the helicopter’s engine or flight controls before the crash. —Andy Pasztor contributed to this article. \nWrite to Paul Berger at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T03:09:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
