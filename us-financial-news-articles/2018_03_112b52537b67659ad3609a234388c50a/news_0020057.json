To prove compliance, refiners must earn or purchase tradeable blending credits, known as RINs - the price of which has skyrocketed in recent years.\nThe program, established in 2007 to help farmers and cut petroleum imports, has been an economic driver in corn-states like Iowa, but merchant refiners say the increasing compliance costs are overly burdensome and put jobs at risk.\nPES, which employs over 1,000 people in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania, in January blamed its bankruptcy on the costs of the credits. Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in its bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners.\nBut the company’s financial meltdown has heaped pressure on the White House and lawmakers to address biofuels policy.\nLast week, President Donald Trump waded deeper into the issue when he told rival groups gathered at the White House that he supported a compromise that temporarily caps credit prices to lower refinery costs, while also lifting restrictions on higher-ethanol blended gasoline to boost corn growers.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency currently limits gasoline to 10 percent ethanol during the summer months, a move intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season.\nLike past efforts to overhaul the RFS, Trump’s proposal faces political and legal challenges from ethanol industry advocates that worry a credit price cap would undermine the biofuel program.\nAnother White House meeting initially planned for this week to further discuss the idea may get postponed for logistical reasons, two sources said. In the meantime, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are preparing an analysis of Trump’s proposals for the White House, the sources said.\nOutside the White House talks, Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas is also drafting a bill that would alter the RFS to help refiners - though the key elements of his plan also face resistance.
