Chung said on Tuesday he had a message from Kim Jong Un he will relay to U.S. officials.\nThe U.S. State Department said on Tuesday that the United States and South Korea are discussing holding a meeting later this week about potential decentralization talks with North Korea.\n“The State Department has been speaking with the White House about the proposed upcoming meeting later this week,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing.\n“In terms of the meeting with South Korea and also with the DPRK (North Korea), we don’t have a play-by-play of that just yet. We will wait for the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to come to Washington to be able to brief us on those meetings.”\nChung cited North Korea as saying it would not carry out nuclear or missile tests while talks with the international community were under way. North Korea has not carried out any such tests since last November.\nNorth Korea is also willing to discuss normalizing ties with the United States, Chung said.\nNorth Korea seems “sincere” in its apparent willingness to halt nuclear tests if it held decentralization talks with the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday as U.S., South Korean and Japanese officials voiced scepticism about any discussions.\nAfter returning from the United States, the South Korean officials will split up and Chung will visit China and Russia, while Suh will head to Japan to speak to officials in the respective countries on the latest detente with North Korea.\nReporting by Christine Kim in SEOUL and Lisa Lambert in WASHINGTON; Editing by Will Dunham and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:34:30.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
