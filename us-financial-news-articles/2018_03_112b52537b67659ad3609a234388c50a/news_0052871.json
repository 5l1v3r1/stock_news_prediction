(“ Sienna ” or the “ Company ”) is pleased to announce that it has completed the previously announced acquisition (the “ Acquisition ”) of ten high-quality private-pay independent supportive living and assisted living retirement residences in Ontario (the “ Acquired Properties ”), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $382 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The Acquired Properties consist of 1,245 private-pay suites located in the Greater Toronto and Greater Ottawa areas.\nThe Acquisition and related transaction costs were financed through a combination of: (i) the assumption and up financing of approximately $88.2 million in property-level debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3.87% and a weighted average term to maturity of 6.2 years; (ii) a $115 million acquisition term loan facility that the Company expects to refinance post-closing; (iii) net proceeds of the Company’s recent bought deal offering which raised gross proceeds of approximately $184 million; and (iv) draws on the Company’s existing credit facilities.\n“This strategic acquisition continues to enhance the quality and size of Sienna's retirement portfolio, in keeping with the Company’s goal of achieving a balanced portfolio of 50% private pay, and is expected to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.
