It is currently losing 2-3 km/day in altitude, and that value will rapidly increase the coming two weeks: pic.twitter.com/O2gQySMEO9 \n— Dr Marco Langbroek (@Marco_Langbroek) March 20, 2018 \nDon’t worry about checking the sky during the days the space station is likely to make its re-entry, though. \n“The personal probability of being hit by a piece of debris from the Tiangong-1 is actually 10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning,” the ESA said . \nWhile there is little risk that the debris from the space station will endanger humans, the ESA is still trying to determine a ballpark idea of where on Earth the space station will make landfall. \n“At no time will a precise time/location prediction from ESA be possible,” the ESA said . \nIt’s most likely to crash into the ocean somewhere between latitudes 43° north and 43° south , but that’s about as much as people will know before Tiangong-1 falls from orbit. \n“We need to get used to the idea of things raining down on us from space,” University of Texas researcher Leon Vanstone wrote in a commentary piece for Fortune , noting that falling satellites are only going to become more common as the number of launches continues to increase. \nScientists are still searching for solutions to the problem of dealing with free-falling satellites and other space debris. Options so far include shooting them down with lasers , as China proposed earlier this year.
