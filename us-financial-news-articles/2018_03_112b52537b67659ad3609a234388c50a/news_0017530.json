It wasn’t music to their ears. He warned of “a backlash against these Kabuki drug-pricing constructs—constructs that obscure profit-taking across the supply chain.”\nMore \nTelecom Italia and the Battle of the Billionaires March 7, 2018 The Trade Deficit Trump Wants to Fix May Only Worsen March 7, 2018 Gearing Up for More Chip Demand March 7, 2018 Excessive market concentration among drug distributors, pharmacies, and pharmacy-benefit managers has resulted in an opaque system of large rebates and discounts that manufacturers pay to middlemen to make sure their drugs can sell. Recently published research from Bernstein found that profit margins throughout the drug supply chain are significantly higher than income statements might suggest.\nThat system has worked better for companies than for patients. For instance, complex drug-pricing rules have resulted in a much slower uptake of biosimilars, cheaper versions of complex biologic drugs, than the FDA would like. That has meant higher profits throughout the drug industry, including for payers like insurance companies. But those higher prices raise the risk of harsher future regulation.\nGranted, the FDA isn’t capable of directly regulating drug prices . Investors shouldn’t take comfort in that fact, however. The Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the FDA, can take actions without waiting for legislation and has stated that high drug prices are a priority for the administration. The Council of Economic Advisers sharply criticized the market concentration of pharmacy-benefit managers in a report earlier this year as a factor in keeping drug prices high. Investors shouldn’t forget that midterm elections are only eight months away and that drug prices are a big issue for voters. Individual states also can create headaches for the industry.\nDrug prices are a big issue for voters in midterm elections.

UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday it would pass rebates directly to a limited number of consumers in the future. Dr. Gottlieb praised that move and expressed his hope that others in the industry would make similar changes.\nReform would pressure stock prices throughout the industry. Those troubles would likely be worse for the supply chain than for pharmaceutical manufacturers since novel drugs provide a clear benefit to patients.\nCompanies that self-police, like UnitedHealth, have chosen to do so and are likely to perform better than the ones who choose to ignore Dr. Gottlieb’s words.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:07:01.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
