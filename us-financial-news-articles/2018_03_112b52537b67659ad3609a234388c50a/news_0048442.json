Of those, nearly two thirds were vehicles made by German or Japanese automakers in their U.S. factories. \nThe Ford Explorer was the most popular U.S. made vehicle in South Korea last year, with about 6,000 vehicles registered, according to statistics compiled by the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association. \nSouth Korean consumers registered 4,843 U.S.-made models sold by the Jeep brand of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV last year, while General Motors Co’s Cadillac brand registered 2,008 U.S.-made models sold last year, according to the KAIDA figures.

German luxury vehicle brands BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz registered 12,947 U.S.-made vehicles in South Korea in 2017. South Korea last year became the sixth biggest market for Mercedes. \nFor a graphic on South Korean car imports, click here \nAmong Japanese automakers, Honda had the most success selling its U.S.-made vehicles to South Korean consumers, with 7,900 U.S.-manufactured Hondas registered last year. \nUnder revisions in the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement, U.S. automakers will be able to bring into South Korea 50,000 vehicles per automaker per year that meet U.S. safety standards, not necessarily Korean standards, up from 25,000 vehicles previously.
