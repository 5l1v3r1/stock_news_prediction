That can reflect poorly on the company and slice profit margins for goods, Mr. Weirich said, and could cost the company future sales.\n“We knew that we weren’t providing the customer experience that we’re so well-known for,” he told the Retail Industry Leaders Association’s Supply Chain conference this week. Often, the company didn’t even learn about a troubled delivery until after it had gone awry. \nMr. Weirich’s supply chain team collaborated with Neiman’s customer care group, using a cloud-based platform from Convey Sofware Inc. to track all of the retailer’s bulkiest, most complex deliveries to capture problems with enough time to correct them before the scheduled delivery date. Within 30 days of launching the software, Mr. Weirich said, Neiman Marcus had reduced its transit time to customers by 24%.\nThe logistics behind those deliveries has grown more important as consumers get increasingly comfortable buying large goods such as appliances and furniture online. U.S.-based XPO Logistics Inc. XPO -0.22% recently said it is expanding in Europe the last-mile service it has developed tailored to large consumer goods , and several traditional freight forwarders and trucking companies are turning toward more home delivery to tap into the growing market.\nThat means logistics companies that have been serving industrial business increasingly are tied to the consumer-facing side of retail. “The supply chain has more of an impact on the customer experience,” Mr. Weirich said. \nNeiman investments in digital operations began to produce results late last year, when sales excluding newly opened or closed locations rose 4.2%, the first quarterly increase since 2015 . About a third of Neiman’s $4.7 billion in annual sales comes from e-commerce, one sign that even wealthy shoppers now are searching online for the best deals.\n.\nWrite to Erica E.
