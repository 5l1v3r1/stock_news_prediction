Lee was reappointed by President Moon Jae-in to lead the BOK for another four years. Lee noted the bank will closely monitor risks from high household debt and financial market volatility as it determines interest rates going forward. $1 = 1,086.8000 won Reporting by Cynthia Kim, Dahee Kim Editing by Eric Meijer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T03:50:58.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
