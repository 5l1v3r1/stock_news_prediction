The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq also ran into trouble — seeing their worst days in nearly six weeks.\nAgati blames several headwinds that were virtually nonexistent last year for the issues facing Wall Street. They include 10-Year Treasury rates and volatility ticking up — as well as policy issues surrounding leadership and tariffs in Washington.\n\"Typically, the markets shrug off kind of the first year of a new administration. It's sort of a courting period or a getting-to-know-you kind of phase between D.C. and the markets,\" said Agati. \"That time is about up now. We're starting to see that, I think, impact market sentiment.\"\nBut that doesn't mean 2018 will be a train wreck.\n\"It's not that we don't think the markets can't eke out decent gains for the year. But we think it's a tougher slog ahead,\" she added.\nAgati doesn't see signs of a bear market or another correction. She believes the next chance of a recession likely won't happen until early 2020.\nBut what has changed is the market cycle, according to Agati. She's advocating active over passive investing.\n\"When you have a rapidly rising market and cycle, which is what we've been in the last few years, it pays to have just broad-based market exposure,\" she said. \"With this sort of coming in towards the end of a cycle or at least being in the later innings, we do think there will be a resurgence of opportunities for active managers.\"\nHer favorite groups include regional banks and defense right now.\n\"We really like the regional banks here. Although they have had a nice run, we think there's still a lot of opportunity left. They're certainly a key beneficiary of rising rates, and the mortgage market has been pretty strong,\" Agati said.\nAs for defense, she believes the recent pullback is a solid entry point for investors and could result in a pitch perfect investment.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
