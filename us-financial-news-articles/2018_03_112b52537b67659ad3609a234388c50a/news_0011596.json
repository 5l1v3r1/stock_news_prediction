The company said there was no information on the motive behind the attack.\nBefore becoming finance chief at Innogy, Guenther served in the same capacity at parent RWE, which he joined in 1999.\nBuenting, 53, was also been a long-time executive at the group, spending more than two decades mostly at RWE, which spun off Innogy in 2016 to facilitate investment in grids and renewables.\nInnogy is scheduled to present full-year results on March 12, with investors seeking more clarity on who will succeed former Chief Executive Peter Terium, who left the group in December after a profit warning.\nHis duties have been taken on by Uwe Tigges, board member in charge of personnel, on an interim basis.\nReporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff; Writing by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Kathrin Jones and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:26:47.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
