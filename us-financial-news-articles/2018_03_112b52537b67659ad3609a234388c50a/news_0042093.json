(“WMI”) subsidiary for $9.0 million in cash to CPI Aerostructures Inc. (NYSE American:CVU), subject to a customary adjustment based on the net working capital of WMI at the closing of the acquisition. The agreement also calls for up to an aggregate of $1.0 million in cash to be paid to Air Industries if WMI enters into certain long-term supply agreements during 2018.\nSeparately, Air Industries will be hosting a conference call on its financial results and the details will be announced next week.\nMr. Lou Melluzzo, Chief Executive Officer of Air Industries commented : “Since becoming CEO of the Company in October of 2017, I have been reviewing the strategic direction of Air Industries. In consultation with the Board, we concluded that it would be best to focus the management and the resources of Air Industries on our complex machined products for aircraft landing gear and jet turbine applications. Based upon this conclusion, we determined that the divestiture of WMI, which we see as accretive, is in the best interest of shareholders.\nWe anticipate that our focus on our core accretive businesses is in the best interest of the shareholders and in line with our stated strategy to streamline the business with a focus on profitability.”\nABOUT AIR INDUSTRIES GROUP\nAir Industries Group (AIRI) is an integrated manufacturer of precision equipment assemblies and components for leading aerospace and defense prime contractors.\nCertain matters discussed in this press release are 'forward-looking statements' intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
