It also struck backstop accords with investors to whom it was selling other assets.\nMincione, an Italian financier who in the past sought to play a role at rival Banca Popolare di Milano, emerged in late February as one of Carige’s largest shareholders after two local businessmen - Vittorio Malacalza, the top investor, with a 20.6 percent stake, and Gabriele Volpi, who owns 9.1 percent.\nA spokeswoman for Mincione on Tuesday declined to comment on Italian press reports that he could seek to have Carige’s shareholders elect a new board if his request to appoint a representative on the current one was denied.\nWith Italy’s fragmented banking sector expected to head for a new round of consolidation, Genoa-based Carige is seen seeking a merger after its restructuring.\nThe bank said on Tuesday it posted a 388 million euro loss last year, fractionally higher than the preliminary figure it reported last month, as it wrote down doubtful loans to ease disposals.
