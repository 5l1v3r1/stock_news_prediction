This translated to an 18 percent increase in revenue to HK$23.1 billion.\nGalaxy said it was exploring opportunities in the Philippines to develop a beach resort on the Boracay Island. Galaxy currently does not operate any casinos outside Macau.\nThe company plans to spend around $500 million initially for the Philippines project, Deputy Chairman Francis Lui said at a press conference on Wednesday.\nThe company is positive on the prospects for its Macau casino licence ahead of the expirations for all six licensed operators which start in 2020, he said.\nThe Macau casino industry is recovering from a more than two-year decline that coincided with a government campaign against ostentatiousness among public officials.\nMacau’s overall market has grown over the past year, with new resorts intensifying competition for casino operators such as Wynn Macau Ltd, MGM China Holdings Ltd, SJM Holdings Ltd, Sands China Ltd and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd.
