With his success, he is a symbol of what the United States has meant for foreigners for forever,\" Alazraki told Reuters.\nMexicans make up about four-fifths of the so-called Dreamers - hundreds of thousands of young people whose parents brought them to the United States illegally and whose fate is now uncertain after Trump moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\nFormer Mexican President Vicente Fox, who has blasted Trump's plan for a border wall, took to Twitter after del Toro's win to needle the U.S. president.\n\"The Mexican Power at the #Oscars is raw talent, which is not there illegally or stealing jobs, as zrealDonaldTrump claims. You see, Donald, talent is not limited by borders,\" Fox said.\n\"The Shape of Water\" had 13 nominations and won a total of four Academy Awards, including best picture.\nThe success of animated feature \"Coco\" was also celebrated as a breakthrough for putting Mexican traditions and life in poor villages at the center of the Disney pantheon.\nThe Disney-Pixar film was a box office smash, raking in more than $700 million worldwide.\nThe film follows a boy named Miguel who finds himself in the land of the dead during the Mexican celebration of the Dia de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead.\n\"With 'Coco' we tried to take a step forward toward a world where all children can grow up seeing characters in movies that look and talk and live like they do,\" Lee Unkrich, one of the film's directors, said in accepting the award.\nWhen del Toro and his fellow \"Three Amigos\" directors Cuaron and Gonzalez Inarritu began making films in Mexico in the 1990s, the local industry was nearly dead, churning out a handful of films a year.\nNow, Mexicos industry produces around 150 films a year. Starting next weekend, the county's up-and-coming talent will compete at the Guadalajara film festival, a showcase for local productions.
