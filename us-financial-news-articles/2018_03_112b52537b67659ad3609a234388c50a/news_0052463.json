He said there was no discussion of a more aggressive 50 basis point rate cut.\n“In this uncertain environment, future policy decisions will be highly data-dependent and sensitive to the assessment of the balance of risks to the outlook,” he said.\nThe central bank’s first monetary easing step since July comes as investors have piled into rand assets on hopes that new President Cyril Ramaphosa will follow through on promises to reform the economy and root out corruption.\nMoody’s said on Friday that it expected to see a strengthening of South Africa’s institutions under Ramaphosa which could translate into greater economic and fiscal strength.
