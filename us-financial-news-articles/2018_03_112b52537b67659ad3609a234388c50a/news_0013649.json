The company was under pressure from investors Sachem Head Capital Management and Eminence Capital to make changes to its business.\nIn June last year, the company replaced Carl Bass as CEO with Anagnost, after the two activist hedge funds also pushed for cost cuts and management changes. Autodesk's shares have nearly doubled in value since 2016.\nAs part of its long-term plan, the company will seek fewer but higher-value subscriptions from businesses, Anagnost added.\n\"The imperative for Autodesk is to maintain their subscription base as they raise maintenance prices, while keeping competitors (e.g. Dassault) from making inroads into their manufacturing (customer) base,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said via email.\nAutodesk reported a net loss of $173.5 million compared with $173.4 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Autodesk lost 9 cents per share, smaller than the 11 cents analysts on average were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 15.7 percent to $553.8 million, higher than analysts' expectations of $544.7 million.
