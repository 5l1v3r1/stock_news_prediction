Soccer Football - Championship - Aston Villa vs Birmingham City - VIlla Park, Birmingham, Britain - February 11, 2018 Steve Cotterill Action Images/Matthew Childs Cotterill took over on a two and a half year deal last September having acted as his predecessor Harry Redknapp’s assistant as Birmingham escaped relegation on the final day of the previous season. Six consecutive defeats in all competitions put an end to Redknapp’s time at St Andrew’s and the same number of successive losses, including a 2-0 derby reverse at the hands of Aston Villa last month, brought an end to Cotterill’s reign. \"The club regretfully confirms that it has this evening parted company with manager Steve Cotterill,\" read a statement on the club website ( www.bcfc.com ). “Steve has conducted himself professionally on behalf of the club at all times, his work ethic and honesty are a credit to him and there is a genuine sadness at this decision. “However, the board feel that a change in management at this stage is in the best interests of the football club.” The loss to Forest on Saturday left Birmingham third bottom of the Championship (second flight) table, two points from safety.
