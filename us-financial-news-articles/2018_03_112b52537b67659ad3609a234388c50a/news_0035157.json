According to Bloomberg , several of these suppliers suffered in the Asian markets after Apple’s development plans were reported. Japan Display was down as much as 4.4%, Sharp 3.3%, and Samsung 1.4%. However, Apple shares were also down 1.3% in early trading in New York.\nIf Apple is able to develop its own screen it will not only affect its contracts with display providers, it has the potential to give Apple a significant edge over the competition. The screen that is reportedly in development, a MicroLED screen, would make phones brighter and slimmer as well as giving them a longer battery life compared to current OLED and LCD displays.\nBut Apple isn’t the only company working on MicroLED. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Samsung revealed a 146-inch MicroLED television dubbed “The Wall.” Apple is reportedly interested in a much smaller MicroLED screen: the company is expected to roll out the new screens first in the Apple Watch. That’s bad news for LG Display, the current supplier of Apple Watch’s OLED screens.\nBut MicroLED isn’t a sure bet. By the time the technology is ready for prime time, a new type of screen might have surpassed its quality.\nApple did not immediately return Fortune ‘s request for comment. A company spokesperson declined to comment to Bloomberg.", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/apple-is-said-to-develop-displays-to-replace-samsung-screens"], "published": "2018-03-19T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T21:13:33.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
