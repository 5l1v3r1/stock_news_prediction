Similar to our previous San Andres acquisition closed in December 2017, we successfully negotiated this transaction to include more than 200 existing wells. Current reservoir modeling indicates that there are more than 45 potential horizontal well locations based on the amount of acreage acquired in this acquisition which provides for a minimum of four laterals for every 640 acre spacing unit.\"\nEnergy Hunter Resources and its partner will own and operate substantial existing infrastructure including oil and natural gas gathering lines, salt water disposal wells (\"SWD\"), SWD gathering lines and injection pumps, power stations and electricity lines, all of which will reduce up front capital costs and provide meaningful savings and efficiencies from field operations.\nEvans concluded, \"Pursuant to the closing of this transaction Energy Hunter Resources will have approximately 75 horizontal drilling locations, alongside existing vertical wells (more than 300) which holds this acreage position with current production. This multi-year drilling program that consists of nearly 20,000 gross acres is proving to be one of the most prolific economic oil regions in the country largely due to extremely low costs.
