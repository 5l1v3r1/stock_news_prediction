REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Thousands of families are now sheltering in open streets and public gardens as existing basements and shelters are already overcrowded, the opposition-run Douma local council said. “After more than 20 days of a barbaric campaign ... this has led to a deterioration of the humanitarian and food situation to a catastrophic level,” it said in a statement. Burials of the dead at the city cemetery have been suspended due to the intensity of aerial strikes, it added. Hundreds of people have been killed in a ferocious air and artillery bombardment of the eastern Ghouta district since Feb. 18 as the Syrian government seeks to crush the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus.
