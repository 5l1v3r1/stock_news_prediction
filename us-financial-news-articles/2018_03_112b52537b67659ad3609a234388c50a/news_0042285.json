He gives the example of Scott Boilen, the man behind the Snuggie: \"The guy that created the Snuggie showed that that was his creation. Don't try to create the Snuggie 2 because you saw someone be successful at it.\"\nYou have to \"believe in what it is you're selling,\" he says. \"Whatever it is that you're going to do, do it because you believe in it.
