The threshold was higher at Booker at 75 percent.\nFor each Booker share, Tesco is offering 0.861 new Tesco shares and 42.6 pence in cash.\nTesco shares were up 2.6 percent at 212.5 pence at 1333 GMT, while Booker’s were up 2.4 percent at 228.8 pence.\n“It’s been carried fairly comfortably,” Tesco Chairman John Allan said at the retailer’s meeting in central London, attended by just 65 Tesco shareholders.\nAlready the dominant player with a 28 percent share of Britain’s retail grocery market, the takeover provides the supermarket group with access to the faster growing “food away from home” segment of the market.\nLast year some prominent Tesco investors criticised the deal, saying Lewis was overpaying and that it would distract from the company’s turnaround plan. The late Richard Cousins resigned in protest as Tesco’s senior independent director in January last year.\nConversely, earlier this month Booker shareholders, hedge fund Sandell Asset Management and merger-arbitrage fund Alpine Associates, along with two shareholder advisory groups said Tesco should pay more.
