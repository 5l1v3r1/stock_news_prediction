As a result, the common stock of Juno will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nThe Juno acquisition positions Celgene as a leading cellular immunotherapy company by adding novel technology and advanced cellular manufacturing capabilities to its broad commercial portfolio and pipeline of therapies addressing serious unmet needs in hematology and oncology. Celgene also gains full global rights to JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel), a potentially best-in-class CD-19 targeted CAR T therapy currently in pivotal trials for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Celgene expects the addition of JCAR017 and other cellular immunotherapy products in Juno’s pipeline to accelerate revenue diversification with meaningful growth drivers from 2020 and beyond.\n“Our colleagues at Juno are developing some of the most promising approaches to treating cancer, and we are excited to add their pioneering work to Celgene’s leading hematology and oncology research and commercial platform,” said Mark J. Alles, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene. “Together, we expect to expand our opportunities to discover and develop new therapies that will improve and extend the lives of patients worldwide.”\nAbout Celgene\nCelgene Corporation, headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation.
