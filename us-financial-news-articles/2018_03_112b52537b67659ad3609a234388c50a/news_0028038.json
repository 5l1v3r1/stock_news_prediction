There’s the original Denver Art Museum, an operatic fortress with jauntily slanted slot windows designed by the Italian architect Gio Ponti in 1971. Across the street stands the indomitably thrusting wing added in 2006 by Daniel Libeskind. Behind it, the exquisitely refined Clyfford Still Museum designed in 2011 by Brad Cloepfil of Allied Works Architecture sits with urbane aplomb.\nOn this chessboard of architectural repute, a more modest museum tries gamely to distinguish itself. Bright rain-slicker-yellow ceramic tubes for the exterior do the trick, in a jarring way. And, as it turns out, that’s just the right posture for the idiosyncratic Kirkland Museum of Fine & Decorative Art, which opened on March 10 in this new building, designed by architect Jim Olson of Seattle-based Olson Kundig, after about 15 years in a less salubrious location.\nArt Deco Vignette with the Dubly Games Table (c. 1927) and Drouant Chairs with original upholstery (1924) designed by Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, a six-panel lacquered wood screen by Jean Dunand (1925 or before) featuring his signature \"Dunand Deco fish and water\" and a Daum Lamp (c. 1928). Photo: Wes Magyar Nothing about the Kirkland is standard issue. The museum is named for Vance Kirkland (1904-1981), one of Colorado’s most eminent artists, best known for paintings of galactic-like nebulae bursting with intense color. The 38,500-square-foot museum houses not only some 1,150 of Kirkland’s paintings, prints and drawings, but also about 7,000 works by 750 Coloradans and over 20,000 international decorative-art pieces. Both art and artifacts—some 6,000—are shown salon style, densely side by side as well as stacked high and low on the walls and grouped chronologically in stylistic batches. Thus Art Deco furnishings by such luminaries as Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann and Jean Dunand line the walls with surrealist and abstract paintings hanging above.\nChock-a-block captures only a part of it; the place is engorged with fascinating stuff in the more-is-more way that has more in common with the tastes of early 20th-century collectors Albert C. Barnes and Isabella Stewart Gardner than contemporary museum practice.\nThere are plenty of stunners, including numerous works by Frank Lloyd Wright ; a rare beechwood sideboard designed in 1919 by Gerrit Rietveld, one of only about 11 known to exist; a darkly gorgeous William Morris rug (1875). Marcel Breuer’s famed strapped leather Wassily Chair (1925-26) is impressive, but more intriguing is a dainty dormitory desk he designed for Bryn Mawr College in 1938. A 1907 armchair by Austrian architect Josef Hoffmann sits atop an Iranian Sarouk rug from the same period.\nRather than employing the greatest-hits approach seen at most design collections—which present top-quality works, for sure, but end up looking the same—the Kirkland runs a pulse-quickening gamut. It’s a master class both in how designers developed their approach and design impulses moved through the world.\nArts & Crafts Vignette featuring the Peacock and Dragon Wall Hanging (c. 1878) designed by William Morris, furniture designed by, left to right, by Eliel Saarinen, Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, Roycroft Shops and William Price as well as Realism paintings by Colorado artists. Photo: Wes Magyar Part of the thrill of discovering the Kirkland anew in its purpose-built home is how personal it feels. That’s thanks to the stewardship of founding director and curator Hugh Grant, for whom it is clearly a labor of love. Mr. Grant inherited the estate of Vance Kirkland, who had been a close friend of his parents, and has devoted his career to keeping the collection intact, with financial support from the Merle Chambers Fund ( Ms. Chambers is Mr. Grant’s ex-wife). Kirkland’s original studio, a handsome red-brick warehouse, and its contents were relocated in their entirety to the new arts district address. The 1,384-square-foot studio now sits like a rocket booster attached to one end of the building, providing a final jolt of intense engagement with the artist.\nWisely, Mr. Olson, the architect, designed a building that aims to accommodate, not compete with, the fervid energy of the installations inside. Long and low, with a running clerestory beneath a deep overhang, the $22 million building has a distinctly residential feeling with a slight echo of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Illinois Prairie Houses. Apart from the punchy yellow exterior, the design is all calm and clarity, with eight galleries off a central axis like inviting side streets off an avenue. Mr. Olson has put carefully crafted details where they count the most: The front door is bronze-colored steel with a richly tactile wood handle; the reception desk is burled walnut; the main floor is terrazzo polished to a reflective gleam.\nAt the same time, the building is not precious. Mr. Olson may have dotted the ceramic exterior with gold-leaf-backed glass tiles—making it glint in places as if shards of sunlight had been swallowed whole—but there are also efficient economies: A cheaper cementitious paneling is used on the building’s backside, by the parking lot.\nThe role of architecture is sometimes to stand back, not out. So much ambitious architecture these days tries to ring all the same notes with structures that are bigger, more dazzlingly technological, more loaded with crowd-luring social spaces. The Kirkland is a welcome throwback: It does its own thing, with inimitable coloratura.\n—Ms. Iovine reviews architecture for the Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T01:47:37.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
