RMH says it discovered the security breach on Feb. 13. It did not notify customers until last week—and did not offer to pay for any credit protection services for affected customers. \nLast month, Applebee’s announced it would close as many as 80 locations this year—on top of the 100-plus it shuttered in 2017 . Same-restaurant sales in 2017 were down more than 5% at the casual dining chain.
