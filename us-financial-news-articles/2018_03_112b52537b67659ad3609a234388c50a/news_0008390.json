REUTERS/Murad Sezer Earlier this week, the Milan tribunal informed lawyers that the court which had been due to hear the trial had too many cases and could not guarantee that it would do so in a reasonable period of time, three sources told Reuters on Friday.\nThe case involves the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell of Nigeria’s OPL-245 offshore oilfield - one of Africa’s most valuable oil blocks - for about $1.3 billion.\nMilan prosecutors allege bribes were paid to win the license to explore the field, which has never entered into production.\nFILE PHOTO - The logo of Italian oil and gas group Eni is seen on the facade of its headquarters in Rome, Italy, December 23, 2017. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi All the accused have denied any wrongdoing.\nThe court is expected to set the new trial date on Monday, the sources said.\nA Milan judge ruled in December that the companies, along with present and past executives, would face trial.\nThe Italian inquiry is one of several into the acquisition of OPL-245, including cases in the Netherlands and Nigeria.\nReporting by Emilio Parodi; writing by Francesca Landini; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T07:49:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
