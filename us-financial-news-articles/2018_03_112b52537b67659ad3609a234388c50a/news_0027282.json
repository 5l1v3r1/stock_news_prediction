This would be in conjunction with saving the Canadian business.\nToys R Us had already begun liquidating about 180 stores , under both the Toys R Us and Babies R Us banners, as part of its restructuring efforts to revive the business. The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection last September, weighed down by nearly $5 billion in debt.\nMost recently, the company has struggled to pay on loans, and lenders had been pushing management to pursue a complete liquidation of the U.S. business.\nThe abrupt shuttering of Toys R Us' massive store fleet will leave a chunk of vacant real estate on the market. Landlords will be scrambling to find tenants for those locations that aren't owned directly by the toy retailer.\nMany of Toys R Us' stores today are leased back to a separate entity created by the company known as Toys R Us Property Co., or Propco. Real estate investment trusts including Kimco , Brixmor and DDR own a handful of stores, while the remainder are owned directly by Toys R Us.\nAccording to real estate analysts, the likely scenario for many of these spaces will include remodeling for multiple occupants. Most of the Toys R Us and Babies R Us locations are more than 40,000 square feet in size, and some are more than 65,000. Tenants such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Best Buy , which also tend to occupy bigger boxes, aren't expanding as rapidly anymore, leaving fewer logical replacements for these stores.\nâ€” Reporting by Lauren Thomas.
