REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo The bank will also disclose a mean gender bonus gap of 86 percent. A spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the contents of the report. The gender pay gap is one of the biggest yet disclosed by a British bank and measures the difference in average pay earned by male and female employees. In common with other banks, HSBC’s pay gap was largely accounted for by the bank having fewer women in senior roles.
