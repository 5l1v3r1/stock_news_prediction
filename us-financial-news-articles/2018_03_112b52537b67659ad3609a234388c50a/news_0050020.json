Most of those pieces are tiny microplastics, it said.\nIn another way of describing its size, Joost said it is made up of enough trash to fill 500 jumbo jets.\nThe plastic has accumulated into a mass due to currents, scientists say. The research studied a patch of more than 600,000 square miles (1.6 million square kilometers) of the ocean.\nA petroleum-based product, plastic disintegrates slowly, and one item pulled from the patch was about 40 years old, they said.\nIt harms marine life by killing creatures such as turtles and dolphins that ingest it, and it harms humans by entering the food chain in the form of microplastics, said Dubois.\n“We’re basically poisoning our own food, especially for those of us relying on fish for our diet,” Dubois said.\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
