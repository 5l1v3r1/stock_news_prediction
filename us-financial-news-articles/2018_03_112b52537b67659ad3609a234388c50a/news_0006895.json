Predictably, the 28-year-old Canadian won easily.\nAlongside him, the strain on Mayer’s face was clear, but he stayed in Warner’s slipstream to record a creditable 7.83.\nAthletics - IAAF World Indoor Championships 2018 - Arena Birmingham, Birmingham, Britain - March 3, 2018 Kevin Mayer of France competes during the Men’s Pole Vault Heptathlon REUTERS/Phil Noble The fact that Warner made mistakes by hitting the first two hurdles cost him the overall lead going into the pole vault.\nOn the first day, Mayer recorded personal bests in the 60m and long jump, which is his weakest event, to offset a moderate high jump. That gave him a 45-point overnight lead.\nThe result will go some way to settling the argument about who is the true heir to American Ashton Eaton, the multi-discipline competitor who denied Mayer decathlon gold at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games as he retained his London crown.\nMayer won the world title in London last year, but this time Warner has simply refused to let his opponent get away.\nNow Mayer will have to do the same if he is to deny Warner in what could be an epic finale.\nReporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T16:11:30.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
