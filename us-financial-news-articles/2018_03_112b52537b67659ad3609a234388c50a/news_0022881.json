(NASDAQ: OREX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of obesity, announced today that it has elected to file a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Orexigen also intends to file a motion seeking authorization to pursue an auction and sale process under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The proposed bidding procedures, if approved by the court, would require interested parties to submit binding offers to acquire substantially all of Orexigen's assets, which would be purchased free and clear of the company's indebtedness and other liens and interests. Such parties could include strategic and financial buyers, and the process is expected to proceed according to the following timeline:\nBids expected to be submitted by May 21, 2018 Structured auction targeted to commence no later than May 24, 2018 Sale intended to be concluded by July 2, 2018\n\"The Board and management team have thoroughly assessed all of our strategic options and believe that this process represents the best possible solution for Orexigen, taking into account our financial needs,\" said Michael Narachi, President and CEO of Orexigen. \"While we have been working closely with our noteholders and have the support of a controlling number of senior secured noteholders, our debt covenant requirements and near-term cash flow needs have necessitated the protection afforded by a court-driven process.\"\nNarachi continued, \"Orexigen was founded on the premise of helping to improve the health and lives of patients struggling to lose weight. This mission has been at the core of creating patient-centric solutions that help customers and patients in meaningful and relevant ways. Since the launch of Contrave, nearly 800,000 patients in the U.S. have benefitted 1 , and, through a successful transaction process, we intend that this growing patient demand will continue to be served.\"\nOrexigen has filed a series of motions with the court seeking to ensure the continuation of normal operations during this process. Orexigen has the support of a controlling number of its senior secured noteholders for this process, who have made a $35 million financing commitment. The company believes that this commitment provides it with sufficient liquidity to conduct its business in an uninterrupted manner, fund its chapter 11 case, including the sale of its assets, and to continue to meet its operational and financial obligations, including: continued servicing of distributors, wholesalers and global partners to ensure timely fulfillment of orders and shipments of Contrave ® (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl extended release)/Mysimba™ (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl prolonged release); the timely payment of employee wages and salaries; and satisfaction of other obligations to patients and physicians who depend on this important therapy. In addition, to attempt to preserve the value of its net operating losses, Orexigen has filed a motion with the court to establish limitations on trading in Orexigen's common stock by beneficial owners of at least 4.5% of Orexigen's common stock during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings.\nAdditional information about this process and proposed asset sale, as well as other documents related to the restructuring and reorganization proceedings, is available through Orexigen's claims agent Kurtzman Carson Consultants LLC at www.kccllc.net/orexigen .\nOrexigen's legal counsel is Hogan Lovells US LLP and its financial advisors are Perella Weinberg Partners LP and Ernst & Young LLP.\nThe petition was filed in United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Case No. 18-10518.\nRecent Business Highlights\nContrave is the No.1 prescribed weight loss brand in the U.S. >2.3M prescriptions have been written in the U.S. since launch >100,000 unique U.S. prescribers of Contrave since launch 23% year-over-year TRx growth in the U.S. in 2017 21% year-over-year TRx growth in the U.S. in 2018 to date All-time highs in weekly TRx volume (19,247), branded TRx market share (48.7%) and telemedicine/home delivery volume (2,288) achieved in early March 2018 2017 U.S. Contrave net sales of ~$75M compared to ~$47M 2 in 2016 2017 global supply revenue from international partners of ~$13M compared to ~$5M in 2016 Implemented streamlined and innovative U.S. commercial model, with expected annual savings of ~$40M in 2018, under the current plan, compared to 2017 Launched in 24 of 68 partnered countries, with an additional 14 launches currently planned in 2018 U.S. market exclusivity solidified through 2030 following favorable ruling in patent litigation Recent FDA acceptance of a significantly more efficient approach for completion of a cardiovascular outcomes post marketing requirement\nSource: IQVIA NPA data Sept 2014 through Jan 2018 and the IQVIA Persistence and Adherence study conducted June 2016 Includes net sales as reported by our former partner pursuant to the terms of our former collaboration agreement for periods prior to the completed acquisition of Contrave, coupled with net sales as recorded by Orexigen after the completed acquisition of Contrave.\nAbout Contrave and Mysimba\nContrave, marketed as Mysimba in the European Union, is a prescription-only, FDA-approved weight-loss medication believed to work on two areas of the brain—the hunger center and the reward system—to reduce hunger and help control cravings.

It is estimated that about 110 million adults are overweight or struggling with obesity; however, only 3% are treated with a prescription weight loss medicine. By 2030, the percentage of Americans who struggle with obesity could reach 51 percent. Obesity can increase the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer, sleep apnea, and a variety of other conditions. Weight loss is complex and for many people diet and exercise alone may not be enough. Two areas of the brain play an important role in weight loss. The hypothalamus, your hunger center, regulates hunger and the mesolimbic reward system can cause cravings even when you are not hungry. Other areas of the brain may be involved.\nAbout Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc .\nOrexigen Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of weight loss and obesity.
