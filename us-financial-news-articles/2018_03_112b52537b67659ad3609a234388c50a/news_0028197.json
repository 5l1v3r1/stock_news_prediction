It is impossible to ignore the growing body of evidence that Syria is continuing to use chemical weapons on its own people â€” a clear violation of international law.\" \nEarlier Tuesday, the Russian military threatened action against the U.S. if it led airstrikes on Damascus.

The spokesman said: \"As (former) Secretary Tillerson said in Paris in January, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the countless Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria. Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its ability and will to resolve the overall crisis.\" \nThe comments come as Assad's regime continues to carry out airstrikes over the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta just outside Damascus. show chapters 10:51 AM ET Sat, 17 Feb 2018 | 04:22 \nThe United Nations Security Council had demanded a ceasefire in Syria two weeks ago to allow nearly 1,000 sick and wounded civilians to leave so they can seek urgent medical treatment. On Monday, the U.S. threatened to \"act if we must\" if the UN ceasefire resolution continues to be ignored. \nU.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Hailey said Monday that the U.S. was drafting a new ceasefire resolution with \"no room for evasion\" and warned that America was prepared to act. \nThe U.S. defense department noted that Haley's comments were appropriate. \"As U.N.
