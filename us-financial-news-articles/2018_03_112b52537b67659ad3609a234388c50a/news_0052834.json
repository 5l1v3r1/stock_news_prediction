We made changes to the lineup and you could see it affected the team.\nSoccer Football - International Friendly - Germany vs Brazil - Olympiastadion, Berlin, Germany - March 27, 2018 Brazil players applaud their fans after the match REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch “We made some easy mistakes. There were some young players on the pitch and we were not really that fine-tuned as a team.\n“But that is why you have such games, to try things out.”\nIn an evenly-balanced first half and with the “open wound” of their shock World Cup loss to Germany still painful according to Tite, the visitors were in no mood to take any early risks.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Disciplined and hard-working at the back, they kept German pressure under control. Brazil grabbed an unexpected lead when keeper Kevin Trapp, replacing the rested Marc-Andre ter Stegen failed to hold on to Jesus’s point-blank header, with the ball slipping through after his reflex save.\n“The team deserves a lot of credit,” said Brazil defender Thiago Silva. “I think we are on the right track, with humility, and discipline and we showed it today against this team.\n“It makes us proud. We are delighted with the positive result against a great team.”\nThe Germans tried to get an equalizer before the break with Mario Gomez, vying for a spot in the World Cup squad, coming close twice.\nBut it was the Brazilians who were more aggressive in the second half, threatening through Paulinho and Philippe Coutinho.\nLoew, who will announce his preliminary World Cup squad on May 15, brought on Sandro Wagner for Gomez to add pressure. However, Brazil kept their cool to earn a much-needed confidence boost.\nThe five-times world champions kick off their World Cup campaign against Switzerland on June 17 before facing Costa Rica and Serbia.\nThe Germans, four-time champions, have been drawn in Group F of the tournament, along with Mexico, South Korea and Sweden.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann, Additional reporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:12:24.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
