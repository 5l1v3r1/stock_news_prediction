As self-made millionaire Barbara Corcoran tells CNBC Make It : \"I think everybody is cheap in some way.\"\nThese three self-made multimillionaires and billionaires, including Corcoran, like to save when it comes to flying.\nBarbara Corcoran Partly because getting to ride in a plane at all still feels like a privilege to her, Corcoran keeps it cheap when she's on the road : \"I'll never spend money on a business class or a first class ticket. Forget about it. I'm always in coach. I just couldn't fathom justifying that.\"\nThat said, she adds, \"I have a routine that makes me feel better than everybody in first class.\"\nThe \"Shark Tank\" star doesn't board a flight without a pre-packed gourmet meal. She brings fresh fruit, fancy cheese, a baguette or croissant and \"always a small bottle of wine,\" she tells Torabi, \"which, of course, you can't bring through security but you can get it at Shake Shack in the airport.\"\nTrying to make my economy seat feel like first class!\nA post shared by Barbara Corcoran (@barbaracorcoran) on Jan 5, 2018 at 4:58am PST\nJim Koch Self-made billionaire and founder of The Boston Beer Co. Jim Koch also refuses to spring for expensive plane tickets. As Business Insider reports , he always flies coach. And he makes sure his employees join him in the cheap seats, including executives.\n\"On those long trips to Munich\" for beer-ingredient research, \"the upgrade from coach to first class is an extra $5,000,\" he writes in his memoir, \" Quench Your Own Thirst .\"\n\"I can't make the math work â€” the average person at Boston Beer makes $55,000 a year. How can I justify paying over a month's salary for a first-class ticket? Is having me get a little more legroom and a better meal really more valuable to the company than what the average person contributes every month? I've never believed that.\"\nSource: The Boston Beer Company Jim Koch, co-founder and chairman of the Boston Beer Company Arik Kislin Arik Kislin is the part-owner of a private jet company, but he still flies commercial, at least sometimes.\n\"It's a lot less luxurious,\" the self-made multimillionaire tells CNBC Make It . \"You have to deal with all the nuances of the airport.\" But it's \"an economical decision,\" especially when he's on his own and when he's \"going across the pond.\"\n\"There's a lot more options to fly commercial. There's a lot more flights going to business cities,\" he says, and that availability of flights is convenient. \"If I wanted to go to London, I'd probably have 20-plus flights to choose from.\"\nFor those reasons, he says, \"it's just easier.\"\nLike this story?
