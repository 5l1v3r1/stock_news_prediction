Their share of global auto industry profits may fall from 85 percent to less than 50 percent by 2030.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “The only companies that can survive in the long term are either those that prevail as a clear innovation leader on the product side, or those that recognize that mobility is no longer a product, but rather a service,” said Christoph Stuermer, Global Lead Analyst at PwC Autofacts.\nDaimler and BMW want to build a joint business which includes car-sharing, ride-hailing, electric vehicle charging, and digital parking services, consolidating their strong footprint in Europe.\nBMW in January bought out its partner Sixt ( SIXG.DE ) from DriveNow, which was seen as one step on the road to an alliance.\nThe two companies have not confirmed the plans, but Daimler said last month it was open to considering a broader alliance and a partial listing of its mobility services operations, which also includes its taxi-hailing and transportation services apps Mytaxi and Moovel.\nIt said on Thursday its mobility services business was poised to expand its portfolio and its customer base, using the expertise gained from Car2Go to work toward an offering with self-driving cars.\n“The goal is to develop the required expertise and resources so that we are a leader in the future business with self-driving cars,” it said.\nChina’s Geely took a 9.7 percent stake in Daimler last week, citing a desire to cooperate on technology.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan and Edward Taylor; Editing by Edwina Gibbs/Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T12:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T12:52:17.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
