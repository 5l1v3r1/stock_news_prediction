Taking an official salary of only $1 has become something of a point of pride in and around Silicon Valley.\nThat's because a company's stock value speaks louder than a set salary. \"The dollar salary really for them is meant to signify that they have large stakes in their company. The value they're going to receive — the compensation they'll earn — is coming solely from their stock,\" Aaron Boyd, previously the director of governance for Equilar, a company that researches executive compensation, explained to Forbes in 2014.\nIn the past, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Snap Inc.'s Evan Spiegel and Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin have all opted to take a single dollar in official compensation. \nThis is an updated version of a previously published article . \nDon't miss: \nHere's just how deeply 68% of Americans don't want to talk about money Nicholas Cage once blew $150 million on a private island and a dinosaur skull—here's everything he bought How 'Grey's Anatomy' star Ellen Pompeo went from barely paying rent to earning $20 million a year Like this story?
