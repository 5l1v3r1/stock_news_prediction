REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo The new government won 81 votes in the 150-member parliament.\nFico, prime minister for 10 of the last 12 years, bowed out this month amid protests and calls for an early election, handing the three-party ruling coalition to Pellegrini, a long-time senior member of the ruling Smer party.\nThe new cabinet has adopted its predecessorâ€™s agenda, including plans to reach a balanced budget by 2020. It underwent six personnel changes but only added two people who have not previously held any government post.\nPellegrini has pledged to keep Slovakia on a pro-European and pro-NATO path.\nFico had sought to position Slovakia - a country of 5.4 million that is an European Union member since 2004 and part of the euro zone monetary club - as a pro-EU bastion in a eurosceptic region.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T00:25:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
