On Thursday, the panel asked the trial judge to provide an example of an act of aiding and abetting. U.S. District Judge Paul Byron declined.\nIn response to another question, Byron said in order for Salman’s actions to be considered “willful,” it had to be proven that she provided support for and participated in something she wished would succeed.\nSalman’s family was hopeful the jurors’ questions suggested they were carefully weighing the evidence, her spokeswoman Susan Clary said.\n“The jury has been asking questions, that shows that they want to know more about the law,” Clary told reporters outside the courthouse. “More questions is better than no questions.”\nDefense lawyers have accused FBI agents of adding words that they say Salman never used to her statements, made during questioning, that she helped Mateen scout targets.\nProsecutors say Salman helped her husband check out potential sites ahead of the June 12, 2016, attack and misled investigators about what she knew.\nThey said she first told investigators that Mateen had acted without her knowledge but later admitted knowing he had left home with a gun and had watched jihadist videos online.
