I’ll have a right to go up or down, depending on the country, and I’ll have a right to drop out countries or add countries,” he told reporters at the beginning of a Cabinet meeting at the White House.\nTrump said he would be fair and flexible on the issue while protecting American workers.\nThe president’s plans have irritated U.S. allies and sparked concerns about a trade war.
