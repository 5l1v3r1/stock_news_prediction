The EU official, briefing reporters on preparations for the summit to be chaired by European Council President Donald Tusk, said he did not expect additional sanctions to be discussed. Among discussions on Russia, however, the agenda would include a debate on strengthening the EU’s defenses against hybrid warfare attacks. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who will attend the summit, has accused Russia of a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in the English city of Salisbury. EU leaders are likely to renew statements of solidarity with Britain, the EU official said, and there could be a discussion of going further than foreign ministers did on Monday in pinning blame on Moscow.
