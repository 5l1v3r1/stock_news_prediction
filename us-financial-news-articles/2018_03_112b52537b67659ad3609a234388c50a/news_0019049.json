The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the incident and says anti-Russian hysteria is being whipped up by the British media.\nBritish experts have identified the substance, which will help identify the source, but the police have not made the information public.\nBoth victims remain unconscious, in a critical but stable condition, while police officer Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was also harmed by the substance, remains in a serious condition though he can now speak.\nA total of 21 people had been treated in hospital following the incident, police said.\nSkripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.\nThe attack has been likened in Britain to the assassination of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.\nA British public inquiry said Litvinenko’s murder had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoy. Lugovoy is an ex-KGB bodyguard who later became a member of parliament.\nBoth denied responsibility and Russia has refused to extradite them. Russia’s embassy in London declined immediate comment.\nWriting by Guy Faulconbridge and Alistair Smout\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:33:42.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
