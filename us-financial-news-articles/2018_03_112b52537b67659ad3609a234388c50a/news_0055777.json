Thang denied wrongdoing, he said.\nThang was prosecuted in connection with losses of up to 800 billion dong ($35 million) in a PetroVietnam investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank.\nOcean Bank suffered heavy losses and was forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank.\nThang, the highest-level politician to have been sentenced for decades, will also have to pay a fine of 600 billion dong ($26.31 million), Dang said.\nThe Politburo is Vietnam’s top decision-making body. Thang lost his position in the Politburo last year, after he came under suspicion of wrongdoing.\nIn January, Thang was handed a 13-year sentence after being found guilty of “economic mismanagement” at a coal-fired power plant overseen by state-owned energy firm PetroVietnam, of which he was chairman.\nThe People’s Court of Hanoi also handed sentences of between 15 months of probation to 16 years in prison to six other people for their involvement in the case at the trial starting on Monday last week, according to the lawyer and state media.\nDang said it was not clear if Thang would appeal.
