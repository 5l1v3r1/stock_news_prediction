Jonathan Blumberg | @YoniBlum 2 Hours Ago \nWhen the NCAA Final Four go head-to-head on Saturday night, assuming viewership is close to last year's , around 20 million fans will be watching. \nGraham Betchart, the director of mental training at Lucid Performance , understands that kind of pressure. \nAfter receiving his master's degree in sports psychology from John F. Kennedy University in 2008, he began developing basketball stars like the Philadelphia 76ers' 6'10'' point guard Ben Simmons, the Minnesota Timberwolves' center Karl-Anthony Towns and the Orlando Magic's power forward Aaron Gordon. Gordon has worked with Betchart since he was 14. \nBut now Betchart is pivoting beyond sports. He works with sales teams and universities. He trains surgeons on how to keep their heads when they're in the middle of a procedure and the patient starts to bleed profusely. He works with lawyers who have to handle the pressure of convincing a jury that their innocent client isn't guilty murder. \n\"What we've found is this is much larger than sports,\" Betchart tells CNBC Make It . \"This is about everyone in life.\" \nHere are seven ways you can thrive under pressure, according to his advice: Graham Betchart Lucid Performance CEO Jason Stirman, Skal Labissière of the Sacramento Kings, and Lucid Performance Director of Mental Training Graham Betchart (from left to right) 1. Let go of the obsession with results \nFearful leaders are always thinking about their teams' results, says Betchart. \"They are the ones that are living way in the future.\" And projecting into the future creates stress, which he calls \"the absence of presence.\" \nA salesperson will not function well if his focus is entirely on numbers, just like a surgeon will fail if he thinks only about the result of the surgery. If something unexpected goes wrong, according to Betchart, some surgeons will immediately think, \"I'm going to lose my job if this happens. I'm going to get sued for malpractice. I don't know how to talk to the parents.\" \nWhat they need to focus on, says Betchart, is resolving the issue. \"Stop the bleeding,\" he tells CNBC. 2. Get comfortable being uncomfortable \n\"If you refuse to be uncomfortable, you are literally limiting your ability to grow,\" says Betchart, citing Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck's research on the \" growth mindset .\" As opposed to the \"fixed mindset,\" having the \"growth mindset\" means embracing a dynamic outlook, believing that trials and challenges will push you to new limits and that failures are opportunities to develop. \n\"Be a learn it all, not a know it all,\" says Betchart. \"Tell yourself, 'I want to keep growing, keep learning, and what I know now might be different in ten years.'\" \n\"And know that you are okay,\" he says. Repeatedly tell yourself, \"I am okay.\" According to Betchart, it sounds easy, but achieving that understanding is actually quite profound. show chapters 12:09 PM ET Fri, 2 June 2017 | 01:10 3. If you are the boss, make mistakes and share them with your employees \n\"Perfectionists perish,\" says Betchart repeatedly. In other words, striving for perfection will ultimately hold you back, because perfection is impossible. \n\"There's nothing worse for a team than someone afraid to make a mistake,\" he says. And when you work to intentionally avoid mistakes, \"it completely limits your creativity.\" \nBecause mistakes inevitably occur, you should instead focus on developinggrit and resiliency . Those qualities, Betchart says, allow you to move forward. \n\"We've found that when a leader, a person in charge, is able to be vulnerable and say, 'I'm human just like you, and I make mistakes' … it empowers the group,\" he says. \"People really resonate when they can connect.\" 4. Be emotionally intelligent \nTwo qualities of the best leaders are empathy and compassion, he says. \"If you can empathize with the people you are working with,\" explains Betchart, \"and have compassion for what they are going through, it's amazing what it brings out of them.\" \nPerformance expert George Mumford, who has worked with Betchart in the past, originally introduced this idea to the NBA in the 90s through Phil Jackson, former coach of the Chicago Bulls. \n\"Mumford taught Michael Jordan compassion,\" Betchart says. The Pistons players would foul him and bump him to throw him off his game, and at first, it worked. \nBut when Jordan learned to take a breath, Betchart says, \"instead of getting angry at the Pistons, he would let it go and think to himself, 'Hey, empathize with them. This is the only way you can try to beat me. You're not as good at basketball as me.' And that allowed him to not lose all his energy.\" \nMichael Jordan, as well as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, all credit Mumford's training for their success.

Be in thriving mode, not survival mode \n\"If you have a lion in your room right now,\" he says, \"I would say you need to be in survival mode. Get the hell out of that room. You're in physical danger.\" \nToo often people Betchart sees are in survival mode, exaggerating the stakes of the task at hand as though their lives depend on the outcome. They expend energy wastefully, he says. \n\"In a company where people are in survival mode,\" says Betchart, \"people don't thrive.\" 6. Understand energy is contagious \n\"You can feel it,\" he says. \"You can feel someone who's fearful. You don't have to say a word.\" When workplace culture is high-stress and heavily results-driven, people are fearful, and that energy transfers to everyone. \nOn the other hand, Betchart says, \"If people are mindful, if they have a highly trained mind,\" they can put a stop to the spread of that negative atmosphere. Their composure will influence those around them. 7. Allow yourself to be vulnerable \n\"If you allow yourself to be vulnerable,\" he says, \"you have a great chance of winning. If you refuse to be vulnerable, you are handcuffing yourself.\" \n\"When leaders have a willingness to be vulnerable … it's the most empowering thing ever.\" There's a ripple effect. The most innovative companies, he says, have leaders and employees who are open and honest, who allow themselves to be vulnerable. \"They have an open mind.\" \n\"Getting into the now is sometimes extremely uncomfortable,\" he adds. But that's all the more reason to do it. \nThis is an updated version of a previously published article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T17:47:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
