The yield curve steepened a touch as Powell's latest comments reduced bets the Fed was ready to ratchet up key borrowing costs faster in the wake of last year's major tax overhaul, along with signs of inflation perking up. \"There is no evidence the economy is overheating,\" Powell said before the Senate Banking Committee. His comments, the second part of his inaugural testimony before Congress as Fed chief, were seen as less upbeat than his remarks on the U.S. economy before the House Financial Services Committee two days earlier. \"They seemed more even-keel. He's a little less upbeat, but he's still upbeat,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. His remarks before the House panel on Tuesday had sparked worries the Fed may quicken its pace of interest rate increases. Bets have grown that the Fed may raise short-term rates four times in 2018, one more than policy makers projected in December. At 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was 2.848 percent, down 2 basis points from late on Wednesday. It fell to a two-week low of 2.824 percent earlier on Thursday, Reuters data showed. The two-year yield fell to 2.250 percent after hitting a more than nine-year high of 2.286 percent on Wednesday. The spread between five-year and 30-year yields was 50.1 basis points, wider than the 48.2 basis points late on Wednesday, Tradeweb data showed. Two days of sharp losses on Wall Street and disappointing housing and regional data had raised speculation that Powell might soften his tone at his Senate appearance, in a bid to quell rate-hike jitters. As Powell was testifying, New York Fed President William Dudley, speaking in Sao Paulo, said four rate increases in 2018 would still constitute a \"gradual\" tightening. On the data front, the Commerce Department said U.S. consumer prices increased in January, with a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months. That bolstered views that price pressures will accelerate this year. The Labor Department said first-time filing for unemployment benefits fell to a 48-year low last week, while the Institute for Supply Management said its barometer on national factory activity reached its strongest level since May 2004.
