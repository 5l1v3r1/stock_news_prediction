Rogers, who scored five centuries in 25 tests at the end of a late-blooming career, will be based in Brisbane at the National Cricket Centre and joins former test bowler and youth coach Ryan Harris at the academy, CA said in a statement. Rogers has been involved in multiple coaching roles with CA since 2015, most recently as an assistant at the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. “We’re looking forward to having Chris work with Australia’s next generation and watching him develop as a coach,” CA high performance boss Pat Howard said in a statement. “We are confident he can have a big impact in moulding our rising stars into future international cricketers.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T19:21:58.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
