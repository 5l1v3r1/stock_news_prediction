It has already led to plans for more stringent rules, including increased scrutiny on big-money gamblers.\nThe next round of recommendations will require Ottawa’s support as they fall under federal jurisdiction. The province is also seeking additional money from the federal government for policing white collar crime.\nEby will ask that Canada’s anti-money laundering regulator, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), start sharing information with law enforcement in order to better track financial criminals.\nHe will also recommend that cash purchases of big-ticket luxury items, such as cars, be tracked, as they can be used to introduce hundreds of thousands in illegal cash into the legitimate economy.\nCash deposits over C$10,000 at banks and casinos, and in real estate and other investment sectors, trigger FINTRAC reporting requirements, while cash retail purchases do not.\nEby’s recommendations are the work of investigator Peter German, a former deputy commissioner with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who is expected to present his final report to the province by the end of this month.\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:01:29.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
