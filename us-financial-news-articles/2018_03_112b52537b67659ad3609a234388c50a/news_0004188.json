The economists did not provide quarterly forecasts.\nBROADER RISKS Chan sees the red-hot property market coming under pressure as more flats hit the market and as interest rates are expected to rise. He did not announce any immediate measures to put a lid on rocketing prices but warned buyers to assess the risk.\nHong Kong’s home prices have surged for 15 straight months despite repeated cooling measures, further exacerbating public discontent towards housing affordability in the city of 7.4 million.\n“Hong Kong has been plagued by land shortage for years. The problem not only affects people’s livelihood, but also restrains our growth potential. We must proactively address this problem with firm resolve,” Chan said,.\nHe said that 20,800 private residential units would be completed annually over the next five years, an increase of some 50 percent over annual private flat additions in recent years.\nSalaries and profits tax cuts worth HK$25.5 billion for the 2017/18 year would be given, capped at HK$30,000 per taxpayer.\nA 13.3 percent increase on annual spending on healthcare was also earmarked to help an efficient, highly subsidised yet occasionally over-burdened public health system.
