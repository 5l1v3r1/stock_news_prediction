JOHN’S, Newfoundland and Labrador--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. (TSX-V:BPLI) (\" Bluedrop \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that the TSX Venture Exchange (\" TSXV \") has accepted the Company's notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (\" NCIB \").\nUnder the terms of the NCIB, Bluedrop may acquire up to an aggregate of 4,962,464 common shares. In the opinion of the board of directors of Bluedrop, its common shares have been trading at prices that do not reflect the underlying value of the Company including its growth opportunities. Accordingly, Bluedrop believes that purchasing and returning its common shares to treasury at present pricing represents an opportunity to enhance value for its ongoing shareholders.\nAs of March 26, 2018, the Company had 99,249,276 common shares outstanding, of which 20,897,931 common shares represent the public float of Bluedrop. Bluedrop acquired 1,858,500 common shares under the NCIB which commenced March 31, 2017 and will expire on March 31, 2018. Under TSXV policies, Bluedrop is entitled to purchase up to 2% of the total issued and outstanding common shares in any 30 day period up to the maximum of 4,962,464 common shares over the 12 month period that the NCIB is in place.\nThe purchases will commence on March 31, 2018 and will end on March 30, 2019, or on such earlier date as Bluedrop may complete its purchases pursuant to the notice of intention to make an NCIB filed with the TSXV. The actual number of common shares which will be purchased and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by the Company. Purchases are anticipated to be made in tranches with the maximum number of Common Shares and aggregate purchase amount to be determined by the board of directors of the Company. The initial tranche of share purchases under the NCIB shall not exceed either (a) one million common shares; or (b) the aggregate amount of $150,000. All common shares purchased by the Company will be on the open market through the facilities of TSXV by Haywood Securities Inc. (\" Haywood \") acting on behalf of Bluedrop in accordance with the policies of the TSXV and will be surrendered by the Company to its transfer agent for cancellation. The prices that Bluedrop will pay for any of the common shares purchased will be the market price of the shares at the time of acquisition.\nThe Company also announces that it has entered into an automatic share purchase plan with Haywood in order to facilitate repurchases of its common shares under the NCIB. Under Bluedrop's automatic share purchase plan (the \" Plan \"), Haywood may repurchase common shares under the NCIB at times when Bluedrop would ordinarily not be permitted to, due to self-imposed blackout periods.\nPurchases under the Plan will be made by Haywood based upon the parameters prescribed by the TSXV, applicable Canadian securities laws and the terms of the parties' written agreement. The Plan has been reviewed by the TSXV and will be in effect for the term of the NCIB.\nAbout Bluedrop\nBluedrop Performance Learning Inc.
