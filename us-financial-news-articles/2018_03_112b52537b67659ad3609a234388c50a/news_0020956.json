As such the Shareholders’ Meeting approved:\nThe corporate and consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2016-2017, as well as all resolutions concerning compensation (Say on pay). A dividend payout in the amount of €0.42 per share relative to fiscal 2016-2017, to be distributed on April 17, 2018 (ex-dividend date: March 16, 2018) with the option for shareholders to receive shares in lieu of a cash payment. The price of these new shares to be issued in payment of the dividend is set at €16.88, i.e. equal to 95% of the average of the trading prices of the twenty stock exchange trading days preceding the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, less the net amount of the dividend.
