Scientists analyzed 122 sets of human remains buried in the wind-swept cemetery in the South Atlantic.\nDuring Britain’s two-month war to reclaim the Falklands, 255 British troops and about 650 Argentine soldiers were killed. The majority of the Argentines who perished were on a Navy ship that sank.\nArgentina still claims the islands, which it calls the Malvinas. But the South American country signed an agreement with Britain in 2016 to try to identify the soldiers and divide the costs. The ICRC forensic scientists began their efforts last June.\nRelatives of Argentine soldiers who died during the Falklands War pose for a photo during their visit to Darwin cemetery, where their relatives were buried, in the Falkland Islands, March 26, 2018.

Nora Dimotta, whose son Raul never returned from the war, cried in front of one of the dozens of still-unmarked graves.\n“This is not the final step, this is the beginning,” said Norma Gomez, whose brother Eduardo was identified. “This process will continue until all the missing soldiers are identified.”\n(This story has been refiled to add dropped word ‘of’ in first paragraph)\nReporting by Juan Bustamante; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T04:20:20.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
