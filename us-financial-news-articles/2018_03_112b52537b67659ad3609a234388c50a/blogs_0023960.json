His attorneys said throughout the trial that he was innocent and that no company received special benefits from Petrobras or Banco do Brasil under his leadership. \nHe served as CEO of Petrobras, as the company is known, from 2015 to 2016, and was brought in to clean up the firm after its central role in a huge corruption scandal that has embroiled politicians and business executives. \nBendine, who led state-owned lender Banco do Brasil from 2009 to 2015, was charged last August. \nProsecutors alleged that Bendine sought 17 million reais in bribes when he led Banco do Brasil to authorize the rollover of a loan to Odebrecht. Odebrecht refused to pay him, according to testimony from its executives. \nShortly before taking over as head of Petrobras, he demanded and received payment of 3 million reais from Odebrecht so that it could receive unspecified favorable treatment from Petrobras, Moro found in his ruling. \n($1 = 3.2449 reais) (Reporting by Ricardo Brito; Additional reporting by Brad Brooks in Sao Paulo; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T11:31:01.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
