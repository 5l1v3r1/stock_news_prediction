His lawyers argued his \"aberrant\" conduct stemmed from anxiety and depression.\nBefore joining Akin Gump in April 2016, Wertkin worked in a DOJ division that handles lawsuits filed by whistleblowers against companies on the government's behalf to recover taxpayer funds paid out based on fraudulent claims.\nThose lawsuits are filed pursuant to the False Claims Act under seal to allow the government to determine whether it wants to join the cases. Whistleblowers can receive a cut of any settlement or verdict.\nProsecutors said that, before leaving the Justice Department, Wertkin began making electronic copies of lawsuits or sneaking into his boss's office at night to copy complaints he found there.\nOnce at Akin Gump, Wertkin pitched his services to companies he knew were under investigation and later to try to sell some of complaints to corporations the government was probing.\nIn one instance, Wertkin using the alias of \"Dan\" used a burner phone to offer an employee at one targeted a copy of a lawsuit in exchange for a \"consulting fee,\" prosecutors said.\nThat employee reported \"Dan\" to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and negotiated to have a colleague, who was actually an undercover FBI agent, deliver $310,000 to Wertkin in exchange for the lawsuit, prosecutors said.\nA disguised Wertkin was arrested at a Cupertino, California, hotel trying sell a copy of the lawsuit to the agent, prosecutors said.\nAfter his arrest, Wertkin returned to Akin Gump to destroy evidence and stage his office to falsely implicate other Justice Department officials as the source of the complaints, prosecutors said.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Diane Craft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T09:06:27.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
