But it skipped a reference to potentially increasing purchases, a signal that it remains on track to end the three-year-old stimulus scheme before the end of 2018.\nThe euro hit a fresh two-month high against the Swiss franc at 1.1795 francs per euro and was up half a percent on the day.\nThe single currency also chalked up gains against Scandinavian rivals, but was broadly flat against the dollar at $1.2393.\nSELLING PRESSURE The yen came under some selling pressure, with the dollar rising more than half a percent against the yen to 105.92 yen , with Morgan Stanley strategists saying the yen could come under more selling pressure.\n“With bond volatility falling as Japan starts its new fiscal year in April, Japanese investors’ appetite for long-term foreign bond investments should rebound temporarily,” they wrote in a daily note.\nElsewhere, the dollar edged higher on hopes that negotiations between the United States and China would produce a compromise and avoid a full-blown trade war.\nBut news U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had discussed “joining forces to counter” China’s economic practices and alleged intellectual property theft raised fears that trade tensions could escalate.\nThe U.S. currency was 0.2 percent higher against a broad basket of its rivals at 89.50 and less than 2 percent below a six-week high of 90.93 hit in early March.\nElsewhere, sterling was buffeted by cross winds as optimism about media reports that Britain will propose a new solution for the Irish border dispute holding up Brexit talks was offset by some disappointment over retail sales data.\nBritish retail sales fell for the first time in five months in March as heavy snowfall combined with the financial strains on many households, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed on Wednesday.\nU.S. data due later in the day include the final estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product and pending home sales.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee and Tom Finn; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYOl Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-03-28T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T03:29:44.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
