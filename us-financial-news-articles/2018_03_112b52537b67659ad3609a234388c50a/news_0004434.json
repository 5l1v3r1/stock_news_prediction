With the fiscal emergency resolved, the advisory board was created to transition the city back to local control.\nMichigan ended oversight of eight cities, one township and Wayne County in recent years. Four school districts continue to have some form of state supervision, according to the Michigan Treasury Department website.\nWith Detroit ending three straight fiscal years with balanced budgets, Mayor Mike Duggan has said the city’s financial review commission should soon be able to go dormant. The state commission was created as part of Detroit’s court-approved plan to exit in 2014 what was then the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy.\nMichigan’s largest city was able to shed about $7 billion of its $18 billion of debt and obligations in federal bankruptcy court.\nIn January, Michigan’s treasurer diminished the role of Flint’s oversight board, giving the mayor and city council more responsibility for operations and finances.\nFlint’s financial emergency, which began in 2011, became controversial when its state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 changed the city’s water source, which caused lead to leach from pipes. The water crisis prompted dozens of lawsuits and criminal charges against former government officials.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:57:15.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
