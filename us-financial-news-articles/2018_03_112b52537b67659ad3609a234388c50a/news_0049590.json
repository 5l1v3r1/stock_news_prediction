A price cap was included to exempt premium models. \nUnder the subsidy scheme, buyers get 4,000 euros off their all-electric vehicle purchase and 3,000 euros off plug-in hybrids. \n“The manufacturer proved with an independent assessment that a base version of the Model S is available on the market for less than 60,000 euros,” German daily newspaper Die Welt on Thursday quoted Bafa as saying. \nIt said, however, that the agency was reviewing previously approved applications for subsidies as it was unclear whether Tesla had stuck with the price limit in the past. $1 = 0.8112 euros Reporting by Maria Sheahan Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T09:24:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
