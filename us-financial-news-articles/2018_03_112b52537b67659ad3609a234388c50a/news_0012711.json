Saudi stocks were 0.03 percent lower, weighed down by telecommunications services and healthcare stocks.\nBanque Saudi Fransi also finished 1.9 percent lower after missing forecasts for fourth-quarter profit in its results published on Sunday.\nThe Dubai index was down 0.2 percent, but the Abu Dhabi index was 0.1 percent up.\nReporting by Tom Arnold.
