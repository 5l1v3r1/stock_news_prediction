Certain statements in this press release may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Forward-looking information may relate to GardaWorld's future outlook and anticipated events, business, operations, financial performance, financial condition or results and, in some cases, can be identified by terminology such as \"may\"; \"will\"; \"should\"; \"expect\"; \"plan\"; \"anticipate\"; \"believe\"; \"intend\"; \"estimate\"; \"predict\"; \"potential\"; \"continue\"; \"foresee\", \"ensure\" or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

These statements are based on certain factors and assumptions including expected growth, results of operations, performance and business prospects and opportunities, which GardaWorld believes are reasonable as of the current date. While management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to GardaWorld, they may prove to be incorrect. GardaWorld cautions the reader that the current economic conditions make forward-looking information and the underlying assumptions subject to greater uncertainty and that, consequently, they may not materialize, or the results may significantly differ from the GardaWorld's expectations. It is impossible for GardaWorld to predict with certainty the impact that the current economic may have on future results. Forward-looking information is also subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what GardaWorld currently expects. Some of the factors contributing to those uncertainties are fluctuations in quarterly and annual results and the ability of the Company to reduce its debt leverage in the current credit environment. Other contributing factors are fluctuations of interest rate and foreign exchange rate, government regulations, permits and licenses, capacity to manage growth, collective agreements, insurance, contracts not renewed or terminated, demand for the services offered by the Company, industry pricing pressure, as well as market forces, economic cycles, and the strength of regional economies where the Company conducts its business.
