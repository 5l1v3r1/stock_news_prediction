The ministry said the price of the Eurobonds eligible for the swap must not exceed 113.5 percent of their face value.\nRussia’s debt to gross domestic product ratio is very low by international standards at around 15 percent, and the finance ministry is not heavily reliant on external borrowing. The ministry is on track to post a budget surplus this year.\nLast year Putin ordered that Eurobonds be offered to help Russians holding capital abroad bring their money home. The finance ministry promised to give preference to Russians when selling sovereign Eurobonds.\nWealthy Russians facing the prospect of targeted U.S. sanctions had floated the idea of a special treasury bond to help create favourable conditions for them to bring their cash home. Unlike with bank accounts, future holders of Eurobonds can remain anonymous.
