There is no way I will do that.'”\nUnki, the smallest of three platinum mines in Zimbabwe, is Amplats’ only operation outside South Africa.\nThe smelter under construction will produce a matte product that will be sent to the company’s refinery in South Africa.\nAs well as concerns about not keeping a controlling stake, miners were concerned that companies were only allowed to retain 20 percent of their foreign earnings, Griffith said.\nFollowing years of cost cuts and asset sales, Amplats paid its first dividend in seven years last week.\n“The market is improving all the time so as we get to that position one of the things that will be a key consideration is: does the market want the extra ounces?” he said.\nZimbabwe will impose a 15 percent penalty tax from Jan. 1, 2019 on exports of platinum producers which do not build refining facilities in the country, Chitando told a mining conference on Wednesday.\nImpala Platinum ( IMPJ.J ), Zimbabwe’s largest platinum producer, said last year “neither the smelter nor the export levy is affordable” and could lead to the closure of its Mimosa mine.\nWriting by Zandi Shabalala; Editing by Pratima Desai and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:46:00.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
