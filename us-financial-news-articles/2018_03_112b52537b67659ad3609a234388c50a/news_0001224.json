In January, CES, the electronics trade show in Las Vegas, faced similar complaints for the skewed gender makeup of its solo keynote speakers, all of whom were men. \nFortune contacted RSA for comment and will update this post if it receives a response. \nRSA told news site Axios that 20% of its overall speakers will be women, albeit in less prominent roles. “This year, RSA Conference will feature more than 130 female speakers tackling everything from data integrity to hybrid clouds to application security, among other topics,” the organizers told Axios. \nThey also pointed out to USA Today that the conference keynote lineup is not yet final and other speakers may be added later. Additionally, it shifted some of the blame to the technology industry itself, in which women fill a minority of technical roles including in the computer security field.
