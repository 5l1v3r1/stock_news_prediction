He said all staff at the embassy were safe.\nShi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Sadegh Hossein Shirazi, whose son was recently arrested for insulting Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been a fierce critic of Iran’s clerical leadership.\nIranian state television Quote: d a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi had protested about the incident to the British ambassador in Tehran.\n“Britain is responsible for the safety of Iranian diplomats,” said the spokesman, Bahram Qasemi.\nIran’s state news agency IRNA said the attackers had carried knives and sticks.
