The cash-strapped government has previously issued bonds to compensate oil companies for late payments, and Gonzalez said he expected a resolution“very soon.”\n“I would rather not comment at this point on what kind of payment tenure we are anticipating or what kind of interest rates we have in mind, but ... in the next few weeks we will be able to provide more detail,” Gonzalez said.\nGonzalez said YPF Energia Electrica, YPF’s electricity subsidiary being partly sold to General Electric Co, has an implied valuation of $1.1 billion to $1.24 billion. GE plans to purchase a 25 percent stake in the subsidiary.\nGonzalez said the company is in talks with an unnamed third company about the sale of an additional 25 percent stake. Reuters reported in December that YPF was in talks with U.S. asset manager Blackstone Group LP about the additional stake.\nGutierrez added that YPF expects to name a new chief executive before the next shareholders’ meeting, which is scheduled for April 27. A six-member committee has run the company since former CEO Ricardo Darre resigned in August.\nOn Friday, the company posted a full-year 2017 profit of 12.7 billion pesos ($627.16 million), rebounding from a 28.4 billion-peso loss in 2016.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T22:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:08:05.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
