JTC will price its shares at 290 pence apiece in the flotation that could be announced as soon as Friday, the source said. Jersey-based JTC, which was set up 31 years ago, provides administration services to funds with more than $85 billion in assets, spanning real estate to private equity. It is majority-owned by its employees and also counts CBPE Capital as a minority investor. Stockbrokers Zeus and Numis are working on JTCâ€™s listing plans, which Reuters first reported last month. $1 = 0.7242 pounds Reporting by Ben Martin Editing by Pamela Barbaglia and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T20:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:19:39.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
