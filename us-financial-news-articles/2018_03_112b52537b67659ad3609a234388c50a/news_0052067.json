It is also expected to launch the price of the rights issue, aimed at paying down debt, plugging the pension deficit and boosting investment.\nLewis, a turnaround specialist who joined Capita from oil services company Amec Foster Wheeler, is seeking to change Capita’s culture after the group won contracts it sometimes struggled to deliver profitably, like others in its sector.\nHe has appointed a chief people officer and intends to bring in a director of digital and general legal counsel who have a proven track record in turning around operations, the person said.\nCapita declined to comment.\n$1 = 0.7065 pounds Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary and Kate Holton Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:43:33.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
