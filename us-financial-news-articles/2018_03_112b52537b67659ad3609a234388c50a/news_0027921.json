(OTCQB:ARPO), a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Over the past year, Aerpio has made tremendous progress in the development of AKB-9778, our first-in-class Tie2-activator,” said Stephen Hoffman, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Aerpio. “In June 2017, we initiated our TIME-2b Phase 2b study in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). The ability to delay or reverse the progression of NPDR to sight-threatening conditions, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema, is a significant unmet medical need. We have been very encouraged by the clinical community’s interest in AKB-9778’s differentiated mechanism of action, its subcutaneous route of administration, and potential to treat multiple diabetic vascular comorbidities. In fact, we announced last month that we had completed enrollment in TIME-2b three months earlier than originally projected. We also recently reported preliminary data supporting the potential of AKB-9778 to protect the kidney vasculature in patients with diabetes. Additionally, based on findings from our previous Phase 2 trial with AKB-9778, we plan to begin clinical development for an eye drop formulation of AKB-9778 to treat primary open angle glaucoma within the next year.”\nRecent Company Highlights\nCompleted enrollment in the TIME-2b study, a Phase 2b clinical trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of the Company’s lead candidate, AKB-9778, for patients with moderate-to-severe NPDR. Presented promising preliminary renal function data from the Company’s Phase 2a TIME-2 clinical trial at the Keystone Symposium on Reducing the Burden of Diabetes Related End-Organ Injury. Successfully completed pre-IND meeting with the FDA for AKB-4924, a once-daily, oral HIF-1α stabilizer for treatment of ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Completed an AKB-4924 single ascending dose study in human subjects under a CTA in Canada. Successfully completed pre-IND meeting with FDA for ARP-1536, a fully-humanized monoclonal antibody that activates Tie2 by binding the extracellular domain of the vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). Because of the long half-life of monoclonal antibodies ARP-1536 has the potential activate Tie2 while being dosed less frequently. Appointed Stephen Hoffman, M.D., Ph.D., as Chief Executive Officer and to the Board of Directors. Appointed Michael Rogers as Chief Financial Officer.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $20.3 million. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2017 were 27.1 million.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, operating expenses totaled $6.3 million, compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2016. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $6.2 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4.6 million, or $4.76 per share, for the same period in 2016.\nOperating expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2017, was $21.4 million compared to $16.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $22.3 million, or $1.03 per share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $20.9 million, or $24.52 per share, for the full year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2017, increased approximately $0.8 million, or 7%, to $12.1 million from $11.4 million in the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was the result of increased spending on our lead candidate AKB-9778, currently in Phase 2b development, partially offset by a decrease in spending on our pipeline candidates AKB-4924 and ARP-1536.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2017, increased approximately $4.0 million, or 75%, to $9.2 million from $5.3 million in the full year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to personnel and related expenses, as well as professional services, including legal, accounting, insurance and other professional services expenses associated with the reverse merger and related transactions, which we refer to as the Merger, a private placement financing in March 2017, and operating as a public company.\nAs a result of the Merger during the first quarter of 2017, more fully discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, outstanding preferred shares were exchanged for and outstanding amounts under senior secured convertible notes were converted into common shares of the Company. The Merger was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes. Following the Merger, we sold to accredited investors $40.2 million of our shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of $37.2 million after deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the offering.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAerpio management will host a live conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today to discuss Aerpio’s financial results and provide a general business update.\nThe live webcast and a replay may be accessed by visiting Aerpio's website at http://ir.aerpio.com/ .

AKB-9778 binds to and inhibits the intracellular domain of VE-PTP, the most critical negative regulator of Tie2. AKB-9778 has demonstrated the ability to activate the Tie2 receptor irrespective of extracellular levels of its binding ligands, angiopoietin-1 (agonist) or angiopoietin-2 (antagonist) and may be the most efficient pharmacologic approach to activating Tie2.\nAbout Diabetic Retinopathy\nDiabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes caused by damage to blood vessels in the retina. Severity of DR ranges from mild NPDR to more advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), the hallmark of which is the development of new abnormal blood vessels.\nAbout Aerpio Pharmaceuticals\nAerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular diseases. The Company’s lead compound, AKB‐9778, is a small molecule activator of the Tie2 pathway and is in clinical development for the treatment of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
