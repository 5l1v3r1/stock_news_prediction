We have to raise retail prices,” the official said. \nIndian farmers are price sensitive and have in the past trimmed purchases when prices rose, said a senior official with a private fertiliser company. \nA lower subsidy will weigh on the country’s negotiations with overseas sellers, both industry officials said. \n“We could not offer a higher price to suppliers due to lower subsidy support,” the official with the private fertiliser maker said. \nIndia buys potash from global miners in annual contracts that the south Asian country could sign in June. \nContracts signed by India and China are considered benchmarks globally, and are closely watched by other potash buyers such as Malaysia and Indonesia.
