S&P 500 e-minis rose 5.25 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 29.5 points.\nSince Trump’s tariff announcement last Thursday, the manufacturing-heavy Dow has posted losses for three days.\nExpress Scripts soared 18 percent after health insurer Cigna agreed to buy the pharmacy benefits manager for $54-billion deal. Cigna shares slipped 5 percent.\nThe European Central Bank’s policy announcement is being closely watched for details on how fast the central bank will end its 2.5 trillion euro stimulus program.\nAmong economic data, a Labor Department report is expected to show initial jobless claims rose to 220,000 from 210,000 in the week ended March 3.\nA keenly-awaited reading on jobs and wage is expected on Friday.\nInvestors are worried that higher wages could lead to faster interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and make borrowing expensive.
