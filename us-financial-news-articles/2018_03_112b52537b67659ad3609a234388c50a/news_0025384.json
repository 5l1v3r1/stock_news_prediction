Last week Paulo Rabello de Castro, chief executive officer of Brazilian development bank BNDES, confirmed the talks between the companies.\nBNDES is a common shareholder in Fibria and Suzano. Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico reported the bid earlier.\nValor had reported that Chile’s Arauco, a subsidiary of industrial conglomerate Empresas Copec SA COP.SN, and Finland’s UPM ( UPM.HE ) were also interested in acquiring Fibria.\nPaper Excellence, controlled by the Wijaya family, which also owns Indonesia’s Asia Pulp & Paper Co Ltd [SINAMS.UL], has acquired Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA last year for $4.7 billion. Fibria and Eldorado have units in the same city, Três Lagoas, in Mato Grosso do Sul state.\nBanco BTG Pactual SA ( BPAC3.SA ) is advising Paper Excellence in the acquisition. Fibria, Paper Excellence, and BTG Pactual did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n($1 = 3.2559 reais)\nReporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T16:21:31.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
