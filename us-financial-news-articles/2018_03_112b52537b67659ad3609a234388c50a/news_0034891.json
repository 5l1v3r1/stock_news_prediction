REUTERS/Rebecca Naden The former rugby league international escaped a conviction at Brisbane Magistrates last month, though, receiving small fines for possession of the prescription tranquilizer Xanax and for missing a summons to appear at a police station. Hunt was handed an additional A$10,000 (5,525 pounds) fine and a four-match ban by Rugby Australia for his transgression, the governing body said on Monday, and will be put on an “illicit drugs testing” programme for a year. The 31-year-old, who also played at the top level in Australian Rules for five years, had voluntarily stood down from the Queenslands Reds after his arrest so was deemed to have served the ban. “We take all matters of off-field behaviour seriously and have conducted a thorough investigation into the events surrounding Karmichael Hunt’s arrest in December,” said Rugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle. “We’ve considered the judgement of the court and all the evidence we had available ... as well as considering the damage that the very public nature of his arrest and the subsequent speculation has inflicted on the game.”Hunt was also fined but not convicted at a Queensland court when he was arrested and charged with cocaine distribution in 2015, with Rugby Australia then banning him for six weeks and doling out a much heavier financial penalty of A$30,000. “The penalty handed down to Karmichael today also takes into account a previous disciplinary matter for which he was fined and suspended in 2015,” Castle added. Hunt played six tests for the Wallabies in the centres last year and signed a new deal taking him through to the end of next year’s World Cup a month before his arrest last year.
