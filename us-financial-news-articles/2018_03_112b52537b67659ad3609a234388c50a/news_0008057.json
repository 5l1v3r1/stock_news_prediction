That drove it to its weakest level against the euro since November on Friday.\nThe pound traded flat at $1.3806 against the dollar, and down 0.1 percent versus the euro at 89.320 pence per euro .\n“Euro sterling pushed up to its highest levels this year last week, edging above 0.8930 with the next resistance at the 0.9020 area,” said Michael Hewson, chief analyst at CMC Markets.\nAgainst the dollar, the pound has fallen in recent weeks and remains far below its post-Brexit vote high of $1.4346 hit in January.\nStill, investors added to their net long positions on the pound last week, data shows, signalling that traders are still betting it will rise.
