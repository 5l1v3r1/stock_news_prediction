Wardinski, Chairman and CEO of Playa Hotels & Resorts\nRecent Developments\nOn February 26th, 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination with Sagicor Group Jamaica Limited (“Sagicor”) whereby Sagicor will contribute into Playa a portfolio of five all-inclusive resorts and two adjacent oceanfront developable land sites located on the desirable North Coast of Jamaica. The portfolio includes four existing resorts including the 489-room Hilton Rose Hall, the 268-room Jewel Runaway Bay, the 250-room Jewel Dunn’s River and the 225-room Jewel Paradise Cove. It also includes an 88-room hotel tower and spa, two developable land sites with a potential density of up to 700 rooms and a hotel management contract for the Jewel Grande Palmyra. The existing assets are currently managed by an external third-party operator and upon closing of the transaction, Playa will be able to immediately internalize and self-manage the assets. In exchange, Sagicor will receive 20 million shares of PLYA ordinary shares and $100 million in cash. In addition, Playa has agreed to nominate two Sagicor appointees for election to Playa’s Board of Directors in connection with the consummation of the transaction.\nOn December 6, 2017, we amended our Senior Secured Credit Facility to borrow an additional $380.0 million priced at 99.75% of the principal amount. Proceeds were used to redeem and fully repay our remaining Senior Notes due 2020.\nWe renovated and re-branded two of our resorts under the new Panama Jack hotel brand, which included conversion of Gran Caribe and Gran Porto to Panama Jack Resorts Cancun and Panama Jack Resorts Playa del Carmen, respectively. The renovation and re-branding was completed and the properties were opened under their new flags in December 2017.\nRenovations at Hyatt Ziva and Zilara Rose Hall Jamaica were completed in December 2017. These included the renovation of 334 remaining original rooms, including new room configurations to maximize sales to families at the Hyatt Ziva and shifting 110 rooms from Ziva to Zilara to accommodate greater demand. We also constructed a new beach spa and a state-of-the-art fitness facility.\nRenovation of the Preferred Tower rooms at Hyatt Ziva Puerto Vallarta was completed in December 2017. These renovations improve the premium guest experience and allow us to achieve higher rates for these significantly improved rooms.\nFinancial and Operating Results\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our Occupancy, Net Package ADR, Net Package RevPAR, Total Net Revenue, Resort EBITDA, Corporate Expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 for our portfolio:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Occupancy 78.0 % 82.3 % (4.3 )pts 81.4 % 81.2 % 0.2 pts Net Package ADR $ 237.86 $ 212.49 11.9 % $ 256.93 $ 240.53 6.8 % Comparable Net Package RevPAR (1) 195.56 174.92 11.8 % 215.23 195.31 10.2 % Net Package RevPAR 185.59 174.92 6.1 % 209.27 195.31 7.1 % Total Net Revenue (2) 123,491 116,770 5.8 % 546,211 509,039 7.3 % Owned Resort EBITDA (3) $ 38,317 $ 36,787 4.2 % $ 201,482 $ 185,262 8.8 % Owned Resort EBITDA Margin 31.1 % 31.5 % (0.4 )pts 36.9 % 36.4 % 0.5 pts Corporate Expenses $ 7,403 $ 8,057 (8.1 ) % $ 30,757 $ 30,593 0.5 % Management Fee Revenue 140 — 100.0 % 140 — 100.0 % Adjusted EBITDA (4) $ 31,054 $ 28,730 8.1 % $ 170,865 $ 154,669 10.5 % Adjusted EBITDA Margin 25.1 % 24.6 % 0.5 pts 31.3 % 30.4 % 0.9 pts (1) Comparable Net Package RevPAR removes the room nights out of service due to renovation and hurricane disruption from the available room nights.\n(2) Total Net Revenue represents revenue from the sale of all-inclusive packages, which include room accommodations, food and beverage services and entertainment activities, net of compulsory tips paid to employees in Mexico and Jamaica.

(\"Playa\") is a leading owner, operator, manager and developer of all-inclusive beachfront resorts in popular vacation destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. We are currently the only publicly-traded company focusing exclusively on the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry. We have a portfolio consisting of 13 resorts (6,130 rooms) we own, which are located in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, and one resort (184 rooms) we manage for a third party, which is located in the Dominican Republic. We believe that the resorts we own, as well as the resorts we manage, are among the finest all-inclusive resorts in the markets they serve. All of our resorts offer guests luxury accommodations, noteworthy architecture, extensive on-site activities and multiple food and beverage options. Our guests also have the opportunity to purchase upgrades from us such as premium rooms, dining experiences, wines and spirits and spa packages.\nForward-Looking Statement\nThis press release may contain Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Occupancy is a useful measure of the utilization of a resort’s total available capacity and can be used to gauge demand at a specific resort or group of properties for a period. Occupancy levels also enable us to optimize Net Package ADR by increasing or decreasing the stated rate for our all-inclusive packages as demand for a resort increases or decreases.\nNet Package Average Daily Rate (“Net Package ADR”)\n“Net Package ADR” represents total net package revenue for a period divided by the total number of rooms sold during such period. Net Package ADR trends and patterns provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the guest base of our total portfolio or comparable portfolio, as applicable. Net Package ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry, and is commonly used to assess the stated rates that guests are willing to pay through various distribution channels.\nNet Package Revenue per Available Room (“Net Package RevPAR”)\n\"Net Package RevPAR\" is the product of Net Package ADR (as defined above) and the average daily occupancy percentage. Net Package RevPAR does not reflect the impact of non-package revenue. Although Net Package RevPAR does not include this additional revenue, it generally is considered the key performance measure in the all-inclusive segment of the lodging industry to identify trend information with respect to net room revenue produced by our portfolio or comparable portfolio, as applicable, and to evaluate operating performance on a consolidated basis or a regional basis, as applicable.\nNet Revenue, Net Package Revenue and Net Non-package Revenue\nWe derive net revenue from the sale of all-inclusive packages, which include room accommodations, food and beverage services and entertainment activities, net of compulsory tips paid to employees in Mexico and Jamaica. Government mandated compulsory tips in the Dominican Republic are not included in this adjustment, as they are already excluded from revenue. Net revenue is recognized when the rooms are occupied and/or the relevant services have been rendered. Advance deposits received from guests are deferred and included in trade and other payables until the rooms are occupied and/or the relevant services have been rendered, at which point the revenue is recognized. Food and beverage revenue not included in a guest’s all-inclusive package is recognized when the goods are consumed. Net revenue represents a key indicator to assess the overall performance of our business and analyze trends, such as consumer demand, brand preference and competition.\nIn analyzing our results, our management differentiates between Net Package Revenue and Net Non-package Revenue (as such terms are defined below). Guests at our resorts purchase packages at stated rates, which include room accommodations, food and beverage services and entertainment activities, in contrast to other lodging business models, which typically only include the room accommodations in the stated rate. The amenities at all-inclusive resorts typically include a variety of buffet and á la carte restaurants, bars, activities, and shows and entertainment throughout the day. “Net Package Revenue” consists of net revenues derived from all-inclusive packages purchased by our guests. “Net Non-package Revenue” primarily includes net revenue associated with guests' purchases of upgrades, premium services and amenities, such as premium rooms, dining experiences, wines and spirits and spa packages, which are not included in the all-inclusive package.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of Total Net Revenue to total revenue for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Package Revenue $ 104,668 $ 98,838 $ 468,434 $ 439,009 Net Non-package Revenue 18,683 17,932 77,637 70,030 Management Fee Revenue 140 — 140 — Total Net Revenue 123,491 116,770 546,211 509,039 Plus: compulsory tips 3,047 3,351 13,334 12,452 Total revenue $ 126,538 $ 120,121 $ 559,545 $ 521,491 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Resort EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as net (loss) income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the period presented, before interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude the following items:\nOther expense, net Impairment loss Pre-opening expense Transaction expenses Severance expense Other tax expense Gain on property damage insurance proceeds Share-based compensation Loss on extinguishment of debt Other components of net periodic pension cost (benefit) Other items which may include, but are not limited to the following: management contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; repairs from hurricanes and tropical storms; and Jamaica delayed opening expenses.\nWe define Resort EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA before corporate expenses and management fee income.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors for two principal reasons. First, we believe Adjusted EBITDA assists investors in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance. For example, changes in foreign exchange rates (which are the principal driver of changes in other expense (income), net), and expenses related to capital raising, strategic initiatives and other corporate initiatives, such as expansion into new markets (which are the principal drivers of changes in transaction expenses), are not indicative of the operating performance of our resorts. The other adjustments included in our definition of Adjusted EBITDA relate to items that occur infrequently and therefore would obstruct the comparability of our operating results over reporting periods. For example, impairment losses, such as those resulting from hurricane damage, and related revenue from insurance policies, other than business interruption insurance policies, as well as expenses incurred in connection with closing or reopening resorts that undergo expansions or renovations, are infrequent in nature, and we believe excluding these expense and revenue items permits investors to better evaluate the core operating performance of our resorts over time.\nThe second principal reason that we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors is that it is considered a key performance indicator by our board of directors (our \"Board\") and management. In addition, the compensation committee of our Board determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based, in part, on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors with information utilized by our Board and management to assess our performance and may (subject to the limitations described below) enable investors to compare the performance of our portfolio to our competitors.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Resort EBITDA are not substitutes for net income (loss) or any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are limitations to the utility of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA. For example, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that other companies publish to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these and other limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Resort EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income or loss generated by our business or discretionary cash available for investment in our business, and investors should carefully consider our U.S. GAAP results presented in this release.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\n\"Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\" is a non-GAAP performance measure. We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as net income attributable to Playa Hotels & Resorts, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding special items which are not reflective of our core operating performance, such as one-time expenses related to debt extinguishment and transaction expenses. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) provides meaningful comparisons of ongoing operating results, by removing from net income the impact of items that do not reflect our normalized operations.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is not a substitute for net income (loss) or any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There are limitations to the utility of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income (Loss). For example, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) or similarly named non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that other companies publish to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) should not be considered as a measure of the income or loss generated by our business or discretionary cash available for investment in our business, and investors should carefully consider our U.S. GAAP results presented in this release.\nPlaya Hotels & Resorts N.V.\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) Income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Resort EBITDA\n($ in thousands)\nThe following is a reconciliation of our U.S. GAAP net (loss) income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Resort EBITDA for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income $ (11,683 ) $ (24,615 ) $ (241 ) $ 20,216 Interest expense 12,474 14,174 53,661 54,793 Income tax (benefit) provision (11,054 ) 9,502 9,051 4,232 Depreciation and amortization 13,038 13,935 53,131 52,744 EBITDA $ 2,775 $ 12,996 $ 115,602 $ 131,985 Other expense, net (a) $ 1,704 $ 3,243 $ 1,078 $ 5,390 Transaction expense (b) 10,515 12,664 21,708 16,538 Severance expense — — 442 — Other tax expense (c) 1,180 (296 ) 1,778 675 Jamaica delayed opening expenses (d) (51 ) — (203 ) — Gain on property damage insurance proceeds (e) — (39 ) — (348 ) Share-based compensation 962 — 3,765 — Loss on extinguishment of debt 12,594 — 25,120 — Repairs from hurricanes and tropical storms (f) 1,042 — 1,807 — Other components of net periodic pension benefit (cost) (g) 333 162 (232 ) 429 Adjusted EBITDA 31,054 28,730 170,865 154,669 Corporate expenses 7,403 8,057 30,757 30,593 Management fees (140 ) — (140 ) — Resort EBITDA $ 38,317 $ 36,787 $ 201,482 $ 185,262 (a) Represents changes in foreign exchange and other miscellaneous expenses or income.\n(b) Represents expenses incurred in connection with corporate initiatives, such as: debt refinancing costs; other capital raising efforts including the business combination with Pace; the redesign and build-out of our internal controls and strategic initiatives, such as possible expansion into new markets.\n(c) Relates primarily to a Dominican Republic asset tax, which is an alternative tax to income tax in the Dominican Republic. We eliminate this expense from Adjusted EBITDA because it is substantially similar to the income tax expense we eliminate from our calculation of EBITDA.\n(d) Represents a reversal on an expense accrual recorded in 2014 related to our future stay obligations provided to guests affected by the delayed opening of Hyatt Ziva and Hyatt Zilara Rose Hall. The partial reversal of this accrual occurred throughout 2017.\n(e) Represents a gain from insurance proceeds related to property insurance and not business interruption proceeds.\n(f) Represents repair and maintenance expenses at Hyatt Ziva Los Cabos due to Tropical Storm Lidia, Dreams Punta Cana and Dreams Palm Beach due to Hurricane Maria for $0.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.4 million respectively.
