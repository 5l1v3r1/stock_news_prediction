Stokes has not played test cricket since an incident outside a Bristol nightclub last September led to him being charged with affray. He currently has three active International Cricket Council (ICC) demerit points to his name and a further offence in the Auckland test will activate an automatic one-match suspension. “He’ll have to be on best behaviour,” Root said. “I’m sure there might be a bit of noise about that after what’s happened (to Kagiso Rabada) – about demerit points and missing games.” Cricket - ODI - New Zealand vs England - Bay Oval, Tauranga, New Zealand, February 28, 2018.

Root said he wanted to be sure that Stokes would be available to play for a run of matches. The 26-year-old missed the Ashes tour of Australia and returned to action last month in the five-match one-day international series against New Zealand, which England won 3-2.
