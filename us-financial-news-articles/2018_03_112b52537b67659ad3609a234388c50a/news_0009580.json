They finished the game on a 13-1 run.\nFreshman Justice Sueing had 17 points and five rebounds and Kingsley Okoroh had eight points and nine rebounds for the Bears (8-23, 2-16), who won only one league game in the calendar year, 74-70 over Oregon State on Feb. 3.

He is two short of Kevin Love’s Pac-12 freshman record.\nAyton had his double-double at halftime, with 14 points and 11 rebounds, as Arizona took an 11-point lead late in the first half in a game that tightened quickly.\nCal scored the final seven points of the half to trim an 11-point deficit to 38-35, and Sueing scored the first four points of the second half to extend the run for a 39-38 lead.\nAyton made two free throws with 5:28 remaining for a 55-53 lead that sparked the final run, although Arizona’s lead was never greater than four until Trier’s steal and layup.\nNeither team shot well. Cal made 38.9 percent and was 3-of-16 from 3-point range. Arizona hit 5 of 18 3-pointers.\nTrier entered the game as one of three Division I players shooting 50 percent from the field, 40 percent from 3-point range and 85 percent from the foul line. The others were Weber State’s Jerrick Harding and Georgetown’s Marcus Derrickson.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T09:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:55:48.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
