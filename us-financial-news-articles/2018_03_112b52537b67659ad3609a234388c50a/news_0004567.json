( bit.ly/2oyrDTM )\n“These sales are the next step in a process Mark laid out in September to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s work in science, education and issues related to justice and opportunity. The funds will go to support a range of CZI’s philanthropic activities and operations for many years to come,” a CZI spokesperson told Reuters.\nZuckerberg said in September he would sell 35 million to 75 million shares of Facebook over the next 18 months. That would amount to up to $13 billion, based on Facebook's current share price. ( bit.ly/2F2qiyT )\nThe Silicon Valley billionaire has said he will donate 99 percent of his Facebook shares to CZI - worth about $45 billion when the initiative was formed.\nHe sold about $1.6 billion of the company’s stock in 2016 and 2017, according to technology website Recode.\nZuckerberg’s foundation is similar to those set up by Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates, and the Buffett Foundation, formed by billionaire Warren Buffett.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Vibhuti Sharma; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T18:24:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
