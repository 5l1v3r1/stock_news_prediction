The government introduced physical education for girls last year and began licensing women’s sports clubs, but Saudis are still coming around to women running in public.\n“This is just the beginning of a revolution for women in Saudi Arabia. In jobs, in our lives, in society, everything is going to change for Saudi women,” said one of the joggers, university student Sama Kinsara.\nThe biggest change yet will come in the summer when Saudi women will be allowed to drive.\nIn Spain, women went on a nationwide strike and held hundreds of rallies, closing many main roads and squares.\nTheir protests included bike rallies, marches, and midnight pot-banging sessions at which they chanted slogans such as “We continue to fight regardless of the cost!” and “Long live the women’s struggle”.\nWomen's right activists shout during a gathering on the street on International Women's Day in Brussels, Belgium March 8, 2018.

Dolatabadi said the woman, whom he did not name, was found guilty of “promoting corruption by removing her veil in public.”\nIran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Thursday accused Iran’s enemies of funding anti-hijab protests.\n“As the result some girls were deceived and removed their veil here and there,” he said. “But that’s a small issue. What I find worrying is that some of the elite are now questioning mandatory hijab.”\nReporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Raissa Kasolowsky; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T00:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T00:54:32.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
