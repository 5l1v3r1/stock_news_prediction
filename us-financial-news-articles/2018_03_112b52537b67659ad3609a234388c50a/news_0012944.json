Automakers are also major exporters and the dollar’s rebound versus the yen provided extra support.\nHonda Motor Co rose 2.4 percent, Toyota Motor Corp gained 1.7 percent and Subaru Corp climbed 1.4 percent.\nPanasonic Corp gained 2.2 percent and Tokyo Electron added 3.5 percent.\nSteel shares also rose, with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal advancing 1.75 percent, JFE Holdings gaining 2.35 percent and Kobe Steel adding 0.9 percent.\nThe broader Topix was 1.77 percent higher at 1,724.75.\nThe dollar was at 106.325 yen, having recovered from a 15-month low of 105.240 plumbed on Friday.
