When asked about his best memory at Harvard, Gates said, \"I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for.\"\nshow chapters Shark Tankâ€™s Robert Herjavec: Easy ways to keep your data safer      3:38 PM ET Tue, 28 Feb 2017 | 00:49 Another Reddit user asked how he then managed to pass his classes. Gates explained that he simply studied \"really hard\" during reading period, a small segment of time some colleges give students just before final exams.\nBy following this strategy, Gates wrote that he \"almost always\" received As. However, there was one exception. Upon reviewing the videotaped lectures for an organic chemistry class, he found that some had no sound or had faulty video. \"That spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course,\" Gates wrote on Reddit.\nIn his University of Nebraska panel discussion, Gates admitted that going into business was a sobering reality check. \"Nobody praised me because I would do things at the last minute,\" he said. As a result, he tried to \"reverse\" his habit to become more like the students he knew in college \"who were always organized and had things done on time.\" \nAlthough the billionaire managed to mostly excel at school even with this bad habit, studies say that the cost of procrastination far outweighs the short-term freedom. According to Psychological Science , citing 20 years of research, procrastination causes one's quality of work and well-being to suffer.\nWhile Gates may no longer wait until the last minute to complete important tasks, he told the students at the time that he's still a work in progress. \"I'm still working on it,\" said the billionaire, \"but procrastination is not a good habit.\"\nLike this story?
