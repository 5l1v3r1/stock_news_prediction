By comparison, he scored 63.6% in 2012, two years before his seizure of Crimea from Ukraine sent his approval ratings soaring. The result was in little doubt, given that the Kremlin has steadily tightened its grip over the main levers of power in Russia, including media and law enforcement — both of which the government uses to promote the president and sideline opponents. His most prominent critic, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in the campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T21:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-18T22:30:20.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
