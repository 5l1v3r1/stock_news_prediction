In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal , people are starting to ask, specifically, how much personal information are we talking about here?\nFacebook is taking steps to curb the amount of data that is shared about us: It is rolling out new tools for better controlling your privacy settings in the coming weeks and it is ending certain ad-targeting options that have been available to third-party data brokers. While waiting for these changes to take effect, there is something you can do to get some answers: Download your Facebook data. \nYou can request a folder of the things you have uploaded to or shared on Facebook from all your sessions on various devices—plus other curious information—to save on your computer. Here are instructions . Once you unzip the folder, open the “index.htm” file in a browser, and start looking around.\nRight now, you’ll see every Facebook friend you’ve ever had—plus the ones you’ve gotten rid of. You’ll see all your videos, pictures, events, liked pages, private messages and timeline posts. Soon, Facebook will have an improved download tool , and include more information such as posts you’ve liked, your reactions and comments, even your search and location history.\nIn a few weeks, Facebook’s account download tool is expected to have a new look and more details from your sessions. Photo: Facebook What isn’t in this single download is a lot of the behind-the-scenes data that Facebook may use to increase engagement and target ads. For instance, it doesn’t list people who might have uploaded your phone number or other information when syncing their contacts with Facebook. It doesn’t say what ads third-party data providers have targeted at you, or which bit of your grocery shopping or web browsing prompted such ads. (No, Facebook isn’t listening through your microphone —it doesn’t need to.)\nThat doesn’t mean there aren’t some interesting—and in some cases mysterious—things in this download. You may have already heard of users downloading their accounts and coming upon alarming information . Here’s what you should look out for:\nContacts, Call Logs and Texts One of the more shocking things some users discovered in their files was a list of phone calls and text messages. The furor prompted Facebook to post an explanation : Calls and texts were logged as part of an opt-in contact-syncing “feature” available to Android users who have Facebook’s stand-alone Messenger app or the Facebook Lite app .\nContact uploading is “a way to more easily find the people you want to connect with,” says Facebook, which insisted it was always opt-in: “People have to expressly agree to use this feature.” Call and text logging was only part of contact syncing on Android. On Apple’s iPhones, Facebook never had access to log calls, yet still offered contact syncing.\nYou can turn off the feature , and the data will be deleted if you do, says Facebook. (Go to Messenger, click on your profile picture, then click People. Look for the Synced Contacts button.)\nSome iOS users, perusing their uploaded contacts, spotted some ghosts: contacts that were no longer in their phones. On my iPhone, I never synced my own contacts and colleagues who had done so in the past, but stopped, said there were no contacts in their downloads.\nAdvertisers With Your Contact Info In your downloaded file, there is a list of companies that Facebook says have your contact info. (In your file, click on Ads.)\nIn your file, Facebook lists companies that it says have your contact information. Photo: Katherine Bindley/The Wall Street Journal Your list could be long, and you may be confused by some of the brands that appear. My own included 11 companies. Some, like Uber, weren’t a surprise. I’ve never signed onto Uber with Facebook, but I do have the app.\nFacebook’s website explains : “When you share information like your phone number or email address with a business, they may add it to a customer list that can be matched to your Facebook profile.”\nOK, so Uber matched my details to target ads at me. (Uber says if you share different contact information with Facebook and outside developers, there won’t be a match.)\nOne mystery company on my list: a fitness app called Aaptiv. While I’m certainly in the target market, I’ve never downloaded its app or clicked on its ads.\nThe company told me it doesn’t have my contact information, but that it may have used an outside data broker to target me. Yet the mystery persists, since Facebook’s list purports to show only companies in possession of my information.\nSome users also spotted musicians and bands they aren’t exactly fans of. Facebook didn’t offer an explanation, so we may never know why my editor’s list includes Cyndi Lauper.\nApps You Login With Facebook Another section of your download names the apps you log into with Facebook. It is not a complete history. If it were, mine would look like a graveyard of online dating apps . My list was empty, save Instagram.\nYou can also see this list—and edit it— by visiting the Apps page within your settings. On Facebook’s website, click on the pencil next to an app’s name to edit the permissions, or X it if you want to remove it.\nIf you are planning on deleting your Facebook account , make a note of all the apps you have linked to—because they all obtained some of your personal data from Facebook. Facebook says developers might keep information about you even after you removed them. To get that deleted, try to contact the developer .\nOn the same app-manager page, you can also turn off the ability to log into apps and websites using Facebook.\nErase Your Trail Last but not least, click Security to check out your list of Active Sessions (machines currently logged into your Facebook account) and Account Activity. This is a lengthy log of all of the “sessions” you’ve had on Facebook, and their associated times, devices and Internet Protocol addresses. \nWhile the list doesn’t name actual locations, every IP address correlates to some geographical location. It is easy to plug in the address to a website, such as iplocation.net or keycdn.com , to identify the corresponding geography. If you thought Facebook wasn’t keeping tabs on you, this list may be a little shocking. Facebook even says it uses IP addresses to target ads to you, even if you don’t let the app itself track you via GPS.\nIf you download this and it is still too daunting, wait a few weeks for the new download tool to arrive. The key is to feel in control, not overwhelmed.\nWrite to Katherine Bindley at Katherine.
