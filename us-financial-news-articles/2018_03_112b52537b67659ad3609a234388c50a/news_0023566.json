Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between his associates and Moscow. Probes of the issue, by congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, have shadowed Trump’s first 14 months in office.\nSeparately, the Democratic Senate and House leaders, as well as the top Democrats on the congressional Judiciary committees, released a letter on Monday urging Trump to use every resource available to extradite 13 Russians Mueller indicted last month for 2016 meddling.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said last week that the indicted Russian nationals could be prosecuted in Russia if they were found to have broken Russian law.\nThere could be action on Russia sanctions soon. Dan Coats, the Director of National Intelligence, insisted to a Senate hearing last week that the administration is engaged on the issue of election security, and said the Treasury Department would announce sanctions on Russia as soon as this week.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-13T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T20:46:45.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
