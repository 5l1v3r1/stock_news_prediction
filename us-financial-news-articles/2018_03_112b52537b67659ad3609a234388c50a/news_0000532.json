Parent company LS & Co. plans to use lasers as part of a new automation effort that aims to cut the production and distribution cycle for one of the world’s iconic brands, the WSJ’s Suzanne Kapner reports, a stark example of the increasingly creative use of technology suppliers are undertaking to meet retailing’s unyielding demand to cut cost and time from supply chains. In this case, LS & Co. is replacing a labor-intensive part of production with lasers that can give jeans the trendy worn look at a far faster pace, allowing the company to better match supply and demand. The end result: reduce the end-of-season markdowns that crush margins. Garment makers increasingly are turning to automation to rein back rising labor costs, even in low-wage countries like Bangladesh, but the LS operation looks to be one of the first to turn to lasers.\nThe Trump administration’s decision on curbs to U.S. steel and aluminum may be imminent. The administration summoned industry executives to a White House meeting today, the WSJ’s Jacob S. Schlesinger reports, in a signal that discussions on protections that could reshape the direction of international trade flows and domestic industrial production were nearing an end. The meeting between the president and the manufacturing executives comes two weeks after the Commerce Department released the results of a study concluded that the imports undermine American national security. U.S. officials blame China for flooding the world with cheap steel and aluminum due to excess capacity in its industries, but the curbs may go beyond Beijing. Mr. Trump has favored imposing broad, across-the-board tariffs hitting countries around the world, with some exemptions.\nThe new U.S. tax law could start reverberating across the lots holding used trucks, jets and railcars. Parts of the tax code rewrite provide new incentives for companies to buy used equipment, the WSJ’s Richard Rubin and Andrew Tangel write, and could heat up the market for industrial equipment as firms try to take advantage of the changes. That’s because the law allows firms to claim an immediate 100% deduction when they buy an asset, including purchases of used equipment already been written off by previous owners. That may trigger a shuffling of assets, as one company’s gently worn asset takes on greater value in another company’s hands, and could help the economic case for sale-leaseback deals. The market for used trucks has been weak and pricing falling for a couple of years. ACT Research reported this week that prices for used Class 8 trucks fell 3% from December to January despite an increase in sales at the end of the year.\nE-COMMERCE Photo: Bloomberg News The manufacturing sector feeding China’s massive export business may be slowing down. An official measure of the country’s factory activity fell last month as plants closed for the Lunar New Year, the WSJ ‘s Grace Zhu and Liyan Qi report, declining to the lowest level in 19 months in a drop that was bigger than analysts had expected . A drop in new export orders pointed to a less optimistic outlook for activity that was a pillar for growth in the ocean shipping trade in the second half of last year, a surge that continued late in the year as consumer spending picked up and retailers rush to restock goods. Bigger fundamentals in trade are shifting, however, including a strengthening of the yuan on global currency markets that is weighing on export growth. The slowdown comes at a fragile time in the maritime business, with container lines set to bring on new capacity as operators set new lineups and spring schedules for shipping alliances.\nHow far can you go in food delivery without logistics? Companies like Grubhub, Just Eat and Delivery Hero are showing strong growth in helping consumers order takeout online, part of the burgeoning world of web-fed delivery operations that is pushing more groceries, meal kits and basic restaurant orders to consumers’ homes. The WSJ’s Stephen Wilmot writes the businesses that serve as ordering platforms face a threat from the increasingly sophisticated operations like Deliveroo and Uber Eats that set up marketplaces for food outlets and also handle the physical delivery. The operations face the notorious problem of how to make money from the capital-intensive, low-margin last mile, and solutions could lead to a more profound disruption in the restaurant industry—so-called cloud kitchens. Such operations come without the cost of prime retail space, and they work exclusively for online orders.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ However you look at it, internally and externally, downward pressure on the Chinese economy now is big. ’\n—Nomura economist Zhao Yang.\nNumber of the Day 8% Projected growth in trans-Pacific container shipping capacity by mid-summer, according to Alphaliner.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. companies drew down inventories at a faster pace and invested less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter .
