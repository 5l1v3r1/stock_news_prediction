Possible US tariff exemptions \nU.S. stock indexes, which had initially tumbled following Gary Cohn's resignation from the Trump administration , pared some losses after the White House hinted that Mexico and Canada could be exempt from planned metals tariffs. \nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Thursday said recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could include \" potential carve-outs ... based on national security.\" The president is expected to sign off on the tariff plan this week, she said. \nWhile that was positive news for Canada and Mexico, trade-related concerns were unlikely to completely evaporate. \n\"[T]he potential for more, rather than less tariffs for China and Europe, remains the key risk,\" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank, in a morning note. \nCohn , Trump's top economic advisor and a free trade advocate, had resigned after the president announced last week that tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent would be implemented on steel and aluminum imports, respectively. \nMarkets also found \"further reprieve after White House trade advisor Peter Navarro indicated he was not a candidate to replace the outgoing Gary Cohn,\" Mizuho Bank economist Zhu Huani wrote in a note. \nThe greenback was steady against a basket of currencies, with the dollar index trading at 89.585 at 2:48 p.m. HK/SINafter touching a two-week low of 89.407 in the last session. \nAgainst the yen , the dollar last traded at 105.96, slipping once more below the 106 level after closing at 106.80 on Wednesday.
