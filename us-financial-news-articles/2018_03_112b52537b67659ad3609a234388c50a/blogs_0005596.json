Icahn joins other activist investors including Starboard Value and Martin Franklin in their bid to reform the company. CNBC previously reported that Starboard and Franklin are teaming up to oust Newell's entire board.\n\"They have really, basically different views on where this company should go,\" Icahn said of Starboard and Franklin. \"There's potential because these brands are another area in the retail business that I think will still survive and, in fact, get even more profitable.\"\nThe New York Post originally reported Icahn's stake in the company, citing multiple sources.\nIcahn noted that he purchased Newell shares for roughly $25 per share, more than 6 percent below their current price of $26.62 per share. The stock is up 3.4 percent Thursday.\nNewell produces a variety of consumer and commercial goods from power tools to child car seats. The industrial conglomerate operates under many brands including Sharpie, Paper Mate, Mr. Coffee and Coleman.\nThis is a developing story.
