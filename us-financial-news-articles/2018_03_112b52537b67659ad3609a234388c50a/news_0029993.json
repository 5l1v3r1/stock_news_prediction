In addition, the Corporation's restricted cash and deposits at December 31, 2017 totalled $7,092,000 compared to $6,948,000 at December 31, 2016.\nAlexco Environmental Group (\"AEG\"), recognized revenues of $10,732,000 in 2017 for a gross profit of $4,000,000 and a gross margin of 37% compared to revenues of $11,361,000 in 2016 for a gross profit of $2,866,000 and a gross margin of 25%.\nOn March 29, 2017 the Corporation announced the release of an independent technical report dated March 29, 2017 with an effective date of January 3, 2017 entitled \"Preliminary Economic Assessment of the Keno Hill Silver District Project, Yukon, Canada\" (the \"PEA\") and announced the Amended SPA with Wheaton (see news release dated March 29, 2017 entitled \"Alexco and Silver Wheaton Amend Silver Purchase Agreement and Alexco Announces Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment for Expanded Silver Production at Keno Hill\").\nOn March 29, 2017 the Corporation announced an updated mineral resource estimate for the Bermingham deposit, expanding the indicated mineral resources from 5.2 million ounces to 17.3 million ounces while inferred mineral resources increased from approximately 0.7 million ounces to 5.5 million ounces of contained silver.\nThe Corporation received an amended Type A Water Use Licence (\"WUL\") from the Yukon Water Board authorizing, subject to certain conditions, the use and discharge of treated water and deposition of dry stacked tailings from the Flame & Moth deposit.\nIn August 2017, the Corporation received an amended Class IV permit allowing the Corporation to commence a 580 meter (\"m\") underground exploration decline into the high grade Bermingham silver deposit. To date the Corporation has completed 430 m of the ramp and decline with completion expected in April of 2018.\nOn November 7, 2017 the Corporation announced comprehensive results from its 2017 surface diamond drilling exploration program, drilling a total of 13,832 m in the immediate vicinity of the Bermingham deposit at a cost of approximately $3,600,000.\nOn May 30, 2017, the Corporation closed a flow-through private placement whereby the Corporation issued 4,205,820 flow-through shares at a price of $2.15 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $9,042,513.\nThe Corporation disposed of investments in marketable securities for proceeds of $2,003,000 and a pre-tax realized gain of $1,204,000.\nHighlight Subsequent to 2017\nSubsequent to year end, the Corporation entered into a definitive credit agreement with Sprott Private Resource Lending (Collector), L.P. to provide a US$15,000,000 credit facility.\nAlexco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Clynt Nauman said, \"2017 was a pivotal year in which we started the transition from explorer – developer to developer – producer. This evolution began in September 2017 at the Bermingham deposit with initiation of a 580 m underground exploration decline which is now approximately 75% complete. Following completion of mining work, two underground drills will be positioned to complete 5,000 meters of infill and extension drilling of the high grade Bermingham silver deposit. Concurrently our mining crews will relocate to Flame & Moth where an additional 965 m of decline ultimately needs to be driven to access the Flame & Moth deposit. Optimization of development and mine plans, new resource calculations and expanded metallurgical testing will be ongoing in anticipation of a prefeasibility study to be complete in Q3, 2018. As we move through Q2 we will be very focused on market conditions, commercial terms and final permitting progress as part of our disciplined progress toward a final production decision.\"\nKeno Hill Exploration and Development\nAlexco's current focus is to re-start mining operations at Keno Hill, subject to several considerations including commodity prices and market conditions. Alexco has the requisite permits and authorizations for future ore production from the Bellekeno, Flame & Moth, Lucky Queen, and Onek deposits, as well as the necessary authorization to drive the Bermingham decline, currently ongoing. In November 2017 a project proposal for environmental assessment was submitted to Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board (\"YESAB\") for future production and processing of ore from the Bermingham deposit. It is anticipated that this application process, including completion of the amendments to Alexco's Quartz Mining Licence (\"QML\") and WUL will be completed by the end of 2018 or early 2019.\nIn December 2017 the Company received an amendment to its WUL from the Yukon Water Board for the development and operation (and eventual closure) of the Flame & Moth deposit.\n2017 Exploration Program\nIn early June, the Corporation commenced a surface diamond drilling exploration program to further explore potentially mineralized structural targets in the immediate vicinity of the Bermingham deposit. In September 2017 the Corporation completed its 2017 exploration program as planned, drilling a total of 13,832 m. Program costs were $3,600,000. Comprehensive drill results were released on November 7, 2017 (see September 7, 2017 press release entitled \"Alexco Completes 2017 Surface Exploration Program, Expands Bermingham Silver Deposit, Advances Underground Development\").\nThe Corporation also commenced an underground exploration program at the high grade Bermingham silver deposit. In August 2017, the Corporation received the required amended Class IV permit allowing the Corporation to commence the 580 m underground exploration decline. As of the date of this MD&A the Corporation has completed 430 m of the ramp and decline with completion expected in April 2018. Subsequent to completion of the Bermingham decline, a 5,000 m underground drill program will be initiated to tighten up spacing to upgrade the existing inferred resources to indicated resources and to upgrade existing indicated resources to measured resource while also increasing the confidence in the geological model. The total estimated cost of the underground exploration development and drilling project is $8,700,000, which includes capital purchases related to underground equipment.\nFinancial\nAlexco's cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 totaled $17.9 M compared to $20.4 M at December 31, 2016, while net working capital totaled $18.4 M compared to $23.4 M for the same dates. With its cash resources and net working capital on hand at December 31, 2017, Alexco anticipates it will have sufficient capital resources to carry out all of its currently-anticipated exploration programs and service the working capital requirements of its exploration activity, environmental services business and corporate offices and administration as planned for the next twelve months.\nSELECTED ANNUAL INFORMATION\nAs at and for the year ended December 31\n(expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts)\n2017\n2016\n2015\nRevenue from environmental services\n10,732\n11,361\n14,662\nGross profit from environmental services\n4,000\n2,866\n3,251\nRevenue from all operations\n10,732\n11,361\n14,662\nGross profit from all operations\n4,000\n2,866\n3,251\nNet loss\n(7,648)\n(4,359)\n(5,509)\nLoss per share:\nBasic\n($0.08)\n($0.05)\n($0.08)\nDiluted\n($0.08)\n($0.05)\n($0.08)\nTotal assets\n123,836\n117,632\n102,542\nTotal long-term liabilities\n19,787\n24,839\n24,496\nDividends declared\nNil\nNil\nNil\nAlexco Environmental Group\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017 AEG recorded revenues of $2.5 M and a gross profit of $993,000 for a gross margin of 40%, compared to revenue of $2.9 M and a gross profit of $881,000 for a gross margin of 30% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
