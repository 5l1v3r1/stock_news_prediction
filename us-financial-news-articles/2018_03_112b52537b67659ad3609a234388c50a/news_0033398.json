Trump said the military sales contributed to the creation of 40,000 American jobs.\nThe talks were part of the first visit by the prince to the United States since he became the heir apparent last June to succeed King Salman. Prince Mohammed has consolidated power and is likely to rule for many decades if he succeeds his father.\nTrump produced charts to show the depth of Saudi purchases of U.S. military hardware, ranging from ships to missile defense to planes and fighting vehicles.\n\"The relationship now is probably as good as it's really ever been and I think will probably only get better. Tremendous investments made in our country and that means jobs for our workers,\" Trump told reporters during a picture-taking session with the crown prince.\nAs they talked, U.S. senators debated a resolution seeking an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's campaign in Yemen's civil war. Some members of Congress have been critical of the Saudi campaign, particularly the humanitarian situation and civilian casualties.\nA Saudi-led coalition is fighting to counter the influence of Iran, an ally of the Houthi militia, who deny any help from Tehran and say they are fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West.\nThe crown prince, in a rare foray into speaking English, said the Saudi pledge for $200 billion in investments will end up at $400 billion when fully implemented. He said a 10-year window for implementing the deal was already underway.\n\"This is a signal that there (are) a lot of things (that) could be tackled in the close future and more opportunities. And thats why we are here today, to be sure that weve tackled all the opportunities and achieve it and also get rid of all the threats facing our both countries,\" he said.\nThe two leaders were also expected to discuss tensions with Iran, Riyadh's regional arch-rival and a country Trump has repeatedly criticized for its expansionist policies in the Middle East.\nThough the prince, 32, has won Western plaudits for seeking to ease Saudi Arabias reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and reform the conservative Sunni Muslim kingdom, the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown last November has unnerved some investors.\nHe is on a public relations blitz while traveling in the United States, with stops in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston.\nTrump and the crown prince underscored the strength of U.S.-Saudi ties which suffered under the Obama administration. Saudi Arabia, a decades-long U.S. ally, felt neglected by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Riyadh's regional rival.
