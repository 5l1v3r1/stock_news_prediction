Munakampe said she had flown out at 0520 GMT on a South African Airways flight.\nThe dancer had been due to perform on Saturday in Lusaka at the launch of a music album organized by a local entertainment company, Sunset Sound Production.\nThe organizers of the show said in a statement earlier this week that Zambia’s National Arts Council had rejected their application.\n“The Council stated that... Zodwa’s performances were not in the public interest and undermined our national values,” the statement said.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Ed Stoddard and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T11:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T11:30:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
