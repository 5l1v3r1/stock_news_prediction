Its live coral cover has plummeted 80 percent since 1980 due to factors such as disease and bleaching.\nHowever, hurricanes rank as the biggest short-term threat, with a category four or five storm capable of wiping out up to 60 percent of live coral cover, said TNC.\nFunding for the policy would come from the government and the tourist industry, said TNC, which devised the plan with insurance firm Swiss Re and the Rockefeller Foundation.\nThe Mesoamerican reef deal is TNC’s latest structure to protect coastal resources.\nLast month TNC, which has nearly $6 billion in assets, according to Forbes, agreed to buy a chunk of the Seychelles’s sovereign debt in return for the Indian Ocean nation agreeing to protect vast swathes of its marine territory.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; Editing by Jared Ferrie and Robert Carmichael.
