The Dow, however, ended lower and remained in negative territory for the year so far.\nEditing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:15:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
