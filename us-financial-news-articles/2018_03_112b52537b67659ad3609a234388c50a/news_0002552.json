A review by competition authorities could take a further six months.\nAurubis in December said it would seek growth by expanding into production of other metals alongside copper. Increasing competition for copper concentrates (ore) from China means Aurubis is focusing on processing complex concentrates that often contain other metals, Schachler said.\n“China is working on expanding its own smelter capacities ... in doing so they want to no longer be dependent on cathodes (new copper) imported from abroad,” Schachler said.\n“For the worldwide smelter industry this means one thing above all: stronger competition for clean copper concentrates.”\nWhen more smelters compete for available concentrates, copper treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) can weaken. TC/RCs are paid by miners to smelters to refine concentrated ore into metal and are a key part of copper industry earnings. World 2018 benchmark TC/RCs agreed in December were down about 11 percent on the year.\nAurubis’ focus on processing complex concentrates will help Aurubis to absorb this 2018 reduction somewhat, because it is “able to obtain higher average” treatment and refining charges, Schachler said.\nThe strong dollar is also having a “positive impact on our business”, as the company generates significant income in dollars but most of its costs are in euros, he said.\nAurubis remains “optimistic” about demand for cathodes this financial year and more improvements should be possible, he said.\nAurubis said in December it plans to double its sales of non-copper metal by 2022/23.\n“We see opportunities and new markets ... for many other metals in addition to copper,” he said.\nFor nickel, a feasibility study is under way about possible construction of a factory for battery-capable nickel sulphate in South Korea in cooperation with Korea’s LS Corp.\nAurubis is no longer marketing the metal tellurium as a simple intermediate product but in the form of metal products for differing industrial uses including the solar industry.\nReporting by Michael Hogan; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:44:17.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
