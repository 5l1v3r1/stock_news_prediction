REUTERS/Toby Melville /File Photo “As with all its shareholders, Barclays will continue to engage with Sherborne, and welcomes them as a shareholder,” Barclays said in a statement after the initial disclosure of the shareholding. Activist investors have become a growing threat for large listed firms as they often use their minority shareholdings to push through major changes in company strategy. Sherborne Investors, which describes itself as a turnaround investment firm on its website, raised 700 million pounds in an initial public offering last year. The firm, led by Edward Bramson, forced British private equity firm Electra ( ELTA.L ) to fire its management team. It was founded in 1986 and is involved in both private and publicly listed investments.
