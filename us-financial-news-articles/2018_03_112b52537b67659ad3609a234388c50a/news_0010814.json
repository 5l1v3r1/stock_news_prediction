But the deal doesn’t really make sense.\nFirst, satellite TV may do better in Europe than in the U.S., but comparisons to DirecTV, which has hemorrhaged subscribers , are difficult to ignore. Sky’s Now TV, an Netflix -like product, is designed to fight back against streaming services, but cord-cutting is still bad news for Sky. Around 2% to 3% of households a year are trading down from Sky’s premium package to Now TV.\nSecond is Sky’s high valuation. Instead of bidding for Sky at 12.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Comcast could buy back shares at just 7.5 times Ebitda—something that would please its shareholders.\nAnother possibility is that Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts is trying to get himself a place at the table, hoping that he can pry away a prize asset or two from Disney . DIS 1.46% Hulu perhaps?\nThe idea has merit. Mr. Roberts has previously expressed interest in other assets that 21st Century Fox FOX 2.41% is selling to Disney. Fox, Disney and Comcast each own 30% of the streaming service. Time Warner owns the remaining 10%, which it bought in August 2016 when the platform was valued at $5.8 billion. After recent hits like “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and the huge rally in Netflix shares, Hulu is almost certainly worth more now.\nMr. Roberts is clearly eager for such a service . He has repeatedly cited Now TV as a reason for his interest in Sky. Yet Hulu is the better platform. A controlling stakeholder—Disney, if the Fox acquisition goes through—could clear up what analysts see as Hulu’s management problems, and take it global.\nDisney CEO Bob Iger has already talked of plans to load Fox’s film studio and FX television shows onto Hulu, making it the company’s adult-focused streaming service. (It plans to launch a separate Disney-branded platform for children.) Though Iger has said the improved platform will “provide Comcast with an interesting opportunity as well,” Mr. Roberts surely isn’t happy about it.\nComcast’s bid for Sky is unlikely to give it the leverage it would need to wrest Hulu from Disney. “Disney isn’t going to give it up,” says Craig Moffett of research firm MoffettNathanson. “If Comcast is trying to play a game of poker here, the risk is Bob Iger calls Comcast’s bluff and says, ‘Fine, take Sky.’”\nDisney may be wise to let Comcast overpay for Sky. Upping its own bid would make the transaction less accretive to Disney, though it could certainly afford to pay more. Comcast, meanwhile, is playing a risky game, and with shareholders’ money no less. Mr. Roberts had better be serious about wanting Sky, because he might just get it.\nThe cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix.
