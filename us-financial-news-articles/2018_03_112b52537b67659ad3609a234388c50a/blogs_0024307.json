At the time, Wall Street was dealing with the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the market was in free fall.\n\"I'm going to step out on a limb here ... I think we're at a bottom. I really do,\" Haines said at the time. When stocks opened after the \"Haines bottom,\" the market began to recover, with the S&P 500 posting a 300 percent gain since then.\nHaines did not normally make those kinds of calls, recalled Cramer, host of CNBC's \" Mad Money .\" \"We've had people come on and [say,] 'This is it, this is it.' And then it wasn't it.\"\nOn Friday, the Labor Department reported the economy added 313,000 jobs in February, crushing expectations and sending the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 270 points Friday morning. The Dow gained 1.46 percent this year, as of Thursday's close, recovering from the early February correction.\nThe wage number in February's jobs report was lower than expected, with average hourly earnings up 2.6 percent on an annualized basis.\n\"Everything about this report was astounding,\" said Cramer.\nCramer said the market had overreacted to the January's wage number, which saw its biggest jump since the end of the Great Recession.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
