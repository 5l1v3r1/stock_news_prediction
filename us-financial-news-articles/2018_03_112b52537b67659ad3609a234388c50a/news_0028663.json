DowDupont eventually decided to break into three: material sciences, speciality products, and agriculture businesses. \nHere’s what there is to know about Fitterling. He has a long history with Dow \nFitterling, now 56, has spent his entire career with Dow. \nHe joined Dow Chemical in 1984 and became Liveris’ lieutenant—the company’s chief operating officer in October 2016. Roughly a year later, the executive took on the same role for DowDupont’s materials science business. \nIn recent years, Fitterling has overseen areas including Dow’s environment, health and safety, sustainability, and research and development divisions. For his role in the company, Fitterling has made millions \nAccording to the most recent data from the Securities and Exchange Commission , Fitterling made about $10.1 million in 2016, nearly half of which came from stock awards. That made him the second- highest earning executive at Dow that year behind CEO Andrew Liveris, who received $23 million. He is taking over the largest of the three DowDupont spinoffs \nDowDupont is expected to spin off into three separate divisions : materials science, specialty products, and agriculture. The splits are expected to begin with the materials science business in early 2019, followed by the other two later that year. \nWith the spinoffs, Fitterling is expected to take over the largest of the three businesses by revenue, in other words, the highest ranking one on the Fortune 500 . \n“Yes, the materials science division (the new Dow) will be the largest of the three,” Jarrod Erpelding, a spokesperson for Dow said in an email. \nIn 2017, that division, which included packaging and infrastructure, represented over 50% of DowDupont’s combined sales on a pro forma basis, or nearly $44 billion. Fitterling would be one of a handful of openly-gay CEOs running a multi-billion dollar company by revenue \nFitterling came out to Dow’s employees in 2014, after spending nearly thirty years keeping the workforce in the dark. \nThe announcement came in the same year that Tim Cook became the first openly-gay Fortune 500 CEO . \nInga Beales, CEO of Lloyd’s of London, is notable for being a bisexual executive helming a company in the Fortune Global 500 . Fitterling has weighed in on President Donald Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs \nWall Street has not taken news of import duties on steel and aluminum lightly. Nor has Fitterling, who says the company has told the Trump administration of its misgivings regarding the proposed taxes. \nRoughly a week earlier, Fitterling warned that such tariffs could lead the company to build new plants in Canada or Argentina instead of the U.S.—a blow to President Trump’s “America First” platform. \n“You eventually get yourself to the point where you are saying, ‘Should I really be building that here or somewhere else?’ ” Fitterling said Tuesday, according to Bloomberg . “We’ve got opportunities in other places like Canada, like Argentina. All of them right now are on the radar screen.” \nWith an increase in steel prices, the cost of building in the U.S. will also grow, the executive noted. DowDupont is expecting yet another $6 billion-worth of U.S. projects in coming months.
