(NYSE:AFI) (“Armstrong Flooring” or the “Company”), North America’s largest producer of resilient and wood flooring products, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nDon Maier, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Improved fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and margin reflect our commitment to targeted productivity and cost control initiatives. For the full year 2017, manufacturing cost and SG&A efficiencies offset more than two-thirds of the combined Adjusted EBITDA impact from legacy portfolio market pressures and higher than expected input costs. While market challenges in resilient sheet and wood are unabating, we continue to make strong progress on our innovation-based growth objectives.”\nMr. Maier continued, “In 2018, we will continue executing our strategic priorities to reinvigorate top line growth and improve our competitive positioning by further pivoting our product portfolio towards growing categories, such as Luxury Vinyl Tile (“LVT”), and driving innovation, including Diamond 10® Technology, across our portfolio. In wood, we continue to improve our cost position and sourcing capabilities while exploring licensing options at entry-level price points. In resilient sheet, our repurposed Stillwater, OK facility has expanded our domestic LVT production, enhanced our capacity efficiency and provided us with technological acumen to repurpose additional facilities across our network. In regards to distributor share of wallet, we are empowering our distribution partners in residential channels while intensifying our focus on national retail and commercial customers, allowing us to improve speed-to-market, cost efficiencies and margins in all channels. These collective initiatives should generate additional cash flow and attractive returns over time. Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook for 2018 and we affirm our 10% EBITDA margin target by 2020, under a range of growth scenarios.”\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Results Compared with Fourth Quarter of 2016 Results\nConsolidated Results\n(Dollars in millions except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet sales $262.7 $271.7 (3.3%) $1,133.7 $1,193.2 (5.0%) Operating (loss) income ($17.2) ($9.2) N/M ($47.0) $18.9 N/M Net (loss) income ($20.7) ($6.3) N/M ($41.8) $9.2 N/M Diluted (loss) earnings per share ($0.80) ($0.23) N/M ($1.54) $0.33 N/M Adjusted EBITDA $5.7 $5.5 4.4% $65.2 $83.1 (21.4%) Adjusted EBITDA margin 2.2% 2.0% 20 bps 5.8% 7.0% (120 bps) Adjusted net (loss) income ($3.2) ($2.5) N/M $5.7 $21.7 (73.5%) Adjusted diluted (loss) earnings per share ($0.12) ($0.09) N/M $0.21 $0.77 (72.5%) In the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales were $262.7 million as compared to $271.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of a decline in net sales in the Wood Flooring segment.\nFourth quarter 2017 net loss was $20.7 million, or a loss per diluted share of $0.80, as compared to a net loss of $6.3 million, or loss per diluted share of $0.23, in the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reduced its deferred tax assets by $12.5 million due to recognition of valuation allowances and the impacts of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted net loss was $3.2 million, or $0.12 adjusted loss per diluted share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $2.5 million, or adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.09, in the prior year quarter.\nFourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million, as compared to $5.5 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase primarily attributable to lower manufacturing costs and SG&A, including lower incentive-based employee compensation, partly offset by the impact of lower Wood Flooring segment net sales and increased raw material input cost inflation.\nResilient Flooring Segment\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet sales $158.2 $158.3 0.0% $700.9 $707.1 (0.9%) Operating (loss) income ($7.0) ($4.8) N/M $9.0 $15.1 (40.7%) Adjusted EBITDA $5.8 $5.3 9.2% $58.4 $55.8 4.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin 3.6% 3.3% 30bps 8.3% 7.9% 40 bps Net sales were $158.2 million as compared to $158.3 million in the prior year period. The slight decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volume in vinyl sheet and laminate products, combined with modest price pressure across most categories. This was mostly offset by higher sales of LVT, which continued to achieve double-digit growth, and VCT, helped by the recent acquisition of the VCT assets of Mannington Mills.\nOperating loss was $7.0 million in the quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 million as compared to $5.3 million in the prior year quarter, driven by improved manufacturing and SG&A costs, which more than offset higher input costs. During 2017, the Company started the process of migrating a portion of its laminate business to a licensing model in place of the current sourcing model, which is expected to generate more attractive EBITDA margins on lower reported sales for that category.\nWood Flooring Segment\nThree Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nNet sales $104.5 $113.4 (7.9%) $432.8 $486.1 (11.0%) Operating (loss) income ($10.2) ($4.4) N/M ($56.0) $3.8 N/M Adjusted EBITDA ($0.1) $0.2 N/M $6.8 $27.3 (75.1%) Adjusted EBITDA margin (0.1%) 0.2% N/M 1.6% 5.6% (400 bps) Net sales were $104.5 million as compared to $113.4 million in the prior year quarter, with the decline driven by lower volumes in both solid and engineered wood. As expected, volume was most impacted in the strategic retail customer channel, which is expected to continue through the first half of 2018. Favorable mix provided a partial offset and price was stable.\nOperating loss was $10.2 million, compared to an operating loss of $4.4 million in the prior year quarter, largely due to the $4.1 million charge in the fourth quarter 2017 in connection with the previously announced closing of two manufacturing facilities. Adjusted EBITDA was ($0.1) million as compared to $0.2 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to the impact of lower net sales and higher input costs, which were mostly offset by lower manufacturing costs and SG&A.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at an aggregate value of $40.0 million under its share repurchase program authorized in March 2017.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The adjusted EBITDA outlook assumes sales growth in the low single-digits, weighted towards the second half of full year 2018. In connection with the strengthened distributor partnerships announced in February 2018 as well as a reduction in corporate overhead, the Company expects to incur one-time charges primarily related to severance of $3 million to $4 million in the first quarter of 2018, which is expected to achieve $10 to $12 million of annualized savings over the next twelve months. The Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million for the full year 2018 while delivering another year of free cash flow in line with recent years.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a live webcast and conference call to review fourth quarter and full year results on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. ET.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The Company uses these adjusted performance measures in managing the business, including in communications with its Board of Directors and employees, and believes that they can provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons of operating performance between current and prior periods. In addition, the Company has applied pro forma adjustments to the non-GAAP results for periods prior to the Company’s separation from its former parent. For periods ending prior to April 1, 2016, the pro forma adjustments represent estimated incremental expenses that would have been incurred had the separation occurred on January 1, 2015 with equivalent outstanding borrowings; for the first quarter of 2016, the pro forma adjustment removes expenses allocated to the Company by its former parent that are not indicative of the estimated expenses the Company would incur post-separation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate to enhance understanding of its past performance, as well as its prospects for future performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in this release and on the Company’s website. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company does not provide financial guidance for forecasted net income since certain items that impact net income are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n(Dollars in millions except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Total\nResilient\nWood\nTotal\nResilient\nWood\nNet (loss) ($ 20.7) ($ 6.3) Interest Expense 0.8 0.2 Other Expense 0.1 3.7 Taxes 2.6 (6.8) Operating (Loss) (17.2) (7.0) (10.2) (9.2) (4.8) (4.4) Depreciation and amortization 18.8 11.1 7.7 12.4 8.2 4.2 Expense related to plant closures, cost reductions,\nacquisition, and multilayered wood flooring duties\n2.0 2.0 0.1 -- 0.1 U.S. pension expense 2.1 1.8 0.4 2.2 1.8 0.4 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5.7 $ 5.8 ($ 0.1) $5.5 $ 5.3 $0.2 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Total\nResilient\nWood\nTotal\nResilient\nWood\nNet (loss) Income ($ 41.8) $ 9.2 Interest Expense 2.8 1.5 Other Expense 0.2 5.8 Net gain from discontinued operations -- (1.7) Taxes (8.2) 4.1 Operating Income (Loss) (47.0) 9.0 (56.0) 18.9 15.1 3.8 Depreciation and amortization 78.7 38.7 40.0 46.6 32.5 14.1 Intangible asset impairment 12.5 -- 12.5 -- -- -- Expense related to plant closures, cost reductions,\nacquisition, and multilayered wood flooring duties\n12.1 3.3 8.8 8.4 0.8 7.5 U.S. pension expense 8.9 7.4 1.5 8.7 7.3 1.4 Adjustment for corporate expense -- -- -- 0.5 -- 0.5 Adjusted EBITDA $ 65.2 $ 58.4 $ 6.8 $83.1 $ 55.8 $27.3 Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ million\nPer diluted share\n$ million\nPer diluted share\nNet (loss) ($20.7) ($0.80) ($6.3) ($0.23) Expenses related to plant closures (including\naccelerated depreciation), cost reductions, acquisition,\nand multilayered wood flooring duties\n6.1 0.1 U.S. pension expense 2.1 2.2 Other Expense 0.1 3.7 Tax impact of adjustments at statutory rate (3.1) (2.2) Impact on deferred tax assets of valuation allowance\nand US tax reform\n12.5 -- Adjusted Net Loss ($3.2) ($0.12) ($2.5) ($0.09) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 $ million\nPer diluted share\n$ million\nPer diluted share\nNet (loss) Income ($41.8) ($1.54) $9.2 $0.33 Expenses related to plant closures (including\naccelerated depreciation), cost reductions, acquisition,\nand multilayered wood flooring duties\n34.9 8.4 Intangible asset impairment 12.5 -- U.S. pension expense 8.9 8.7 Adjustment for corporate expense -- 0.5 Pro forma adjustment for interest expense -- (0.4) Other Expense 0.2 5.8 Tax impact of adjustments at statutory rate (21.5) (8.7) Net gain from discontinued operations -- (1.7) Impact on deferred tax assets of valuation allowance\nand US tax reform\n12.5 -- Adjusted Net Income $5.7 $0.21 $21.7 $0.77 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $62.9 Purchases of property, plant, and equipment (44.8) Sale of assets 0.4 Free cash flow $18.5 Columns may not foot due to rounding.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005275/en/\nArmstrong Flooring, Inc.\nInvestors:\nDouglas Bingham, 717-672-9300\nVP, Treasury and Investor Relations\nIR@armstrongflooring.com\nor\nMedia:\nSteve Trapnell, 717-672-7218\nCorporate Communications Manager\naficorporatecommunications@armstrongflooring.com\nSource: Armstrong Flooring, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armstrongflooring.com&esheet=51768295&newsitemid=20180306005275&lan=en-US&anchor=www.armstrongflooring.com&index=2&md5=eb86063851857e53e84d79c3bfb39262", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005275/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.armstrongflooring.com&esheet=51768295&newsitemid=20180306005275&lan=en-US&anchor=www.armstrongflooring.com&index=1&md5=0ac1e23495ef8c25c9237d426cb60152"], "published": "2018-03-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T15:51:01.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
