MBIA ( MBI.N ), the parent company of National Public Finance Guarantee Corp, was up 4.4 percent on Monday, while shares of AMBAC Financial Group ( AMBC.O ) gained 6.56 percent.\nThe fiscal turnaround plan will serve as a basis for creditor restructuring talks in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy, which, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt, was already the largest in U.S. government history before Maria trashed the island’s infrastructure and killed dozens.\nThe plan needs approval by a federal board tasked with managing the island’s finances. The board was expected to approve the February version of the plan at a meeting on Monday, but postponed the meeting after Friday’s revision.\nObservers cast a skeptical eye on the rosier projections, unsure the board would go along with them. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello and the board have butted heads for months over what the plan should include.\nThe new plan creates $3 billion more in cost savings than the February version, including an extra $1.34 billion in tax measures like changing minimum tax rates and reducing incentives.\n“While these headlines appear positive, we continue to think there will be a lot of noise before there is any significant resolution in Puerto Rico,” analysts at KBW Research said in a Monday note.\nChris Ryon, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, which does not own Puerto Rican bonds, said he was scratching his head over the spike.\n“I guess hope springs eternal,” Ryon said. “I don’t see the numbers working out in that way, that favorably. You have been losing population, saying the recovery is going to really juice their economy. I don’t see that happening.”\nSuch reservations underscore an ongoing credibility gap for Puerto Rico in the eyes of creditors and lawmakers, spanning multiple gubernatorial administrations.\nThe island has not published audited financial statements in three fiscal years, and absorbed routine accusations from stakeholders and legislators that it is overstating its crisis.\nReporting by Nick Brown; Additional reporting by Daniel Bases; Editing by Daniel Bases and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T04:12:55.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
