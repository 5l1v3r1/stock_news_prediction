Based in New York City and founded in 2006, Mesmerize is an established leader in patient education at the point-of-care and the largest provider of static media in high prescribing physicians' offices. Gregory Leibert, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mesmerize, and Craig Mait, Chief Operating Officer, will join Brite Media in leadership roles and will continue to operate the Mesmerize business along with their existing team.\nBrite Media's Chief Executive Officer Joe Puglise notes, \"We are thrilled to gain access to the point-of-care space with a partner who has the expertise, tenure, and reputation of Mesmerize. The efficacy to advertisers, proven ROI, and explosive growth in the channel drew our attention to Mesmerize. We look forward to helping Mesmerize lever their impressive growth in the years to come.\"\nMesmerize provides targeted educational materials including wallboards, literature distribution, branded medical essentials, and mobile integration to patients and care givers in waiting rooms, exam rooms, and other high traffic areas of doctors' offices, dental offices, community-based organizations, AIDS service organizations, and independent pharmacies. The company's network reaches over 60,000 physicians and 7,500 pharmacies nationwide. Mesmerize's editorial content in English, Spanish and Chinese speaks directly to patients across multiple demographics within specialty practices including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, oncology, women's health, pediatrics, mental health, cardiology, and infectious disease.\n\"The partnership with Brite Media gives Mesmerize Marketing the resources necessary to scale our rapidly growing point-of-care networks,\" said Gregory Leibert. \"Mesmerize will look to expand our patient education and deliver significant results to our customers, by supplementing our industry-leading static media presence with new static and digital media platforms.

Point-of-care media educates patients in an environment where they are empowered to communicate with their care providers about disease specific conditions.\n\"We believe in the power of point-of-care media,\" said Michael Ellis, Brite Media's President and Chief Operating Officer. \"Mesmerize will perfectly complement Brite's current media platforms. The combined companies will leverage the strengths, creativity, and human capital of both businesses to continue delivering outstanding results to our customers.\"\nThe Beekman Group (\"Beekman\"), a leading private equity firm based in New York, acquired Brite Media in 2014 with the goal of building an out-of-home media platform with a diversified product offering.
