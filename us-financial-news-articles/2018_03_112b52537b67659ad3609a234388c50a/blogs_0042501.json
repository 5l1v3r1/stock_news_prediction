Airbus has agreed to take a majority stake in the CSeries in a deal expected to close later this year, while Boeing is in tie-up talks with Bombardier's Brazilian rival Embraer .\nThe Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal.\nIt was not yet clear how Boeing's decision will impact the planemaker's relationship with the Canadian government, which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between C$15 billion and $C19 billion.\nA Bombardier spokesman was not immediately available to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T19:46:51.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
