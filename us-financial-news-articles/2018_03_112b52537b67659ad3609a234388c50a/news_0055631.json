His father, a lawyer, moved the family to London and then New York. Young Francis was dispatched to the Groton School in Massachusetts, where he mingled with the sons of the American elite, before enrolling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBy age 40 he was a respected economist and adviser to President Lyndon Johnson, dealing with international economic policy and relations with Europe. State Department grandees tended to see these White House advisers as rivals. Mr. Bator enjoyed telling friends that Secretary of State Dean Rusk had derided him as “the ambassador from Ulan Bator.”\nDuring his 3 ½ years in the Johnson administration, the erudite European felt at ease with the earthy Texas politician. Prof. Bator said in an oral history that he met with the president “sometimes several times a week, sometimes not at all for two, three weeks.”\nAfter leaving the administration in 1967, he became the founding chairman of the public-policy program at what became Harvard University’s Kennedy School.\nProf. Bator was struck by a car in January while crossing a street in Newton, Mass., and died March 15. He was 92.\n\n\nProf. Bator’s economic writing included explorations of “market failures,” in which market forces fail to lead to optimal results. A not-so-simple 1957 article, “The Simple Analytics of Welfare Maximization,” was used as a framework for teaching microeconomics. The New York Times once listed his 1960 book, “The Question of Government Spending: Public Needs and Private Wants,” as one of seven books that influenced President John F. Kennedy’s approach to the presidency.\nMore \nAdvertising Mogul Dailey Made TV Spots for Reagan March 30, 2018 Peter Munk, Freewheeling Founder of Barrick Gold, Dies in Toronto at 90 March 28, 2018 Former Georgia Gov. Miller Dies at 86 March 23, 2018 Wayne Huizenga, Entrepreneur Behind Blockbuster and AutoNation, Dies at 80 March 23, 2018 As an adviser to President Johnson, he dealt with issues including international-trade negotiations, restrictions on convertibility of the dollar into gold and French withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s integrated military command. Prof. Bator counseled against overreacting to efforts by French President Charles de Gaulle to assert independence in military affairs.\nLong after serving in the White House, he remained loyal to President Johnson and disputed suggestions that the former president was a hick with little grasp of international affairs.\nIn a 2008 article, “No Good Choices: LBJ and the Vietnam/Great Society Connection,” Prof. Bator wrote that President Johnson “respected brains and regretted that he didn’t have a highbrow education, but he knew perfectly well that he was as smart as anyone around—not just shrewd, but analytically smart.”\nMr. Johnson “knowingly bet his presidency on an unexamined strategy in an unexplained war,” Prof. Bator wrote. The president knew his policy of sending more U.S. troops to Vietnam was a huge risk, Prof. Bator added, but believed that if he was seen as soft on communism he would lose the political power needed to get his Great Society social programs through Congress.\nFrancis Michel Bator was born Aug. 10, 1925, in Budapest, where the family occupied a modernist home on a hill in the Buda section. The family name was pronounced BAH-tor in Hungary but later Americanized to BAT-or.\nAt Groton, he played ice hockey, sang in the choir and did well enough academically to qualify for MIT, where he earned a doctorate in economics. One of his professors there was Robert Solow, later a Nobel laureate in economics. At a 2013 tribute dinner for Prof. Bator, Dr. Solow recalled the “fierce intensity” of his former student: “When he grabbed something he didn’t let it go until he had wrung it dry.”\nHis education was interrupted by service in the Army during World War II. He was on a ship in the Pacific when the Japanese surrendered.\nHis experience as an economic adviser during the Kennedy administration and as a White House aide under President Johnson informed his teaching at Harvard, where he spent most of his career. One of his former students, Mark Kleiman, now a professor at the NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management, said Prof. Bator had a deep understanding of the interplay between government officials and agencies with differing agendas and of the risks of unintended consequences of policy choices.\nThough he thrived in the U.S., Prof. Bator remained an Anglophile and never completely shed his Old World habits. Taken to see the Boston Celtics play basketball in the 1960s, he spent most of the game reading the Economist.\nProf. Bator’s survivors include two children, four grandchildren and his longtime companion Jae Roosevelt. He married Micheline Martin in 1949; they separated in the early 1970s, and she lives in Westwood, Mass.\nAt the dinner honoring Prof. Bator in 2013, Dr. Solow said: “What stands out about Francis is that he never gave in. He never gave in to foolish fashions in macroeconomics, and he never gave in to the nonsense that passes for wisdom or punditry in our time. He stuck to what he had learned and thought out for himself…. He was not merely stubborn; he was right.” \nWrite to James R.
