Most recently, White held senior executive positions at SolarWinds, Syncplicity and Addepar. Her leadership resulted in successful outcomes across all three companies—SolarWinds held its IPO in May 2009 at a valuation of nearly $1 billion, Syncplicity was successfully acquired by EMC in 2012, and as President and COO of Addepar, White significantly scaled the customer and partner base for the company's investment management platform, which now supports $800 billion in total assets and serves some of the world's most important global financial services firms.\nPaul Zwillenberg, CEO of RMS parent company DMGT, said: \"This is the perfect time to appoint Karen White, a highly-respected and seasoned Silicon Valley executive, as the Chief Executive Officer of RMS.
