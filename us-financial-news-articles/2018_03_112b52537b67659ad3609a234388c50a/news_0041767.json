A logo of the German luxury carmaker BMW is seen during the company's annual news conference in Munich, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Dalder “We wanted to wait for the fifth generation to be much more cost competitive,” Krueger said speaking to analysts in Munich on Thursday. “We do not want to scale up with the fourth generation,” Krueger explained. The cost advantage between BMW’s fourth and fifth generation electric vehicle technology amounts to a “two digit number,” Krueger said. “If you want to win the race, you must be the most cost competitive in the segment, otherwise you cannot scale up the volume,” Krueger said.
