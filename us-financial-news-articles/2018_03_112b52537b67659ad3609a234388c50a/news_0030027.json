Jackson, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the United Kingdom’s Prudential plc (NYSE: PUK), recorded sales and deposits of $21.4 billion in 2017. The results mark another highly successful year for the company, despite recent challenges faced throughout the industry.\nBarry Stowe, chairman and chief executive officer of the North American Business Unit of Prudential plc 4 , said the results were primarily driven by industry-leading positive net flows and the growth of separate account assets under management, which totaled a record $176.6 billion in 2017.\n“As the American retirement wave picks up steam, the need for the products and education that Jackson provides has never been greater,” Stowe said. “We will continue to embrace our leadership position in the industry, particularly as we establish the footprint to change the narrative in the retirement marketplace. We are working harder than ever to ensure consumers understand the value of annuities that offer a lifetime income stream, as these products can serve as a foundational part of a comprehensive financial plan.”\nJackson continues to maintain its financial strength and capital position. The company increased total IFRS assets to $264.4 billion at the end of 2017, up 12 percent from year-end 2016. Jackson also reported regulatory adjusted capital of $4.3 billion, more than eight times the minimum regulatory requirement (as of December 31, 2017), while remitting a $600 million dividend to its parent company.\n1 Financial results from Jackson National Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries have been included in Jackson’s financial results. Fixed index annuities, life insurance and institutional products are not sold in New York.\n2 International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a principles-based set of international accounting standards indicating how transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements. IFRS is issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in an effort to increase global comparability of financial statements and results. Jackson’s parent, Prudential plc (Group), uses IFRS to report the Group’s financial results.\nIFRS pre-tax operating income is based on longer-term investment returns. It excludes short-term fluctuations in investment returns, hedge results and change in value of derivatives. A reconciliation to both IFRS net income as well as net income based on US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) is as follows (amounts in millions):\n$ 2,852.0 IFRS basis pre-tax income from operations (1,967.7 ) Net hedge results and change in value of derivatives, net of DAC amortization (28.6 ) Net realized investment losses, net of DAC amortization (110.0 ) Normalization of longer-term investment returns, net of DAC amortization (461.0 ) Income tax expense 284.7 IFRS net income 118.1 IFRS to US GAAP adjustments, net of tax $ 402.8 US GAAP basis net income attributable to Jackson Jackson's net income was impacted by hedging losses incurred due to the equity market, which were not fully offset by the release of accounting reserves. IFRS accounting for variable annuity liabilities is not necessarily consistent with the economic value of these liabilities. Jackson continues to manage its hedge program on an economic basis and is willing to accept the accounting volatility that results.\n3 Jackson also has $250.0 billion of IFRS policy liabilities set aside to pay future policyowner benefits (as of December 31, 2017).\n4 The North American Business Unit of Prudential plc includes Jackson, its subsidiaries Jackson National Life Distributors LLC (JNLD) and Jackson National Asset Management, LLC ® (JNAM) and its U.S. affiliates PPM America, Inc. (PPMA) and National Planning Holdings ® , Inc. (NPH). On August 15, 2017, NPH announced the sale of the business of the four firms in its broker-dealer network to LPL Financial LLC (LPL).\nAbout Jackson National Life Insurance Company\nJackson is a leading provider of retirement products for industry professionals and their clients.
