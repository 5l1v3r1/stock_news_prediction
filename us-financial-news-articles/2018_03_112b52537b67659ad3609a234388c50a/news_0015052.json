(NASDAQ:CNCE) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as provided an update on its product pipeline and corporate activities.\n“Our focus for Concert in 2018 centers around pipeline advancement, notably CTP-543 for moderate-to-severe alopecia areata, and our newly announced development candidate, CTP-692, for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia. These differentiated product candidates were created with our deuterium platform to address important unmet patient needs,” said Roger Tung, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Concert Pharmaceuticals. “We believe that we have numerous ways to further grow our pipeline and we will be exploring additional opportunities to do so throughout 2018.”\nDr. Tung added, “The achievements we realized in 2017, including the CTP-656, now VX-561, asset purchase agreement with Vertex and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision upholding the validity of our CTP-543 patent, position us well to capitalize on our product candidate opportunities and continue to validate our deuterium approach.”\nRecent Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nEnrollment in Second Cohort of CTP-543 Phase 2a Trial Initiated. In February 2018, the Company initiated enrollment of the second cohort of its Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating CTP-543. Concert is developing CTP-543 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks hair follicles resulting in patchy or complete hair loss. The Company expects to report topline data from the 4 mg and 8 mg cohorts of the Phase 2a trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. CTP-543 Granted Fast Track Designation. In January 2018, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for CTP-543. Fast Track designation is reserved for therapies for serious medical conditions which offer the potential to significantly advance the existing standard of care, and is designed to facilitate their development and expedite the review process. CTP-543 Patent Proceedings. In October 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) denied Incyte’s petition to institute inter partes review (IPR) of Concert’s U.S. Patent No. 9,249,149. The denial of Incyte’s IPR petition upholds the validity of Concert’s composition of matter patent claims covering CTP-543. In January 2018, the PTAB denied Concert’s petition to institute Post Grant Review (PGR) of U.S. Patent No. 9,662,335 assigned to Incyte. The January PTAB decision does not prohibit Concert from developing CTP-543 for alopecia areata and the development timelines for CTP-543 remain on track. CTP-692 Selected as New Development Candidate. Concert selected CTP-692, a novel drug candidate for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia, as its next development candidate. CTP-692 is a deuterated form of d-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Based on the clinically demonstrated effects of d-serine and our initial preclinical assessment of CTP-692, the Company believes that CTP-692 has the potential to help restore NMDA receptor activity in key areas of the brain to improve clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia. The Company intends to conduct preclinical evaluation and advance CTP-692 into clinical development by year-end 2018. Marc Becker Named Chief Financial Officer. Effective January 4, 2018, Marc Becker joined Concert as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Becker is a seasoned financial executive with more than 15 years of experience in the biotechnology industry. Prior to joining Concert, he was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at CRISPR Therapeutics. NASDAQ Biotechnology Index. In December 2017, Concert was selected for addition to the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is designed to track the performance of a set of NASDAQ-listed securities that are classified as either biotechnology or pharmaceutical according to the Industry Classification Benchmark.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash and Investments Position.

Revenue was $143.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $174,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue relates to the asset purchase agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals whereby Vertex acquired worldwide development and commercialization rights to CTP-656 and other assets related to the treatment of cystic fibrosis for $160 million. R&D Expenses. Research and development expenses were $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $6.8 million. The decrease was primarily due to the discontinuation of CTP-656 as a result of the asset purchase agreement with Vertex. G&A Expenses.
