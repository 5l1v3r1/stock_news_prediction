(NYSE American: NHS) (the \"Fund\") has announced a decrease in its monthly distribution rate and declared its next monthly distribution at the new rate. The Fund's next monthly distribution is payable on April 30, 2018, with a record date of April 16, 2018 and an ex-date of April 13, 2018.\nNHS decreased its monthly distribution rate to $0.0658 per share of common stock from the prior monthly distribution rate of $0.0725 per share. NHS's annual distribution per share of common stock is now $0.7896 versus the prior annual amount of $0.87. The new distribution rate represents an annualized distribution rate of approximately 6.21% per share of common stock based on the Fund's net asset value of $12.71 per share on March 28, 2018.\nThe Fund's decrease in distribution rate is the result of numerous factors, including the decline in the absolute level of yields available in the high yield market, the degree of credit spread tightening that has occurred in the high yield market, the increase in the Fund's cost of leverage and the resultant overall reduction in the level of income generated by the Fund relative to its current distribution amount.\nIn an effort to maintain a stable distribution amount, the distribution declared, as well as future distributions, may consist of net investment income, realized capital gains and return of capital. In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. This notice would be for informational purposes, and would disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distributions, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gain and return of capital.\nAbout Neuberger Berman\nNeuberger Berman, founded in 1939, is a private, independent, employee-owned investment manager.
