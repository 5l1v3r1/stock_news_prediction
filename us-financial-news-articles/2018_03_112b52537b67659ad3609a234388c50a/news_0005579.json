For graduate degree holders, the lifetime earnings differential between men and women is more than $1.6 million.\"\nThe pay gap grows with graduate school and varies by major. It's largest for social science majors: $1.8 million for those with graduate degrees and $1.1 million for those with bachelor's degrees.\nGeorgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, Women Can't Win: Despite Making Educational Gains and Pursuing High-Wage Majors, Women Still Earn Less than Men, 2018. \nHere are 10 majors where the lifetime gender wage gap for graduate degree holders is $1 million or more.
