The neighbours are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce. \nChina commended the two sides for their efforts to improve ties. \n“We hope the momentum of dialogue can continue and that the peaceful situation also can last,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a briefing. ‘RESOLVE PROBLEMS’ \nKim is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump some time in May to discuss denuclearisation, although a time and place have not been set for that summit. \nKim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a surprise visit to Beijing this week, his first trip outside the isolated North since he came to power in 2011. \nEven more surprising was Kim’s pledge to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. That commitment was reported by Chinese state media, although North Korea’s official media made no mention of it, or Kim’s anticipated meeting with Trump. \nA senior Chinese official visiting Seoul on Thursday to brief South Korea on Kim’s visit to Beijing, said it should help ease tension and lead to the denuclearisation of the peninsula. \n“We believe his visit will help the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, ensure peace and security of the Korean peninsula and resolve problems regarding the peninsula through political negotiations and discussions,” Yang Jiechi said in opening remarks during a meeting with South Korea’s National Security Office head, Chung Eui-yong. \nYang, a top Chinese diplomat, is scheduled to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday. \nSouth Korean Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon told reporters Kim’s visit to China was not discussed with North Korean officials in their Thursday talks. \nTrump and Kim had exchanged insults and veiled threats of war in recent months but the U.S. leader made the surprising announcement this month that he was prepared to meet Kim to discuss the crisis over the North’s development of weapons. \nThe North Korean leader’s engagement with the international community has sparked speculation that he may try to meet other leaders. Japan’s Asahi newspaper said Japan had sounded out the North Korean government about a summit. \nJapan’s Foreign Minister Taro Kono left open the possibility that Shinzo Abe might meet Kim at some point. Kono said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that Japan was closely watching preparations for the North-South Korean summit and the Trump-Kim meeting. \nChinese President Xi Jinping promised Beijing would uphold its friendship with North Korea after his meeting with Kim. \nTrump wrote on Twitter he had received a message from Xi late on Tuesday that his meeting with Kim “went very well” and that Kim looked forward to meeting the U.S. president.
