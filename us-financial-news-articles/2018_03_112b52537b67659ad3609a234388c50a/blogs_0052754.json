You may want to consider these five fastest-growing international destinations for American tourists. \nIsrael is gaining the most traction with U.S. travelers who purchased travel insurance through comparison website Squaremouth , according to the St. Petersburg, Florida-based company. \nThe firm's rankings are based on data Squaremouth collects when customers input their destination and trip costs into the site to compare policies. \nThe cost of visiting some of these fastest-growing destinations is also surging. Travelling to Iceland cost 20 percent more for visitors seeking travel insurance between March 2017 and March 2018 than the 2016-2017 period. \nVisitors to Norway spent almost double that of tourists going to other popular destinations, with expenses increasing more than 12 percent in the last year. The average spent by U.S. visitors to the top five destinations was about $4,075. Here's a look at the top five global hot spots: 1. Israel \nAverage trip cost: $3,318 \nYear-over-year cost increase: 5.6% \nMore tourists than ever visited Israel in 2017, according to the country's tourism ministry , drawn to its famous holy sites and beautiful beaches along the Mediterranean Sea. The most visited spots include Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Dead Sea, Tiberias and the Sea of Galilee area. Ahikam Seri | Bloomberg | Getty Images 2. Iceland \nAverage trip cost: $3,938 \nY-O-Y cost increase: 19.55% \nMore tourists have been flocking to Iceland for its dramatic and diverse landscape, peppered with volcanoes, glaciers and hot springs — not to mention the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights. Hollywood has also given the Nordic country a boost. Films like \"Interstellar\" and \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" and hit television show \"Game of Thrones\" were filmed in the country.
