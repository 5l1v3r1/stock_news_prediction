Distributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The amount of distributable income for each quarter depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Company during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Company’s fiscal year. The specific tax characteristics of distributions paid during calendar 2018 will be reported to each stockholder on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year.\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has the discretion to change the amount of the distribution in any given quarter based on the Company’s estimate, as of that quarter, of its taxable income for the year. The Company’s estimate of its taxable income for 2018, and therefore the amount of each quarterly distribution in 2018, may change depending on a variety of factors, including the performance of the Company’s portfolio investments.\nThe Company has an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan, or “DRIP,” for its stockholders. Consequently, when the Company declares a distribution, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP automatically have their distribution reinvested in shares of the Company’s stock, rather than receiving it in cash. A stockholder who has elected to receive distributions in cash may re-enroll in the DRIP at any time by notifying the plan administrator.\nAbout OHA Investment Corporation\nOHA Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:OHAI) is a specialty finance company designed to provide its investors with current income and capital appreciation.
