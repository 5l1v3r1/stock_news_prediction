Posco is the largest steel producer in South Korea.\nFor Hyundai Steel , another large Korean steel manufacturer, the U.S. represents around 5 percent of total sales volume.\n\"A more visible impact will likely be centered around companies such as Seah Steel , Husteel and Nexteel, which have much higher U.S. exposures,\" the analysts wrote.\nJapan is also expected to see limited direct impact, given how just 1.8 percent of its crude steel production and 1.5 percent of steel product output last year were exported to the U.S., according to Nomura.\nThose views were similar to what was expressed by ratings agency Moody's in a note last week, when it noted that the direct impact of tariffs would be moderate on Korean steelmakers , to low on other Asian countries.\nSouth Korea and Japan are the third and seventh largest sources of U.S. steel imports , according to a 2017 U.S. Department of Commerce report â€” they are also the two largest sources of U.S. steel imports from Asia.\nNomura's research, which considers steel imports from the European Union collectively, ranks South Korea and Japan as the overall fourth and eighth largest sources of U.S. steel imports, respectively.\nSteel producers in the region traded higher on Monday, recovering from losses recorded in the last session. The Topix Iron & Steel index rose 1.54 percent by midday trade, with Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal up 2.3 percent and JFE Holdings higher by 0.53 percent.\nElsewhere, South Korea's Posco and Hyundai Steel were up 2.9 percent and 1.96 percent, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T06:11:43.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
