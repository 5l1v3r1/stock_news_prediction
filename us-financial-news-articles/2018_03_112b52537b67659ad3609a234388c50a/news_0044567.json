The company has now lost more than $100 billion in market value in the last 10 days, when news reports first surfaced about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook user data in Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe company also faces rising discontent from advertisers and users. U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys on Monday suspended all advertising on Facebook, joining internet company Mozilla Corp which made a similar move last week.\nOpinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook as the firm ran advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers apologizing to users.\nFewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germanys largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.\n(Writing by Bill Rigby Editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T00:16:37.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
