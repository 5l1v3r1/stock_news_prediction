The index has lost around 3.4 percent since Monday and was set for its worst week since early February when a spike in volatility had sent markets into a tailspin.\n“The equity markets are getting clobbered, which is not that surprising with fears of a trade war breaking out,” said Paul Fage, a TD Securities emerging markets strategist.\nOn Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index and the Dow were buoyed by gains in Nike, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq was weighed by losses in chip stocks led by Micron Technology.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 67.35 points, or 0.28 percent, to 24,025.24, the S&P 500 gained 2.12 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,645.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.13 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,155.55.\nEuropean stocks fell, with Germany’s Dax down 1.4 percent, the French CAC 40 1.3 percent lower and Britain’s FTSE 100 0.4 percent in the red.\nThat followed large declines in Asia, where the Nikkei tumbled 4.5 percent and the Hang Seng index lost 2.4 percent.\nChina urged the United States to “pull back from the brink,” but investors fear Trump’s tariffs are leading the world’s two largest economies into a trade war with potentially dire consequences for the global economy.\nChina disclosed its own plans on Friday to impose tariffs on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation against U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum products.\nSAFETY Amid the uncertain world economic climate, investors seeking safer assets jumped into government bond markets in Europe and the United States.\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which fell almost 8 basis points on Thursday, rose on Friday but were still set for their biggest two-week fall since November.\nIn Europe, benchmark issuer Germany’s 10-year bond yields hovered close to 10-week lows struck a day earlier at around 0.52 percent. While German bond yields recovered in European trading, they were still on track for their biggest two-week drop since November.\nMany investors also turned to the Japanese yen, a currency likely to benefit from a full-fledged trade war.\nThe currency gained as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar to 104.635 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016. Investors later booked profits to leave the yen up 0.1 percent at 105.19 yen per dollar.\nThe Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it fell against the euro.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against other major currencies, fell 0.36 percent.\nU.S. crude rose 1.62 percent to $65.34 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.44, up 1.55 percent on the day.
