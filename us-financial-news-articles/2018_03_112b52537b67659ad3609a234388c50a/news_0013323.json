Intrinsyc achieved year over year revenue growth of 58% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, with Adjusted EBITDA of US$602,619 (CDN$766,107), net income of US$484,797 (CDN$611,772), and earnings per share of US$0.02 (CDN$0.02).\nThe strong revenue growth was a result of increased shipments of embedded computing hardware to new and existing clients, as well as improvement in revenue from engineering services. Revenue was US$6.8 million (CDN$8.7 million) which was an increase from US$4.3 million (CDN$5.7 million) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nFiscal 2017 revenue was US$20.7 million (CDN$ $26.8 million), which was an increase of 18% over the prior year. Annual revenue growth was a result of very strong growth from hardware sales, partially offset by a decline in software and services revenue. Since services revenue is generally at higher margins than hardware revenue this change in revenue mix impacted overall gross margin and earnings. The decline in services revenue was primarily as a result of the reduced revenue from a single major client as they delayed their product development. Net income for Fiscal 2017 was US$642,337 (CDN$808,382), with earnings per share of US$0.03 (CDN$0.03).\n“Our strong performance in the quarter is confirmation of the Company’s successful strategic execution and transition from a non-recurring engineering services business model, to providing integrated solutions with a repeat revenue model,” stated Tracy Rees, Chief Executive Officer, Intrinsyc Technologies Corporation. “When our computing solutions are designed into our clients’ products it typically leads to repeat hardware purchases over multiple years and the benefits of this model are evident in our increasing revenue contribution from the Company’s embedded computing products, which increased by 76% annually.\n“Although the decline in services revenue from a major client negatively impacted our gross margin and earnings in Fiscal 2017, we have indications that our client will once again be a significant contributor to our services revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2018.\n“I’m confident that Intrinsyc is on the right track with our expanding product portfolio, strong technology partnerships, industry leading technical expertise, and growing client base. While we expect that our continued execution of our strategic initiatives will lead to annual revenue growth; there is a greater likelihood for quarterly variability in Fiscal 2018 due to the timing of our clients’ hardware orders and the availability of components needed for manufacturing.”\nQuarterly Business Highlights\nThe Company increased design wins for the Company’s Open-Q™ computing modules from 44 in the previous quarter to 50 in the fourth quarter, and production wins from 19 to 22, over the same period. Design and production wins are important metrics to track our progress in building our business with scalable repeat revenue.\nNew production wins, agreements, and orders announced during the fourth quarter included:\nA production win and order for the Company’s Open-Q™ 2100 System on Module (“SOM”). The SOM will power an advanced GPS asset tracking product built for government applications by a leading government systems integrator. The initial order received will support a client rollout and field trials with larger production expected beginning in the second quarter of 2018.\nA new production win and the receipt of an initial order valued at US$470,000 for the Company’s Open-Q™ 410 SOM. The SOM will be used in a camera based IoT product.\nThe receipt of orders for hardware and services from new and existing clients, that are in aggregate valued in excess of US$800,000. Among the engineering services orders are commitments from an industry leading company in the robotics industry, a Fortune 500 computing company, and an Industrial IoT company that is planning on using the Company’s recently launched Open-Q™ 626 SOM.\nAnnounced the Open-Q™ 660 Hardware Development Kit. Mobile Platform . The development kit supports an advanced mid-range processor that is designed to provide a leap in performance; supporting advanced photography and enhanced gaming, in addition to long battery life for top-tier mobile and IoT devices.\nIntrinsyc was named to Deloitte's Technology Fast 500™ , ranking 407 on this list of the 500 fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies in North America. Intrinsyc achieved this award as a result of our 196 percent revenue growth over a three-year period, from 2013 to 2016.\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Month Comparative Results\nThe Company reported fourth quarter revenue of US$6.8 million (CDN$8.7 million), up 58% over the same period in the prior year of US$4.3 million (CDN$5.7 million) and up 41% over the prior period of US$4.8 million (CDN$6.0 million). The increase in revenue over the comparative periods was due primarily to increased revenue from the sale of hardware products.\nThe Company had net income of US$484,797 (CDN$611,772) in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of US$210,128 (CDN$327,171) in the same period in the prior year and net income of US$93,006 (CDN$112,859) in the prior quarter.\nGross margin 2 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 35%, which was consistent with the 36% gross margin in the same period in the prior year but higher than 30% in the prior quarter. Decrease in gross margin over the same period in the prior year was due to the change in revenue mix, which saw a significant increase in revenues from the Company’s Embedded Computing Hardware business which has a lower gross margin than the Company’s engineering services, and a decrease in engineering services revenues. The increase in gross margin over the prior quarter was due to an increase in engineering services revenues.
