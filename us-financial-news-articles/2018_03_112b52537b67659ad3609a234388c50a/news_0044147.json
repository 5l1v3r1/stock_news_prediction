Loan originations and transaction fee revenue were up 31% and 37% year-over-year to $2.9 billion and $130 million, respectively. Prosper also generated cash from operations for three consecutive quarters, starting in Q2 2017.\n“During 2017, Prosper put its business on solid footing and saw a return to strong growth, driven by stable funding and continued demand from borrowers who want to refinance high-interest debt at a time when credit card interest rates are rising,” said David Kimball, CEO, Prosper Marketplace. “Prosper is among the few marketplace lending companies that have achieved true scale with over $11 billion in cumulative originations since inception. As an industry leader, we continue to invest in our platform and user experience, as well as explore new products where we can leverage our expertise in consumer credit.”\nDuring 2017, Prosper established the Prosper Marketplace Issuance Trust (PMIT), its company sponsored securitization program. Through PMIT, Prosper closed three over-subscribed deals that totaled $1.5 billion and attracted more than 45 unique investors.\n“The launch of PMIT was an important step in broadening our investor base, attracting new investors to the platform, and diversifying our funding sources,” said Usama Ashraf, CFO, Prosper Marketplace. “We look forward to expanding our securitization program in 2018 and continuing to build confidence and interest in the consumer credit asset class.”\nThe following table summarizes the financial highlights from the year:\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics (Unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nTwelve Months Ended Dec 31, 2017 2016 Loan Originations $ 2,876,055 $ 2,187,600 Transaction Fees, Net 130,174 95,130 Servicing Fees, Net 27,206 28,903 Net Loss (115,158 ) (118,741 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) 5,460 (37,991 ) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 1,081 (62,667 ) Summary of Key 2017 Financial Highlights:\nSurpassed $11 billion in cumulative personal loan originations through the platform since inception Increased loan originations 31% and transaction fee revenue 37% year-over-year Net loss of $115 million included $89 million of non-cash charges related to warrants to purchase preferred stock that were issued to a consortium of investors and a third party in connection with a settlement agreement Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $5 million increased $43 million year-over-year Generated cash from operations for three consecutive quarters, starting in Q2 2017 Closed $50 million Series G funding, ending 2017 with approximately $100 million of liquidity\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP Financial measure.
