The fire exits were blocked,\" Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the committee, said in a statement.\nFour people have already been detained, including two employees of the firm that services the mall's fire alarm.\nEmergency services said they had extinguished the fire, but later said it had reignited in places, and that rescuers were struggling to recover bodies because the building's top floor had collapsed.\nIt was unclear if any people were still unaccounted for.\nHealth Minister Veronika Skortsova said from the scene that 13 people were in hospital, including an 11-year-old boy in a serious condition.
