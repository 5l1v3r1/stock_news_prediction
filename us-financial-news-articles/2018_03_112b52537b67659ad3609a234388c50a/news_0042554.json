TCEHY, +4.12% and a private-equity firm co-founded by billionaire Jack Ma, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe possible investment is part of a fundraising effort by Manbang Group, a tech unicorn that runs a mobile app platform matching truck drivers with shippers who have cargo to move. Unicorns are private companies that have valuations greater than $1 billion. \nManbang is looking to raise between $500 million and $1 billion in fresh funds to help it expand in China’s growing logistics market, according to people familiar with the matter. Neither the fundraising amount nor the participating investors have been set, the people said. \nThe infusion of funds would value the company at about $5 billion if Manbang raised $500 million, they said. Representatives from Manbang Group didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. \nA SoftBank investment would come from its Vision Fund, a nearly $100 billion investment vehicle that has backed other ride-hailing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Didi Chuxing Technology Co. in China. The company spent about $8 billion for a stake of about 15% in Uber last year. SoftBank declined to comment.
