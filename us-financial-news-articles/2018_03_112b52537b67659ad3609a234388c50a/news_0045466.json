The fight is internal and external,” Erdogan told a crowd in the Black Sea province of Trabzon, without elaborating on what operations he was referring to.\nIraq’s Joint Operations Command denied that any foreign forces had crossed the border into Iraq.\n“The operations command confirmed that the situation in Nineveh, Sinjar and the border areas was under the control of Iraqi security forces and there is no reason for troops to cross the Iraqi border into those areas,” it said in a statement.\nSources in Sinjar said there was no unusual military activity in the area on Sunday.\nThe Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. President Tayyip Erdogan said last week they were creating a new base in Sinjar, and that Turkish forces would attack if necessary.\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan speaks during a meeting of his ruling AK Party in Trabzon, Turkey March 25, 2018.

Turkey sees the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed PKK.\nErdogan has vowed to extend the military operation along the Syrian border and on Sunday said the Turkish-led forces would take control of the town of Tel Rifaat.\nMany civilians and YPG have gathered in and around Tel Rifaat after Turkey seized control of Afrin. It is a Kurdish-controlled enclave, cut off from a larger expanse of Kurdish territory in the northeast of Syria.\nThe United Nations said last week that around 75,000 people had been displaced to Tel Rifaat and surrounding areas from Afrin, and more were expected to come.\nAdditional reporting by Lisa Barrington in Beirut and Raya Jalabi in Baghdad.; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T19:16:33.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
