With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.\nFacebook shares fell as much as 6.5 percent, briefly dipping below $150 for the first time since July 2017, before recovering the day's losses to close up 0.4 percent at $160.06.\nThe shares are still down 13 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica. The company has lost more than $70 billion in market value since then.\nThe recovery in Facebook's stock on Monday may have been due to investors taking advantage of the lower stock price and the belief that the latest regulatory scrutiny may not ultimately hurt the company's relative long-term growth prospects, Wall Street analysts said.\nThe FTC investigation is looking at more than whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent order it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.\nIf the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine it thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.\nWe remain strongly committed to protecting peoples information,\" Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said in a statement on Monday. \"We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.\nALL APOLOGIES\nLawmakers in the United States and Europe continue to pressure Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain the company's privacy practices.\nThe U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg and the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy.\nThe U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee have already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing.\nFacebook's failure to protect confidential user information likely violated specific legally binding commitments, but also basic norms and standards,\" said U.S. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.\nIn Europe, the European Union Justice Commissioner asked Facebook if the company is \"absolutely certain\" that the Cambridge Analytica incident could not be repeated.\nZuckerberg apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and he promised to restrict developers' access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. He also said sorry in full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers.\n\"The was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,\" Zuckerberg said in the ads. \"We are now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n'FUTURE REGULATION'\nHis apologies have failed to quell discontent. Germany's justice minister said Facebook's promises were not enough.\n\"In future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly,\" Katarina Barley said after talks to which she summoned Facebook executives including European public affairs chief Richard Allan.\nAdvertisers and users are also unhappy.\nU.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys suspended all advertising on Facebook on Monday while wireless speaker maker Sonos said in a blog post it will remove advertising from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Alphabet's YouTube for one week.\nInternet company Mozilla Corp, Germany's second-largest bank Commerzbank AG and British advertising group ISBA all suspended advertising on Facebook last week.\nOpinion polls published on Sunday in the United States and Germany cast doubt over the trust people have in Facebook.\nFewer than half of Americans trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday, while a survey published by Bild am Sonntag, Germanys largest-selling Sunday paper, found 60 percent of Germans fear that Facebook and other social networks are having a negative impact on democracy.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson Writing by Bill Rigby Editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T00:16:08.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
