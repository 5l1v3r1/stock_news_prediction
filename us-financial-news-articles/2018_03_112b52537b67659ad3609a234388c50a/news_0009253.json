But by 1300 GMT the dollar was flat at 106.17 yen.\nTrump faced growing pressure on Monday to pull back from his plans from political and diplomatic allies as well as U.S. companies, but he said he would stick to his guns.\n“The market has to work out what the trade wars mean for the U.S. dollar,” said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley.\n“While in the short term they might be seen as dollar-negative, there’s an argument to say in the medium term it could be dollar-positive, because if growth really does slow down, and moves out of emerging markets, then we could see a squeeze on liquidity and some positive dollar momentum.”\nAs the dollar slumped, the euro rebounded above $1.24 to a two-week high of $1.2414, after a brief selloff on Monday tied to Italy’s inconclusive weekend election.
