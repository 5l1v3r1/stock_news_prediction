The twice World Cup winner posted a photograph on his Twitter page on Saturday with his left forearm and hand encased in a plaster cast. The Blues told local media Williams would be out for between six and eight weeks. The team were not immediately available to confirm the reports. The 32-year-old could return in time for the clash against the defending champion Canterbury Crusaders on May 19, two weeks before the All Blacks play their first match in their three-test series against France in Auckland. The Blues, who have a bye this week, play South Africaâ€™s Sharks next Saturday at Eden Park.
