Both hits came off Padres right-handed reliever Adam Cimber, who took the loss in his major league debut.\nJeremy Jeffress, the fifth of six Milwaukee pitchers, was credited with the win after getting out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the bottom of the 11th when Chase Headley grounded into a double play.\nRight-hander Jacob Barnes got the save, striking out the side in a perfect 12th. Milwaukee pitchers had 15 strikeouts for the game.\nThe Padres tied the game at 1-1 on Freddy Galvis’ two-out, run-scoring, ninth-inning single to right off Brewers All-Star closer Corey Knebel. Carlos Asuaje started the game-tying rally with a one-out single, and pinch runner Matt Szczur stole second ahead of Galvis’ second hit of the game.\nBehind the pitching, hitting and sliding of right-handed starter Chase Anderson, the Brewers were leading 1-0 through eight innings.\nAnderson held the Padres to one hit and three walks with six strikeouts over six innings. He also hit the first of three straight Milwaukee singles in the third and scored the game’s first run with a slide that beat the throw home by Padres left fielder Jose Pirela.\nPadres starter Clayton Richard retired the first two Brewers in the third ahead of Anderson’s single. The Milwaukee pitcher moved to second on the second of free agent signee Lorenzo Cain’s three hits in his Brewers debut.\nThe Brewers’ other offseason outfield acquisition, Christian Yelich, then blooped a single to left that dropped in front of a late-breaking Pirela, whose weak throw to the plate allowed Anderson to score.\nAnderson and relievers Josh Hader and Matt Albers combined to take a three-hit shutout into the bottom of the ninth.\nRichard allowed the one run on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts over seven innings. He retired 13 of the 14 hitters he faced after getting inning-ending, double-play grounders in both the first and second innings after excellent defensive stops by third baseman Headley and shortstop Galvis.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:03:24.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
