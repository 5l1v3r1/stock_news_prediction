Veyrat still owns a 56 stake in Neoen through his investment vehicle Impala, which will hang on to its majority stake in the IPO.\nThe listing is primarily aimed at providing an exit for private equity group Omnes Capital, which has two funds with a combined 24 percent stake in Neoen’s capital, the source said.
