U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to replace his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. At the same time, the New York Times reported U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for documents related to Trump's businesses, including some concerning Russia. Earlier this week, the U.S. currency took a hit after Trump dismissed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and investors grew increasingly nervous about the direction U.S. policy might take following a series of departures by key members of staff. \"Risk appetite is suffering due to the U.S. political scenario, marked by instability in Donald Trump's cabinet and worries about increased protectionism,\" economists at SulAm√©rica Investimentos wrote in a report. Currencies from Mexico, Chile and Colombia slipped between 0.1 and 0.4 percent, while the Argentine peso firmed due to central bank intervention. Both the Brazilian real and the nation's benchmark Bovespa stock index were nearly flat. Shares in wood pulp and paper producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA surged over 15 percent after it won the battle for control of larger rival Fibria Celulose SA <FIBR3.SA, whose shares slumped 10 percent.
