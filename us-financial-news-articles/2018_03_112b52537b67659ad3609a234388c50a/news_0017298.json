I said well, ‘Let’s talk about it.’”\nIt took two years of discussion to agree that heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions attributable to human activity are driving today’s climate change.\nThe marital episode and her subsequent engagement with faith groups have firmed up her views that the traditional conservative tenet of small government - not science - usually explains why some resist the issue.\n“(It’s) not because they really have a problem with the science,” she said. “It’s because they have a problem with the perceived solutions.”\n“Taxes, government legislation, loss of personal liberty ... that’s the real problem people have.”\nHayhoe did not field any questions from climate change skeptics during her talk at the summit in Edmonton. And her message struck particularly close to home in a province that is Canada’s main oil producer.\n“The world energy system is undergoing an energy revolution ... from old dirty energies that we have been using for hundreds of years to clean, endless sources of energy like wind,” she said, in an interview after her speech.\n“Oil and gas companies, they look down the road and they understand that the world is changing.”\nUnder the Paris agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to curb planet-warming emissions enough to keep the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, ideally to 1.5 degrees.\nBut without unprecedented action temperatures could rise above 1.5 degrees, according to a draft report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seen by Reuters earlier this year.\nEditing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilience and climate change.
