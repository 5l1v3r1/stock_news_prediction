Bullying has been reduced by almost a third among the 7,000 children who have taken part in pilot programs, it said.\n“I spent time with an amazing young girl – Sripun – who was voted by her peers to take part in an anti-bullying program to help stop violence in schools,” Beckham said in a statement.\n“This has increased her confidence and she’s hopeful that other students won’t have to go through the same bullying experience she did.”\nThe fund — named after Beckham’s lucky number on his England and Manchester United shirts — focuses on children at risk of violence, abuse or disease.\nBeckham, a father of four, has said that he hopes his own children will be proud of his work with the 7 Fund, which also has projects in Indonesia, Nepal, Uganda and El Salvador.\nReporting by Katherine Pennington; Editing by Katy Migiro.
