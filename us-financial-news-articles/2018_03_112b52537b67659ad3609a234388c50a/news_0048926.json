REUTERS/Anindito Mukherjee/Files Fortis, based in the northern Indian city of Gurugram, had not yet made a firm decision about the offer, it said in a statement here , pushing its shares down 2.5 percent in afternoon trading.\nThe shares rose as much as 4.2 percent earlier in the day after the Mint newspaper reported the boards of Fortis and Manipal Health were expected to meet to approve the proposed merger.\nThe statement comes weeks after media reports that U.S.-based private equity firm TPG Capital, a shareholder in Manipal, wanted the two companies to merge and form the largest healthcare services provider in the country.\nFortis’ main backers, Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh, resigned from its board last month following legal troubles related to the sale of their stake in Ranbaxy to Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd ( 4568.T ). The Ranbaxy case is unrelated to Fortis.\n“We continue to support the management and the board to successfully transition to the new joint entity,” the Singh brothers said in a statement late Tuesday.\nThe merger of Fortis and Manipal will unlock significant value for all stakeholders, they said.\nReporting by Tanvi Mehta, Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru and Devidutta Tripathy in Mumbai; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:23:45.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
