REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The Cincinnati-based company also is refining its product assortment, pricing, marketing and customer service under Restock Kroger amid a brutal price war with rivals ranging from Walmart to German discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nCEO McMullen said Kroger would not cede ground to those competitors, nor would it make the price war worse.\n“We’re not going to lose on price, but we’re not out there trying to lead the market down,” McMullen said on the conference call.\nKroger plans $3 billion of capital expenditures in 2018, in line with 2017. It also expects to close the sale of 800 convenience stores to British gas station operator EG Group for $2.15 billion later this year and use the proceeds to buy back shares and pay down debt. That sale is not included in its 2018 profit forecast.\nKroger’s sales for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, rose 12.4 percent to $31.03 billion, topping analysts’ target of $30.83 billion. Identical same-store sales were up 1.5 percent, edging past analysts’ estimate of 1.45 percent, and the sales forecast for 2018 was roughly in line with expectations, a sign that customers are not abandoning Kroger.\nNet earnings attributable to Kroger jumped 68.8 percent to $854 million, or 96 cents per share.\nGross margin was 21.9 percent of sales for the fourth quarter. Excluding fuel, the 53rd week and a credit and charge for last-in-first-out inventory accounting, gross margin decreased 31 basis points from the same period last year.\nKroger’s shares had gained about 16 percent in the past six months before dropping 12.7 percent to $22.91 in midday trading.\nReporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson, Sriraj Kalluvila, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Peter Szekely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T16:02:33.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
