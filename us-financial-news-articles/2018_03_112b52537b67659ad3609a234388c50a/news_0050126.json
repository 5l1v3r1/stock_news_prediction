Morgan analysts said on Thursday. \n“For the business sector we estimate this extra burden amounts to perhaps around $11 billion annually. For the household sector the figure is around $5 billion,” J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli and analyst Teresa Ho wrote in a research note. \nThe expected rise in debt burden would be “a very minor tightening and not enough to motivate a change to the macroeconomic outlook,” they said.
