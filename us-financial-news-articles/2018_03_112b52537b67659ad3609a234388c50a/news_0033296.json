RDI holds approximately 46% of the issued and outstanding shares of DavidsTea.\nMr. Herschel Segal, co-founder of DavidsTea and President of RDI, leads the slate of RDI nominees. If the slate is elected or appointed, it is expected that Mr. Segal will be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of DavidsTea. The other nominees are: M.

I am confident that the members of the slate share my belief in the company and its future. We think eight is an appropriate size for the Board of DavidsTea at the present time. Six of our eight nominees are independent of RDI and a majority of our nominees will be independent directors of DavidsTea.\n“As I previously said, I have every confidence that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and Board of Directors of DavidsTea will endorse our slate of nominees and that our slate will appear in the management information circular that DavidsTea will prepare for the annual meeting of shareholders. Our nominees are ready to take office at the annual meeting, if not sooner,” Mr. Segal concluded.\nFor further information please contact:\nMr. Lorenzo Salvaggio\nVice-President and Chief Operating Officer\nRainy Day Investments Ltd.\n(514) 295-2353\nSource:Rainy Day Investments Ltd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T02:39:47.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
