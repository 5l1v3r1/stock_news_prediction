SunPower last month said the tariff would force it to cut 150 to 250 non-manufacturing jobs.\nThe cheaper P-series panels could be made at a new U.S. facility that the company would build, probably in the Southwest, Werner said, noting that SunPower was in the process of narrowing down its options to two locations.\n\"This is not hypothetical. We're ready to make this happen,\" he said, adding that an exemption for premium panel imports would \"facilitate\" this plan.\nA big investment in solar panel manufacturing as a result of the tariff would mark a win for the Trump administration, but so far the industry remains focused on the fate of the installation business, which employs tens of thousands of people.\nOnly China's JinkoSolar has said it plans to build a U.S. manufacturing facility, and SolarWorld, one of the panel producers behind the trade case that resulted in the tariffs, has said it will hire 200 employees this year.\nSuniva, the bankrupt company that first petitioned the administration in April to impose tariffs, has not publicly outlined its plans.\nThe exemption request will undergo a 30-day comment period before the U.S. Trade Representative makes a decision.
