Sales rose 3 percent last year, sharply down from a 13.7 percent gain in 2016.\n“Regarding the annual sales target, whether it is 3 or 1 or 5 percent, whether it’s from CAAM or an industry forecast, it’s not numerically important,” Li Shaohua, CAAM assistant secretary general, told a press briefing in Beijing.\n“It’s too early to determine the full-year picture based on the January-February trend.”\nChina’s auto market has been facing a slowdown overall. In 2017, auto sales in the market fell short of a 5-percent growth forecast from CAAM, hurt in part by a phasing out of tax cuts on smaller engine cars that began last year.\nCAAM said sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), referring to pure electric and plug-in hybrids, rose 95.2 percent in February to 34,420 units. Sales of NEVs in the first two months of the year surged 200 percent to 74,667 vehicles.\nChina is making a major push to support the NEV sector and drive a shift away from traditional petrol-engine cars. The industry body has previously said the segment will grow around 40 percent this year to top sales of 1 million low-energy cars.
