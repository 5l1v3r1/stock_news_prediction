Mar 24, 2018; Austin, TX, USA; Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa plays against Ian Poulter of England during the fourth round of the WGC - Dell Technologies Match Play golf tournament at Austin Country Club. Mandatory Credit: Erich Schlegel-USA TODAY Sports Englishman Poulter had to stave off a late comeback by hot-putting Oosthuizen before securing a 2&1 victory at Austin Country Club in Texas. Poulter was not surprised Oosthuizen proved so difficult to subdue. “I knew Louis wasn’t going to back off. That’s why he’s got a Green Jacket in his closet,” Poulter said, referring to the reward a player receives for winning the U.S. Masters. Only problem is that Oosthuizen does not have a Green Jacket — at least not the Augusta National variety. Poulter perhaps can be forgiven for his error because Oosthuizen has come very close at the Masters, losing a playoff to Bubba Watson in 2012. Oosthuizen does have a Claret Jug, however, following his runaway British Open victory at St Andrews in 2010. He also lost a playoff at St Andrews to Zach Johnson in 2015, and has the dubious honour of having completed the career grand slam of runner-up in all four majors. Poulter advanced to play American Kevin Kisner in the quarter-finals.
