It said the FBI had relied on information beyond what the ex-spy, \nChristopher Steele, \nprovided, had corroborated some of his report and had told the court about Mr. Steele’s motivations. \nThe inspector general will also look at what information the FBI and Justice Department knew about a source that provided information used in the application, the statement said. \nSeparately, the inspector general has been reviewing the FBI’s handling of its probe into \nHillary Clinton’s \nuse of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Some of its findings led to the dismissal of former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe this month. \nMr. Sessions’ referral of the issue to the inspector general raised President \nDonald Trump’s \nire last month. “Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse,” he tweeted , adding the decision was “DISGRACEFUL!”. \nComplaints about alleged wrongdoing by Justice Department personnel are generally referred to the inspector general to examine. At the time, Mr. Sessions said he would continue to discharge his duties with “integrity and honor” and the agency would work in a “fair and impartial manner.” \nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T01:10:16.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
