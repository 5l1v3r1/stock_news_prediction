She also noted that the “extreme volatility” of crypto-assets could “easily create new vulnerabilities” in the financial system.\nThen came Google’s early-Wednesday announcement that it will be banning ads for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, or ICOs. Facebook made a similar move earlier this year, so the two biggest digital ad players are shunning the cryptocurrency space.\nAt least, in theory. Facebook’s attempts have been less than successful, with some people using off-brand spellings such as “bitc0in” to evade the social network’s filters. Even without such tactics, it still seems a few scammy ICO-related pitches are making it onto Facebook .\nAt the time of writing, around 7 a.m. Eastern Time, Bitcoin was down 3.66% at a value of $8,830, according to CoinMarketCap.com .\nWhile the recent news may not be so great for some in cryptocurrency circles, it wasn’t all bad. On the plus side, Lagarde suggested that the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could also be used for regulatory purposes.\n“The technology that enables instant global transactions could be used to create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures. Better use of data by governments can also help free up resources for priority needs and reduce tax evasion, including evasion related to cross-border transactions,” she wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T13:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T15:34:49.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
