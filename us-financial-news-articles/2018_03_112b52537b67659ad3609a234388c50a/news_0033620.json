The logo of Italian oil and gas group Eni is seen on the facade of its headquarters in Rome, Italy, December 23, 2017. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi In its 2018-2021 plan, Eni said it would pay a dividend this year of 0.83 euros ($1.02) per share compared to 0.80 euros on last year’s results. It also said a share buyback remained an option to distribute excess cash. “The dividend increase announced today mirrors our commitment to a progressive remuneration policy,” Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said. Eni was the first oil major to cut its dividend three years ago after a steep decline in the oil price. As crude prices recover, the world’s biggest oil companies are now trying to woo investors with promises of growth and greater rewards. In February, Total raised dividends and announced plans to buy back shares while BP flagged a resumption of share buybacks. [nL8N1PY27R] [nL8N1PW59S] State-controlled Eni, the world’s most successful explorer in recent years after finds in Egypt and Mozambique, said it planned to spend about 32 billion euros over the plan period. It said it aims to increase production by 3.5 percent per year, up from a 3 percent target in its previous plan. Free cash flow is expected to total 22 billion euros over the period. Eni also said it intended to grow its midstream and downstream businesses. Eni shares were up 1 percent at 13.96 euros by 1213 GMT, outpacing a 0.4 percent rise in Milan’s blue-chip index.
