This unfortunately will have negative economic consequences,” it read.\nCrucially, after British calls to include financial services in the future free-trade deal with the EU, the bloc said Britain would be treated as any other third country.\n“In services, with the aim of allowing market access to provide services under host state rules, including as regards right of establishment for providers, to an extent consistent with the fact that the UK will become a third country and the Union and the UK will no longer share a common regulatory, supervisory, enforcement and judiciary framework,” the document said.
