By Isaiah Freeman-Schub; Photography by Dham Srifuengfung; Syling by Julie Ragolia Scroll NEW FACES Self-taught in ceramics, Hoyt, 37, has honed a battery of methods to manipulate his material, experimenting with marbling, extrusion, tiling and slip-casting to achieve his faceted motifs.Bell & Ross BR S-92 Blue Steel watch, $3,200, bellross​.com, and Tod’s jacket, $3,995, tods​.com.

TOOLING AROUND “I was seduced by a new material,” says Hoyt of his pivot to ceramics in 2011, four years after graduating with a degree in printmaking from Massachusetts College of Art and Design. “I came into the studio and had a rapid-fire succession of ideas of what I could do with clay.” Vacheron Constantin Traditionnelle, $20,300, vacheron-constantin​.com. STANDING ORDER Hoyt begins by creating a flattened, “exploded” version of a piece, consisting of a series of slabs that he then joins together using Sheetrock frames. “When it comes to my process, I still feel like I’m living in a two-dimensional world,” says the former printmaker. “I’m finding a voice in three-dimensional form.”Blancpain Villeret Ultraplate, $22,500, blancpain​.com, Hermès coat, $4,350, tank, $360, and pants, $630, Hermès stores nationwide. STARTING BLOCKS Hoyt, who shows with New York’s Patrick Parrish gallery, was selected to create a site-specific installation for last year’s Exhibit Columbus. The citywide series in Columbus, Indiana, challenged designers to create an interactive experience evoking the city’s rich architectural history and exploring the role of design in daily life. For his piece, called Theoretical Foyer, Hoyt replaced 2,500 sidewalk bricks on a corner of a main street with the colorful casts seen here.Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 150M watch, $5,400, omegawatches​.com, and Berluti jacket, $1,960, similar styles available at Berluti, 677 Madison Ave, New York FORM AND FUNCTION “Making the work is about achieving some kind of facility over the clay,” says Hoyt. “I’ve intentionally picked a medium that is very finicky. It withholds so much the whole way.”Tank Louis Cartier watch, $21,400, Cartier boutiques nationwide; Salvatore Ferragamo jacket, price upon request, Salvatore Ferragamo boutiques nationwide.

STRETCH THE RULES Occasionally employing digital tools, Hoyt works mostly in an analog mode, often beginning with stream-of-consciousness drawing to imagine compelling shapes and colors. “It’s about connecting dots that the universe has already put there,” he says. “Whatever identifying language Ihave is because I’ve chosen to find the form organically.” Zenith Heritage 146, $6,700, zenith-watches​.com, Bottega Veneta sweater, $2,300, 800-845-6790.
