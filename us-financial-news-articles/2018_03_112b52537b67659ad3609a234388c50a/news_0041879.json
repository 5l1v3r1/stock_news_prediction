Weidmann is a very good man but I think there's a lot of ammunition being built up against him,\" David Marsh, chairman of the London-based think tank OMFIF (Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum), told CNBC Thursday.\nRecent remarks by Bruno Le Maire, the economy minister of France, showed that the name to replace Draghi is far from being decided. The minister said earlier this month that just because France decided to back the Spanish economy minister de Guindos as ECB vice president, it doesn't prejudge other choices France will make for other major European posts.\n\"I think in the end (Weidmann) won't get the job. It could even be another Frenchman actually,\" Marsh told CNBC, adding that this will be a \"big issue\" for Germany and France — the two largest euro economies.\nOn top of the decision for ECB chief, there will be an array of discussions to elect officials for many other European positions that will become vacant over the next two years. For instance, Europe will have to choose a new European Commission president in the spring of 2019, as well as a new European Council president, along with other roles inside the ECB.\nshow chapters UK PM May more likely than not to get Brexit through unopposed: OMFIF 4:22 AM ET Wed, 13 Dec 2017 | 02:44 It is expected that European countries will be competing to get their national representatives in the various institutions.\nIn February, Erik Nielsen, global head of CIB research at UniCredit, told CNBC that \"Weidmann's vocal opposition to most of the ECB decisions in recent years has generated too much opposition in too many other member states for him to get the nod.\"\nHe added that the fact that the heads of the European Stability Mechanism, the Single Resolution Board and the European Investment Bank are all from Germany could also impact his chances of being selected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T14:56:42.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
