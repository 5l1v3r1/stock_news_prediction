Col. Ralph Peters , a strategic analyst for Fox News, said he was leaving the network and laid out his reasoning in a fiery letter to colleagues, obtained by BuzzFeed News .\nMore from Vox:\nThe massive new study on race and economic mobility in America, explained\nThe gun control movement needs boys\nIllinois primary election: live results of key races\n\"Today, I feel that Fox News is assaulting our constitutional order and the rule of law, while fostering corrosive and unjustified paranoia among viewers,\" Peters wrote . \"Over my decade with Fox, I long was proud of the association. Now I am ashamed.\"\nHe went on:\nIn my view, Fox has degenerated from providing a legitimate and much-needed outlet for conservative voices to a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically ruinous administration. When prime-time hosts — who have never served our country in any capacity — dismiss facts and empirical reality to launch profoundly dishonest assaults on the FBI, the Justice Department, the courts, the intelligence community (in which I served) and, not least, a model public servant and genuine war hero such as Robert Mueller — all the while scaremongering with lurid warnings of \"deep-state\" machinations — I cannot be part of the same organization, even at a remove. To me, Fox News is now wittingly harming our system of government for profit.\nPeters continued in that vein before signing off: \"As our president's favorite world leader would say, 'Das vidanya'\" — Russian for \"goodbye.\"\nFox News responded to Peters's letter in a statement, saying he was \"entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention.\"\nJeremy Barr tweet\nBefore his angry departure, Peters, a retired US Army officer, was a fairly reliable conservative voice on foreign policy, and he had been extremely critical of the Obama administration. He did not hold back on Obama's US response in Syria; he called the president a \"pussy\" on air (and was temporarily suspended for it ) and described Secretary of State John Kerry as \"as fierce as a chocolate eclair.\"\nThat said, Peters was never a Trump fan. He told Fox Business in November 2016 he would vote for Hillary Clinton in the election — even though she was \"despicable,\" \"corrupt,\" and \"greedy\" — because \"it's a vote against Donald Trump. I don't want Moscow's man in the White House.\"\nAnti-Trump views weren't entirely uncommon on Fox News during the campaign. But since Trump's election, the network has moved closer and closer to the White House line — too much so, it seems, for even some of its own reliably conservative commentators.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T15:20:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
