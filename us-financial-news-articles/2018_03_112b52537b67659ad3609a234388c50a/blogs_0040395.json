Last year, Japan welcomed 28.7 million tourists — up from 10.4 million in 2013.\nThe surge has been helped by several factors, including a relatively weak yen — down about 10 percent against the dollar over the last five years — and relaxed visa requirements, particularly for the all-important Chinese market.\nThe growth rate — about 20 percent in 2017 versus 2016 — is one of the highest in the world and expected to continue, said André Andonian, managing partner for Japan at consultancy firm McKinsey.\nshow chapters Japan looks for a sustained tourism boom as Olympics approach 11:06 PM ET Sun, 25 Feb 2018 | 03:14 \"The Olympics will be the booster to sustain growth,\" he told CNBC, listing other major events leading up to the games, such as World Cup Rugby in 2020 and the G20 meeting in 2019.\nAndonian noted that tourist expenditures have risen in the United Kingdom since the 2012 London games — and that bodes well for Tokyo.\nIn January of this year, the number of visitors to Japan rose 9 percent versus the same period a year ago .\nThe newest government target is to attract 40 million tourists by 2020, as it embarks on a drive to draw more tourists from non-Asian countries. In 2017, over two-thirds of international visitors were from South Korea and Greater China.\nRetailers get a lift Big industries are benefiting from Japan's tourism boom.\nMore tourists — including mainland Chinese tourists who have a penchant for retail therapy — are helping to support merchants in an aging Japan.\nTourist spending hit a record 4.42 trillion yen ($41.7 billion) in 2017 — in tandem with the surge in visitor numbers — a jump of 17.8 percent from a year ago, official data show.\nshow chapters What could be pushing up consumer spending in Japan? 10:02 PM ET Tue, 10 Oct 2017 | 02:27 The boost to retail has sent shares of related stocks higher, with cosmetics maker Shiseido and discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings posting gains.\nShiseido's shares surged over 100 percent in the last year, Don Quijote's shares rose 60 percent in the same period. In the same period, the Nikkei 225 rose about 10 percent.\nBoth of those merchants' shares were fueled by tourist spending. Shiseido is planning a new factory in the country — its first new domestic plant in four decades — to cater to the demand for \"Made in Japan\" products.\nAlthough Japan is known for a relatively expensive retail scene, customers get \"price and quality, as well as specific offerings,\" said Ed Rogers, CEO of Rogers Investment Advisors.\nHotel industry There are simply not enough rooms in Japan, with hotels in the so-called Golden Route of Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto experiencing high occupancy around 80 percent, said McKinsey's Andonian.\nThe tight supply prompted the Japanese government to step up activity in the arena, financing the development of hotels in large cities by private companies. A private consortium also set up a new fund to invest in aging, traditional accommodation.\nMeanwhile, developers have stepped up construction, with names like Hyatt, Marriott, Nomura Real Estate Development and Mitsui Fodosan building new accommodation to house holiday revelers.\nInfrastructure Like its predecessors, the Tokyo Games will require billions in infrastructure investment — a controversial issue that requires political support for the use of public funds.\nThe budget for the Olympics stands at 1.35 trillion yen ($12.7 billion) as of December 2017 — double the 730 billion yen ($6.9 billion) projected in 2013 when the city won the games.\nshow chapters Preparations for Tokyo 2020 are 'right on track' 11:14 PM ET Wed, 14 March 2018 | 03:11 Tokyo will be upgrading existing sites and building new sites for the games that can be used after the event to help control costs, said Masa Takaya, spokesman for the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nStill, infrastructure companies involved in the investment, such Mitsubishi Estate , Mitsui Fudosan will benefit from the work. Both companies are part of a consortium that won a bid for the athletes' village.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T11:54:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
