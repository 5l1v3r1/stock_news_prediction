For English football but also for European football, for Manchester United themselves,” he added. \n“I think you need a few of these heavyweights to push it forward.” \nWillems was speaking before a UEFA women’s Champions League quarter-final second leg between Chelsea and French side Montpellier, with the Londoners 2-0 up after the away game. \nManchester City were also on course to reach the semi-finals. SPONSORSHIP RIGHTS ‘UNBUNDLED’ \nThe crowds for women’s Champions League games are still a fraction of those in the men’s game, with Chelsea playing their game at AFC Wimbledon’s 2,250 capacity stadium in south-west London. \nWhile England captain Steph Houghton, who plays for Manchester City, has built up a Twitter following of nearly 100,000 over years, Manchester United player Paul Pogba has close to five million. \nUEFA has big plans to grow the game, however. \nThe soccer body took the decision last November to ‘unbundle’ sponsorship and broadcast rights so that women’s soccer could stand alone rather than the respective Champions League and European championship being packaged together. \n“Packaged together is the polite way to say it,” said Willems of the old system. \n“It was more like if you want men’s Euro, you have to take women’s euro. That was not good for the women’s competition but it was also not good for the sponsors because they had something they were really not interested in at the time. \n“Now we will know the real value of women’s football and have companies with us that are only there for that. I see that as something strong.” \nThe plans focus on building the audience as well as participation, and Willems said the initial feedback was positive. \nUEFA were also discussing with clubs a greater centralization of the women’s Champions League, along the same lines as the men’s which has its own sponsors and advertising, rather than just for the final. \n“The proposal is that from the 2019/20 season, from the quarter-finals onwards, we would have a centralized broadcast approach, limited sponsor approach,” said Willems. \nThat could eventually also set out the quality of stadiums, which could make playing at grounds like Stamford Bridge more likely. \n“I feel that we are at the tipping point of where things are changing in certain countries... like England,” said Willems of a country ranked second in the world in the women’s game.
