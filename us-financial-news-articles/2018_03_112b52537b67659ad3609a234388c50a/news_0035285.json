VW has denied any market manipulations.\nManfred Doess, head of legal affairs at VW's majority stakeholder Porsche SE, said on Tuesday he did not expect the latest inquiry to lead authorities to press charges against VW.\n\"In my judgment, nothing will come out of this,\" Doess said at the holding firm's earnings press conference.\nSince its dieselgate scandal, VW has launched a multibillion-dollar investment in electric vehicles and mobility services as part of an attempt to rebuild its image.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T10:15:01.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
