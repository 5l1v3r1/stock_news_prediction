REUTERS/Henry Nicholls “In risk terms one or two days is not what we are concerned about, what we are worrying about is whether there could be an ongoing risk that could build over the future.”\nCordons were still around the restaurant and the pub on Sunday, and police could not say how long they would remain.\nA number of police cars and other vehicles were removed from a local car park by soldiers wearing protective clothing and gas masks on Sunday, a Reuters eyewitness said.\nSlideshow (11 Images) Items from the Zizzi restaurant, including a table, had been removed and destroyed, the BBC said.\nLocal residents said they were concerned by the warnings about contamination issued to the people who had visited the venues.\n“It’s worried a lot of people,” dog walker Phil Burt said. “This town is usually packed on a Sunday, but I think a lot of people are just staying away.”\nMany in British media and politics have speculated that Russia could have played a part in the attack on Skripal, but interior minister Amber Rudd said on Saturday it was too early to say who was responsible.\nSkripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.\nFinance minister Philip Hammond said Britain would respond “appropriately” if a foreign state is found to have been involved in the poisoning.\n“This is a police investigation and it will be evidence-led and we must go where the evidence takes us,” Hammond told BBC television on Sunday.\n“So we have to allow the police investigation to run its course. But if there were to be an involvement of a foreign state evidenced by this investigation, then obviously that would be very serious indeed and the government would respond appropriately,” he said.\nReporting by Paul Sandle and William Schomberg; Editing by Mark Potter and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T12:40:23.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
