Craig Reedie, President of the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) attends the WADA Symposium in Ecublens, near Lausanne, Switzerland, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse WADA president Craig Reedie told a conference that he was “encouraged by the significant progress” made by RUSADA but added it was still taking too long. “We want to welcome and independent and efficient RUSADA back in from the cold... it’s just a pity it is taking so long for Russian authorities to make it happen,” he said. Reedie said the slow progress was “despite a significant amount of work being carried out by WADA to persuade the Russian authorities to recognize and accept as true the systemic doping scheme as revealed by the McLaren report.” There was no immediate comment to Reedie’s remarks by Russia which has repeatedly denied systemic doping.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse RUSADA was declared non-compliant in 2015 after a report commissioned by WADA found widespread doping in the country’s athletics. Since then, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA have launched a string of investigations — including one by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren — to look into the issue which ballooned into the biggest doping scandal in years, engulfing many sports and said to involve more than 1,000 athletes.
