The Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica more than $6 million to target Facebook ads based on voter data it had collected in the run-up to the election, according to Federal Election Commission records cited by Reuters .\nAccording to Facebook, about 270,000 people downloaded Kogan's app, and gave consent for the creator to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked.\nThe social network said it banned the app in 2015, and Cambridge Analytica said that it had deleted all data from it. However, Facebook said it recently received reports that the company had not in fact deleted all the information, leading it to suspend SCL and Cambridge Analytica until further notice, pending an internal investigation.\nOn Saturday, Cambridge Analytica issued a statement", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-17T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T05:28:48.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
