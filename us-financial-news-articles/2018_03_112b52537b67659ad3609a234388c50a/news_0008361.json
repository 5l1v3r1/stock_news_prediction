The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4%.\nInvestors were trying to gauge the impact of President Donald Trump’s protectionist trade agenda and whether planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are the start of a broader policy that could eventually include levies on other products and commodities.\nMr. Trump on Monday increased the pressure on two U.S. trading partners, saying in an early-morning tweet that he would only lift the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports if Mexico and Canada sign a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Other countries have already responded that they plan to retaliate, including Canada and the European Union.\n“Investors are thinking if this leads to an all-out trade war or repercussions with Nafta, this is a lot bigger,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management. “This would create an economic downdraft that would potentially be bad for the economy.”\nIndustrial conglomerates were among the market’s biggest laggards Monday, as many of those companies would face higher costs under the proposed tariffs. Aerospace giant Boeing BA -0.66% led the Dow lower, falling 1% and shaving roughly 24 points from the blue-chip index. Caterpillar, meanwhile, declined 0.5%.\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.4%, though Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 1.2% after the country’s elections Sunday produced no clear winner . In Asia, most markets finished down.\nA voter casting her ballot at a polling station during the Italian general election in Rome on Sunday.

Signs of rising inflation in the developed world fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve could push interest rates up faster than previously expected, making stocks less attractive.\nTariffs could now add to expectations for higher inflation, said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments.\nThe Dow fell more than 3% last week amid the inflation jitters, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 2% and 1.1%, respectively.\n“There’s a more volatile policy environment that didn’t exist a few months ago,” said Mr. Wood of the risks posed by the Fed and the tariffs.\nElsewhere, stock markets in Europe mostly brushed off the inconclusive Italian vote , as the euro switched between gains and losses against the U.S. dollar and the British pound.\nWhile the Italian election increased the political instability in the eurozone’s third-largest economy, populist parties still face hurdles to entering government given their reluctance to work with other parties. Analysts predict short-term volatility until a new government is formed but expect the wider economic upswing in Europe to continue.\n“This time the economic recovery in Europe and world-wide is much more resilient than in the past,” said Diego Franzin, head of equities at Amundi.\nIn Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 2.3%, while Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.7%, on concerns of global trade frictions.\nWrite to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T05:46:11.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
