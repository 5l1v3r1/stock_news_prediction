Data showing fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth slowed less than estimated also supported the greenback.\nAnalysts said this week’s jump for the dollar looked overdone, however, and that many of the structural reasons for the U.S. currency’s decline - trade and budget deficits and monetary tightening in other parts of the world - remained.\n“Is U.S. protectionism good or bad? The market is very undecided about this, but the dollar’s bounce was a little bit too bold from the market’s perspective,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX strategy at Commerzbank.\nYUAN STRENGTH Elsewhere, the Chinese yuan moved up again, rising 0.1 percent to 6.2862 yuan per dollar and putting it on track for its best quarterly performance since 2008.\nThe Chinese currency has risen about 3.4 percent so far this year, and some analysts predict that trade relations with the United States will limit China’s ability to weaken its currency.\nThe dollar also eased against the yen, losing some momentum after hopes of detente in East Asia provided the spark for its largest daily gain in six months the previous session.\nThe dollar fell 0.3 percent to 106.52 yen, giving back some gains after surging 1.43 percent on Wednesday, its biggest rise since Sept. 11 of last year.\nBecause of Japan’s status as a net creditor nation, the yen tends to be bought on rising geopolitical tensions and vice versa.\nSome traders also noted, however, that currency trading so far this week has been driven by flows related to quarter-end, and for many Japanese firms, the financial year end, on March 31.
