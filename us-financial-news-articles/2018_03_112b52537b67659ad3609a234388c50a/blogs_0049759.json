Prince Mohammed and Masayoshi are \"looking for a number of investment opportunities,\" according to the tweet, which was hashtagged #CrownPrinceinNYC.\nTweet \nThe Saudi Press Agency did not immediately return a request for confirmation that the meeting took place on Monday.\nSaudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is one of the primary investors in Softbank's roughly $100 billion Vision Fund, which is focused on funding technology ventures, including Uber and Indian e-commerce site Flipkart.\nSoftbank intends to invest as much as $25 billion in the kingdom in the next few years, Bloomberg reported in November. Much of that money will go towards a new tech-focused city called NEOM announced by Prince Mohammed during an investment summit last fall, according to Bloomberg.\nFresh from visits to Washington and Boston, Prince Mohammed is now in New York City, where he will attend a CEO Summit on Tuesday. The day's agenda includes a panel on Saudi Arabia's so-called \"giga-projects\" like NEOM.\nThe 32-year-old crown prince is spearheading Saudi Arabia's economic transformation, which aims to diversify the kingdom's oil-dependent economy.\nWATCH: Meet Saudi Arabia's crown prince show chapters Meet Saudi Arabiaâ€™s crown prince      2:59 PM ET Wed, 21 March 2018 | 02:52", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T00:19:12.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
