The software allows you to fly pretty much any aircraft in any type of weather imaginable, but I opted for a U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and clear sunny skies. \nI started out at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and flew over the Potomac river to see a few of D.C.'s monuments as well as the Pentagon. \nHere's what I saw in my VR handset: Amanda Macias | CNBC Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D flight simulator \nAs it turns out, I wasn't great behind the throttle of the Black Hawk and ended up crashing in a field near the Pentagon. Breed later told me that I was operating on the easiest mode available on the simulator. \nIn short, Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D is essentially a souped-up training aid that was leveraged from the \"best technology from the video game industry to drive extreme affordability and innovation in the defense industry,\" Breed explained.
