The ripple effect is that countries, producers of bauxite or iron ore, will have downward pressures on the value of their commodity,” Kituyi said.\n“There will be concentration: bigger companies in the smaller producers will take over the smaller suppliers because of vulnerabilities created by this anxiety,” he said.
