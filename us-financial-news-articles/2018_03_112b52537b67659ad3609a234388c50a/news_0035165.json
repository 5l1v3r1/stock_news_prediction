Reach her on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: helen.reid.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net WHAT WE'RE WATCHING AHEAD OF THE OPEN (0752 GMT) European stock futures were down 0.2 to 0.5 percent, pointing to a more feeble start to a busy week with investors’ eyes on Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting and the EU summit on Brexit. With earnings season drawing to a close, there are however results from Henkel and Micro Focus which could jolt the shares. Henkel warned the year was off to a slow start, its shares are indicated down 2-3 percent. Micro Focus meanwhile is seen falling as much as 15 percent after it said annual revenue would fall more than expected due to lower licence income and complications from its purchase of Hewlett Packard assets, prompting its CEO to quit. M&A continues apace, and Hammerson’s rejection of Klépierre’s takeover offer is likely to boost the UK commercial real estate firm’s shares. It is offers such as these that many UK investors are hoping for when they buy into what many see as the stocks most at risk from a disorderly Brexit, such as commercial real estate investment trusts. European companies like Klépierre have all the more to gain from buying the depressed shares with the euro/sterling exchange rate so favourable. With the offer valuing Hammerson’s shares at a 40.7 percent premium to Friday’s closing price, and the market’s short position on Hammerson growing in the past month, the shares are likely to jump this morning. News that activist investor Sherborne acquired a more than 5 percent stake in Barclays should shake up the British bank’s shares too.

With earnings season drawing to a close, corporate news is thin on the ground but M&A news is still coming in: Hammerson has just announced it rejected an acquisition offer by Klépierre which valued the UK real estate company's shares at a 40.7 percent premium to their closing price on Friday. (Helen Reid) MORNING CALL: CAUTION DOMINATES FIRST DAY OF BUSY WEEK Good morning and welcome to Live Markets. European stocks are called down this morning, following the lead of Asian markets which hit a speed-bump in the first trading day of a busy week. Britain prepares for a critical EU summit this week, and investors are also eyeing Jerome Powell's first press conference as Federal Reserve Chair and the central bank's decision on Wednesday. Asian shares were mixed as tension built ahead of this week's Fed meeting which will likely result in an interest rate hike. Spreadbetters call the DAX 17 points lower at 12,373, the CAC 40 down 17 points at 5,265, and the FTSE 100 16 points lower at 7,149.
