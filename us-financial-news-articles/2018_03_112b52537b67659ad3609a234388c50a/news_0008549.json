Russell declined to comment when contacted by Reuters while pilot Fenlator-Victorian said “all queries should be directed to the IBSF”. Sources with knowledge of case indicated that the “A” sample showed traces of the banned steroid clenbuterol. The bobsleigh team received a lot of attention in Pyeongchang as they were the first female athletes from the Caribbean island nation to compete at a Winter Olympics. Their breakthrough appearance came 30 years after a Jamaican men’s team competed at the Calgary Olympics, inspiring the highly successful movie “Cool Runnings”.
