And then we saw the TV pictures and it wasn’t enough.”\nHamilton showed impressive composure during the post-race news conference not to voice his disappointment strongly.\nBut he may have also felt a little silly sitting next to victorious Vettel after his “joke” on Saturday that his record-setting pole lap was designed to “wipe the smile” from the German’s face.\n“Really last minute I was told that Ferrari was coming out (of pit-lane), I didn’t know Ferrari was in,” Hamilton told reporters. “I think, just disbelief from that moment until... just disbelief.”\nThe Hamilton disappointment compounded a tough weekend for his team mate Valtteri Bottas, who suffered a heavy crash during qualifying and was penalized five grid places after the team had to replace his gearbox.\nHe finished a creditable eighth after starting 15th on the grid.\n“We got punched in the face today and we got punched in the face yesterday,” Wolff added.\n“And against everybody saying that we are going to run away easy with 20 victories or whatever, and I always said that’s not the case.\n“It is very close at the top and I guess this is the message everybody wants to hear.”\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-25T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:23:19.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
