It’s a serious diplomatic step, we haven’t recalled an ambassador in 25 years,” Miroslav Lajcak told reporters after a regular government meeting.\n“The process continues, I will meet with the head of Slovakia’s secret service today and, depending on the information, we are ready to take further steps.”\nSlovakia’s President Andrej Kiska on Tuesday criticized the government for not taking tougher diplomatic steps, calling for “a principled and clear attitude in response to a request for solidarity coming from one of our important partners.”\nPrime Minister Peter Pellegrini said on Monday that Slovakia would not make “theatrical gestures under pressure”.\nRobert Fico, who resigned as prime minister this month but remains leader of the ruling Smer party, said on Tuesday he refused to “break friendly ties with Russia just because someone else wishes so”.\nReporting By Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T17:00:03.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
