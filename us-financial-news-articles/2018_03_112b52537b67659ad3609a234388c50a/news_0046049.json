A reporter who comes to the Great Hall of the People unscripted,” cheered one commentator on Weibo.\nAn official at Yicai who was not authorized to speak to media, said Liang had been temporarily pulled from the channel’s parliamentary coverage team.\nNeither Liang nor Zhang could be reached for comment on Wednesday, and emailed inquiries to both reporters’ employers went unanswered.\nReporting by Pei Li and Tony Munroe; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-14T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:31:06.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
