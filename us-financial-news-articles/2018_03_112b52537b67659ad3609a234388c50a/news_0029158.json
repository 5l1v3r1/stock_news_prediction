Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow failed to meet a deadline to explain the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a Soviet-made nerve agent. Russia denies involvement in the attack. Britain has received shipments of liquefied natural gas from Russia this year and in total, Europe gets a third of its gas from Russia. “We will be continuing to discuss with the European Union not just our energy security but that wider energy security issue,” May said when questioned by lawmakers.
