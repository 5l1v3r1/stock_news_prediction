It has grown rapidly in size and complexity, emerging as one of the world's largest with financial assets at nearly 470 percent of gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund.\nThe latest ministry shake-up also includes the creation of a new immigration management bureau and the restructuring of the national intellectual property rights bureau.\nThe proposals will be formally approved by the parliament on Saturday.\nChina is restructuring the responsibilities, roles and powers of its state institutions to make them more efficient. President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser, Liu He, said that such reform would be profound.\nâ€” CNBC contributed reporting to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T02:59:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
