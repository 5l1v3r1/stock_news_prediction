All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the Company’s long-term growth prospects. Forward-looking information may be identified by such forward-looking terminology as “anticipate,” “believe,” “may,” “will,” and similar terms or variations of such terms. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that if they do not fully materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Additional information on these and other risks, uncertainties and factors is included in Wright’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC.

It is presented as supplemental information that the Company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company’s core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back net interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization to net income. EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute either for net income, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, or cash flow, or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA prior to non-cash stock compensation expense and non-recurring items shown above.\nThe Company through its wholly-owned subsidiary has one operating segment which is engaged in the investment management and financial advisory business and derives its revenue from investment management services, other investment advisory services and financial research. The Company’s corporate operations are not considered an operating segment and the Company does not allocate corporate expense for management and administrative services or income and expense related to other corporate activity to its operating segment to measure its operations. The Company’s management utilizes adjusted EBITDA to measure segment performance.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA of the operating segment to loss from continuing operations before income taxes (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\n2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of operating segment $ 954 $ 785 Other operating expenses:\nCorporate (1,555 ) (1,498 ) Depreciation and amortization (433 ) (643 ) Equity based compensation (218 ) (229 ) Software implementation costs (38 ) - Relocation and severance costs - (99 ) Operating loss (1,290 ) (1,684 ) Non- operating income (expense):\nInterest expense and other, net (96 ) (100 ) Share of loss from Investment in LLC - (294 ) Loss from operations before income taxes $ (1,386 ) $ (2,078 ) Following is a summary of the Company's total\nassets (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 Operating segment $ 6,160 $ 6,224 Corporate (1) 6,286 7,431 $ 12,446 $ 13,655 (1) Consists principally of cash and cash equivalents\nWRIGHT INVESTORS' SERVICE HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nYears Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues Investment management services $ 2,213 $ 2,240 Other investment advisory services 2,387 2,765 Financial research and related data 812 706 5,412 5,711 Expenses Compensation and benefits 3,364 3,745\nOther operating 3,338 3,650\n6,702 7,395 Operating loss (1,290 ) (1,684 ) Share of loss from Investment in LLC - (294 ) Interest expense and other, net (96 ) (100 ) Loss from operations before income taxes (1,386 ) (2,078 ) Income tax benefit (expense) 96 (54 ) Net loss $ (1,290 ) $ (2,132 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (0.07 ) $ (0.11 )\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180326006060/en/\nWright Investors’ Service Holdings, Inc.\nIra J.
