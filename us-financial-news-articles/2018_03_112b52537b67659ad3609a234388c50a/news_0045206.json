It was just time. It was so cool driving up here and it felt good.”\nAfter climbing from the No. 14 Ford Fusion, Bowyer immediately turned toward the crowd and shouted for someone to give him a beer. There were plenty of fans to oblige the affable Kansan after the race was delayed a day due to big snowstorm that passed through the area Saturday.\nHe is also now the answer to a great trivia question, the only driver to have won at the top level in all three of the current manufacturer’s cars: Ford, Chevrolet and Toyota.\nKyle Busch finished second, and Ryan Blaney placed third.\nDenny Hamlin, a five-time winner at Martinsville, dominated Stage 1 and won it, leading 103 of 130 laps. Brad Keselowski challenged Hamlin late, but lapped traffic kept him from making the pass for the lead.\nMartin Truex Jr. started on the pole thanks to sitting atop the points standings after qualifying was cancelled Saturday, and he quickly bolted out to maintain the lead, but Kyle Busch, who started second, passed him on Lap 5 of 500.\nBefore long, Hamlin, Busch’s teammate, had taken the lead on Lap 27, and the cars started settling in for the long slog that is a Martinsville race on the .526-mile paper-clip shaped track.\nBlaney dominated Stage 2, winning his first stage on a short track, by leading 121 of the 130 laps with Clint Bowyer trying to chase him down before finishing second.\nKeselowski was fourth and Hamlin rounded out the top five.\nWhen the final 240-lap stage began, Blaney was still out front after pit stops.\nNASCAR now takes a week off for the Easter holiday and is back in action Sunday, April 8, at 2 p.m. ET at Texas Motor Speedway for the O’Reilly Auto Parts 500 on the 1.5-mile D-shaped oval. It’s the last weekend off for the Cup series until June 17, a span of 11 races.\n—K.
