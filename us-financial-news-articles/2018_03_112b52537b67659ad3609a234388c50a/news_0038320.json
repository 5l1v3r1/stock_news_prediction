The projects are expected to be connected to the grid during the second quarter of 2020.\nIn China, as of February 28, 2018, the Company's late-stage utility-scale power pipeline totaled 410 MWp.\nSolar Power Plants in Operation\nIn addition to its late-stage utility-scale solar project pipeline, the Company has a portfolio of solar power plants in operation, totaling 1.2 GWp, as of February 28, 2018, which are recorded on its balance sheet as \"project assets\", \"assets held-for-sale\" and \"solar power systems, net\". Revenue from the sale of electricity generated by the plants, which is recorded as \"assets held-for-sale\" and \"solar power systems, net\". totaled $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $9.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe sale of projects recorded as \"project assets\" (build to sell) on the balance sheet will be recorded as revenue once revenue recognition criteria are met, and the gain from the sale of projects recorded as \"assets held-for-sale\" and \"solar power systems, net\" (build to own) on the balance sheet will be recorded within \"other operating income (expenses)\" in the income statement.\nThe table below sets forth the Company's total portfolio of solar power plants in operation, as of February 28, 2018:\nU.S.\nJapan\nBrazil\nChina\nIndia\nOthers\nTotal\n808\n85.6\n56.8\n145.5\n91.1\n24.1\n1,211.1\nManufacturing Capacity\nSubject to market conditions, the Company plans to expand its ingot, wafer, cell and module capacities by December 31, 2018 to 2.0 GW, 5.0 GW, 6.35 GW and 9.81 GW, respectively.\nManufacturing Capacity Roadmap (MW)\n31-Dec-17\n30-Jun-18\n31-Dec- 18\nIngot\n1,200\n1,620\n2,000\nWafer\n5,000\n5,000\n5,000\nCell\n5,450\n5,600\n6,350\nModule\n8,110\n8,310\n9,810\nThe Company's ingot manufacturing capacity reached 1.2 GW, as of December 31, 2017 and is expected to reach 1.62 GW and 2.0 GW by June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018. The increase is intended to reduce the purchase cost of ingots and therefore reduce the Company's all-in module manufacturing cost.\nThe Company's wafer manufacturing capacity at the end of 2017 was 5.0 GW, all of which uses diamond wire-saw technology. Diamond wire-saw technology is compatible with the Company's proprietary and highly efficient black silicon multi-crystalline solar cell technology, thereby reducing silicon usage and manufacturing cost.\nThe Company's solar cell manufacturing capacity as of December 31, 2017, was 5.45 GW. The Company expects to increase its cell manufacturing capacity to 5.6 GW and 6.35 GW by June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nThe Company's module manufacturing capacity as of December 31, 2017 was 8.11 GW and it is expected to reach 8.31 GW by June 30, 2018 and 9.81 GW by the end of 2018.\nCertain of our production plants have recently experienced under-utilization due to the changing tariff and market conditions. In particular, some of our module and cell production plants in Canada and South East Asia are under-utilized due to the Section 201 tariff decisions by the U.S. government.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe Company's business outlook is based on management's current views and estimates with respect to operating and market conditions, its current order book and the global financing environment. It is also subject to uncertainty relating to final customer demand and solar project construction and sale schedules. Management's views and estimates are subject to change without notice.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects total solar module shipments to be in the range of approximately 1.30 GW to 1.35 GW, including approximately 65 MW of shipments to the Company's utility-scale solar power projects that may not be recognized as revenue in first quarter 2018. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 is expected to be in the range of $1,370 million to $1,400 million, which includes recognized revenue from the sales of solar projects during the quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter is expected to be between 10.0% and 12.0%, which reflects the impact of lower margin U.S. solar projects we have already sold in the quarter.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects total module shipments to be in the range of 6.6 GW to 7.1 GW. Total revenue for the full year 2018 is expected to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion. We expect approximately 53% of total revenue for 2018 to come from our Solar Module and Components Business, while the balance will come from our Energy Business. The Energy Business revenue will mainly come from monetization of the Company's solar power plants in the U.S., Japan, China and the UK. The Company expects its cost of production will decrease throughout the year as material costs decrease and new, higher efficiency cell and module capacity comes online.\nDr. Shawn Qu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Canadian Solar commented, \"Moving into 2018, we have seen price adjustment throughout the solar value chain. We expect that our technology, new products and the increase in vertical integration along the manufacturing process will help the Company further build upon its leadership position.\"\nRecent Developments\nOn March 12, 2018, Canadian Solar announced that Recurrent Energy, its wholly owned subsidiary, had completed the sale of its interests in three solar power plants totaling 309 MWp in the U.S. to Korea Electric Power Corporation, South Korea's largest electric utility.\nOn March 1, 2018, Canadian Solar announced that it had secured a non-recourse project finance facility of up to JPY16 billion ($149 million) from Shinsei Bank, Limited for its 53.4 MWp Oita Hijimachi solar power project in Japan.\nOn February 22, 2018, Canadian Solar announced that it had completed the sale of solar power plants totaling 142MWp in the U.K. to Greencoat Solar II LP, managed by Greencoat Capital LLP, for approximately GBP 191.2 million ($267.7 million), net of distributions of GBP 3.8 million ($5.3 million) made prior to closing.
