In early 2017, the country's Supreme People's Court said during a press conference that 6.15 million Chinese citizens had been banned from taking flights for social misdeeds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T15:05:17.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
