Koh gave Prager a chance to amend its lawsuit.\nA lawyer for Prager did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a similar request.\nIn court papers, Google acknowledged that deciding which videos to restrict \"may involve difficult, subjective judgment calls.\"\nBut it maintained that it should not be held liable for trying to keep YouTube \"safe and enjoyable for all users.\"\nGoogle drew attention last August when it fired an engineer, James Damore, who had written an internal memo saying that biological differences led to fewer women in various technology jobs.\nDamore sued Google in January, saying it was biased against white men with conservative views.\nThe case is Prager University v Google LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-06064.
