Zielinski, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics, was given a four-year ban after testing positive for 19-Norandrosterone during a doping control during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. CAS rejected Zielinski’s appeal, deciding “it could not conclude otherwise than that the athlete had committed the anti-doping rule violation intentionally. Furthermore, the Panel did not find any reasons to reduce the four-year period of ineligibility”.
