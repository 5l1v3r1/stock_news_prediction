He decided to call the actress to congratulate her, which White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed.\nThe premiere episode of Rosanne , a revival of the 1990s sitcom, had 18.2 million total viewers, 10% more than the original series finale 21 years ago, reports Deadline .\nRoseanne has been a vocal defender of Trump, and on the show her character portrays an avid Trump supporter. In a recent interview with The New York Times , Barr had said she made Roseanne a Trump supporter on the show because it seemed like an “accurate portrayal” of the political preferences of many working-class American families.\n#RoseanneBarr when i think of all the Presidents that I have gotten to meet and talk with, it really makes me feel so humbled!
