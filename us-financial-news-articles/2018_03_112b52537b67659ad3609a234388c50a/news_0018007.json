The CFTC filed its suit back in January, alleging that the company solicited “money and virtual currencies” but never provided the promised advice. \n“The CFTC Complaint further alleges that to conceal their scheme, soon after obtaining customer funds, Defendants removed the website and social media materials from the Internet and ceased communicating with [Coin Drop Markets] Customers, who lost most if not all of their invested funds due to Defendants’ fraud and misappropriation,” the regulator said at the time. \nThe CFTC isn’t the only regulator that claims oversight over the cryptocurrency business. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sees virtual currencies as securities , and has set up a whole “Cyber Unit” to tackle fraudulent initial coin offerings (ICOs) . \nBoth federal agencies testified last month to the Senate, regarding the threats posed to investors by the booming cryptocurrency market. CFTC chair Christopher Giancarlo testified that the market deserves a “thoughtful and balanced” regulatory response.
