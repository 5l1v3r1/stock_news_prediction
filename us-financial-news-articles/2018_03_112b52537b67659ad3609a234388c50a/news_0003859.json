REUTERS/Tami Chappell/File Photo “The company should have acted sooner to mitigate the impact on these additional affected consumers,” Thune said in a statement. “Equifax needs to put consumers first and shouldn’t be trying to clean up its mess in a piecemeal fashion.”\nEquifax will release fourth-quarter results on Thursday afternoon, earnings that will give investors a clearer picture on how much it will cost the company to recover from the hack.\nThe company in November said breach-related costs totalled $87.5 million in third quarter. It issued a fourth-quarter outlook that missed Wall Street forecasts, predicting $60 million to $75 million in costs related to the incident during the period.\nEquifax said on Thursday it would contact the newly identified breach victims and offer them free identity theft protection and credit monitoring services.\nThe company’s shares were down 2 percent at $110.76 in late afternoon trade, in line with a decline in broader U.S. equity markets.\nReporting by Jim Finkle in Toronto and Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T16:43:35.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
