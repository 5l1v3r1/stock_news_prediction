The Greenstone Subscription was also conducted at the Placing Price, which represented a discount of 0.55 per cent. to the closing mid-price of 3.62 pence per ordinary share on 22 March 2018 being the business day prior to the announcement of the Greenstone Subscription.\nThe Placing is conditional upon, among other things, the completion of the Greenstone Subscription and approval of the Placing by the Company's shareholders at the General Meeting.

Following completion of the Greenstone Subscription and the Placing, the Company's issued share capital will consist of 1,175,281,434 ordinary shares.\nAs announced this morning, the Company was seeking to raise a minimum of US$8.0 million.
