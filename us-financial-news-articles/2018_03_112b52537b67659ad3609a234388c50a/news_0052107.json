(Graphic on expected yield moves: reut.rs/2pLxl5r )\n“Clearly there are concerns. We are introducing new fiscal measures at a stage in the cycle which we have never done before in the past, and there is uncertainty there,” said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo.\n“With most of the duration of those issuances at the short end of the curve, you may see higher rates there which may lead to a flatter yield curve.”\nThe yield spread has narrowed - a move generally seen by financial markets as a sign at this stage of an economic cycle of potential trouble ahead - in recent months from its peak of around 300 basis points in 2010.\nBut over 80 percent of 31 strategists expect it will be more than two years before the yield curve inverts. One strategist expected it to invert within a year. The rest said expected it to invert in one to two years.\nAn inverted yield curve, when the two-year yield trades above the 10-year, has preceded all five past recessions.\nSome analysts have said an inversion does not necessarily mean an impending recession as it has in the past. But nearly 70 percent of 30 respondents said it was still an indicator of recession.\nCLOSING IN ON POLICY AND YIELDS Benchmark bond yields in the euro zone and Britain are also expected to climb along with U.S. Treasuries as the European Central Bank is expected to end its stimulus this year and the Bank of England is forecast to raise interest rates.\nThe spread between 10-year Treasuries and much lower-yielding German bunds over the forecast period is predicted to be roughly around the current 230 basis points.\nThat reflects expectations the ECB is closing the monetary policy gap with the United States.\nThe latest findings are in step with a separate Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists earlier this month, which showed the dollar was expected to retreat further, giving way to a rising euro despite the Fed outlook.\nWhile speculation had risen the Bank of Japan would follow in the footsteps of its major peers on removing monetary stimulus after Governor Haruhiko Kuroda hinted at that on March 1, the latest poll showed almost no change in expectations compared to three months ago.\nThe consensus was for 10-year Japanese government bonds to yield 0.10 percent in a year, a view held for well over a year now.\n“The fact that bond yields have remained firm through bouts of volatility suggests that the recent leg-up in yields has staying power,” said Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD.\n“Nevertheless, despite the efforts of central bankers to remove stimulus in a measured, non-disruptive fashion, the process of interest rate normalization could trigger future episodes of financial market volatility.”\n(For a graphic on expected yield moves, click reut.rs/2pLxl5r )\nPolling by Vivek Mishra and Shrutee Sarkar, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://reut.rs/2pLxl5r", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T03:35:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
