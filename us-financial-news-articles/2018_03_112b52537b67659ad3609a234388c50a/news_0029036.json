He returned to Accenture four years later with a deeper understanding of the African business landscape.\n“Vukani truly understands the local market and has been delivering real value and impact for our clients through innovative digital solutions, making him a great choice to lead our business in sub-Sahara Africa,” said Gianfranco Casati, Accenture’s group chief executive – Growth Markets. “As country managing director, Vukani will help clients streamline, transform and grow their businesses so they are future-ready.”\nAccenture has been operating in South Africa since 1971. The company serves a wide range of clients in the country, from state-owned entities to private enterprises and multinationals, through its offices in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Pretoria.\n“In our rapidly changing digital society, many companies are at risk of being left behind unless they embrace digital technology company-wide,” Mngxati said. “It is a journey that not only improves companies’ bottom lines, but is also a part of nation building, making this an incredibly exciting time to be able to help shape the future of Africa.”\nVukani holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Business Information Systems and Accounting from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.\nAbout Accenture\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
