His name would then be removed from Qualcomm's slate of board director nominees at Qualcomm's shareholder meeting next week.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.\nJacobs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nQualcomm shares were up 1.7 percent at $60.95 in midday trading in New York on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $90 billion.\nWithout an existing company as acquirer, Jacobs, whose father Irwin co-founded Qualcomm, is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy.\nPaul Jacobs has no meaningful stake in the company.\nEven if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, sources said on Thursday. Adding to the potential conflicts, Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund.\nSoftBanks deals are also subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. national security panel that objected to Broadcoms bid for Qualcomm.\nGiven that Qualcomms board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomms nominees is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomms board directors could put pressure on Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who was criticized by some investors for inviting CFIUS to review Broadcoms bid, to make changes to the companys strategy.
