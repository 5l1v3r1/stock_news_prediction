Citi said Merran will be based in London and report to Jay Mann, head of its fixed income and currencies beta platform. It is part of a push by Citi to build its ETF business. It has made several hires in recent months, including Andrew Jamieson from iShares as global head of ETF product. In January Citi added ETFs to the list of instruments it accepts as collateral in agency securities lending transactions. It said that was because regulatory changes, including MiFID II, meant European institutional investors were looking to increase and diversify their pools of collateral to meet increasing margin requirements.
