The adjustment strips out writedowns and restructuring and tax charges which resulted in a reported net loss of 328 million euros for the full year.\nAnalysts, however, pointed to a good downward trend in debt which is seen at about 1.1 billion euros at the end of this year, from 1.3 billion euros at the end of last December.\nSaipem shares, which hit a six-month low on Monday after it said it would re-publish its 2016 accounts, fell after Tuesday’s results but later recovered to trade up 3.4 percent at 1526 GMT.\n$1 = 0.8106 euros Reporting by Stephen Jewkes Editing by Valentina Za/Mark Potter/Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:35:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
