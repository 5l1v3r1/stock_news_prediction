(OTC Pink: COHO; \"Crednology\"). Our management team has been negotiating the acquisition of a cloud computing company for some time. Unfortunately, due to some significant changes to the target’s customer base, the acquisition was put on hold. We recently revived our interest in the acquisition and have agreed new terms. We now plan to close this transaction- providing a successful due diligence process in the next four to six weeks.\nOrie Rechtman, CEO of Crednology Holding Corp. commented , “ The E-waste industry, as a whole, has seen changes to costs and to selling prices as a result of China putting a temporary block on all plastics imports. China is responsible for 50% of worldwide plastic recycling. This had a direct effect on the recycling of printers, copiers and plotters as well as household plastic electronics. The industry has picked up momentum again in February and we have seen increased demand and e-waste available supplies as we are nearing Earth Day in April. As momentum has picked up we have seen revenue growth again. As a result, we expect our first quarter’s results to continue our upward momentum and progress. The acquisition, although comparatively small due to the target’s loss of revenue, will benefit our bottom line profit starting in our second quarter.”\nAbout Crednology Holding Corp.\nCrednology Holding Corp, a Delaware corporation, is a public holding company that has been dedicated to enhancing shareholder value through a strategic combination of organic growth, mergers and profitable acquisitions.\nThe Company is engaged in the cloud computing segment of the technology sector as well as the Electronic Waste and Recycling business.
