Analysts on average had estimated a 5.6 percent increase.\nTotal revenue climbed 10.8 percent to $33 billion, edging past expectations of $32.75 billion.\nIssaquah, Washington-based Costco’s shares fell slightly in after-hours trading.\nReporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T01:46:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
