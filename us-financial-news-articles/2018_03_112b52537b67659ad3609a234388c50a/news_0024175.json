He most recently served as CEO at Acadia Healthcare's Twelve Oaks Recovery Center in Navarre, Fla.\n\"Mark understands the important work of addiction treatment and knows what it takes to lead a large organization,\" said Young, who is transitioning into a consulting role with parent company American Addiction Centers. \"He will equip our team to become even more effective in their life-changing work.\"\nThe Oxford Treatment Center, an American Addiction Centers facility, provides a complete continuum of care for drug and alcohol addiction.
