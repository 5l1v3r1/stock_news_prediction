The President is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities. We have no announcements at this time,” he said.\nMoscow has denied responsibility for the attack and has retaliated against Britain’s move to expel 23 Russians by ordering out the same number of Britons.\nThe United States joined with Britain in blaming Russia for the attack.\nTrump has sought to improve ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and last week in a phone call with Putin congratulated him his disputed re-election victory.\nReporting By Steve Holland; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T00:47:11.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
