The index fell to -59 at its worst during the financial crisis.\nThe number is calculated by measuring the difference in percentage points between firms that reported increased optimism and those that reported it decreased.\nIt was the eighth quarter of falling optimism in the last nine quarters and marked two straight years of negative sentiment - longer than what was seen over 2007-9, when gloom in the industry lasted for seven consecutive quarters.\nPwC’s head of financial services Andrew Kail said as well as Brexit, firms were grappling with high levels of competition, changing consumer behaviours, rapid technological change, new regulation, and trying to manage costs.\n“... Collectively, it is denting confidence about the future,” he said.
