(NASDAQ: DXPE) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. The following are results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the back of this press release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 financial highlights:\nSales were $265.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 5.4 percent from the third quarter and an increase of 19.5 percent compared to $222.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $0.36 based upon 18.2 million diluted shares, compared to $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016, based on 17.4 million diluted shares, which included the $5.6 million gain on the sale of Vertex. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the fourth quarter was $15.8 million compared to $13.5 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 17.1 percent. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 6.0 percent and 5.4 percent for the fourth and third quarter, respectively, a 59 basis point improvement. Free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) for the fourth quarter was $3.4 million or 21.3 percent of EBITDA.\nFiscal Year 2017 financial highlights:\nSales were $1.0 billion for fiscal year 2017, compared to $962.1 million for fiscal year 2016, an increase of 4.6 percent. Adjusting for the divestiture of Vertex in October of 2016 or $22.7 million in sales, organic sales increased 7.2 percent. Gross profit was $271.6 million, or 27.0 percent of sales for the fiscal year 2017, compared to $264.8 million, or 27.5 percent of sales for the fiscal year 2016. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $238.1 million, or 23.7 percent of sales for fiscal 2017, compared to $245.5 million, or 25.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2016. Earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year 2017 grew 89.8 percent to $0.93 based upon 18.2 million diluted shares, compared to $0.49 per diluted share in fiscal 2016, based on 15.9 million diluted shares. EBITDA was $61.7 million for fiscal 2017, compared to $55.2 million for fiscal 2016. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 6.1 percent and 5.7 percent in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Free cash flow (cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) for fiscal 2017 was $9.7 million compared to $43.1 million for fiscal 2016. Adjusting for the 2017 reclassification of outstanding checks (see non-GAAP reconciliation), free cash flow for fiscal 2017 would have been $26.8 million.\nBusiness segment financial highlights:\nService Centers’ revenue for the fiscal year was $641.3 million, an increase of 3.3 percent year-over-year with a 9.9 percent operating income margin. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 3.8 percent sequentially with a 9.6 percent operating income margin. Innovative Pumping Solutions’ revenue for the fiscal year was $204.0 million, an increase of 9.0 percent year-over-year with a 5.6 percent operating income margin. For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 16.6 percent sequentially with a 7.3 percent operating income margin. Supply Chain Services’ revenue for the fiscal year was $161.5 million, an increase of 4.9 percent year-over-year with a 9.6 percent operating margin. For the fourth quarter, revenue declined 2.1 percent sequentially with a 9.4 percent operating income margin.\nDavid R. Little, Chairman and CEO remarked, “We closed the year with fourth-quarter sales growing 5.4 percent sequentially leading to full year results growing 7.2 percent year-over-year, adjusting for the divestiture of Vertex. Improved market conditions together with DXP’s ability to execute on key organic initiatives are delivering widespread improvements across DXP.\nI am encouraged with the current state of our company and I have never been more confident in our strategy and ability to create shareholder and stakeholder value. We are prioritizing investments and focusing on DXP having a smart recovery through this next up cycle. We are also emphasizing continuous improvement across DXP to generate margin expansion while growing the top-line.\nDXP’s fiscal 2017 sales were $1.0 billion, or a 4.6 percent increase over fiscal 2016, on a reported actual basis. Each of our business segments experienced sales growth in fiscal 2017 with Innovative Pumping Solutions growing 9.0 percent, Supply Chain Services growing 4.9 percent and Service Centers growing 3.3 percent. Fiscal 2017 sales were $641.3 million for Service Centers, $204.0 million for Innovative Pumping Solutions and $161.5 million for Supply Chain Services. DXP produced EBITDA of $61.7 million growing 11.8 percent over fiscal 2016.\nAs we look ahead, we expect accelerating organic sales growth, EBITDA margin enhancement, with strong cash flow generation and growth in earnings. Our key end markets continue to show stabilization but we will watch all our markets closely, especially given our recent experience of both oil and gas and industrial cycling down at the same time. In 2018, we will build on the momentum we have generated and remain customer-focused as we continue to create long-term value for shareholders.”\nKent Yee, CFO added, “DXP’s fiscal 2017 financial performance reflects the beginning of a positive improvement in our business. Adjusting for the divestiture of Vertex, sales and EBITDA grew 7.2 percent and 32.2 percent, respectively. Our fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share was $0.93, which also includes a $1.3 million provisional benefit related to U.S. tax reform. DXP ended the year with $25.6 million in cash on the balance sheet and net debt of $226.5 million. During the year, we successfully refinanced our credit facility with a new ABL and Term Loan B, while positioning DXP to take advantage of what we believe is building momentum in our business. DXP is in a position to invest in our business and see potential for significant value creation as we pivot our strategy to growth and continuous improvement to expand margins. DXP’s execution from our sales teams and partners is driving growth across our businesses and we look forward to a successful fiscal 2018.”\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nDXP supplements reporting of net income with non-GAAP measurements, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the unaudited GAAP measurements. Additional information regarding EBITDA and free cash flow referred to in this press release are included below under \"--Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information.\"\nThe Company believes EBITDA provides additional information about: (i) operating performance, because it assists in comparing the operating performance of the business, as it removes the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as items not directly resulting from core operations such as interest expense and income taxes and (ii) the performance and the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, EBITDA performance is a component of a measure of the Company’s financial covenants under its credit facility. Furthermore, some investors use EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry. Management believes that some investors’ understanding of performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for comparing ongoing results of operations. By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with a reconciliation from net income, the Company believes it is enhancing investors’ understanding of the business and results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well the Company is executing strategic initiatives.\nAbout DXP Enterprises, Inc.\nDXP Enterprises, Inc. is a leading products and service distributor that adds value and total cost savings solutions to industrial customers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and Dubai.
