Slate Retail REIT also announced today that the Board of Trustees have elected to suspend the REIT’s distribution reinvestment plan until further notice.\nCommencing with the March distribution to be made on April 16, 2018, unitholders who elected to participate in the DRIP will receive the declared cash distributions on the distribution payment date. The suspension of the DRIP is intended to preserve value and eliminate dilution for the REIT’s unitholders.\nHolders of Class U Units may elect to receive their distribution in Canadian dollars and should contact their broker to make such an election. If a holder of Class U Units elects to receive distributions in Canadian dollars, the holder will receive the Canadian dollar equivalent amount of the distribution being paid on the Class U Units based on the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate at the time of payment of the distribution.\nHolders of class A units of the REIT (\"Class A Units\") will receive a distribution equal to the Canadian dollar equivalent (based on the U.S./Canadian dollar exchange rate at the time of payment of the distribution) of U.S.$0.070546 per Class A Unit. Holders of class I units of the REIT (\"Class I Units\") will receive a distribution ­equal to U.S.$0.073878 per Class I Unit. Holders of units of subsidiaries of the REIT that are exchangeable into Class U Units (\"Exchangeable Units\") will receive a distribution equal to U.S.$0.07 per unit.\nDistributions on all unit classes of the REIT, and distributions on Exchangeable Units, will be payable on April 16, 2018 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2018.\nAbout Slate Retail REIT (TSX: SRT.U / SRT.UN)\nSlate Retail REIT is a real estate investment trust focused on U.S. grocery-anchored real estate.
