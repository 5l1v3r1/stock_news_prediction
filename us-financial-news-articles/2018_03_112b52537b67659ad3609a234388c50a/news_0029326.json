They remain in a critical condition in hospital.\nDhand has previously noted that polls had so far indicated that voter participation was likely to \"fall well below the Kremlin's unofficial target of 70 percent.\"\nPutin is widely expected to win the election with a strong lead ahead of the other seven candidates running, but the authorities are keen to get people out to vote to improve the semblance of legitimacy.\n\"The regime in Russia is authoritarian but it requires a certain acquiescence from the populace,\" Daragh McDowell, principal Russia Analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC on Thursday.\n\"Voter turnout can be the key way to show that people are enthusiastic about, and willing to engage with, the state,\" he said. \"If turnout numbers are continuously falling, then you have legitimacy issues.\"\nMcDowell didn't believe the spy attack in the U.K. would factor in the lead-up to the vote on Sunday, saying Putin was unlikely to mention it.\nThe Russian embassy in London issued a statement Wednesday, following May's announcement, saying, \"We consider this hostile action as totally unacceptable, unjustified and shortsighted. All the responsibility for the deterioration of the U.K.-Russia relationship lies with the current political leadership of Britain.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T12:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T12:31:59.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
