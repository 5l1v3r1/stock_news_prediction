Just this week, Alibaba announced an additional $2 billion investment in Southeast Asian online retailer Lazada.\nSpeaking to CNBC at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong , he said that the e-commerce market in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is set to take off.\n\"Now it will be interesting because the change is coming, the wave of investments at Alibaba, Tencent, is coming in a big way, could be the tech dragons waking up the hidden tigers. From here on it could reach a tipping point where you have an explosion in the e-commerce activities,\" Sathirathai said.\nVCG | Getty Images Currently, e-commerce penetration in the region is still only 2 percent, he said.\nAside from capital injection, Sathirathai said the Chinese companies are also bringing know-how such as their tech and data analytics.\nThat contribution might help with two key problems in Asia: Payments and logistics.\nThe payment mode used in Southeast Asia is still mainly cash on delivery, which is a constraint on e-commerce growth, he said. And smart logistics systems could solve problems surrounding last-mile delivery.\nBut companies would need to work with the fragmented markets in Asia first, and \"localization\" will be key to that, he added.\n\"It's going to be very different in each market. Just because you win in one market doesn't mean you can dominate another market.\"\nBut one thing is for sure, he said: The region is set to see many companies fighting for a piece of the market.\n\"Competition is going to be gruesome, consolidation is the next phase.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T10:41:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
