The company is confident that it will be able to propose opportunities to most of the affected employees through programmes which are ramping up,” it added.\nAirbus, whose main rival is Boeing, has cut production rates of the A380 - the world’s largest passenger jet - due to weak demand, and it has also faced delays and cost overruns on the A400M military plane programme.
