Rugby Union - Championship - New Zealand All Blacks vs South Africa Springboks - Auckland, New Zealand - September 16, 2017 South Africa's Uzair Cassiem runs through All Blacks defence. REUTERS/Nigel Marple Cassiem, who has been capped eight times by the Springboks, will complete the current season at the Cheetahs before moving to Scarlets ahead of the 2018-19 campaign. “The Scarlets are known throughout the world and are playing some great rugby at the moment... it was clear to see the ambitions of the club and the environment at the Scarlets is just what I am looking for,” Cassiem said in a statement. The 28-year-old is the Scarlets’ third new recruit after the signings of loose forward Blade Thomson and centre Kieron Fonotia. “He’s a dynamic player that likes to carry and has the ability to offload. He is a very physical individual,” head coach Wayne Pivac said. “He has the ability to play across the back row but has been signed primarily as an eight.” Scarlets travel to Munster for their next Pro14 game on Saturday.
