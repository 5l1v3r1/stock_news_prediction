REUTERS/Danny Moloshok The plunge in the early measure suggested total viewership for the film industry’s highest honors could come in below the 2008 record low of 32 million, and follows a rating slide in other award shows and sport events this year as viewers turn to streaming options. The live telecast attracted 18.9 percent of viewers in 56 major markets according to Nielsen’s preliminary overnight metered market household ratings, an ABC spokesman said. That compared with 22.4 percent a year ago, when the Oscars audience fell to a nine-year low of 32.9 million viewers. Hollywood trade publication Variety earlier on Monday reported the 18.9 Nielsen rating. The Nielsen data does not include viewing of the Oscars on digital and mobile platforms. Updated numbers will be released later on Monday. The Oscars, expected to rank as the most-watched non-sporting event on U.S. television this year, honored romantic fantasy“The Shape of Water” as best picture during a nearly four-hour ceremony where themes of female empowerment and activism almost overshadowed the awards.

The Grammy Awards in January attracted 26.1 million television viewers, its smallest audience since 2006. February’s Super Bowl, the most-watched telecast of the year, saw its viewership decline by 7 percent from a year earlier to 103.4 million. Sofia Carson on the red carpet.

ABC owns the broadcast rights for the Oscars through 2028. ABC sold out its ad inventory for Sunday’s Oscars broadcast and charged $2.6 million on average for a 30-second spot, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. That was a jump from the average price of $1.91 million in 2017, according to data from research firm Kantar Media, which said ABC generated $128 million from the 2017 telecast. ABC offered the live show streaming on abc.com and the ABC app via a participating cable or satellite subscription in certain markets. It was also available on live TV services that stream ABC.
