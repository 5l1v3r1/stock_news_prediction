The bank had originally aimed to raise as much as 40.17 billion rupees ($619.72 million) from the sale.\nThe ICICI Securities IPO follows the listing of ICICI Bank's life and non-life insurance arms in the past two years, and will help bolster the bank's capital base at a time when banks are seeing provisions for soured loans here rising.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, CLSA, Edelweiss, IIFL and SBI Capital Markets were the banks managing the IPO. The stock is scheduled to begin trading on April 5.
