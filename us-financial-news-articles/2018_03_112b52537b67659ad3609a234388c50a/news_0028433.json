A Shell logo is seen at a gas station in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci Shell has edged out companies such as Malaysiaâ€™s Petronas to supply LNG through a long-term contract to Hong Kong utility CLP Power, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The deal will be for about 10 years to supply about 1.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG from after 2020, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
