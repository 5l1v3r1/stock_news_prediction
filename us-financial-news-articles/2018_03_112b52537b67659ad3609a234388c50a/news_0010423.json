Admiral Scott Swift, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, speaks at a news conference near the damaged USS John McCain and the USS America at Changi Naval Base in Singapore August 22, 2017. REUTERS/Calvin Wong China on Monday unveiled an 8.1 percent rise in defence spending for 2018, fuelling an ambitious military modernisation programme and making its neighbours, particularly Japan and self-ruled Taiwan, nervous. “These investments and commitment need to be taken with full transparency,” Admiral Scott Swift said during a press roundtable in Tokyo. China’s “intent is not clearly understood”, he said. China insists its military spending is transparent and that it does not pose a threat, but is needed to update old equipment and defend its legitimate interests. China’s state media on Monday said the 2018 defence budget was proportionate and low. Chinese defence spending is only officially about one-quarter of the military spending of the United States. But many foreign analysts and diplomats say China under-reports the figure.
