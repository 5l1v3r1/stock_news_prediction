Anthology allows members to privately and anonymously review jobs and companies, and provides insights to what is out there in a discreet, confidential, and intelligent way, which is what randrr is also solving with our platform,” says randrr Founder and CEO Terry Terhark. “We couldn’t be more excited to have such a great company become a part of randrr.”\n“We’ve had the privilege to get to know Terry and his vision for randrr since early 2016.
