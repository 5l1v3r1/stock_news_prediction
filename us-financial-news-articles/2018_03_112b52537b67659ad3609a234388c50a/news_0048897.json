They treated human beings like they are garbage.”\nLate Wednesday, hours after the flames tore through the detention center of a police station, the country’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, announced the death toll and said four prosecutors had been appointed to “clarify these dramatic events.” But few details had been provided as of Thursday afternoon, and government officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nRelatives of the prisoners said their loved ones called from inside the jail, telling them that shots were being fired and then that a fire was roaring out of control. \nDaniela Ñata said her husband, Endruver Torres, phoned to say he was grazed by a bullet. Then a brother-in-law, also a prisoner, called and made a vain cry for help. “He told us in that moment, ‘Help us! Help us! They’re burning us. We are being sprayed with gasoline,’ ” she said. \nMs. Ñata, 32, a vendor, said her husband and her brother-in-law were killed. Like several other prisoners, she said she hadn’t been able to recover the bodies as of Thursday afternoon.\nA Window to Freedom, a group that monitors conditions in the country’s jails, said the trouble began when a prisoner wrested a gun from a police officer and shot him in the leg in a failed attempt to take two police officers hostage. Prisoners then set fire to mattresses, spreading smoke and flames in the confined space. Officials tried to break through and save prisoners who had been burned or were suffering from smoke inhalation.\n“The victims were all killed by asphyxia,” said Carlos Alberto Nieto, director of A Window to Freedom.\nVenezuela’s penitentiary system, where prisons are often run by the prisoners, is notoriously violent and rife with drug and gang activity.\nMore than 40,000 prisoners are crammed into facilities with a capacity for 19,000, rights groups say. Crime experts say professional kidnap and ransom teams that make Venezuela’s streets some of the world’s most dangerous are often run by gang leaders from inside the prisons. Riots, and sometimes fires, are not uncommon.\nThe situation is particularly combustible in police detention centers, which were designed for temporary housing but often hold prisoners long term. The jail in Valencia, run by the police of Carabobo state, held 200 prisoners, though it was designed for 60.\n“What happened in the Carabobo police [jail] is confirmation of what has been repeatedly denounced for four years, that there’s overcrowding in the dungeons,” said Humberto Prado, director of a prison watchdog group, the Venezuelan Prisons Observatory.\nUnder the Chavista movement that has run Venezuela for more than 19 years, officials pledged to create a modern penitentiary system. But Venezuela’s is among the continent’s most violent, a problem exacerbated by food and medicine shortages, said Mr. Prado, who said malnutrition and tuberculosis are rife behind bars. \nThirty-eight people were killed in an August 2017 riot in a prison in the state of Amazonas, with the armed forces dispatched to put down the uprising. And in 2013, shortly before Mr. Maduro took office, 61 died in a prison riot near Barquisimeto. \nIn Geneva, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights issued a statement calling on Venezuelan officials to “carry out a prompt, thorough and effective investigation to establish the cause of these deaths” and compensate the families of the victims. \nJuan Miguel Matheus, a congressman from Carabobo state, said the opposition National Assembly would name a commission to investigate what had happened. He said it has been hard to get information from the families of the victims, partly because they are afraid of retribution from Mr. Maduro’s authoritarian government. \n“This is evidence of the crisis in the jail system and in the system of justice,” Mr. Matheus said.\nMeanwhile, relatives of the victims, like Leno Lefit, 19, whose brother died in the fire, lamented that his family hadn’t been able to recover the body or get a response from authorities.\n“I feel horrible,” he said. “He was my brother, we were inseparable and my mother doesn’t know anything.”\n—Tibisay Romero in Valencia, Maolis Castro in Caracas and Juan Forero in Bogotá contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T02:59:44.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
