Europe could also file an eventual complaint before the World Trade Organization, Moscovici said.\n“We must accept that the world becomes a place of each man for himself,” the commissioner said.\nThe U.S. leader’s proposal for a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum has rattled global markets as well as prominent congressional Republicans and business leaders worried about the potential economic fallout.\nMoscovici said some of the goods under consideration for an EU riposte were largely produced in constituencies held by Trump’s Republican party.\n“We want Congress to understand that this would be a lose-lose situation,” he said.
