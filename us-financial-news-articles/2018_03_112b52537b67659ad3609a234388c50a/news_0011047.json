Trading in depositary receipts rather than the underlying shares reduces administration and transaction costs, both for companies and for investors.\nThese receipts represent ownership of a set number of company shares that can be listed and traded independently from the underlying stocks, and are often used by emerging market companies to raise capital in places like the United States and London.\nThe CSRC plan, if implemented, could give Chinese investors access to leading overseas-listed local technology companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Baidu Inc , JD.com Inc, and Tencent Holdings Ltd.\nAll these firms preferred to list overseas due to Beijing’s strict rules on their track record of profits, as well as because of the lengthy time taken to clear the IPO applications in the world’s second-largest economy.\nCSRC could not be immediately reached for comment outside of business hours. Financial magazine Caixin first reported the planned CDR move on Monday.\nBaidu declined to comment, while Alibaba, JD.com and Tencent did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
