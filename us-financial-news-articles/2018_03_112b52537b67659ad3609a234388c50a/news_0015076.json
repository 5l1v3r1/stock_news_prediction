Both sources didn’t rule out the company could try to list in the future and a third source added that the IPO might be delayed to 2019.\nThe company is majority-owned by Italy’s state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) CDP.UL and China’s Shanghai Electric Group ( 601727.SS ) holds a 40 percent stake.\nLast month Ansaldo Energia’s Chief executive resigned and was replaced by its chairman Giuseppe Zampini. The CEO of CDP Equity, a unit of CDP, Guido Rivolta was appointed new chairman.\nCDP declined to comment.\nReporting by Elisa Anzolin and Massimiliano Di Giorgio,; writing by Giulio Piovaccari\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:56:18.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
