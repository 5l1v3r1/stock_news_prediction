The review will include an assessment of its majority stake in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare ( GLSM.NS ).\n“The decision not to pay up for Pfizer’s consumer assets will have led GSK CEO Emma Walmsley to remove uncertainty by bringing all the consumer revenues in-house and assisting toward efficient capital allocation,” said Ketan Patel, co-manager of the Amity UK Fund at EdenTree Investment Management, who holds GSK shares.\n“Long-term investors will welcome the greater clarity this brings to both companies.”\nGSK said that the purchase would boost adjusted earnings and cash flows.\nPfizer has been struggling to sell its consumer healthcare business after GSK and Reckitt Benckiser ( RB.L ) both dropped out of the bidding, while differences in price expectations have also hobbled German drugmaker Merck KGaA’s ( MRCG.DE ) attempts to sell its consumer products unit.\nAnd GSK’s call for bids for its consumer healthcare nutrition brands - with a regional focus on India - could detract attention from Merck’s asset, which relies heavily on sales of vitamins and dietary supplements in emerging markets.\nSlideshow (2 Images) NOVARTIS SHARES RISE Barclays analysts said Glaxo was paying less than 17 times expected 2018 core earnings for the joint venture stake, while sources have told Reuters that both Merck and Pfizer had asked for up to 20 times for their respective assets.\nYet analysts at Baader Helvea welcomed the cash price fetched by Novartis as “excellent news” for the Swiss company, whose shares opened 1.9 percent higher.\nDeutsche Bank analysts said the move decluttered Novartis’s portfolio, but cautioned that the Swiss group was being too vague about what it would do with the cash.\n“The time is right for Novartis to divest a non-core asset at an attractive price,” Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said.\nNovartis said the money would be used by Novartis to expand its business organically as well as for bolt-on acquisitions.\nIn an interview before the deal was announced, Narasimhan ruled out large acquisitions by the Basel-based company.\n“We want to focus our M&A efforts on bolt on acquisitions that have either new technologies or products that fit into our core therapeutic areas,” he told CNBC in an interview recorded on Sunday.\nFor Narasimhan, a Harvard trained medical doctor, the disposal is among his first moves as CEO, a role he took on less than two months ago when he replaced Joe Jimenez.\nHe is now emphasizing the use of technology to boost returns on research investment but Novartis is currently also reviewing its Alcon eye care unit for a possible spinoff to shareholders, which could come in early 2019.\nUnder the 2014 deal to pool their consumer assets, Novartis had the right so sell its 36.5 percent stake to Glaxo from this month. The transaction is set to complete in the second quarter, subject to necessary approvals.\nRelated Coverage GSK says very confident about consumer margin goal of at least 20 percent ($1 = 0.7029 pounds)\nadditional reporting by Simon Jessop in London, Michael Shields in Zurich; editing by Alexander Smith and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T08:29:48.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
