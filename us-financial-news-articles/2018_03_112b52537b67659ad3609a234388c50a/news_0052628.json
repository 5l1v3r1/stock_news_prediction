The Company commercializes its products via its own salesforce in Canada, and through a global network of licensed distributors in the U.S. and other territories.\nAcerus currently has three marketed products: ESTRACE ® , a product for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms, is commercialized in Canada; NATESTO ® , the first and only testosterone nasal gel for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males diagnosed with hypogonadism, is commercialized in Canada and the U.S.; and URIVARX ® , a Natural Health Product that helps reduce symptoms of hyperactive bladder such as daytime urinary frequency, urgency and nocturia. URIVARX ® was recently approved by Health Canada and will be offered over-the-counter to Canadians dealing with such symptoms. Also, NATESTO ® has been licensed for distribution in 29 additional countries worldwide. Marketing approvals in jurisdictions outside of North America are expected to take place over the course of the coming years. Acerus’ pipeline includes four innovative products: ELEGANT TM Vaginal Moisturizer, which provides comfort to women suffering from vaginal dryness, and ELEGANT TM pH, which is a pH balanced vaginal product; GYNOFLOR™, an ultra-low dose vaginal estrogen combined with a probiotic, for which a NDS has been filed in Canada for the treatment of vaginal atrophy, restoration of vaginal flora and treatment of certain vaginal infections; and TEFINA™, a clinical stage product aimed at addressing a significant unmet need for women with female sexual dysfunction.
