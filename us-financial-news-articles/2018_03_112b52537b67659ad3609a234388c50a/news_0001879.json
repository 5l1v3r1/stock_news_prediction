The $27.84 million payment represents a little over one day of profit for the Atlanta-based retailer.\n“We’re pleased to have settled this and we remain committed to the responsible disposal of waste,” Home Depot said in a statement. “We’ll continue to work with California officials to that end.” (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T03:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T21:33:51.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
