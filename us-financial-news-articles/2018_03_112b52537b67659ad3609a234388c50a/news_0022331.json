Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a rate of 85.2 percent.\nThe construction rate rose to 91.0 percent from 89.5 percent in the third quarter on general strength in the sector while oil and gas extraction increased to 83.0 percent from 81.5 percent on higher volumes of oil.\nCapacity in the manufacturing sector rose to 86.1 percent, the highest for 17 years. Motor vehicle production recovered after a weak third quarter that included longer than usual maintenance shutdowns in assembly plants.\nFor 2017 as a whole the average capacity utilization rate for Canadian industries rose by 4.4 percentage points to 84.6 percent on stronger oil and gas extraction after slipping 0.3 percentage points in 2016.\nReporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T21:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:08:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
