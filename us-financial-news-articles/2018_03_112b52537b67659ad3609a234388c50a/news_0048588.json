The incident has focused new attention on the lack of clear safety standards for such vehicles.\nDucey called the crash \"an unquestionable failure.\"\n\"In the best interests of the people of my state, I have directed the Arizona Department of Transportation to suspend Uber's ability to test and operate autonomous vehicles on Arizona's public roadways,\" Ducey said.\nThe letter strikes a dramatically different tone from late 2016, when Ducey invited Uber to his state with celebration, saying \"Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads.\" At the time, a banner was hung on a building in Phoenix welcoming Uber.\nUber moved its driverless cars to Arizona from San Francisco after California regulators shut down the self-driving fleet for not having the proper permits.\nUber, which had already pulled its self-driving cars off the road after the accident, said in a statement on Monday that it will \"keep a dialogue open with the Governor's office to address any concerns they have.\"\n(Reporting by David Schwartz; Writing by Heather Somerville; Editing by Sandra Maler and Michael Perry)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T23:21:47.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
