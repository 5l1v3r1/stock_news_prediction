GTL also acquired Nashville-based IDS in January 2017, which added education professionals and content to help prepare inmates for re-entry and reduce recidivism.\n\"I am excited to be joining GTL and leading the company during a period of tremendous opportunity,\" said Alderson. \"GTL's products play a critical role in facilitating inmates' connection to friends and family. I am excited about the opportunity for GTL products to continue to enhance communication, increase facility safety, and provide education opportunities to inmates. We will work to deliver these benefits to our corrections customers, while also improving the rehabilitation and re-entry of those who are incarcerated.\"\nAbout GTL\nGTL leads the fields of correctional technology, education, and government payment services with visionary solutions and customized products that integrate seamlessly to deliver security, financial value, and operational efficiencies while aiding inmate rehabilitation and reducing recidivism rates.
