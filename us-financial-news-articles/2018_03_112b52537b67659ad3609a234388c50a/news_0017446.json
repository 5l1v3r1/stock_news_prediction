Its service offerings include technical and administrative support, communications and outreach, information technology, strategic planning and evaluation, and organization change and performance management. With nearly 150 employees, Montero Williams International immediately becomes one of the largest African American-owned firms in New England, with growth aspirations—including additional acquisitions alongside organic growth—on the horizon.\n\"Growing our organization and our capacity to provide a broader range of management and technology solutions was a strategic priority for us,\" Montero Williams CEO Alan Williams said. \"To that end, we identified precisely the right growth opportunity in acquiring BCS, Incorporated and chose this moment to rebrand ourselves and prepare for future growth.\"\nWilliams, formerly Syncom Group's founder and managing director, has a long track record of successfully guiding and advising private, public, and multilateral organizations. He has nearly 25 years of experience in management consulting, having served in an executive capacity at Accenture prior to founding Syncom. He has a bachelor's degree from Harvard University, Master of Science degrees in both management and real estate development from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is completing his doctorate degree in organization change and leadership at the University of Southern California. In addition, Williams has studied at the American University in Cairo and is a Fellow of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.\n\"Looking ahead, our goals are continued excellence and service to customers and smart, strategic growth together,\" Williams continued. \"Aligning these two firms and building upon their successes will create a company that expands both the client base and types of projects the firm can pursue—and brings new opportunities to our teams, for which I am very pleased.\"\nTo learn more, visit www.monterowilliams.com .\nContact: Morgan Evans\n410-997-7778, x252\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montero-williams-international-formed-via-merger-between-syncom-group-and-bcs-incorporated-300608066.html\nSOURCE BCS, Incorporated", "external_links": ["http://www.monterowilliams.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montero-williams-international-formed-via-merger-between-syncom-group-and-bcs-incorporated-300608066.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T19:09:17.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
