Reinhart got his stick on Rasmus Ristolainen’s point blast, and Toronto goalie Frederik Andersen had no chance.\nPominville made it 2-0 at 3:43 with his 11th goal off another deflection. Ristolainen ripped a slapper from the left point and Pominville got position in the high slot. His tip struck Nazem Kadri’s skate and slipped by Andersen.\nLeo Komarov brought the Maple Leafs even with an unexpected display of offense. After going 13 games without a goal, the one-time All-Star bagged two goals in an 11-minute span bridging the periods.\nKomarov pounced on the rebound of William Nylander’s shot during a power play and roofed a wrister over the stick side of Johnson at 19:52 of the first period to make it 2-1. Komarov then finished a pretty 3-on-2 rush by cashing in Matt Martin’s feed for his seventh goal at 10:49 of the second period.\nBut Buffalo regained the lead for good at 13:30 on Zemgus Girgensons’ seventh goal. Reinhart tried a centering pass for Marco Scandella at the left post, but the puck hit Girgensons’ skate, caroming off the post and into the net.\nAnother fortuitous bounce set up O’Reilly’s 19th goal at 15:35. Ron Hainsey’s clearing attempt around the net hit referee Kendrick Nicholson and bounced to O’Reilly in the right circle. He wired a wrister by Andersen.\nLarsson made it 5-2 at 9:55 of the third period with his fourth goal, while the Maple Leafs’ Mitchell Marner bagged his 18th at 17:57.\nAndersen stopped 19 shots in Toronto’s fourth straight defeat.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:11:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
