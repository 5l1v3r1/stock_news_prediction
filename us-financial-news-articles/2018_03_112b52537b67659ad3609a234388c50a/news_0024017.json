This dividend is designated an \"eligible dividend\" for Canadian income tax purposes. For non-resident shareholders, Pembina's common share dividends should be considered \"qualified dividends\" and may be subject to Canadian withholding tax.\nFor shareholders receiving their common share dividends in U.S. funds, the March 2018 cash dividend is expected to be approximately U.S. $0.1392 per share (before deduction of any applicable Canadian withholding tax) based on a currency exchange rate of 0.7736. The actual U.S. dollar dividend will depend on the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate on the payment date and will be subject to applicable withholding taxes.\nPembina pays cash dividends on its common shares in Canadian dollars on a monthly basis to shareholders of record on the 25th calendar day of each month (except for the December record date, which is December 31st), if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors. Should the record date fall on a weekend or a statutory holiday, the effective record date will be the previous business day. The dividend payment date is the 15th of the month following the record date. Should the payment date fall on a weekend or on a holiday the business day prior to the weekend or holiday becomes the payment date.\nClosing of Term Loan and Credit Facility Extension\nPembina has closed its previously announced $1 billion non-revolving term loan (\"Term Loan\") with certain existing lenders. The Term Loan will be used to partially repay existing amounts drawn under Pembina's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, thereby providing additional liquidity, flexibility and interest cost savings. The Term Loan will have an initial term of three years and is pre-payable at the Company's option. The other terms and conditions of the Term Loan, including financial covenants, are substantially similar to Pembina's $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. Concurrently, Pembina also completed an extension of its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which now matures May 31, 2023.\nAbout Pembina\nCalgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corporation is a leading transportation and midstream service provider that has been serving North America's energy industry for over 60 years.
