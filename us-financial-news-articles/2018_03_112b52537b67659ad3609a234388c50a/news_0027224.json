The company, which is based in Singapore but majority-owned by Bank of China, reported a record net profit of $587 million for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, up from $418 million a year ago, as it grew its fleet. The result was 13 percent higher than the average estimate of $519.5 million of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BOC Aviation in January had said its earnings would benefit by $88 million to $93 million due to U.S. tax cuts.
