That would in effect allow him to stay in his post indefinitely.\nDelegates and visitors entering the Great Hall of the People, the venue for the parliament, the National People’s Congress, have to go through facial scanners. The same happened to those attending the related advisory body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\n“This year, security at the two sessions has some freshly-baked ‘black tech’ coming online,” wrote the state-run Science and Technology Daily newspaper, using a comic-book term in China for futuristic surveillance gadgets.\nThe paper said cameras at the event had been upgraded to capture, analyse and compare suspicious faces in around two seconds, powered by a system called “Skynet” - which has a national database of blacklisted individuals.\n“The plot of sci-fi film ‘Minority Report’ is now basically becoming a part of daily life,” the newspaper added, referring to the Tom Cruise movie set in a futuristic society where crimes are solved and punished before they even happen.\nROBOTS AND DRONES China has been deploying a growing arsenal of security technology, fuelling the growth of a domestic industry and worrying civil rights defenders about the growing intrusion on individual privacy.\nA key concern is that blacklists could include a wide range of people stretching from lawyers and artists to political dissidents, charity workers, journalists and rights activists.\nThe new technologies range from police robots for crowd control, to drones to monitor border areas, and artificially intelligent systems to track and censor behaviour online. There are also scanners to forcibly read mobile phone data and even police dogs with virtual reality cameras.\nA recent Human Rights Watch report said China was also expanding a biometric voice database to boost voice recognition capabilities.\nSurveillance measures long-used in restive areas such as Xinjiang in the northwest are also being rolled out more widely around the country, with a planned drive to centralize and standardize powerful but fragmented systems over the next year.\nAt the meeting of the NPC, most delegates said the increasing use of technology to improve state security was a positive, and that the benefits far outweighed privacy concerns.\n“This is a good thing, it means our technology is really leading the world,” said Lu Yaping, a delegate from Jiangsu province in eastern China. “I don’t have any concerns about safety.” (Reporting by Pei Li and Cate Cadell in BEIJING Additional reporting by Thomas Sun Writing by Adam Jourdan Editing by Martin Howell)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T13:06:37.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
