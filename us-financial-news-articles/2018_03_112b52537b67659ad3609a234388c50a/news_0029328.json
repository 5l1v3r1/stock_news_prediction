We start with American-made steel sheet and coil and aluminum sheet, coil and ingot and make a world-class product. We compete around the world. Unfortunately, the president has picked the wrong target for his tariffs. Steel and aluminum prices are already at all-time highs. Instead of increasing demand for domestic steel and aluminum, the tariffs will ultimately decrease demand. This is a simple economic law: Prices go up and demand goes down. The real target, if the president wants to help the domestic steel and aluminum companies, should be to consider putting tariffs on foreign fabricated and cast parts rather than on raw materials.\nWhat President Trump has done is make American manufacturers that use American-made steel and aluminum sheet or ingot noncompetitive in the world marketplace. We have eight domestic competitors that import fabricated parts and assemble them here. American steel and aluminum companies won’t benefit from the tariffs and will only put their customers out of business. This happened in 2004 when steel prices doubled, and it will happen again. Tariffs on foreign parts would give assembly shops the incentive to become real manufacturers and increase employment in manufacturing. American steel and aluminum companies would see an increase in volume, not a potential decrease due to higher prices.\nHarry Graves\nPresident\nAmerican Coolair Corporation\nJacksonville, Fla.\nAll that President Trump wants to do is reset our trading priorities, a brief pause you might say, to let these industries retool so that they can be competitive again. Your editorial sounds like the sky is falling and the trade war has begun. It’s time for you to relax a bit and allow President Trump’s shot across the bow to sink in with our trading partners as they realize there is a new sheriff in town who is not a pushover. Maybe if some of our previous presidents stood up for our core industries, they would not have been decimated over the past 30-plus years.\nA. Guy Hubschman\nAndover, Mass.\nYour editorial “ How a Trade War Escalates ” (March 8) describes how the EU-proposed tariffs on certain U.S. items are “politically shrewd in targeting exports from states represented by Republicans on Capitol Hill. The point is to punish voters in states Mr. Trump carried in 2016 and Republicans running for re-election this year.”\nThat certainly sounds like a foreign-government entity interfering in our elections. Should this interference really be cheered on at the same time millions of dollars are being spent by a special counsel investigating foreign-government interference in our elections? Is interference OK as long if it is aimed at a target which is not a media favorite?\nLarry Stewart\nPonte Vedra Beach, Fla.\nRegarding your editorial “ Professor Ross’s Soup-Can Economics ” (March 6): Perhaps the Trump administration might review the effects of the well-chronicled tariffs on sugar. The cost of the raw material increased, causing candy manufacturers to move across the lakes to Canada. The net result was six jobs lost for every one gained, along with capital moved abroad.\nMark Munday\nKnoxville, Tenn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T17:49:19.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
