The company said Kawasaki would quit on April 1.\nThe U.S. lawsuit, filed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco, was brought by two California residents who seek to represent a nationwide class of consumers who bought allegedly defective Toyota vehicles.\nAccording to the complaint, Toyota's Prius, Camry, Land Cruiser and Lexus vehicles have all been manufactured with \"sub-standard\" steel, aluminum and copper.\nThe plaintiffs allege that Toyota and Kobe Steel both violated federal and state consumer protection laws by claiming that the vehicles complied with U.S. quality standards.\n\"We have not grasped the whole content of the case and we are now looking into the matter,\" a Kobe Steel spokesman said on Wednesday.\nToyota declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nIn a special order in November, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked 29 automakers, including Toyota, to disclose any safety issues for any of their vehicles or engines containing products supplied by Kobe Steel.\nThe regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what data it had received in response and whether there was any evidence of faulty materials in Toyota cars.\nMonday's 40-page lawsuit outlines the ways in which the companies allegedly concealed poor metal quality. It demands compensatory and punitive damages of an unspecified amount.\nAccording to the complaint, at least six Toyota car models sold or leased to U.S. consumers were manufactured with substandard metal from Kobe Steel. Plaintiffs said the metal could impact vehicle safety and performance.\nToyota had the duty to disclose any defective vehicle components because it has consistently marketed its automobiles as safe, functional and reliable, the lawsuit says.\nKobe and Toyota had superior knowledge and access to the facts, the lawsuit alleged, giving rise to fraud by concealment claims.\nFour individuals in Canada who bought cars that use Kobe's products have already brought class-action lawsuits seeking unspecified damages against Kobe and it subsidiaries.\nKobe is also undergoing a separate U.S. Justice Department probe.\nA company executive said on Tuesday that it is fully cooperating with the U.S. probe, but it was hard to predict how it would develop.
