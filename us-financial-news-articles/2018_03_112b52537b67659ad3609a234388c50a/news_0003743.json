By comparison, Apple Music, which was launched in 2015, has 36 million paying subscribers.\nSpotify's premium subscription costs $9.99 a month. Apple Music too charges the same but offers a three-month free trial to its users. Unlike Spotify, Apple does not have an advertising-based free service.\n\"With our ad-supported service, we believe there is a large opportunity to grow users and gain market share from traditional terrestrial radio,\" Spotify said.\nThe company is seeking to list its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"SPOT.\" http://bit.ly/2F0OfCU \nRevenue for Spotify, which is present in more than 60 countries, came in at 4.09 billion euros ($4.99 billion) in 2017, compared with 2.95 billion euros, a year earlier.\nIts operating loss widened to 378 million euros from 349 million euros a year earlier.
