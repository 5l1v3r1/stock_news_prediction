Praluent has faced the same issues.\nRegeneron and Sanofi shared the Odyssey results with ICER, an independent organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines, to seek its view based on the new findings.\nICER’s updated report issued on Saturday found that for higher-risk patients $4,500 to $8,000 was an appropriate annual Praluent price based on the value of the benefits those patients receive. But for the larger at-risk population with LDL below 100 the cost should be $2,300 to $3,400, it said.\nA similar Repatha study in a slightly different patient population showed an identical 15 percent overall risk reduction but no death benefit.\nLONGER TRIAL That trial, carried out over two years, showed a more pronounced risk reduction in the second year, leading some cardiologists to suggest a longer trial would have spawned better results. Odyssey followed patients on average for 3.3 years and the risk reduction versus placebo was greater over time.\nArtery clogging that leads to heart disease problems develops over decades, noted study co-chairman Dr. Gregory Schwartz.\n“It may be unrealistic to think it can be modified on the timeframe of a usual clinical trial. It may take years and years to really reap all the benefits that one can achieve,” Schwartz said.\nWith an LDL target range of 25-50, rather than taking it as low as possible, three-quarters of patients were on a lower dose of Praluent and some were taken off the drug if their LDL remained at 15 or lower. It is unclear if benefits would have been more pronounced had more patients received the higher dose.\nThe drug was deemed extremely safe with no difference from placebo in incidence of neurocognitive problems or new-onset diabetes.
