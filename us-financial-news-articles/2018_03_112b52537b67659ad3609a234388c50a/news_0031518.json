By a 2-1 vote, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it found merit in several objections to the rule that were raised by business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and declared the rule void “in toto.” Last year, after Donald Trump became U.S. president, the Labor Department delayed the scheduled implementation of some provisions of the rule to July 2019.
