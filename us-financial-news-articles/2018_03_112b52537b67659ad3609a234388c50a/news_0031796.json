(NYSE: AI) (the \"Company\") its Board of Directors authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend will be payable on April 30, 2018 to common shareholders of record on March 29, 2018. This dividend is consistent with the Company's variable dividend policy pursuant to which the Board of Directors evaluates dividends on a quarterly basis and, in its sole discretion, may approve the payment of dividends.\nThe tax characterization to shareholders of the distribution will be determined after the end of the calendar year and will be reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV. To the extent the Company has current or accumulated earnings and profits for the year, distributions would be reported as dividends. Because the Company is taxed as a C-corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, any dividends would be qualified dividends eligible for the reduced capital gains rates. Any distributions in excess of earnings and profits for the year would be classified as nontaxable returns of capital to the extent they do not exceed a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock, or as a capital gain to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock.\nAbout the Company\nArlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE: AI) is a principal investment firm that currently invests primarily in mortgage-related and other assets. The Company is headquartered in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
