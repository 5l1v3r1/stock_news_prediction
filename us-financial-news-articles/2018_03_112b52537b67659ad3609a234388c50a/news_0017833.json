Across the world last year, it repeated 2016’s record output of 165 billion cubic meters (bcm) of oil equivalent (boe).\nWintershall expects significant rises in sales and earnings before special items in 2018, after increasing both steeply in 2017, thanks to higher volumes and higher commodity prices.\nOil prices last year increased 23 percent to $54 per barrel on average for North Sea grade Brent. Wintershall’s internal company planning is based on an average price of $65 this year and an exchange rate of $1.2 per euro.\nIt also sees gas prices remaining at current levels in north-western Europe in 2018, after spot gas at European trading hubs rose 24 percent last year.\nThe merger with DEA, which BASF said last week would likely close by the end of the third quarter, will bring synergies in German and Norwegian oil and gas ventures where the two operate separately, and in administration costs, Mehren said.\nThis would likely affect the two headquarters at Kassel and Hamburg, Mehren said, mentioning that Frankfurt, Germany’s business capital, could become an option for moving certain operations.\nThe merger will be followed by an initial public offering of the merged entity, which BASF said it did not expect to happen before 2020.\nReporting by Vera Eckert; Editing by Ludwig Burger and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T21:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:02:45.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
