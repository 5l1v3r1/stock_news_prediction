U.S. technology firms, from \nIntel Corp. \nto Apple, depend on China operations for a big chunk of their profits earned by working in China and selling there. \nThe administration has said that change in China happens too slowly, resulting in a $375 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China. Many in U.S. industry agree with the administration that Beijing uses its enormous market to force companies to improperly transfer technology and submit to other discriminatory practices. But they want the administration to take a less confrontational approach. \nThe administration is also considering bringing a case before the World Trade Organization alleging that China is violating trade rules, which would be a way to try to build a coalition of nations. But it is unclear whether that will proceed; a case would be overshadowed by any move to levy tariffs before getting WTO approval. \nCountries bring cases to the WTO in Geneva for adjudication. If a country wins a claim, it is authorized to assess tariffs, unless the losing nation changes its offending practices. \nSuch actions take years to complete, and the Trump administration is looking for faster action. \nThe move against China comes on the heels of a White House decision to assess tariffs of 25% on steel products and 10% on aluminum, citing national-security concerns. Industry groups also had urged the administration to take a multilateral approach in that case and to form a coalition to press China to cut its excess metals capacity, which is widely seen as the source of a global glut. Instead, the U.S. chose tariffs. \nMr. Garfield, though, said he saw hopeful signs in the way the administration handled the metal cases. Initially, the administration said it would apply tariffs across the board to all nations. Now it has carved out exceptions for Mexico and Canada and is considering them for other nations. It also has set up a formal process for companies to win exclusions for their products. \nThe group wants the administration to set up a similar process before assessing any tariffs, as a way to guard against potential economic harm. Tariffs on information and communications technology products would lower overall U.S. productivity growth, said a report on Friday by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research group in Washington, D.C., that takes a hard line on China. \n“Let’s create a process where the administration shares their thinking and allows people to comment,” Mr. Garfield said. \nWrite to Bob Davis at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T02:24:43.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
