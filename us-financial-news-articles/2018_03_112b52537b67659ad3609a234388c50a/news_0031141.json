A spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol said there are an unknown number of fatalities.\n“We are in full search-and-rescue mode,” Maurice Kemp, deputy mayor of Miami-Dade County, said at a press conference. Mr. Kemp said authorities had dogs searching the site, four cranes and urban search-and-rescue specialists scouring the rubble.\nThe $14.2 million bridge crossed Miami’s Southwest Eighth Street, connecting FIU’s campus to the town of Sweetwater. Its main span—174 feet long, and weighing 950 tons—was just put in place on Saturday and was expected to be opened for foot traffic next year.\nLocation of\ncollapsed\nbridge\nSweetwater\n8th St.\nRonald\nReagan\nTurnpike\nFlorida International\nUniversity\n95\nMIAMI-DADE CO.\nThe\nEverglades\nMiami\nUniversity Park\n874\nFLA.\n5 miles\n5 km\nDetail\n﻿\nSteven Ippoliti, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Miami, was on his way to work when he saw the bridge suddenly collapse. “I was just kind of like in shock,” he said in a phone interview. “I was like, ‘Did that really happen?’ ”\nMr. Ippoliti said he was driving toward the bridge when he saw it go down, the north side collapsing before the south side. “It was there one second and the next it was down on the road, with dust flying,” he said. “It was just so quick and unexpected.”\nThe National Transportation Safety Board Chairman said it would send a team to investigate the collapse. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said in a Twitter post that he was staying in “constant contact with law enforcement” and that he planned to visit the university Thursday evening to be briefed by authorities.\nBuilt as part of a $19.4 million federal transportation grant, the pedestrian bridge was celebrated Saturday as its main span was lifted from temporary supports and rotated 90 degrees across an eight-lane road that is known as Tamiami Trail.\nIn a March 10 Twitter post about the “first-of-its-kind pedestrian bridge,” the university Quote: d President Mark B. Rosenberg as saying “FIU is about building bridges and student safety. This project accomplishes our mission beautifully.”\nBridge Building The firms involved in the construction and design, FIGG Engineering and Munilla Construction Management, released statements saying they would cooperate with the investigations.\n“In our 40-year history, nothing like this has ever happened before,” Tallahassee-based designer FIGG said in a statement. The firm has designed bridges nationwide, including the Seven Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys and the Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay.\nMunilla Construction Management, a family owned construction company that built the bridge, said it would conduct “a full investigation to determine exactly what went wrong.”\nThe bridge used a construction technique called “accelerated bridge construction,” according to the university. The school has conducted research and symposiums on the technique, which professors have said is meant to reduce traffic congestion and improve bridge safety in cities.\nThe Federal Highway Administration has said that accelerated bridge construction techniques have improved motorist and worker safety, by shortening construction time to as little as 48 hours. About 44% of bridge construction worker injuries involve a vehicle in the work zone and the majority of those crashes are fatal, according to the agency.\nWrite to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com , Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvZVuN-CHnE?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0"], "published": "2018-03-16T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:16:37.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
