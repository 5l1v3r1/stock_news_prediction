Critics have said the vote appeared reminiscent of the same kind of elections that kept autocrats in power for decades before the Arab Spring of 2011. \nThe incumbent secured almost 92 percent of the 25 million votes counted so far, according to state-run daily newspaper al-Ahram. Voter turnout \nIn becoming Egypt's first democratically-elected president in 2013, al-Sisi won 97 percent of the vote — but with a modest turnout of less than 50 percent. \nThis time around, the former U.S.-allied military commander was thought to be desperate to ensure a higher attendance at the polls in order to press ahead with his plans to combat militants and push through stringent economic reforms . \nHowever, after three days of voting, the overall turnout was projected to be less than 40 percent, Reuters reported, citing two unnamed sources. CNBC has not been able to independently verify these sources. Who's the sole challenger? \nAt the start of the year, all of al-Sisi's credible political opponents withdrew from the race citing a targeted strategy of intimidation by authorities . Egypt's president has denied any wrongdoing. \nAs a result of the flurry of withdrawals at the start of the year, al-Sisi's only remaining challenger was Moussa Mustafa Moussa. The little-known lawmaker had consistently endorsed al-Sisi until a last-minute decision to enter the race. Moussa reportedly even helped organize events in order to ensure the incumbent could stand for a second term. \nDetractors have accused Moussa of being a stooge candidate, though he has insisted his campaign to become Egypt's leader is genuine. Why does this matter? \nUnder nearly every dictator, everyday life for Egyptian citizens has deteriorated since 2011 . The cost of day-to-day living has increased, inflation has significantly reduced the value of salaries, liberties have been curtailed and an uptick in terrorist activity has caused greater insecurity. Human rights groups say al-Sisi has overseen an unprecedented crackdown on dissent which has resulted in the detention of tens of thousands of people.

In November, an assault on a mosque killed more than 300 people — thought to be the worst attack in Egypt's modern history.
