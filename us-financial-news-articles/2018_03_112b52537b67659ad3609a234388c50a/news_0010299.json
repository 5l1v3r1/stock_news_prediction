Slideshow (3 Images) Bismillah Tabaan, the police commander of the city’s ninth district, where Friday’s explosion took place, said a suicide bombing was the cause of blast, but the intended target was not clear. Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish said the cause of the explosion was a car bomb in the city’s Qabl Bai area. One person had been killed and 14 bystanders wounded, he added, with all the casualties civilians. Much of the center of Kabul is already a zone of concrete blast walls, razor wire and police checkpoints but security has been tightened even further in the wake of the Jan. 27 ambulance attack and another attack on the city’s Intercontinental Hotel earlier in the month.
