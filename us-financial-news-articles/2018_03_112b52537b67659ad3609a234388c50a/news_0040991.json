I will need to switch to use domestic peanuts from pistachios in my meals,\" said another user.\nChinese imports of fresh fruit and nuts have surged in recent years thanks to the country's rapidly growing middle class, which has given rise to a new generation of consumers willing to splurge on healthy food.\nIn a demonstration of their buying power, Chinese shopping portal JD.com sold 57 million cherries to Chinese consumers in one day during a shopping event in June last year.\nThese fruits and nuts are part of a list of 128 U.S. products that could be hit with tariffs if the two countries fail to agree on trade issues, China's Ministry of Commerce said.\nThe two countries have, however, said they are in talks. The Trump administration says it wants to impose the tariffs in response to China's \"economic aggression\".\nStill, not all Chinese consumers viewed negatively the potential higher duties on U.S. fruit and nuts. Some said they could find alternatives from Australia and Europe, with at least one saying the tariffs could be good for China's own growers.\n\"These products all have domestic equivalents,\" said the commentator on Weibo. \"This could lift demand!\"\n(Reporting by Brenda Goh and SHANGHAI Newsroom; Additional reporting by Meng Meng in BEIJING; Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T16:20:15.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
