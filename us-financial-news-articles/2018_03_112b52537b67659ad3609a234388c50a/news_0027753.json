PAUL, Minn., March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Image Sensing Systems, Inc. (“ISS”) (NASDAQ:ISNS) today announced that Richard Ehrich has resigned as its Chief Financial Officer. The Board of Directors has appointed Todd Slawson as Interim Chief Financial Officer.\n“I’d like to thank Rich for his many contributions to Image Sensing Systems,” said Andrew Berger, ISS Executive Chairman. “Rich originally expressed a desire to resign following his relocation to Colorado Springs, Colorado with his family. We were able to convince him to stay onboard, as we knew he would be influential in instituting changes needed at the Company, including rightsizing certain fixed costs and transitioning the Company to a new auditor. In addition, Rich helped to implement an increase in financial discipline at the Company, allowing Image Sensing to once again be a profitable company. With Rich’s assistance, we have realized a number of significant objectives, including the conclusion of the arbitration with Econolite, and we wish Rich the best in his future ventures,” concluded Mr. Berger.\nMr. Slawson has most recently served as Director of Finance and Corporate Controller at ISS. Prior to joining the ISS team, he held various positions at KPMG LLP where he principally focused on technology-based companies. Mr. Slawson holds a Bachelor of Arts degree with a concentration in Corporate Finance and Accounting from Minnesota State University, Mankato. He is also a licensed CPA in Minnesota.\n“I'm enthusiastic and honored to have the opportunity to work with the Board of Directors and ISS leadership to continue the Company's drive of sustainable revenue growth, earnings acceleration and returns on invested capital. The Company has built good momentum in the past year, and I look forward to continuing that success,\" said Todd Slawson.\nAbout Image Sensing Systems\nImage Sensing Systems, Inc. is a global company dedicated to helping improve safety and efficiency for cities and highways by developing and delivering above-ground detection technology, applications and solutions.
