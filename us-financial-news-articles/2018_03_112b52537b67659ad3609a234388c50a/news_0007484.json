Picture taken May 3, 2017. REUTERS/Ernest Scheyder Oil production growth from the United States, Brazil, Canada and Norway will more than meet global oil demand growth through 2020, the IEA said, adding that more investment would be needed to boost output after that.\nNon-OPEC production is set to rise by 5.2 million bpd by 2023 to 63.3 million bpd with the United States alone accounting for nearly 60 percent of global supply growth.\nProduction in 2017 rose by 670,000 bpd as drillers added 200 rigs,“beating all expectations”, the IEA said.\nOPEC STRUGGLES Output from OPEC producers will grow at a much slower pace, the IEA said, adding it expected Venezuelan production declines to accelerate, offsetting gains in Iraq. Birol said Venezuela’s production outlook may need to be cut in coming years as well.\nAs a result, OPEC’s crude oil capacity will grow by just 750,000 bpd by 2023, the IEA said.\nWith shale and other non-OPEC supply rising, demand for OPEC crude plus withdrawals from inventories will average 31.8 million bpd in 2019, the IEA said, 1.8 million bpd less than its last medium-term forecast.\nThis is lower than demand of 32.3 million bpd expected in 2018 and below the IEA’s latest estimate of OPEC’s production of 32.16 million bpd.\nWith forecast capacity of 36.3 million bpd, OPEC will be supplying less than 35 percent of global demand by 2023 compared to its historic share around 40 percent.\nBoosted by economic growth in Asia and a resurgent U.S. petrochemicals industry, global oil demand will increase by 6.9 million bpd by 2023 to 104.7 million, according to the IEA.\nDespite steep non-OPEC oil production gains, the IEA warned that a decline in mature fields meant more investment was needed across the globe after 2020.\n“Upstream investment shows little sign of recovering from its plunge in 2015-2016, which raises concerns about whether adequate supply will be available to offset natural field declines and meet robust demand growth after 2020,” it said.\nAdditional reporting by Ernest Scheyder and Alex Lawler; editing by David Evans and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T11:22:53.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
