Cambridge Analytica has called the allegations \"false\" and on Tuesday the board suspended CEO Alexander Nix . Facebook said it was deceived and vowed to vigorously enforce its policies to protect people's information. Paul Marotta | Getty Images Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg received an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree from Harvard University at its 2017 366th Commencement Exercises on May 25, 2017 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \nSonnenfeld criticized Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg for not publicly addressing the allegations. They reportedly plan to remain silent until Facebook completes an audit of what happened. \n\"They're hiding. They're throwing up lawyers,\" he said. \"They should show some accountability.\" \nIn a statement on Tuesday, Facebook said, \"Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue. The entire company is outraged we were deceived.\" \nAs for who should run the social media giant, Sonnenfeld pointed to two possibilities currently sitting on the company's board. One is former American Express CEO Kenneth Chenault, and the other is Erskine Bowles, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and ex-Morgan Stanley lead director. \nHowever, tech investor Jason Calacanis thinks Sandberg should step into the CEO role , telling \"Closing Bell\" on Monday that Zuckerberg has done a \"horrible, horrible\" job of handling the crisis. \nSandberg is a \"better communicator\" and a \"tremendous leader,\" Calacanis said. \"She's better at understanding how to manage these issues.\" \nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sonnenfeld's remarks.
