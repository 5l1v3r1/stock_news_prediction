We will lose volume and market share with this increase,” he said.\nState-owned fuel retailer CPC said it had not taken a decision on whether to increase prices.\nBohra said his company was incurring a loss of 12 rupees per liter of petrol and 17 rupees per liter of diesel as of Friday, and the decision to raise the price was taken after the government did not act itself.\n$1 = 156.1000 Sri Lankan rupees Editing by Shihar Aneez and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:49:40.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
