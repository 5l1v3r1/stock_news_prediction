Impax denies that allegation.\nImpax, which in October agreed to combine with Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC, denies wrongdoing and contends that its deal with Medicis did not delay competition.\nThe trial came after Impax on Saturday reached a deal to resolve part of the litigation it faced over Solodyn, agreeing to pay $35 million to resolve claims by a class of direct purchasers such as retailers and wholesalers.\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which in 2012 acquired Medicis, in February said it would pay $58 million to resolve related claims against it.\nThe trial is expected to last four weeks. Jurors will be asked only to determine liability because damages will be determined at a later trial.\nLawyers for the consumers and insurers have said they were overcharged by up to $790.3 million and that the defendants were unjustly enriched by up to $803.3 million, according to an October court ruling.\nUnder federal antitrust law, any damages would be tripled.\nThe case is In re Solodyn (Minocycline Hydrochloride) Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 14-md-02503.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T17:46:52.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
