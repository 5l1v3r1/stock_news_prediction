He added that the two leaders \"will probably get together in the not-too-distant future\" to discuss the international arms race.\nTrump and Putin will also talk about North Korea, Ukraine and Syria, among \"various other things,\" the U.S. said.\nThe election win keeps Putin in office as Russia's president for another six years . His closest rival in the election, which was held Sunday, scored nearly 12 percent of the vote, while his most vocal opponent, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in the race.\nPutin's overwhelming victory and the circumstances leading to it have prompted criticism from Russia watchers. The White House, however, skirted the issue Tuesday.\n\"We're focused on our elections. We don't get to dictate how other countries operate,\" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at Tuesday's White House press briefing. \"What we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country.\"\nThe arms race Trump's comment on the arms race came as the top nuclear commander for the U.S. made a case Tuesday for America adding another nuclear weapon to its arsenal.\n\"I strongly agree with the need for a low-yield nuclear weapon,\" Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said of the Pentagon's request for a low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\n\"That capability is a deterrence weapon to respond to the threat that Russia in particular is portraying,\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday.\nLate last month, Putin made waves by boasting about an arsenal of new nuclear weapons, including an underwater drone, a new hypersonic missile and a cruise missile that has a \"practically unlimited range.\"\nHyten has previously called Russia the \"most significant threat\" to the U.S. because the the nation poses \"the only existential threat to the country right now.\"\nSanctions and election meddling The call between Trump and Putin also comes as the special counsel's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election intensifies. Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia, and Putin has rejected accusations that the Kremlin had anything to do with any election interference.\nThe Trump administration announced last week that it was sanctioning several Russians and entities linked to the Kremlin for meddling in the 2016 election as well as for cyberattacks against U.S. infrastructure, such as the energy grid.\nTrump had resisted calls to punish Russia for its malfeasance, despite U.S. intelligence agencies' claims that Kremlin-backed operatives did interfere in the campaign.\nOn Tuesday, Sanders told reporters Tuesday that she doesn't believe the subject of 2016 election meddling came up in the Putin-Trump phone call. \"But it is something that we've spoken extensively about,\" she said.\nThe war in Syria Trump has expressed admiration for Putin dating back to the years before he ran for president, but he is not the only U.S. commander in chief to call the Russian leader after an election victory.\nPresident Barack Obama called Putin in 2012 to congratulate him for his win that year, although Russia-U.S. relations were especially contentious during Obama's administration due in large part to the conflict in Syria. Russia has backed Syrian President Bashar Assad's brutal war.\nTrump, for his part, has criticized Obama over his handling of the Syrian war. \"President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing,\" Trump said in August after a suspected chemical attack in Syria. \"The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable attack.\"\nThe war in Syria continues to rage, and a Russian military leader recently threatened action against U.S. forces there if Americans target Russian servicemen.\nâ€” Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T17:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T17:42:03.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
