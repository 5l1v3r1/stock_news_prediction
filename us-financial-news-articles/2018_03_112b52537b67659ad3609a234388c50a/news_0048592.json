The series explored the bad blood between Crawford and Davis in the later years of their life.\nDon Howarth, a lawyer for de Havilland, did not immediately return a request for comment.\nMurphy said in a statement that the ruling “gives all creators the breathing room necessary to continue to tell important historical stories inspired by true events.”\nIn February Netflix Inc hired Murphy, known for the hit series “American Horror Story” and “Glee,” to create exclusive series and films as part of a five-year deal expected to be worth up to $300 million.\nDe Havilland, best known for the 1939 film “Gone With the Wind,” won two Oscars in a career spanning 50 movies.\nDe Havilland moved to Paris in the 1950s, where she currently resides, and has only made rare public appearances since retiring.\nLawyers for de Havilland, 101, said she was the only living person to be depicted in the eight-part miniseries.\nDe Havilland objected to scenes in which she was portrayed as using a vulgar term to refer to her sister, actress Joan Fontaine, and joking about Frank Sinatra’s drinking.\nIn October a lower court judge denied a request by FX to dismiss the case on First Amendment grounds, saying there was merit to her allegation that she was depicted in a false light.
