He stopped 25 of 26 shots in a 5-1 win at Buffalo on Wednesday.\nHis team provided just enough offense and then hung on for the victory, which pulled the Flames within one point of a playoff spot in the Western Conference standings.\nBennett put the Flames on the board 4:25 into the affair with his second goal in as many outings. Ottawa goalie Mike Condon stopped a long shot from Micheal Ferland, but Bennett pounced on the rebound and fought off a couple of defenders to get a pair of chances before he slipped the puck past the sprawling netminder for his 11th of the season.\nWhat had been a dull, uninspiring game through the first 50 minutes picked up over the final half of the third period.\nStajan finally gave the Flames what became the game-winning goal at 11:42 of the final frame. Curtis Lazar, who the Flames acquired via trade from the Senators at last season’s trade deadline, led a rush down the ice before firing a perfect cross-crease pass for Stajan to redirect for a tally that broke a 16-game goal drought.\nBut Jean-Gabriel Pageau put the Senators on the board with a penalty shot at the 12:55 mark of the period to set up a frantic finish. Pageau was hooked by Dougie Hamilton on a breakaway and converted his one-on-one showdown with a five-hole shot that beat Rittich.\nWhile Rittich was strong in net, he certainly had good fortune on his side. Ottawa’s Bobby Ryan rang a shot off the post early in the third period, after which Rittich gave the iron a kiss through his mask, and then Zach Smith also hit a post late in the third period.\nCondon stopped 29 shots in an excellent but unrewarded performance. Also, Senators forward Mark Stone saw his 10-game point-scoring streak snapped.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T19:54:41.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
