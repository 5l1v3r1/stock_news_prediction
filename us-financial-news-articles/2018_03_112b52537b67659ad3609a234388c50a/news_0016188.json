The potential delays will not result in additional programme cost to the taxpayer, the statement said. Boeing previously missed a forecast that the aircraft would be delivered last year. In a statement on Wednesday, Boeing said: “There is always risk on any development program, we’re relying on our partnership with the Air Force to help mitigate those risks, complete KC-46 testing and deliver 18 game-changing tankers to them as quickly as possible.” The world’s biggest maker of jetliners said it had discussed a range of delivery dates with the Air Force. In the third quarter of 2017, the company took a $329 million (236.7 million pounds) charge for its KC-46 aerial refuelling tanker programme. Charges related to the programme have reduced profit by $1.9 billion after tax. Boeing expects to build a substantial business from the tanker, which is based on its twin-aisle 767 commercial jet. Boeing plans to deliver 179 tankers to the U.S. Air Force and expects to sell about 400 in total worldwide.
