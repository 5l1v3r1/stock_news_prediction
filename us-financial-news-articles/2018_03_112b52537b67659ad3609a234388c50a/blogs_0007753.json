He's done a great job,\" said Kudlow, a longtime economist who served in the Reagan administration.\nThere are multiple media reports casting doubt on Cohn's future in the White House after he was unable to convince Trump not to impose steel and aluminium tariffs. There's been speculation for months about whether or not Cohn may leave his post as director of the National Economic Council.\nIn a brief gaggle with reporters on Friday morning, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked about whether Cohn is staying. \" I don't have any reason to think otherwise right now.\" She added, \"Gary was here yesterday afternoon, I talked to him in my office several times.\" \nSanders also said, Trump is \"pretty committed\" to his announced new policy, saying she did not expect the 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum to change. \nKudlow said on \"Squawk Box\" Trump has done great things like tax cuts and deregulation, but these tariffs are not among them. On Thursday , Kudlow said Trump's tariffs are a \"bad omen\" and could cause \"major calamity.\"\nTrump announced the new tariffs Thursday, sending stocks into a tailspin, re-approaching their early February lows. Dow futures were down about 200 points on Friday. The president, making good on a campaign promise to protect America's trade interests, is expected to set the tariffs, as early as next week .\n\"I've had this discussion with the president,\" said Kudlow. \"I've had it for two years-plus. I won a lot of discussions on taxes, on regulations. I have not won any on trade.\"\nTariffs are \"prosperity killers\" that will do more harm to the U.S. economy than good, Kudlow said. \"Tariffs damage the user of the commodity, in this case, steel. It's a tax.\"\n\"We're going to have a group going into the Oval [Office] to see him, probably next week to talk it through,\" Kudlow added. \nIn a tweet Friday morning, Trump suggested the U.S. would come out on top if the new tariffs were to spark an international trade war. \n@realDonaldTrump When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big.
