(NASDAQ:AQMS), (“Aqua Metals” or the “Company”), which is proceeding to commercialize its proprietary electrochemical lead recycling technology called AquaRefining™, has provided a corporate update and announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nCompany Update\nAqua Metals continues to work towards scaling up operations at the world’s first AquaRefinery at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) in McCarren, Nevada.\nAs previously described, the modules experienced a “sticky lead” condition in which recovered lead was hanging up on the modules’ exit chutes, and as a result, periodic manual intervention was required to remove the AquaRefined lead. The following progress has been made to overcome this condition:\nIn early December 2017, Aqua Metals announced that they had developed a solution to address the “sticky lead” condition by using a retro-fit package consisting of modifications to the exit chute and improvements to the electrolyte feed system. Initial testing of the chosen solution was completed using one electrolyser during the remainder of December 2017. This solution was then expanded to one full module, comprised of 6 electrolysers, and operated during January and early February. The retro-fitted module completed a series of tests, including operation of more than 20 hours over a four-day period. In early March, the Company completed the first 24 hour run of continuous operation of an AquaRefining module. This 24-hour testing run produced approximately 2.4 metric tonnes of AquaRefined lead, which meets the Company’s objectives. Moreover, the module achieved this output using approximately 13% less energy than its design basis, in part, as a result of the modifications developed to resolve the sticky lead issue.\nWork to install the parts required for “sticky lead” retro-fit has commenced, and the Company expects to have substantially completed this by the end of March. The Company plans to bring 16 retro-fitted modules on-line in groups of 4. The first group is expected to begin initial operation by the end of March 2018 and our plan is to ramp up AquaRefining production during Q2.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financials\nTotal revenues in 2017 were $2.1 million, compared to no revenue in 2016. Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.9 million, compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and no revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company incurred an operating loss of $24.9 million in 2017 compared to an operating loss of $13.0 million in 2016. The Company incurred an operating loss of $6.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an operating loss of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss for 2017 was $26.6 million, or ($1.31) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $13.6 million, or ($0.89) per diluted share, in 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.0 million, or ($0.32) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $4.9 million, or ($0.30) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company had $22.8 million in cash as of December 31, 2017, compared to $26.6 million as of December 31, 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company raised approximately $13.8 million from an underwritten public offering. In January 2018, the Company received approximately $2.1 million from the underwriter exercising its overallotment option from the December 2017 capital raise.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Guidance\nTotal revenues in the first quarter of 2018 are expected to range between $1.3 million and $1.4 million, compared to revenue of $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nConference Call and Webinar\nAqua Metals will host a conference call today, Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time) to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nDr. Stephen Clarke, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas Murphy, Interim Chief Financial Officer, will host the call followed by a question and answer session.\nTo access the call, please use the following information:\nDate: Thursday, March 15, 2018\nTime: 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern time)\nDial-in: 1-888-394-8218\nInternational Dial-in: 1-323-794-2149\nPasscode: 6648793\nWebcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=128741\nA telephone replay will be available approximately two hours after the call and will run through April 15, 2018 by dialing 1-844-512-2921 from the U.S., or 1-412-317-6671 from international locations, and entering replay pin number: 6648793.\nThe webcast will be available for replay for 60 days at http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=128741 and on the investor relations section of the company's website at www.aquametals.com .\nAbout Aqua Metals\nAqua Metals, Inc.
