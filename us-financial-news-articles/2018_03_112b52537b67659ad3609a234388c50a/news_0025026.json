The airline had 89 departures to an equal number of arrivals scheduled from Boston's Logan International Airport on Tuesday, American Airlines spokesman Ross Feinstein said. \nSeveral airlines with large operations from Boston, including American, Delta and JetBlue , are waiving ticket-change fees for travelers affected by the storm. Southwest said passengers won't pay additional fees for a date change. The airline doesn't charge date-change fees but passengers generally have to pay more if the fare is higher on the new travel date. \nAirlines will often cancel flights ahead of time to avoid stranding passengers and crews, which can lead to further delays if employees are not in place to work when flights resume. \nAbout a fifth of flights scheduled for Tuesday are already canceled, according to flight-tracking company FlightAware.
