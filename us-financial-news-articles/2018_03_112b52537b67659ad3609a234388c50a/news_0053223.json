Tighe sold the house for 1.63 million pounds in 2016 to pay the confiscation order. \nThe judges said the purchase of the property had been a joint decision made in good faith. But they said that against the background of criminal conduct, the property should be considered a “gift” in legal terms and dismissed the appeal. \n“Ms Tighe made no financial contributions at all, directly or indirectly, towards the purchase...Their marriage for around a year, and Joshua’s (their son) birth in October 2011, cannot of itself involve ‘consideration’ of ‘value’...” the judges said in the ruling. \nTighe said she was disappointed that her contribution to the marriage had not been recognised. \n“Sarah and I are very disappointed with this outcome,” Hayes said in a statement. “This is unfair on Sarah and my 6-year-old son, Joshua. I will now consider options for a further appeal.” \nHayes has referred his conviction to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent body that examines potential miscarriages of justice. \nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which prosecuted the case, declined to comment. $1 = 0.7085 pounds Editing by Adrian Croft", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T21:34:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
