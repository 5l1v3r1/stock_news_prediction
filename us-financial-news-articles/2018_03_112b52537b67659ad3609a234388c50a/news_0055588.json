Questions about the incident hindered his presidential ambitions for years and have spurred numerous books, documentaries and films. \nThe film follows Kennedy’s emotional reaction to the accident and his advisors’ attempts to try and contain the ensuing scandal. \n“If you want to understand Ted, who he was before, during and after, this is the moment to examine him, this week or 10-day period,” said actor Jason Clarke, who plays Kennedy. “This is it, this is the making of a man.” Cast members Jason Clarke, Kate Mara and Ed Helms pose at the premiere for \"Chappaquiddick\" in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nCurran shied away from trying to make the film a definitive version of what may have happened between Kennedy and Kopechne on July 18, 1969. \n“What I like about John Curran’s version is you can draw your own conclusions. How much empathy you retain for Ted Kennedy is up to you,” said Jim Gaffigan, who plays Kennedy’s friend Paul Markham. \nKennedy, a lifelong Democrat, died in 2009 at age 77 after serving almost 47 years as a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. He was the younger brother of slain U.S. President John F. Kennedy and of former U.S. Attorney General and Senator Robert Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 after winning the Democratic presidential primary in California.

He is truly, truly a conundrum of liberalism and the Democratic party that still exists, the good and the bad,” Clarke said \nClarke referenced Kennedy’s efforts on behalf of civil rights and better access to medical care, but he added. “Then there’s the immense hypocrisy and white privilege that allows him to get away with something.” Reporting by Rollo Ross; Editing by David Gregorio", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T22:48:44.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
