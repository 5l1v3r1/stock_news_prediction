The sources said the stake was worth $3.1 billion at current market prices but GSK wanted a premium in any sale. \nThey estimated the consumer health nutrition business, which also has smaller operations in Nigeria and Bangladesh, could fetch more than $4 billion. \nNestle, the world’s biggest packaged food company, has previously told GSK privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions, the people said. \nNestle already owns the malt drink Milo, but it is not a big-seller in India. The Swiss company declined to comment. \nUnilever, the world’s largest tea company, and Kraft Heinz, which sells the powdered drinks Crystal Light and Kool-Aid, also declined to comment. \nHorlicks is more than 140 years old with origins dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, first founded a company in Chicago to manufacture the drink. It was introduced to India by Indian soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War. \nAssociated British Foods, which owns the malt drink brand Ovaltine, could look at the business to scale up in a key emerging market, the sources said, although the size of the GSK business could be a deterrent. \nAn ABF spokesman declined to comment. \nThe Indian business has an enterprise value of about 29 times core earnings, said one of the sources, meaning any deal premium will value it well above what many packaged food and drink brands fetch. The valuation is inflated by the high growth rates seen in the Indian market. \nNestle and Unilever could purchase the asset through their local Indian subsidiaries, Nestle India or Hindustan Unilever. \nOther potential suitors might include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Suntory, Mondelez International and JAB, the coffee business owner that recently agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple, one of the sources said.
