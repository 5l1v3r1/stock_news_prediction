Undercover filming appeared to show senior executives suggesting the firm could use sex workers, bribes, ex-spies and fake news to help candidates win votes around the world.\nThe Channel 4 News investigation, broadcast Monday, comes after articles published by the New York Times and U.K. newspaper The Observer, showed how the data of millions of Facebook profiles ended up being given to Cambridge Analytica. \nAcademic Aleksandr Kogan and his company Global Science Research created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” in 2014. Users were paid to take a psychological test and the app collected the data. It also gathered data on a person’s Facebook friends, according to British newspaper The Observer and The New York Times. \nIn this way, 50 million Facebook profiles were mined for data. Kogan then shared this with Cambridge Analytica, which allowed the firm to build a software solution to help influence choices in elections, according to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who revealed the alleged practices to both newspapers. \nBoth Kogan and Cambridge Analytica have denied wrongdoing in regards to the reports in The Observer and The New York Times.
