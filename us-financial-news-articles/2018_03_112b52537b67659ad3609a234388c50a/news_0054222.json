Qatar has denied the charge and accused the four countries of trying to make it conform to their foreign policy positions.\nQatar in June 2017 asked the ICAO to intervene after its Gulf neighbors closed their airspace to Qatar flights as part of the sanctions.\nBahrain’s civil aviation authority confirmed the incident took place, saying two Qatari fighter jets flew under a UAE Airbus A320 en route from the emirate of Fujairah to Rome, forcing the UAE aircraft to fly at a higher altitude.\nBahrain said this was the second incident to take place on the same day.\nThe airline involved was not specified.\nThe Bahraini agency said in a statement carried by state news agency BNA that the Qatari jets entered airspace managed by Bahrain without prior authorisation, and that the necessary measures had been taken to file a complaint with the ICAO.\nQatari officials were not immediately available to comment.\nWhile the UAE has banned Qatari aircraft from using its airspace as part of the restrictions, Qatar has not reciprocated.
