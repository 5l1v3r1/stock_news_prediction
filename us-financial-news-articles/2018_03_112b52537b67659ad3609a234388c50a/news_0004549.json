And local governments have stepped in to offer training and redeployment services in a bid to avoid a rise in unemployment.\nThe central government has funneled significant funds into supporting the industrial sector, including a new 350 billion yuan ($55.2 billion) fund to help restructure state enterprises, and 100 billion yuan to finance layoffs in the coal and steel sector. Both initiatives were announced in 2016.\nA rebound in the economy has also helped. A housing boom and a jump in infrastructure investment last year helped spark a dramatic turnaround in China’s industrial sector.\nAnd with winter pollution curbs set to expire this month, steel producers are eager to ramp up production to take advantage of high prices and strong demand.\nSlideshow (14 Images) A representative from Shijiazhuang steel-focused conglomerate Hebei Jingye Group said at the job fair that the company was recruiting a large number of new staff this year.\nFast-growing consumer services and technology industries have also helped pick up the slack in job growth.\nGovernment officials boast that 13.51 million new jobs were created in China last year, and a tight labor market in some sectors have driven salaries up significantly.\nBut some companies say hiring has become more difficult as graduates demand more in terms of salary and types of jobs.\n“Young people either want to be their own boss and start their own business, or they lack independence to the point that their parents accompany them to the job fair,” said Wang Yandong, a representative of Hebei Hengxin Wire Mesh Manufacturing.\nThe government last month pledged to roll out more job growth measures this year, though companies often say it’s not easy to find candidates with the right skills.\nNogeteks Ltd, a local startup that sells a chemical solution to control dust at construction sites, on Sunday was advertising a salary of 2,500 yuan ($395.07) to 3,000 yuan a month for an accountant with a few years of work experience.\nWhile many job seekers said they were just browsing, Wang Xinjie, the Great Wall Motor technician, saw some real results.\nHe got an offer to join Lizhong Wheel Group in Baoding with a salary increase of about 15 percent to 4,000 yuan a month, he said by text after the fair.\nChina says its urban-registered jobless rate fell to 3.9 percent in 2017 - the lowest since 2002.\nMany analysts say, however, that the official data is an unreliable indicator of employment conditions, as it measures only employment in urban areas and doesn’t take into account millions of migrant workers.\nReporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T17:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T17:48:34.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
