However, she remained more poised on the big points and eventually won on serve when Bertens could only tap the ball back across the net, allowing Williams to put away the winner. “I’m not sure,” eighth seed Williams said in an on-court interview when asked how she had pulled off the victory in a match that had 15 breaks of serve. “I had a lot of chances; she had a lot of chances. It didn’t look good sometimes but that’s why you keep playing to the last point and why I love this game.” Mar 25, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; Venus Williams of the United States (L) shakes hands with Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands (R) after their match on day six of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park.
