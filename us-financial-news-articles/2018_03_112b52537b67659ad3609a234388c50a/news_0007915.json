Firestar Diamond Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Feb. 26 in the United States, following accusations that other firms led by Modi and his uncle colluded with officials of Indiaâ€™s Punjab National Bank to secure unauthorised loans starting 2011. Indian investigators have subsequently attached or seized various assets belonging to Modi and his companies. Firestar is not named in the police complaint. (Reporting by Krishna N.
