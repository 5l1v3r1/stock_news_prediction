Also on Thursday, Canadian retailer Mountain Equipment Co-op said it would stop ordering all Vista brands. Neither retailer sells firearms or ammunition.\nRelated\nWalmart, Dick’s Say They Will Stop Selling Guns to Those Under 21 Kroger to Stop Selling Guns to Buyers Under 21 CEOs Choose Sides on Gun Control at Their Own Risk President Sends Mixed Signals on Gun Legislation “We believe that it is the job of companies that manufacture and sell guns and ammunition to work towards common-sense solutions that prevent the type of violence that happened in Florida last month,” said REI, which has about 150 stores.\nShares of Vista fell 10% in Friday trading. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nVista, based in Farmington, Utah, was spun off in early 2015 by defense contractor Alliant Techsystems Inc. It was already the largest U.S. commercial ammo maker by revenue, with brands such as Federal Premium, and diversified into firearms before the spin with acquisitions including Savage Arms rifles.\nRelated Video In the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead, student survivors have started a movement for greater gun control. Two students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School explain how social media, crowdfunding and political activism have helped spread their message. Photo: Getty Images After it was a separate company, Vista moved into consumer brands. In 2015, the company bought water bottle and hydration pack maker Camelbak for $412.5 million. That year it also bought paddleboard retailer Jimmy Styks. The following year, Vista purchased Camp Chef, an outdoor cooking equipment seller, and spent $400 million to buy BRG Sports Inc., which makes sports gear such as bike helmets and goggles.\nThe company is targeting an outdoor pursuits market it estimates is worth $93 billion a year, and just under half its sales last year came from non-shooting sports products.\nBut Vista has faced turmoil and slumping sales. The company issued a profit warning last February and named a new chief executive in October. For the nine months ended Dec. 31, the company reported that sales fell 12% to $1.74 billion.\nMEC didn’t stop selling Camelbak and other Vista brands after the acquisitions because the Canadian retailer was focused on “the health, safety and dignity of the people who make our products and on reducing our environmental footprint. Going forward, we will be aiming to better understand ownership structures in our supply chain,” said MEC CEO David Labistour in an email.\nGun sales have slumped over the past year after climbing to record highs in 2016, leaving the industry awash with excess inventory. The Republican sweep of the U.S. presidency and both chambers of Congress reduced concerns about tougher gun-ownership laws, long a driver of sales.\nVista entered the postelection period in a weaker position than peers such as Smith & Wesson owner American Outdoor Brands Corp. and Sturm, Ruger & Co., in part because others were faster to introduce new AR-15-style rifles as sales of those guns skyrocketed . On Thursday, American Outdoor said sales dropped 33% in the most recent quarter and warned of weaker sales and profit even as the firearm inventory glut starts to lift.\nVista’s share have fallen more than 60% since the U.S. presidential election in 2016.\n—Doug Cameron contributed to this article.\nWrite to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T04:45:49.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
