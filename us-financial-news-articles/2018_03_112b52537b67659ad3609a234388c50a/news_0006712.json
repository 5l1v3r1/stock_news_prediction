That helped the yen higher against the euro and sterling.\nThe dollar was already on the back foot before Kuroda spoke, having pulled sharply back from six-week highs after Trump's decision to impose tariffs took the wind out of the greenback's week-long recovery.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.37 percent to 90.00.\nBilal Hafeez, a macro strategist at Nomura in London, said Trump's move was much more aggressive than tariffs imposed by his most recent predecessors. Barack Obama imposed tariffs on Chinese steel imports in May 2016 and George W. Bush against EU steel imports in March 2002. Those moves saw the dollar fall 1.5 percent and 6 percent respectively in the subsequent months.\n\"The contours of the dollar reaction will likely depend on the reaction of other countries to these tariffs... The more powerful force could be the withdrawal of capital flows to the U.S.,\" he wrote in a note.\nThe euro, meanwhile, was up 0.42 percent versus the dollar at 1.2319, with the focus on Sunday's Italian parliamentary election and the level of support for populist agendas that could have a wider impact on the European Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T05:05:17.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
