Speaking at a news conference, Cavusoglu said Ankara sought an agreement with Washington over who will secure Manbij after the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey considers a terrorist organization, withdraws from the area. Cavusoglu said Turkey wanted the understanding with the United States over Manbij, where U.S. troops are stationed, to be a model for all areas controlled by the YPG.
