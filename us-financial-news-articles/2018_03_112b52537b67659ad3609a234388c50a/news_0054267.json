During his campaign trail in 2016, Trump told supporters that if he became president Amazon would have \"such problems.\"\nNow in a tweet Thursday, Trump has accused the firm of causing \"tremendous loss to the U.S.\".\nTweet 1\nIn recent days, big tech has seen a steep sell-off as investors calculate what lawmakers around the world might do to regulate the sector, particularly following revelations surrounding the use and misuse of data. From March 16 until Tuesday, Facebook shed almost $80 billion in value following concerns over data breaches.\nChristopher Harvey, head of Equity & Quant Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities said despite current negative sentiment, he would be surprised to see a Trump administration enforce new laws.\n\"If you look at President Trump, one of the things he ran on was de-regulation. So I have a difficult time believing that he and the government want to regulate the whole industry,\" Harvey said.\nTechnology stocks make up 25 percent of the S&P 500 . Apple , Amazon and Google parent Alphabet alone have a combined market capitalization of around $2 trillion. That represents almost 10 percent of the index's total market cap of about $23 trillion.\nWhile that imbalance is unnerving for some investors, Harvey said tech's heavy presence should act as its own insurance.\n\"The goodwill, the prices, the productivity that technology brings to the marketplace and to other sectors is strong, so I don't think we want to lose that,\" he added.\nThe house view of Wells Fargo is that the broader fundamentals of the tech sector remain intact and that valuations remain reasonable.\nshow chapters Expert: Firms like Facebook, Google to be hit hardest by regulation 10 Hours Ago | 03:50 However, a less positive perspective is offered by Cyrus Mewawalla, who is head of Thematic Research at GlobalData.\nHe told CNBC Thursday that across the world many people now think of big tech firms as BAADD (big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy).\nMewawalla forecast that 2018 will be a tough year for some big tech companies with respect to regulation, especially in the area of data privacy and anti-trust issues.\n\"We think companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google will get hit more in regulation that Apple or Microsoft for example,\" he said.\nHe said internet companies hosting fake news on their platforms will lead to more punitive fines, increasing the commercial case for spending large sums of money to fix the problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T13:59:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
