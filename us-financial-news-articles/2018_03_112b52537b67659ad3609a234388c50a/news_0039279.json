Invest for the long term Markets fluctuate, but that doesn't necessarily mean you need to change course.\nThe best thing retirement savers can do is stick with a long-term strategy designed to weather all market conditions — up and down.\nTo that end, be consistent and commit to a plan based on your personal goals ( and geography ).\n2.

Yet, fewer than 1 in 5 boomers said they started saving when they were in their 20s, according to the Capital Group survey.\nFidelity suggests that workers every year put away 15 percent of their salary , which includes any employer match they receive. That number isn't attainable for everyone, however. (The median savings rate in a retirement plan is now just shy of 9 percent, the highest percentage in almost 10 years, according to Fidelity.)\nTo work your way up, Jeanne Thompson, a senior vice president of Fidelity Investments, suggests incremental changes. \"Increase your savings 1 percent every year to a target of 15 percent.\"\nThe key is to make sure you have enough time for your savings and market returns to grow.\nMore from Retire Well: \nThe new retirement: Working \nHere are some steps to clean up your financial clutter \nA retirement hack millennials will love", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T14:31:41.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
