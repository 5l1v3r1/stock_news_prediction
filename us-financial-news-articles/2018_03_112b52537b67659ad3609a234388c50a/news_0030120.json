LifeScan makes blood glucose monitoring products and generated net revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2017, Johnson & Johnson said. The company said the acceptance period for the offer would end on June 15, unless extended, and during that time, consultations with relevant works councils were planned. J&J had said in January last year it was evaluating options for its diabetes care companies, specifically LifeScan, Animas Corp, and Calibra Medical Inc.
