Others speculated that Amazon may be mentioned in the speech after Trump's message on Twitter earlier on Thursday attacking the retail giant. \n\"He could very well bring up Amazon ,\" Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a Fox News interview. \"That's certainly on his radar, as we've seen with his tweet this morning.\" CNBC NEWSLETTERS \nGet the best of CNBC in your inbox Please choose a subscription A daily email for dreamers, seekers and game changers.
