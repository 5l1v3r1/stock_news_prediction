A key part of that effort involves a crackdown on primarily Democrat-governed cities and states that Sessions claims are \"sanctuaries\" that protect illegal immigrants from deportation.\nSessions is expected to discuss the lawsuit during a speech on Wednesday morning in Sacramento. The Justice Department lawsuit cites a provision of the U.S. Constitution known as the \"Supremacy Clause,\" under which federal laws trump state laws.\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra on Tuesday said law enforcement in the state is focused on public safety, not deportation. The Trump administration's legal arguments are similar to those it has made in other cases, he said, and his office is prepared to address them.\n\"We've seen this 'B' rated movie before,\" Becerra said on a call with reporters.\nBrown in October signed into law a bill that prevents police from inquiring about immigration status and curtails law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers.\n\"The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,\" Sessions plans to tell a group of law enforcement officers on Wednesday, according to prepared remarks seen by Reuters.\nA second law, Senate Bill 54, prevents state and local law enforcement from giving federal immigration officials information about when they intend to release an illegal immigrant from their custody.\nThe third law empowers the state to inspect federal immigration detention centers.\nThe Justice Department filing says all three laws improperly attempt to regulate federal immigration at the state level. The department also plans to seek a court order from a judge to temporarily block the state from enforcing the laws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T11:46:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
