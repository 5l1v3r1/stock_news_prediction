However, safety records in recent years have improved greatly.\nIn June 2012, a Dana Air flight crashed into a Lagos apartment block, killing 163 people in the country’s worst airline disaster in two decades.\nAlso last month, Dana came under fire after a passenger tweeted, with a photograph, that an emergency exit door had fallen off a plane as it touched down.\nReporting by Felix Onuah, writing by Paul Carsten, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T09:43:16.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
