Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015.\nBroadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nShares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively.\nSingapore-based Broadcom's $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.\nQualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.\nIntel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc.\nIf Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.\nBroadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.\nThe Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.\nStill, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.\nVLSI Research chief Dan Hutcheson agreed. \"There's product overlap, but it's really inconsequential,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis and Peter Henderson in San Francisco, Diane Bartz in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Cynthia Osterman, Rosalba O'Brien and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T02:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T04:07:56.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
