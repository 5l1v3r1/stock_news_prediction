A strong anti trafficking law in India will send a powerful message.”\nCalling it a “historic” achievement in the campaign against trafficking, Satyarthi urged parliament to pass the law.\nThe comprehensive bill unifies existing anti-trafficking laws and aims to make India a leader in the fight against such crimes in South Asia, one of the fastest-growing regions for forced labor, begging and forced marriage in the world.\nMany poor victims from rural areas are lured by traffickers with promises of good jobs, only to find themselves forced to work in fields or brick kilns, enslaved in homes as domestic workers, or sold to brothels.\nIndian government data shows reports of human trafficking rose by almost 20 percent in 2016 against the previous year, to 8,132 cases.\nAcknowledging the magnitude of the crime, a government statement said the bill “addresses one of the most pervasive yet invisible crimes affecting the most vulnerable persons especially women and children”.\nUnder the new law traffickers could be jailed for 10 years or for life. Conviction also includes a fine of at least 100,000 Indian rupees ($1,534).\n“In order to break the organized nexus, both at the national and international level, the Bill provides for the attachment and forfeiture of property and also the proceeds for crime,” the government said.\nThe legislation also provides for special courts to expedite trafficking cases, setting a deadline of one year for trial and repatriation.\nUnder the law, a rehabilitation fund will be set up to help victims rebuild their lives and they will be allowed to give evidence through video conferencing without being identified.\nAnti-trafficking committees - at district, state and central levels - will be set up to oversee prevention, protection and victim rehabilitation.\n($1 = 65.2000 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Katy Migiro.
