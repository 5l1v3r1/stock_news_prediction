REUTERS/Henry Romero Trump wants to protect American workers against countries that engage in unfair trade practices, but “I’m not sure he has made up his mind” on the tariffs, Perry said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference.\nThe key issue for the administration was putting together a plan that “strategically” deploys tariffs and regulations, said Perry, who addressed conference executives on the global role of a U.S. energy resurgence.\nThe proposal, which involves imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, has been criticized by Republican lawmakers and U.S. trade allies since the president first tweeted his intentions last week.\nGary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser and a free trade advocate, resigned on Tuesday in a sign of an internal clash on the issue within the administration.\nPerry suggested the proposal could unleash a backlash that draws in other sectors.\n“If you change one rule, it probably has an effect. Does it have unintended consequences? It may do that.”\nReporting by Gary McWilliams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T18:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T18:48:41.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
