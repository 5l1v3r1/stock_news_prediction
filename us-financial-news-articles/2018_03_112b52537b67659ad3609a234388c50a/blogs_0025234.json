He was arrested in July and is the only ex-Petrobras CEO implicated in the so-called \"Car Wash\" investigation. \nBendine was named head of Brazil's second largest bank, Banco do Brasil, in 2009 by then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Six years later, President Dilma Rousseff made him CEO of Petrobras.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T11:31:04.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
