Linde Group logo is seen at company building before the annual news conference in Munich, Germany March 9, 2017. REUTERS/Lukas Barth Linde achieved increases in both revenue and operating profit last year after adjusting for currency effects, lifted by a stronger performance from its engineering division. Operating profit rose to 4.21 billion euros ($5.22 billion), in line with market expectations and the group margin increased to 24.6 percent, up from 24.2 percent in 2016. Lindeâ€™s on-site business, which supplies gases to large steel or petrochemicals plants, would benefit from a solid project pipeline this year while the healthcare operations would be burdened by price reductions, the company said.
