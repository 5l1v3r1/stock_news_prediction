As our pipeline continues to expand with indications such as NASH and inflammatory bowel disease, we are thrilled to have someone of June’s caliber lead their development and commercial strategy.”\n“I am delighted to join Innovate at this transformative time for the company,” said Dr. June Almenoff.

Innovate’s lead drug candidate, larazotide acetate (INN-202), has a mechanism of action which decreases intestinal permeability and regulates tight junctions by reducing antigen trafficking across intestinal epithelial cells. In several autoimmune diseases, including celiac disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and others, intestinal permeability is increased, also referred to as “leaky gut,” and to our knowledge, larazotide is the only drug in clinical testing which reduces permeability.\nIn celiac disease, larazotide is the only drug which has successfully met the primary endpoint with statistical significance in a 342-patient Phase 2b efficacy clinical trial. Innovate successfully completed the End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA in 2017 and is preparing for larazotide to begin Phase 3 clinical trials for celiac disease targeted for the second half of 2018. In clinical trials testing more than 800 patients, larazotide demonstrated a favorable safety profile comparable to placebo, especially due to its lack of systemic absorption from the small intestines. Larazotide has also received Fast Track designation from the FDA for celiac disease.\nFor more information, please visit www.innovatebiopharma.com .\nForward Looking Statements for Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to the potential for Innovate’s drug development pipeline candidates in treating the diseases and conditions for which they are being developed, Innovate’s start of clinical trials for celiac disease, NASH, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis, and Innovate’s ability to develop future collaborations.
