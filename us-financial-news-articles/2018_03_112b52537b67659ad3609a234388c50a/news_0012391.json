REUTERS/Punit Paranjpe/File Photo The Competition Commission of India (CCI) levied a penalty of 398 million rupees ($6.13 million) on Jet Airways, 94.5 million rupees on InterGlobe and 51 million rupees on SpiceJet, it said in a statement.\nThe CCI noted in its order that “the airlines acted in a concerted manner” in fixing and revising the fuel surcharge rates, which are a component of freight charges.\nSlideshow (2 Images) The anti-trust watchdog criticized the airlines for using fuel surcharge as a pricing tool which was essentially introduced to mitigate the fuel price volatility.\nJet Airways, IndiGo Airlines, owned by InterGlobe, and SpiceJet did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\nIn 2015, the three airlines were penalized by CCI for the same issue.\nReporting by Aditi Shah, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:26:06.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
