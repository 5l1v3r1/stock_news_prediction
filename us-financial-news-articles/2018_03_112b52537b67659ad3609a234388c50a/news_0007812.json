It’s where they get their ears pierced for the first (or second or third) time—and where they buy their first set of earrings. Like a lot of traditions, though, that might be changing.\nThe chain is reportedly preparing a bankruptcy filing that would result in lenders taking over the company. Bloomberg reports Claire’s has a debt load of $2 billion.\nThe company signaled it was in trouble in January, announcing it was working with investment bank Lazard to evaluate a capital structure solution to ensure its long-term success. CEO Rob Marshall, though, insisted the company still planned to offer its products in roughly 4,000 CVS stores.\nA Chapter 11 filing, if it does come, would allow the chain to continue operating as it worked on a turnaround plan. However, it’s not a guarantee it would stay in business. Toys ‘R’ Us was optimistic at the start of its bankruptcy proceedings that it would only close a limited number of locations, but is now reportedly planning a liquidation of its U.S. operations after failing to find a buyer or reach a debt restructuring deal with lenders.\nOther retailers that have filed for bankruptcy in the past few months include Bon-Ton , The Walking Company, and cosmetics chain Kiko.", "external_links": ["https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-walking-company-files-second-bankruptcy-in-10-years/518701/", "http://www.clairestores.com/static-files/61645d07-3d23-420a-8059-6957e3664a26", "https://www.reuters.com/article/bankruptcy-kiko/cosmetics-chain-kiko-files-for-bankruptcy-to-close-most-stores-idUSL1N1P7284", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-08/claire-s-is-said-to-plan-bankruptcy-with-creditors-taking-over"], "published": "2018-03-10T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T19:11:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
