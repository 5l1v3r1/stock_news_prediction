(\"Camping World\") that it is in the process of acquiring 'Dixie RV Superstore in Newport News, Virginia', should not be interpreted by the public or the RV industry to suggest that Camping World is buying our valued company. Dixie RV SuperStores is neither affiliated with nor has any common ownership interest in the Virginia dealership. The true legal name of the sole Virginia dealership, which Camping World intends to purchase, is 'Dixie Trailer Sales of Newport News, Ltd.'

Dixie RV SuperStores did enter a License Agreement with the Virginia dealership allowing it to use 'Dixie RV Superstore' while it continued to conduct its own business, but that privilege will not pass on to any successors or assigns, including Camping World.\nDixie RV SuperStores , which originated in 1984, continues to be a family-owned business with 4 stores across the Gulf South.
