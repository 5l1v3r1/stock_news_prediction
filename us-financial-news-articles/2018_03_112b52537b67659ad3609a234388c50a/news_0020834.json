Other users may respond to those tweets. When one user blocks another, the blocked user cannot respond to the blocker’s tweets.\nThe plaintiffs have accused Trump of blocking a number of accounts whose owners criticized, mocked or disagreed with him in replies to his tweets.\nThey argued that Trump’s Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, is a public forum, and that denying them access based on their views violates the First Amendment.\nTrump in court papers countered that his use of Twitter is personal, not a “state action.”\nEven if it were a state action, he said, his use of Twitter was a form of “government speech,” not a public forum.\nTrump’s Twitter use draws intense interest for his unvarnished commentary, including attacks on critics. His tweets often shape news and are retweeted tens of thousands of times.
