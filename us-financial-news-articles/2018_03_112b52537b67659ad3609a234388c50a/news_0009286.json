CEZ said talks on both points would continue until the end week.\nBorissov, who has previously dismissed opposition Socialists’ calls for the state to buy back private energy assets, said the government was considering legal changes that would allow the state to have a say in similar deals despite objections from analysts and political parties, including Bulgaria’s ethnic Turkish MRF.\nLast week Borissov urged the central bank and intelligence services to look into the deal, estimated to cost about 320 million euros. Inercom has said it will be financed by bank loans, but has declined to elaborate.\nThe Socialist party (BSP), the largest opposition party in the ex-communist country, has started a campaign against the CEZ sale, saying the Bulgarian state should be able to try and buy the power distributor and compete on the market.\nBSP also initiated a petition to stop the deal and asked the chief prosecutor to check the origins of the funds with which Inercom plans to complete the deal. BSP will take part in a protest against CEZ sale in Sofia on Wednesday.\nEnergy prices are politically sensitive in the EU’s poorest member state, and a spike in electricity bills in 2013 toppled Borissov’s first government.\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:03:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
