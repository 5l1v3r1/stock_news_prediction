The dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 104.95 yen.\nA gauge of stress in the U.S. money markets climbed to its highest level in nearly nine years on Tuesday on concerns about growing costs for banks and other companies to borrow dollars and further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.\nThe gap between the three-month dollar London interbank offered rate and three-month overnight indexed swap rate expanded to 58 basis points, the widest since May 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nIn a week that the U.S. Federal Reserve broadly stuck to its “dot plot” on future interest rate moves and signaled a relatively upbeat outlook for the economy, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are on track to post its second biggest drop so far this year, further weighing on the greenback.\n“The FX market itself isn’t sure and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to by the yen and the Swiss franc,” Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at Societe Generale wrote in a daily note.\nThe Swiss franc was also the other notable winner in currency markets this week with a 0.6 percent rise.\nIn other currencies, sterling edged higher in the backdrop of an EU summit with the British currency changing hands at $1.4121.
