(formerly General Communication, Inc., \"GCI Liberty\") (Nasdaq: GNCMA), and will formally effect this name change at a later date.\nThe company also announced that Mike George, currently CEO of QVC, Inc., will become President and CEO of Qurate Retail Group. Greg Maffei, who currently holds that position, will become Chairman.\nQurate Retail Group will comprise eight leading retail brands -- QVC, HSN, zulily, Ballard Designs, Frontgate, Garnet Hill, Grandin Road and Improvements -- all dedicated to providing a 'third way to shop,' beyond transactional ecommerce or traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Globally, Qurate Retail Group will be #1 in video commerce, reaching approximately 370 million homes worldwide via 16 television networks and multiple ecommerce sites, social pages, mobile apps, print catalogs, and in-store destinations, and will be #3 in ecommerce in North America and #3 in mobile commerce in the US (1) .\n\"Qurate Retail Group will be a new venture in more ways than just a change of name,\" said Greg Maffei. \"We will be a select group of like-minded businesses that provide customers with curated collections of unique products, made personal and relevant by the power of storytelling, combining the best of retail, media and social.\"\nAs part of this rebrand, Qurate Retail Group will launch a new logo.\n\"Our new logo and name reflect our unmatched expertise in curation, which goes far beyond product,\" said Mike George. \"We will be the unrivaled leaders in curating experiences, conversations, and communities for millions of highly discerning shoppers -- bringing joy, inspiration and humanity to shopping.
