He did not elaborate on the specific timing.\nMexico’s heavy oil activity is currently concentrated in the Pemex-operated Ku-Maloob-Zaap region in the Bay of Campeche, which produces 850,000 barrels per day (bpd), nearly half of the country’s output. The volume is expected to start declining in the coming year, according to the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH).\nPemex’s heavy oil farmouts would offer partnership opportunities for the mostly undeveloped Ayatsil and Tekel fields in the Gulf’s shallow waters, the center of Pemex’s drilling activities.\nThe Mexican government has in its portfolio two adjacent areas, Pit and Kayab, which also could be offered in a bidding round, CNH chief Juan Carlos Zepeda told Reuters.\n“It’s key that Pemex moves forward to farmout first as they have the largest and only operative field,” Zepeda said.\nPemex’s exploration and production chief, Jose Antonio Escalera, said the auction could choose to have Pemex alone farmout its two oilfields, or offer the cluster of four fields along with the government.\nThe whole heavy cluster has recoverable reserves of more than 3 billion barrels with nearby infrastructure to transport and export the crude.\nWANTED: HEAVY SOURS “Heavy sour” no longer means cheap, unwanted oil barrels. Heavy versus lighter oil price differentials in the Atlantic basin have narrowed in recent months due to falling exports by traditional suppliers Mexico, Ecuador and especially Venezuela, whose output fell in 2017 to its lowest in almost three decades.\nThe only Latin American country consistently supplying the Atlantic with incremental volumes of crude is Brazil, whose new production coming from its vast deepwater reserves is mostly composed of medium sweet grades, not exactly what U.S. Gulf refiners need the most.\n“We cannot leave our market to the Canadians,” Zepeda said.\nCanada’s heavy oil exports have partially compensated for the lack of supply from Latin America, but transportation constraints often make it difficult for some Canadian producers to offer barrels to U.S. Gulf refiners at attractive prices.\nThe CNH estimates that Ayatsil, Tekel, Pit and Kayab could start producing about two to three years after awarding the areas.\nReporting by Marianna Parraga Editing by Paul Simao and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T04:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:29:18.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
