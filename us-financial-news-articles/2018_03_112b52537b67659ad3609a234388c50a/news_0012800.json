(NASDAQ: VEON, Euronext Amsterdam: VEON), a leading global provider of connectivity and internet services headquartered in Amsterdam and serving more than 240 million customers, announces that Kyivstar, its wholly-owned and market-leading business in Ukraine, has acquired the following spectrum in the 1800MHz band suitable for 4G/LTE:\n25MHz (paired) at UAH 1.325 billion (approximately USD 49 million); and two lots of 5MHz (paired) at UAH 1.512 billion (approximately USD 56 million).\nFollowing this acquisition, Kyivstar expects to have the largest amount of contiguous spectrum in both the 1800MHz and 2600MHz bands, which we believe will enable the company to increase the geographical coverage of its high-speed data network in Ukraine, further strengthening its position as market leader in the country.\nAbout VEON\nVEON is a NASDAQ and Euronext Amsterdam-listed global provider of connectivity and internet services, with an ambition to lead the personal internet revolution for over 240 million customers it currently serves, and many others in the years to come.
