The police held off from telling the public for a while, in order not to compromise their investigation.\nTwo of the burglaries took place on the southwestern Reykjanes peninsula, where local police commissioner Olafur Helgi Kjartansson said: “Everything points to this being a highly organized crime.”\nIceland is a popular cryptocurrency-mining location because the process is extremely energy-intensive, and renewable energy is cheap and plentiful there. According to an AP source, the Icelandic police are monitoring energy usage across the island nation in an attempt to locate the missing equipment.\nThis is not the only recent example of bitcoin-related crime spilling over into the physical world. A couple weeks back, Taiwanese police said they suspected four gangsters of violently assaulting two men and forcing them to transfer Bitcoins into the gangsters’ account.", "external_links": ["https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3369734", "https://apnews.com/55117fb55a714e909fb9aaf08841a5d6/Bitcoin-heist:-600-powerful-computers-stolen-in-Iceland"], "published": "2018-03-05T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T18:40:03.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
