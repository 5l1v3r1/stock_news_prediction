A deal is expected to materialise in the coming weeks, although no mandate has been announced.\nThe Saudi government started issuing debt in the international markets through loans and bonds two years ago in order to refill state coffers hit by a slump in oil prices.\nIt made its debut in the bond markets with a US$17.5bn issue in 2016, and raised a further US$21.5bn in 2017 through conventional and Islamic bonds.\nThe sovereign is also working with HSBC, JP Morgan and MUFG on the refinancing of its existing US$10bn syndicated loan.\nAt the same time as the DMO is meeting investors, a host of Saudi Arabian government officials and business leaders are in London as part of a Goldman Sachs conference. They include Fahad Al Saif, president of the DMO, Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority, and Khalid Al-Hussan, CEO of Saudi Stock Exchange.\nReporting by Robert Hogg and Sudip Roy, editing by Alice Gledhill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:59:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
