(Had it not been for the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, the net loss would have been $165 thousand in the quarter.) This compares with revenues of $2.9 million and a net loss of $253 thousand for the Fourth Quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues for the year ended December 30, 2017 totaled $14.6 million compared with $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss for the year totaled $1.7 million for fiscal 2017, compared with a net loss of $455 thousand for fiscal 2016. (The loss in 2017 would have been $1.1 million in the absence of the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.)\nGrant Bennett, President and CEO, said, “The loss we experienced in the Fourth Quarter, before considering the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, was due in large part to two isolated incidents which had a negative impact of $392 thousand on our bottom line: non-recurring severance costs, and sales returns due to an error by one of our plating vendors. Our vendor has accepted responsibility, is reworking the product at no cost to the Company, and the product is expected to be shipped to the customer during the First Quarter of 2018.”\nMr. Bennett continued, “The loss for the year obscures the progress we have made in 2017. At this time a year ago our annual revenue run rate had declined to $12 million. We were confident the weakness in demand we were experiencing was temporary. While we shrunk our direct labor force and kept a lid on discretionary spending, we maintained our core resources and even increased our spending in sales and marketing. Our assessment of the market has proved to be correct and, since the second quarter of 2017, we have been running at an annual revenue rate of $16 million. As we look forward we are seeing continued growth in demand and, as a result, are hiring manufacturing personnel in all three shifts. In the Fourth Quarter alone, we increased our full-time staffing from 125 to 143 to meet the demand projections of our key customers. We also made progress in our armor business during the year where we have been providing prototypes to three customers which, in each case, has the potential to result in a production order in the next 12 to 24 months. In addition to the initiatives in armor, we have continued to commit resources in both Japan and China. Although we are in the early stage of generating revenues in each of these markets, both have the potential to be among our largest markets 3-5 years from now.”\nThe Company will be hosting its fourth quarter conference call with investors at 4:30PM today.
