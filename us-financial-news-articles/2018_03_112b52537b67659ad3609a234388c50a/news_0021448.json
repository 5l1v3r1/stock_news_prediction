It hit a record low of 155.90 per dollar on Feb. 14.\n“The importer demand in early trade was offset by late exporter dollar sales,” said a currency dealer.\nDealers said trading activity could be muted on Friday as countrywide protests by Muslims over the violence are expected.\nThe rupee has weakened 1.27 percent so far this year, after declining 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nIt is expected to be pressured by continued importer demand for dollars ahead of the traditional New Year in April, dealers said.\nA gradual depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year are expected on account of debt repayments by the government, dealers added.\nThe government must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.68 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 3.2 billion rupees in the week ended Feb. 28, central bank data showed.\n$1 = 155.4000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:22:05.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
