Although the economic recovery is clearer, there are still some fragile areas, he added. He said rate differentials did not have an impact on foreign exchange rates, as the baht is hovering near four-year highs against the dollar. The BOT has left its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.50 percent, near record lows, since April 2015 as Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy has struggled to gain traction. Most economists expect no policy change for the rest of 2018, while some predict rate hikes in the second half of the year. The BOT last raised its policy rate in August 2011, a quarter-point increase to 3.50 percent.
