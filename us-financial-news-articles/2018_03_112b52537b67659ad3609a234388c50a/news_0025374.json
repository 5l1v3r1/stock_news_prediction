The latest snags mean GSK may enjoy more Advair profits for longer, although Mylan still has a chance to win a U.S. green light for its version of generic Advair in 2018.\nThe timing of the arrival of generic Advair in the United States is critical to GSK’s near-term earnings outlook. The drugmaker expects its 2018 earnings, at constant exchange rates, to be flat to down 3 percent if generic Advair launches in the U.S market by mid-year. Without generics, earnings would be up 4 to 7 percent.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler and Justin George Varghese; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T10:08:23.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
