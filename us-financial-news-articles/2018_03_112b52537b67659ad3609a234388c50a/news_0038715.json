Wilshere was told he could leave with around a month remaining in the summer transfer window but felt offers from other clubs were not enticing enough and he had yet to regain full fitness. “It was an honest conversation,” Wilshere told British media. “He (Wenger) said, ‘I am going to be honest with you and at the moment we are not going to be offering you a contract, so if you can get a contract somewhere else, you can go’. “Obviously, I was not happy with that but at the same time I was happy he was being honest.

Ideally, yes, I want it sorted as soon as possible. I want to go to the World Cup and enjoy it...,” Wilshere added. “Ideally from my point of view and the club’s point of view, they will probably want it sorted.” England play a friendly away at the Netherlands on Friday before hosting Italy four days later.
