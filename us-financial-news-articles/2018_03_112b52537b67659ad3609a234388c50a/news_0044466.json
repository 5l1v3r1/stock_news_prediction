The following data from DEVOTE in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is now included in the label:\nPrimary composite endpoint: Tresiba ® U-100 demonstrated no increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with a hazard ratio of 0.91 compared to insulin glargine U-100 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78; 1.06, p<0.001). 1 MACE in the DEVOTE trial is defined as the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, or non-fatal stroke. 1 Secondary confirmatory endpoint: Tresiba ® U-100 demonstrated 40% significantly lower rates of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) compared to insulin glargine U-100 (95% CI: 0.48; 0.76, p<0.001). 1\nBlood sugar control between the two groups was similar at baseline and throughout the trial. 1 In DEVOTE, severe hypoglycemia was defined as having a low blood sugar level that requires assistance from another person to treat.\n[For patients seeking information on Tresiba ® , please visit Tresiba.com .

In the trial, 7,637 people (Tresiba ® U-100: n=3,818, insulin glargine U-100: n=3,819) with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to once daily treatment with either Tresiba ® U-100 or insulin glargine U-100 in addition to standard of care for diabetes and cardiovascular disease for a median duration of 2 years.\nThe primary composite endpoint in DEVOTE was time from randomization to the first occurrence of a three component composite major adverse cardiovascular event, comprised of: cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke.

Additionally, people with type 2 diabetes are two to four times more likely to have cardiovascular disease than those without diabetes. 10 Type 2 diabetes is a life-long condition once diagnosed, but can be managed through a combination of lifestyle modifications like eating healthy, physical activity and oral and/or injectable medications as prescribed by a physician. 11\nAbout Novo Nordisk\nNovo Nordisk, a global healthcare company, has been committed to discovering and developing innovative medicines to help people living with diabetes lead longer, healthier lives for 95 years.
