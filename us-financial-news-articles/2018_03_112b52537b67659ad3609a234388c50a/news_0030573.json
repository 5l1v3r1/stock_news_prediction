The filing follows reports on Wednesday, March 14 th that the CEO informed employees the company would shutter all of its U.S. stores, including those in Puerto Rico. The company has so far been unable to identify a potential investor or strategic buyer, and in recent days, news emerged the company has failed to remit payments to vendors.\nThe motion also seeks to establish bidding procedures for the sale of the retailer’s Canadian division. This coincides with reports indicating that toy manufacturer MGA Entertainment, Inc. is attempting to assemble its peers in the toy making industry to bid for Toys “R” Us Canada. The Canadian division also entered bankruptcy, but is in better financial health than its U.S. counterpart. MGA Entertainment is also exploring options to make a bid for up to 200 of the retailer’s top-performing U.S. stores with the potential of merging operations with Toys “R” Us Canada.\nFor a list of CMBS with exposure to the retailer, please see our most recent report, Toys “R” Bust, Retailer Prepares to Liquidate U.S. Portfolio, which can be accessed here .
