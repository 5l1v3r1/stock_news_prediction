(NYSE:COO) today announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $590.0 million. CooperVision (CVI) revenue up 14% to $444.8 million, and CooperSurgical (CSI) revenue up 32% to $145.2 million.\nFirst quarter GAAP diluted loss per share $2.50. GAAP results include a $202.0 million net charge related to the recent enactment of U.S. tax legislation.\nFirst quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $2.79, up 86 cents or 45% from last year’s first quarter. See “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results” below.\nCommenting on the results, Robert S. Weiss, Cooper’s president and chief executive officer said, \"We're off to a very nice start this fiscal year with solid revenue growth and very strong profits. I'm excited about our continuing growth within CooperVision driven by our 1-Day silicone hydrogel and Biofinity ® franchises along with our positioning with PARAGARD ® at CooperSurgical. The future continues to look bright.”\nFirst Quarter Operating Results\nRevenue $590.0 million, up 18% from last year’s first quarter, up 4% pro forma (defined as constant currency and including acquisitions in both periods).\nGross margin 63% compared with 63% in last year’s first quarter. Gross margin was positively impacted by CooperVision (favorable currency and product mix) offset by CooperSurgical (negative impact of the inventory step-up associated with PARAGARD). On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 68% compared with 63% last year driven by improvements in both businesses.\nOperating margin 15% compared with 18% in last year’s first quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the acquisition of PARAGARD (amortization and inventory step-up) offset by improved operating results. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 28% compared with 23% last year driven by gross margin improvements.\nTotal debt increased $1,229.8 million from October 31, 2017, to $2,402.5 million, primarily due to acquisitions led by PARAGARD.\nCash provided by operations $26.2 million offset by capital expenditures $51.4 million resulted in negative free cash flow of $25.2 million. Cash generation was negatively impacted by $52.7 million from the PARAGARD acquisition (primarily buildup of trade receivables) and a $42.0 million payment to the UK taxing authorities related to the DPT inquiry associated with the prior transfer of certain Sauflon related intellectual property.\nFirst Quarter CooperVision (CVI) Operating Results\nRevenue $444.8 million, up 14% from last year’s first quarter, up 8% in pro forma.\nRevenue by category:\nPro forma (In millions) % of CVI Revenue %chg %chg 1Q18 1Q18 y/y y/y Toric $ 137.8 31 % 14 % 9 % Multifocal 46.9 11 % 11 % 5 % Single-use sphere 116.3 26 % 17 % 11 % Non single-use sphere, other 143.8 32 % 14 % 4 % Total $ 444.8 100 % 14 % 8 % Revenue by geography:\nPro forma (In millions) % of CVI Revenue %chg %chg 1Q18 1Q18 y/y y/y Americas $ 169.1 38 % 4 % 3 % EMEA 177.9 40 % 23 % 9 % Asia Pacific 97.8 22 % 20 % 15 % Total $ 444.8 100 % 14 % 8 % Gross margin 66% compared with 63% in last year’s first quarter.

Gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by the inventory step-up associated with the PARAGARD acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was 69% vs. 62% last year, driven primarily by the addition of PARAGARD.\nFiscal Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company updated its fiscal year 2018 guidance. Details are summarized as follows:\nFiscal 2018 total revenue $2,510 - $2,560 million\n- CVI revenue $1,865 - $1,900 million\n- CSI revenue $645 - $660 million\nFiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $11.70 - $11.90\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes impact of U.S. tax reform, amortization of intangible assets and other costs including integration expenses which we may incur as part of our continuing operations.\nWith respect to the Company’s guidance expectations, the Company has not reconciled non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance to GAAP diluted earnings per share due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting acquisition-related, integration and restructuring charges and expenses, which are reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP measure. Due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of such charges and expenses that impact GAAP diluted earnings per share, the Company is not able to provide such guidance.\nReconciliation of GAAP Results to Non-GAAP Results\nTo supplement our financial results and guidance presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures that we believe are helpful in understanding our results. The non-GAAP measures exclude costs which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Our non-GAAP financial results and guidance are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the factors management uses in planning and forecasting for future periods. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our consolidated operating results. Our non-GAAP financial measures may include the following adjustments, and as appropriate, the related income tax effects and changes in income attributable to noncontrolling interests:\nWe exclude the effect of amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial results. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods; however, the amounts are affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions.\nWe exclude the effect of acquisition and integration expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP financial results. Such expenses generally diminish over time with respect to past acquisitions; however, we generally will incur similar expenses in connection with any future acquisitions. We incurred significant expenses in connection with our acquisitions and also incurred certain other operating expenses or income, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as a part of our continuing operations. Acquisition and integration expenses include items such as personnel costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs and integration related professional services. Restructuring expenses include items such as employee severance, product rationalization, facility and other exit costs.\nWe exclude other exceptional or unusual charges or expenses. These can be variable and difficult to predict, such as certain litigation expenses and product transition costs, and are not what we consider as typical of our continuing operations. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe report revenue growth using the non-GAAP financial measure of pro forma which includes constant currency revenue and revenue from acquisitions in both periods. Management also presents and refers to constant currency information so that revenue results may be evaluated excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current period revenue for entities reporting in currencies other than the United States dollar are converted into United States dollars at the average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year. To report pro forma revenue growth, we include revenue for the comparison period when we did not own recently acquired companies.\nWe define the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is useful for investors as an additional measure of liquidity because it represents cash flows that are available for repayment of debt, repurchases of our common stock or to fund our strategic initiatives. Management uses free cash flow internally to understand, manage, make operating decisions and evaluate our business. In addition, we use free cash flow to help plan and forecast future periods.\nTHE COOPER COMPANIES, INC.
