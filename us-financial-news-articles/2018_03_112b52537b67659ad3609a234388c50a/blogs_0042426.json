Tellawi said his client did not dispute the events described in the indictment, but the lawyer also suggested that while Saada had a political motive, personal emotions linked to his conservative Muslim background also came into play.\n“This is a young man who, while in Lod, drank alcohol, behavior that his father learned about. When he asked his father to arrange for him to marry the woman he loved, his father refused,” Tellawi told Reuters.\n“That led my client to wake up one day and say, ‘I’ve had it with this life,’ and to find a Jew to attack.”\nTellawi said his client had “thrown away” the knife after stabbing Danino once - a possible suggestion that Saada had second thoughts about killing her.\nThe court adjourned until April 26. Tellawi said his client wanted to consider how to respond to the main charge filed against him - attempted murder during a terrorist act.\nWrapping up her testimony, Danino turned to the defendant and said her survival showed that “my God is strong, my faith is stronger than the power of your hand”.\nWriting by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T21:52:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
