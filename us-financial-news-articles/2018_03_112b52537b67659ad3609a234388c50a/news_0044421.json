We view our Revised Proposal as attractive for both sets of shareholders.\"\nThe company said a deal with U.S.-listed International Paper would expose Smurfit shareholders to the risk of greater leverage and challenges of integrating two businesses with different cultures.\nThe bid comes as growing consumer spending and the popularity of online shopping have boosted demand for packaging.\nThe company reiterated that it sees its future as an independent company, headquartered in Ireland.\nAn acquisition would allow International Paper to significantly diversify its business beyond North America.\nSmurfit, which operates in 35 countries in Europe and the Americas, recorded a slight rise in core annual profit to 1.24 billion euros ($1.5 billion) last year after a strong fourth quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:09:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
