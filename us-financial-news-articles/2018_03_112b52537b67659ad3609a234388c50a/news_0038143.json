U.S. gold futures for April delivery shot up 1.17 percent to $1,327.\nSpot gold was up 0.89 percent in the Wednesday session shortly before the Fed announced its decision.\nThe dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped 0.55 percent to 89.87 after climbing to its highest since March 1 in the previous session. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated assets such as gold cheaper for holders of other currencies.\nThe expectations for a faster pace of U.S. rate hikes have recently caused gold to fall 4 percent from a 1-1/2 year high reached in January. Higher U.S. interest rates typically reduce demand for non-yielding bullion, though analysts said that the possibility of an escalation in geopolitical tensions could cushion gold.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods by Friday, following on from tariffs he imposed this month on imported steel and aluminum.\nInvestors are worried that Trump's actions could escalate into a trade war if China and other countries retaliate, threatening global growth.\nAmong other precious metals, silver added 1.74 percent at $16.467 an ounce while platinum rose 1.06 percent at $950.50 an ounce and palladium rose 1.02 percent to $988.47 an ounce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T06:07:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
