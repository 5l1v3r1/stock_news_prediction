It also said its day-to-day operations would continue as usual during the restructuring process.\niHeartMedia said it believes its cash on hand, together with cash generated from continuing operations, will be sufficient to fund and support the business during the bankruptcy proceedings.\n“The agreement we announced today is a significant accomplishment, as it allows us to definitively address the more than $20 billion in debt that has burdened our capital structure,” said Bob Pittman, the company’s chairman and chief executive.\nDespite sluggish sales and a steady loss of listeners to new platforms, the company had avoided bankruptcy for years by pushing out debt maturities through refinancing and swaps.\nPrivate-equity firms Thomas H. Lee and Bain Capital purchased iHeart , then known as Clear Channel Communications, in 2008 on the eve of the financial crisis. The $26.7 billion deal was troubled almost from the start, and the private-equity firms had to sue its banks to stand by debt they had promised to provide for the deal.\nOver the past five years iHeartMedia has spent more on debt payments than it earns. With more than $8 billion in debt maturing next year, the company began talks with creditors on a deal to swap a big chunk of debt for some of its equity.\nThe bankruptcy filing paves the way for iHeartMedia to shed most of the debt it took on in the 2008 buyout.\nRecent talks had centered on a plan to hand 94% of the equity in iHeartMedia’s radio business and all of the equity in Clear Channel Outdoor to senior creditors led by Franklin Mutual Advisers Inc. The company and its creditors had been haggling for weeks over how much of the remaining 6% of equity in the radio business should go to the company’s junior bondholders and private-equity sponsors.\n“Regardless of the details, iHeart’s business will be substantially more valuable when it eventually emerges from bankruptcy,” said Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza.\nThe company’s radio network remains dominant in the industry, but it has like its peers failed to substantially increase revenue in recent years.\nThe company earned just enough money to make its annual debt payments, but never enough to pay down the debt from the 2008 buyout.\nThe company’s bankruptcy comes just over three months after Cumulus Media Inc., the nation’s No. 2 radio broadcaster, filed for bankruptcy. The reach of traditional radio stations remains massive, though advertising revenues have stagnated in the face of challenges from technology titans such as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\nTraditional radio stations also face competition from on-demand streaming services such as Spotify AB and Apple Inc.’s Apple Music. That leaves iHeartMedia and other radio broadcasters as the place audiences go to for costlier programming such as news, talk and sports.\nStill, iHeart says its broadcast radio stations alone reaches 271 million people in the U.S. each month, more than any other media and tech company including Facebook and Google.\nIn 2016 the company, which has offered free streaming of thousands of its radio stations since 2011, rolled out a pair of on-demand subscription music-streaming services to compete with Spotify and Apple Music. The move, however, isn’t expected to add much—if anything—to the company’s bottom line and is viewed internally as an attempt to keep listeners from migrating to rival platforms.\nJohn Malone’s Liberty Media Corp., which owns satellite-radio leader Sirius XM, has also been circling iHeartMedia, offering to pump $1.16 billion into the broadcaster in return for a 40% stake in the reorganized company. Liberty has built a position in iHeart’s debt in an effort to have a say in the company’s restructuring.\n﻿ Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as legal counsel to iHeartMedia, Moelis & Co. is serving as its investment banker and Alvarez & Marsal is serving as financial adviser, the company said Thursday. ﻿\nWrite to Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com and Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T08:22:46.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
