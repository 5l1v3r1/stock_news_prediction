The Washington Post cited a \"growing unease\" among attendees surrounding the increasing sense of economic inequality in the world. \nBridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio warned of an increased pressure on the middle class as blue-collar jobs continue to disappear and predicted that those on the lower end of the economic spectrum would turn against those in power, the Post reported . \nIn his annual letter to CEOs , BlackRock's Larry Fink wrote: \"Since the financial crisis, those with capital have reaped enormous benefits.
