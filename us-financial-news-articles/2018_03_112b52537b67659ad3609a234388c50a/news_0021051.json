The higher the oil price, the bigger the forex purchases will be.\nOn Monday, the ministry said it would decrease its daily purchases of foreign currency to the equivalent of 192.5 billion roubles ($3.37 billion) between March 7 and April 5, from 298.1 billion roubles purchased in the preceding period.
