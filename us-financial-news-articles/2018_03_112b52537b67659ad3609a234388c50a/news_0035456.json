In this newly created role, Merrill will join CEO and Founder Kathleen Shanahan to support outstanding client service , create new products and services, and expand new business growth. Merrill’s enviable track record as an agency executive and deep experience working with technology innovators are an ideal match for BOCA as it enters its next phase. This appointment comes on the heels of BOCA also making a move from its roots in North Beach to prestigious Union Square.\nMerrill’s career is marked by a number of professional successes, including senior roles at top PR and communications firms. Most recently, he served as managing director at ICR, a strategic communications and advisory firm, where he ran the West Coast technology PR practice. Prior to ICR, Merrill spent 15 years with Schwartz Communications, a leading independent technology PR agency. There, he served as senior vice president before taking the role as managing director of the agency’s San Francisco office.\n“Merrill is a trusted advisor and has been a mentor from my past days at Schwartz Communications, where we worked with each other for years,” said Kathleen Shanahan, CEO and founder of BOCA Communications. “His experience leading and growing a $30 million PR agency, coupled with his reputation for outstanding client service, will be critical to achieving our ambitious goals and taking BOCA to the next level. I am delighted he accepted the position, and look forward to working with him and other senior BOCA members to help lead the company to new heights.”\nKathleen founded BOCA in December 2008 as an independent consultancy where she advised CEOs on their marketing communication strategy. In 2010, she decided it was time to build a reputable digital PR agency, and since that time BOCA has been a fixture in the San Francisco agency landscape, representing clients ranging from disruptive innovators to publicly traded companies in B2B high tech, digital health and life sciences.\nKathleen’s career in PR spans roles both in-house and at various small and large agencies. With BOCA, Kathleen drew on that experience to create a unique organization that bucks the typical agency structure. Clients benefit from experienced and strategic PR professionals that are specialists in media, highly curated content and digital content .\n“Kathleen and her team have built a unique agency with a talented group of PR professionals and a who’s who list of clients,” said Merrill. “This role is a tremendous opportunity to work with her again, join an amazing team and lend a fresh perspective to complement the agency’s current point of view. I look forward to delivering great work for our clients to achieve their business and marketing goals.”\nAbout BOCA Communications\nBOCA Communications is a digital agency that delivers communications, content and digital insight for its roster of large and small B2B high-tech and life sciences clients.
