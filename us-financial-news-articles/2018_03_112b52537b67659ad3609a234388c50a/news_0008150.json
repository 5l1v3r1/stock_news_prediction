Despite strong support for far-right, anti-establishment and euroskeptic parties in Italy, the currency seemed immune to the political uncertainty in the third-largest euro economy.\n\"The reaction in FX (fixed income) markets to the eurosceptic shift in Italy so far has been muted, as investors await more clarity on the composition of the next government,\" Danske Bank said in a note on Monday morning.\nThe parliamentary elections in Italy are likely to lead to a hung parliament , sparking weeks of negotiations between the political parties. According to preliminary results, the Five Star Movement is set to be the largest political force, but a right-wing coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia is set to win the most seats.\n\"We don't know what's going to happen with this government and we are really waiting to see who will try to form a coalition,\" David Zahn, head of European Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group, told CNBC on Monday.\nAccording to Zahn, the worst outcome for markets would be a coalition between the populist Five Star Movement and the far-right Lega, formerly known as the Northern League.\nshow chapters Franklin Templeton: Don't expect dramatic impact on Italian bonds 12 Hours Ago | 03:21 \"They should have enough votes between them to actually form a coalition,\" he said, noting that this is \"highly unlikely\" as both parties have said previously they would not be joining forces.
