Core profit, which excludes revaluation gains, grew to HK$34.3 billion ($4.4 billion) last year but lagged a Thomson Reuters StarMine Smart Estimate of HK$36.8 billion drawn from a poll of 25 analysts. Revenue edged up 1.2 percent to HK$166 billion. Many major Chinese property developers are widely expected to book their best-ever profits for 2017 on record sales, as industry consolidation has brought economies of scale that have helped developers minimise the impact of government measures. China’s seventh-largest developer by sales said it is aiming for a 25 percent increase in contracted sales for 2018, targeting HK$290 billion. China Overseas Land said in a statement it did not expect there to be any let-up in property regulation. “Mainland China’s policy will accelerate financial de-leveraging and further tightening of loan credit, which will adversely impact sales and cash collections in the property industry,” it also said. $1 = 7.8484 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Clare Jim; Editing by Edwina Gibbs", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T08:36:45.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
