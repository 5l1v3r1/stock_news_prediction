She has denied the allegations.\n“The charges are entirely baseless and malicious,” Tauli-Corpuz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview.\n“The government sees this as an opportunity to pursue people they don’t like. I am worried for my safety and the safety of others on the list, including several rights activists.”\nLocal and international organizations have slammed the Philippine government’s action, with New York-based Human Rights Watch calling the petition “a virtual government hit list”.\nTwo other U.N. special rapporteurs expressed “grave concern” about Tauli-Corpuz being on the list, and said she was being punished by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for speaking out against some of his policies.\nIn December, Tauli-Corpuz said thousands of indigenous people had been forcibly displaced from their homes in Mindanao, in the south of the country, and asked authorities to end abuses against them that had escalated under military operations.\n“The petition is really an attempt to quell criticism and opposition to the administration,” Tauli-Corpuz, said on Saturday.\n“It’s to distract attention from the abuses,” the indigenous leader from the Kankanaey Igorot people of the Philippines’ Cordillera region, said.\nThe Philippines was the deadliest country in Asia last year for defenders of land and resources amidst a government crackdown on rural communities, according to advocacy group PAN Asia Pacific.\nKillings and other forms of repression targeting farmers, indigenous people and activists “spiked dramatically”, it said.\n“The Philippine government regularly and increasingly threatens and harasses indigenous peoples,” said Julie Koch, executive director at advocacy group International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA).\nThe petition “is taking it to a whole new level,” she said in a statement.\nThe Philippine foreign minister hit back at the U.N. human rights chief on Saturday for issuing “irresponsible and disrespectful” comments about the president.\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein told a news conference on Friday that Duterte’s attacks against U.N. human rights activists suggest he needs to see a psychiatrist.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
