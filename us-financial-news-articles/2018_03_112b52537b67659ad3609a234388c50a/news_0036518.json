(OTC PINK: GPLS) , doing business as CannCo Brands & Development (the \"Cannco\" or “Company”) announced today that it has reached agreement to acquire all of the assets related to www.THCFinder.com .\nFormed in 2009, www.THCFinder.com is an advertising and marketing site that geo-targets dispensaries, delivery services, and cannabis related physicians offices.\nMarcus Laun, CEO of GeoPulse, states, “We believe THCFinder is a tremendous, undervalued asset to integrate into CannCo Brands & Development. Having been in operation almost ten years, it’s grown organically. With the acquisition CannCo will invest in the platform’s technology, representing an excellent opportunity to aggressively expand a well-established and respected geotarget site for the cannabis sector throughout the US.“\n“We also believe that in light of the State of California’s recent activities relating to the enforcement of the State laws which prevent illegal marketing of unlicensed dispensaries, we feel our timing to acquire and expand THCFinder.com is perfect. THCFinder.com has an active customer base, a solid platform and with our acquisition, the ability to grow and cross pollenate our clients with our soon to be acquired Stonerdays.com . We are extremely excited to now have two pending acquisitions including www.StonerDays.com and www.THCFinder.com ,” continued Mr. Laun.\nRubin Granabos, founder of THCFinder.com , states, “We’ve seen many companies try to compete in the cannabis finder site industry with very few that have withstood the test of time. We truly believe with Marcus’s insight and direction we can become one of the largest geo-finder sites in north America. We can’t wait to get started on our expansion.”\nAbout THCFinder.com\nTHC Finder helps medical marijuana patients find better access to reliable and safe medication and provides a platform for patients to interact and feel at ease in a community of users.
