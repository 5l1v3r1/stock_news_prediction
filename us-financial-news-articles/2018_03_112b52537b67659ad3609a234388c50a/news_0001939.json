(CAI) (NYSE: CAI), announced today that its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CAL Funding III Limited (“CAL Funding III”), issued on February 28, 2018 $332,000,000 of 3.96% Series 2018-1 Fixed Rate Asset-Backed Notes, Class A (“Series 2018-1 Notes Class A”) and $16,900,000 of 4.80% Series 2018-1 Fixed Rate Asset-Backed Notes, Class B (“Series 2018-1 Notes Class B”).\nThe Series 2018-1 Notes Class A and the Series 2018-1 Notes Class B, are rated “A” and “BBB”, respectively, by Standard & Poor’s. The Series 2018-1 Notes have a scheduled maturity date of February 25, 2028 and a legal final maturity date of February 25, 2039.\nVictor Garcia, President and Chief Executive Officer of CAI, commented, “We are very pleased to have concluded another successful securitized note offering. The offering experienced strong demand with more than two times oversubscription to our issuance amount. With the completion of this transaction, our fixed rate debt now represents approximately 60% of our total outstanding debt, enabling us to significantly reduce our exposure to the current rising interest rate environment.”\nMr. Garcia continued, “In general, we believe that a rising interest rate environment is positive for CAI as it allows us more flexibility to renew our expiring leases at higher rates and helps support utilization by making existing in-fleet equipment less expensive to our customers than new equipment that is priced with an embedded higher interest rate. The transaction will have minimal effect on CAI’s first quarter interest expense.”\nAdditional information on CAI's results, the state of the industry, as well as its view of the effect of higher interest rates on its business, is available in a presentation posted today on the \"Investors\" section of CAI's website, www.capps.com .\nAbout CAI International, Inc.\nCAI is one of the world’s leading transportation finance and logistics companies. As of December 31, 2017, CAI operated a worldwide fleet of approximately 1.3 million CEUs of containers, and owned a fleet of 7,172 railcars that it leases within North America.
