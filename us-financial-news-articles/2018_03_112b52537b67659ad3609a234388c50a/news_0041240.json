These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Equity’s management with respect to, among other things, future events and Equity’s financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “will likely result,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “goal,” “target,” “would” and “outlook,” or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Equity’s industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Equity’s control. Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses, and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.\nFor discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 16, 2018 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, Form S-3 or Form S-4. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Equity’s underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Equity anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Equity does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition, Equity cannot assess the impact of each factor on Equity’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Equity or persons acting on Equity’s behalf may issue.\nMedia Contact:\nJohn Hanley\nSVP, Director of Marketing\n913-583-8004\njhanley@equitybank.com\nInvestor Contact:\nJacob Willis\nInvestor Relations Officer\n316-775-1675\njwillis@equitybank.com\ninvestor.equitybank.com\nSource:Equity Bancshares, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TS_dYt7l7PecpARRbFI5bb-uTfcQC9C_QHRz3TCrkf07hla_ud18ab0ZPFTk3BadCDOrQ8tu2DIz4XK64hzilA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wNeCP86LlvftBvi0hzlQJZ-zQZy8UcuZVw9qRcKmS8wh64v_eMb3O48r1hsNLZ37bN1UPZCYPstwOpOG7ggqvMB34LNrF6EElcYOxw6Y3d8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gOfVH3u56I9Ol0pnnxtZ1nNykfvdtE3-xcccpT9S3xLEYRFD7yfGGoD_yinLliohW7pFe13rRkMdfkEFKn_Bg8iGqRvsIXxrITD4elXVQtA=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lZ_a5aKuyMAmXa98mWYvoHjz2oAlefwNkho5YrhDip-51YZ2CT9r6eZZEaaJfG0oTTwutZq6OCCIFjMeO--z0HGgtX6gJkL8Mhj067vv0AWZBHjKwWQmSxXZh0ajxq-2Iu_9m4nqFdQhMzBeYKYTDXWWhhntaYeFb3UFxGcKHqTB760f8lmBoVnFHM4jiNys9jIv333QlopqoviAoWXfvGgDhqbM5Y9UeHIhFB1LDbK9dqNVEQCGsNzkeiH1FHGD", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/670facce-bee6-477f-8363-2656efd1d6b3"], "published": "2018-03-21T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T00:29:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
