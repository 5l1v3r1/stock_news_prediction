As the local volunteer leader for Light the Night, Baiden will lead efforts to accelerate corporate support and drive revenue growth to advance LLS's ultimate goal of creating a world without blood cancers. Baiden's vast experience in strategic sales and marketing, along with connection to the local oncology community make him an ideal choice for the role.\n\"Light The Night is a truly spectacular event that is meaningful to patients and their families in so many ways,\" Baiden said. \"I am honored to serve as the Corporate Walk Chair and look forward to encouraging local businesses and corporations to join me and Avella in supporting LLS as we take significant steps together to end cancer.\"\nPhoenix-based Avella, one of the nation's largest specialty pharmacies, has been a sponsor of Light the Night in Phoenix and Tucson for several years and is dedicated to empowering patients, providers and other organizations – like LLS – across the entire healthcare continuum. LLS has invested more than $1 billion in cutting-edge research to advance therapies and, thanks to this investment, survival rates for patients with many blood cancers have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled since the early 1960s. Yet, despite these advances, about one third of patients with blood cancer still do not survive even five years after their diagnosis.\nThe Greater Phoenix Light The Night will be held on Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018, at Phoenix Municipal Stadium.
