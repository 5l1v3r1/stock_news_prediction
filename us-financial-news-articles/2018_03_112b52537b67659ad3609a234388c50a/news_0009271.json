French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian delivers a speech during a foreign ministers’ meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, France, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer “The will for a ceasefire is for everybody, all of Syria. We need to say it because we will all be mobilised in the coming days on the question of eastern Ghouta, but the truce applies to all, including Afrin,” Jean-Yves Le Drian told parliament’s foreign affairs committee. He said French authorities had repeated this to Turkish officials and told them France regretted the intervention against Kurdish militants in the Afrin region and advised Ankara “put an end to it.” Reporting by John Irish; editing by Michel Rose", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T19:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T21:27:44.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
