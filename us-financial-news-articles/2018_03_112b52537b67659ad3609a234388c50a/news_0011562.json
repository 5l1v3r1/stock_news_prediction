Stocks across the globe rose after four days of declines, with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 higher as fears of a trade war eased. The local share price index futures rose 1.1 percent, or 64 points, to 5,948, a 53-point premium to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark fell 0.6 percent in the previous session. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.3 percent in early trade.
