Sources also told the Journal that Amazon is nearing a $1 billion deal to construct three data centers there. \nNasser said he could not reveal any more about Aramco's discussions with tech firms, except to say that the company is keen on cloud computing and is hunting for opportunities to enter the market. \nSaudi Aramco has already been using data analytics to improve its operations, according to Nasser. \n\"It's something that we have been doing a lot of work on, and we will continue to work with our partners also to expand our operation and increase our efficiency and also cut our costs,\" he said. \nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old spearheading the kingdom's economic transformation plan, is expected to visit the United States later this month. \nLast year, Saudi Arabia announced tens of billions of dollars worth of deals during President Donald Trump's trip to Riyadh and during Prince Mohammed's visit to China. \nSaudi Arabia plans to raise about $100 billion by selling shares of Aramco on the public market. The proceeds would underwrite the expansion of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and its plans to diversify its economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T13:33:20.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
