(NYSE: GTT), the leading global cloud networking provider to multinational clients, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter highlights:\nRevenue of $249.2 million grew 80.7% over 4Q16 and grew 23.0% over 3Q17. Net loss was $49.5 million, compared to net loss of $0.9 million in 4Q16 and net loss of $9.5 million in 3Q17. The 4Q17 net loss was primarily the result of several nonrecurring costs, including: $5.8 million in exit, transaction and integration costs related to the Global Capacity and Transbeam acquisitions; $17.3 million of tax expense related to the change in U.S. tax law; and $29.0 million of tax expense related to the recording of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) of $60.8 million grew 79.8% over 4Q16 and grew 8.0% over 3Q17. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.4% compared to 24.5% in 4Q16 and 27.8% in 3Q17. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin is due to the inclusion of Global Capacity for a full quarter in 4Q17. Capital expenditures were $15.2 million (6.1% of revenue), compared to $6.4 million in 4Q16 (4.6% of revenue) and $9.1 million in 3Q17 (4.5% of revenue). Using constant currency: (i) 4Q17 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA would have been lower than reported by $2.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively, compared to 4Q16; and (ii) 4Q17 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA would have been lower than reported by $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, compared to 3Q17.\nFull year highlights:\nRevenue of $827.9 million grew 57.0% over 2016. Net loss was $71.5 million compared to net income of $5.3 million in 2016. The 2017 net loss was primarily related to nonrecurring costs, including: $41.5 million in exit, transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of Hibernia, Perseus, Global Capacity and Transbeam; $8.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt from the term loan repricing; $17.3 million of tax expense related to the change in U.S. tax law; and $29.0 million related to the recording of a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. Adjusted EBITDA of $221.7 million grew 77.2% over 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.8% grew 310 basis points over 2016. Capital expenditures were $42.0 million (5.1% of revenue) compared to $24.2 million in 2016 (4.6% of revenue). Using constant currency, 2017 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA would have been higher than reported by $3.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, compared to 2016. On a pro forma basis, assuming: (i) Hibernia Network’s and Global Capacity’s historical results had been included for all periods presented; and (ii) constant currency: 4Q17 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.3% and 11.1%, respectively, over 4Q16. 4Q17 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew 1.5% and 5.2%, respectively, over 3Q17. 2017 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.4% and 14.4%, respectively, over 2016.\nRevenue and cost of revenue includes $5.6 million and $17.4 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, related to Federal Universal Services Fund and similar taxes and surcharges, which are now reported on a gross basis. Previously, these taxes and surcharges had been reported on a net basis. Revenue and cost of revenue have been adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the change in methodology.\nSee “Annex A: Non-GAAP Financial Information” for more information regarding the computation of Adjusted EBITDA, constant currency and pro forma calculations.\n“Our results demonstrate continued execution against our growth strategy,” stated Rick Calder, GTT president and chief executive officer. “With the acquisition of Interoute, which we announced earlier this week, we are excited to lead GTT into its next chapter of growth and further enhance our position as the most disruptive player in our industry.”\n“2017 was an incredible year for GTT, and 2018 is off to a great start,” stated Mike Sicoli, chief financial officer. “We remain focused on rapid growth and progressing toward our next financial objectives of $2 billion in revenue and $550 million in Adjusted EBITDA.”\nConference Call Information\nGTT will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.

ANNEX A: Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), from time to time we may use or publicly disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in the course of our financial presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls and otherwise. For these purposes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) defines a non-GAAP financial measure as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions or cash flows that: (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in financial statements; and (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors to provide an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allow us and our investors to better evaluate our performance and profitability. These measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for GAAP, and they may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude severance, restructuring and other exit costs, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, losses on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation and, from time to time, other non-cash or nonrecurring items.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance, and this financial measure is among the primary measures we use for planning and forecasting future periods. We further believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management and makes it easier to compare our results with the results of other companies that have different financing and capital structures. In addition, we have debt covenants that are based on a leverage ratio that utilizes a modified EBITDA calculation, as defined in our Credit Agreement. The modified EBITDA calculation is similar to our definition of Adjusted EBITDA; however, it includes the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of and expected cost synergies from the companies acquired by us during the applicable reporting period. Finally, Adjusted EBITDA results, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are utilized by management and our compensation committee for purposes of determining bonus payouts to our employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures\nAdjusted EBITDA less purchases of property and equipment, which we also refer to as capital expenditures, is a performance measure that is used to evaluate the appropriate level of capital expenditures needed to support our expected revenue and to provide a comparable view of our performance relative to other telecommunications companies that may utilize different strategies for providing access to fiber-based services and related infrastructure. We use a “capex light” strategy, which means we purchase last-mile services and select core IP network services from other providers on an as-needed basis, pursuant to our customers’ requirements. Many other telecommunications companies spend significant amounts of capital to construct their own fiber networks and data centers and attempt to purchase as little as possible from other providers. As a result of our strategy, we typically have lower Adjusted EBITDA margins compared to other providers but also spend much less on capital expenditures relative to our revenue. We believe it is important to take both of these factors into account when evaluating our performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures from net (loss) income (amounts in millions):\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Adjusted EBITDA Net (loss) income $ (49.5 ) $ (0.9 ) $ (71.5 ) $ 5.3 Provision for income taxes 40.0 3.6 17.3 3.9 Interest and other expense, net 20.4 7.8 71.0 30.0 Loss on debt extinguishment -\n-\n8.6 1.6 Depreciation and amortization 37.9 16.6 132.6 62.8 Severance, restructuring and other exit costs 0.5 -\n22.4 0.9 Transaction and integration costs 5.3 1.7 19.1 4.8 Share-based compensation 6.2 5.0 22.2 15.8 Adjusted EBITDA 60.8 33.8 221.7 125.1 Purchases of property and equipment (15.2 ) (6.4 ) (42.0 ) (24.2 ) Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures $ 45.6 $ 27.4 $ 179.7 $ 100.9 Constant Currency\nWe evaluate our results of operations both as reported and on a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency data offers valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. We calculate constant currency results by converting our current-period local currency financial results using prior-period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior-period reported results.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, from time to time we may use or publicly disclose certain “pro forma” financial measures in the course of our financial presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls and otherwise. We believe these certain pro forma financial measures provide a more comparable view of our results relative to prior periods, particularly given the number of acquisitions we have completed in the past.\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information and related notes present the historical information of GTT as if the acquisitions of Hibernia Networks (“Hibernia”) and Global Capacity had occurred on the first day of the period presented.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2016, the following unaudited financial
