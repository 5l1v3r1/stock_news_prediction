Toys ‘R’ Us Inc said earlier in the day that it would shutter or sell its stores in the United States after failing to find a buyer or reach a deal to restructure its debt. The liquidation is expected to be most disruptive in 2018, Hasbro said in an email. The iconic toy retailer accounted for about 9 percent of Hasbro’s global sales in 2017, according to analysts. Hasbro’s shares were down 1.1 percent at $87.52 in afternoon trading. Shares of rival Mattel Inc dropped nearly 3 percent to $13.78. Toys ‘R’ Us accounted for about 11 percent of the company’s sales in 2017, analysts estimated.
