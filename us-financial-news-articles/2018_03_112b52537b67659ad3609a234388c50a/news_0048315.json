Smart Estimates give greater weighting to more accurate analysts.\nRevenue rose 11.9 percent to 60.16 billion yuan. Gross profit margin increased 2.4 percentage points from a year ago to 35.2 percent amid relatively low raw milk prices and an improving product mix.\nChief Executive Officer Jeffrey Lu said the company would look for opportunities from rising consumption of mid- to high-end products such as yoghurt, as well as the growing popularity of milk products among younger consumers.\n“Mengniu will follow closely the trend of consumption upgrade and move toward the middle and higher end of the value chain,” he said in a statement.\nMengniu also said the dairy industry was looking at a revival of sales of liquid milk and milk powder amid a recovery in consumer confidence and the roll-out of China’s two-child policy. Looking forward, Lu said the dairy product industry was “expected to maintain relatively fast growth in the next 5 to 10 years”.\nMengniu is stepping up development and sales of premium products that are gaining favour with Chinese consumers and is working with partners like Danone Group and Arla Foods to bring more dairy goods to China.\n$1 = 6.2781 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:16:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
