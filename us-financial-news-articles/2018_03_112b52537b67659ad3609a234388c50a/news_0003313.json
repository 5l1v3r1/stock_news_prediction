FILE PHOTO: A HNA Group logo is seen on the building of HNA Plaza in Beijing, China February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo HNA bought a 25 percent stake in Park Hotels as part of its $6.5 billion (4.7 billion pounds) deal to buy a 25 percent stake in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc from biggest shareholder Blackstone Group LP in 2016. That stake in Park Hotels is currently valued at $1.4 billion. “The exact timing, manner and terms of any such sale would be subject to market conditions and other considerations,” said the Park Hotels filing to the U.S. securities regulator on Friday. HNA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. In recent months, HNA has raced to alleviate severe financial strain following a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years, which has sparked scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.
