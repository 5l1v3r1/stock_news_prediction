(RHO, LP), and merged it with retail macadamia nut brand, MacFarms . The merger poises Buderim to become the largest marketer of macadamia nuts in the continental U.S. Currently, Royal Hawaiian Orchards and Buderim are Hawaii’s largest and second largest macadamia nut orchard owners, respectively, and are responsible for more than 65 percent of macadamia nut production in the U.S. combined.\n“This transformational acquisition creates a platform for us to become a global leader in macadamia nut snacks,” said Andrew Bond, chief executive officer at Buderim Group Limited. “Leading the U.S. market – where there is significant growth potential for this healthy, nutrient-rich snack – will help us lay the groundwork for making our macadamia nuts a household staple across the world.”\nA “Fresh From Hawaii” brand, MacFarms produces snackable macadamia nuts ranging from Sea Salt to Milk Chocolate. Royal Hawaiian Orchards offers a vast portfolio of delicious macadamia nut-based snacks that are free of GMOs and gluten, including Roasted Macadamia Nuts, Macadamia Nut Milk, Dark Chocolate Covered Macadamia Nuts and Fruit & Macadamia Nut Crunches.\nScott Wallace, executive vice president at MacFarms, will lead the combined business and oversee sales, marketing and operations. Wallace was previously the executive vice president at Royal Hawaiian Macadamia Nut and formerly served as president of Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut until 2001. In 2017, Wallace lead the charge for Royal Hawaiian Orchards to gain approval for a Qualified Health Claim from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, allowing marketers to claim that consuming macadamia nuts can help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease under certain circumstances.\n“I believe this is a genuinely exciting opportunity that creates a win-win for consumers, customers, suppliers and employees of both brands,” stated Wallace.\nMacFarms’ products are widely available in Hawaii and Costco locations around the world, while Royal Hawaiian Orchards’ products are available in thousands of stores throughout the U.S., including Whole Foods Market and 7-Eleven.\nAbout Buderim Group Limited\nBuderim Group Limited , together with its subsidiaries, manufactures and distributes confectionery ginger and other ginger-based products to industrial, food service, and retail customers worldwide.
