Wind gusts of more than 90 miles per hour downed trees and power lines a day earlier.\nAlmost 2.4 million homes and businesses had no power in the Northeast and Midwest early on Saturday. Some utility companies warned customers that power might not be restored until later in the day or Sunday.\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a states of emergency.\n“Please use common sense, heed all warnings, and stay inside and off the roads if possible,” Hogan said in a statement.\nFalling trees killed five people, including two boys, across the region, according to local media and police.\nPrivate forecasting service AccuWeather said the storm dumped as much as 18 inches (46 cm) of snow on parts of New York state and Pennsylvania.\nIt also snarled transportation from the Middle Atlantic into New England, with more than a quarter of flights into and out of New York’s three major airports and Boston’s airport canceled, tracking service FlightAware.com reported.\nOne flight landing at Washington’s Dulles International Airport came in through turbulence so rough that most passengers became sick and the pilots were on the verge of becoming ill, the Federal Aviation Administration said.\nPassenger railroad Amtrak worked to restore service across the region as it removed down tress on tracks. Amtrak said it canceled more than a dozen trains and modified its schedule in the Northeast on Saturday.\nAdditional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:53:47.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
