Bern wants the same treatment as other countries, enabling EU investors to trade in Switzerland.\nDiplomats say the mood has brightened considerably since Bern laid out this month its negotiating position on a new treaty Brussels wants that would formalise ties currently governed by a patchwork of bilateral sectoral accords.\nIt marked the first time that the seven cabinet members from four parties had agreed on a unified platform for talks, a major step forward after their squabbling hampered years of negotiations and frustrated top EU officials.\nBrussels has put pressure on Switzerland to sign a treaty that would see it adopt EU laws governing the single market as the price of enhanced access. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) would give its opinion on disputes involving how to interpret single-market rules.\nThis is anathema to the anti-immigration Swiss People’s Party, the largest in parliament, which has two cabinet seats.\nMany Swiss conservatives are also wary of giving “foreign judges” such power, but both sides have now focused on setting up arbitration panels to help break the impasse.\n$1 = 0.9506 Swiss francs Reporting by Michael Shields Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T16:04:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
