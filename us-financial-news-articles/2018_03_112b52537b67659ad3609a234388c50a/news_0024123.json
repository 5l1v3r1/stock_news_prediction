Emmaculate Reflections will be an operating division of KBS and will continue to utilize its brand.\nMark Minasian, chief executive officer and co-founder of KBS stated, \"Our interest and ultimate investment into Emmaculate Reflections was in part based on work we'd done which clearly indicated that the large and growing chain restaurant sector, ranging from fast casual to fine dining, was woefully underserved, leaving large, sophisticated chains in need of contract services providers capable of delivering consistent brand standards across locations and geographies. Emmaculate has codified a scalable and repeatable process for ensuring high standards day in and day out across their more than 1,000 customer locations, and they've done it successfully for over 20 years. They service some of the best known and operated chains in North America. Their operating discipline and persistence resonated with us, and combining Emmaculate's end market expertise with our scale, IT and resources is very exciting. This acquisition will provide local, regional and national service solutions to those large-scale clients who are seeking multi-unit, multi-region service solutions. That was the industrial logic. Equally, if not more important, was the people piece of this deal. I've had the opportunity to get to know the founders over the past two years, and the passion and commitment they show toward their customers and people hit home and is culturally aligned with who we are at KBS. Jerry Donath, Lenny Feinstein and Bob Fiestal have toiled for decades building this outstanding service brand and in the process, built a culture that puts customer satisfaction first while always taking great care of their people. We warmly welcome the Emmaculate team aboard.\"\nEmmaculate Co-founder Lenny Feinstein stated, \"We couldn't be happier to be partnering with Mark and his team at KBS. This merger is a great moment for our business because it creates more service and geographic options for our customers and more opportunity for our people.\"\nCo-founder Jerry Donath continued, \"I totally agree. Lenny and I are excited and will continue to run the business day-to-day as we always have, but now we have the full backing of KBS and their resources, which means we can say 'yes' to customers in new markets when and where they need us. That's great for our customers, our people and our newly combined company.\"\nEmmaculate Reflections provides janitorial services for restaurants and other food service establishments, as well as hotel and country club cleaning services. Other cleaning services include pressure cleaning, carpet cleaning, specialized floor cleaning, stainless cleaning, hood and filter cleaning, event staffing, and dusting programs.\nHoon Cho, managing director of GI Partners, majority owner of KBS, stated, \"The KBS acquisition of Emmaculate Reflections is the fifth closing in the past twelve months and is a continuation of the technology-enabled consolidation that we set out just over three years ago. In every instance, KBS has transacted with best-in-class operators in their respective service lines and end markets, and Emmaculate clearly meets those high standards. We are very happy to welcome Jerry, Lenny and their team. We look forward to another smooth integration, putting the power of the KBS platform together with this fine brand. We congratulate the KBS and Emmaculate teams on this terrific new venture.\"\nAbout Emmaculate Reflections Cleaning Service\nEmmaculate Reflections Cleaning Service is a full service company providing the highest quality, most cost-effective janitorial services to the food service, restaurant, entertainment and hospitality industries.
