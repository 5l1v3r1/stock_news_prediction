Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.\nMost Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic. Analysts on average expect Apple’s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAnalysts covering Amazon on average expect its stock to rise 10 percent within the next year to reach $1,700, which would give it a market value of $823 billion.\nApple on Thursday was up 0.60 percent at $176.05, while Amazon rose 0.31 percent to $1,549.90.\nReporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T01:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:13:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
