By chance it equalled Mike Powell’s best indoor mark because this was a contest that resembled the great jousts between the American and his compatriot Carl Lewis.\nThe bronze went to defending champion Marquis Dendy, who leapt 8.42 to complete a full set of personal bests by the medallists.\nIn winning, Echevarria joins a long list of Cuban jumpers led by five-times indoor champion Ivan Pedroso, who still holds the championship record of 8.62.\nFittingly, he received his medal from Alberto Juantorena, Cuba’s Olympic gold medallist in the 400 and 800 metres in 1976.\n“I think I’m in the peak of my career,” said Echevarria.“I’m feeling very physically strong. Birmingham has been great to me and the atmosphere has been fantastic and I’m really looking forward to what 2018 holds.”\nAthletics - IAAF World Indoor Championships 2018 - Arena Birmingham, Birmingham, Britain - March 2, 2018 Gold Medalist Cuba's Juan Miguel Echevarria, silver medalist South Africa's Luvo Manyonga and bronze medalist Marquis Dendy of the U.S. celebrate on the podium during the medals ceremony for the Men's Long Jump Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley There will almost certainly be more to come from Echevarria, with former Olympic champion Greg Rutherford predicting that a new star had been born.\n“At 19, that was something special,” said Rutherford, who was commentating for the BBC after missing the event through injury.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “Generally, jumpers put on 20 or 30cms outside so we should see a great summer. It was a great showcase for the sport.”\nEchevarria had announced his intention to compete for medals in Birmingham by posting 8.34 in finishing behind Manyonga in Metz earlier this month, following up with a solid 8.20 last time out.\nIn Birmingham, he got steadily better, opening with 8.19 and following with jumps of 8.28, 8.36 and then, finally, 8.46.\nThere was always the suspicion that even that might not be enough against Manyonga, who threatened to jump through the end of the pit on more than one occasion.\nLooking unflustered, Manyonga knew that as an athlete, and as a man who has battled drug addiction, greater challenges had been conquered and the result was in doubt right to the finale, when Manyonga registered his fourth no jump.\nPredictably, the South African departed with a smile and a sense of perspective.“I tried to get the gold but I did well to get a personal best,” he said.\nReporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T06:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T01:01:29.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
