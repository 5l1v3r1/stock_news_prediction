On October 5, 2017, the Company sold its 30.1 per cent ownership interest in Dye & Durham Corporation (“D&D”) for $25 million, representing a $15.4 million accounting gain before tax. On December 21, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary ESC Corporate Services Ltd. (“ESC”), acquired AVS Systems Inc. (“AVS”) for $25.0 million in cash on closing, with up to $20.0 million in additional consideration contingent on the realization of future business.\nYear-end 2017 Highlights\nRevenue of $93.6 million compared to $88.4 million in 2016, up 5.9%.

(“ERS“) in January, Alliance Online Solutions in June and as noted in the fourth quarter highlights, AVS in December. As also noted, the Company sold its 30.1 per cent ownership interest in D&D for $25 million.\nFinancial Position as at December 31, 2017\nCash of $31.3 million compared to $33.5 million as at December 31, 2016, down 6.6%.

Not only did we deliver increased revenue, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, but we also made two significant acquisitions, which is consistent with our strategy of acquiring companies with competencies or operations in our industry space.” Stusek continued, “Our subsidiaries ESC and ERS are delivering organic growth, while our Registries business continues to demonstrate its resilience in the face of economic challenge. I look forward to the year ahead as we continue to execute on our strategy to deliver shareholder value.”\nManagement’s Discussion of ISC’s Summary of Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2017 Financial Results\n(thousands of CAD dollars;\nexcept earnings per share\nand where noted)\nThree Months\nEnded Dec 31,\n2017\nThree Months\nEnded Dec 31,\n2016\nYear Ended\nDec 31, 2017\nYear Ended\nDec 31, 2016\nRevenue - Registries Land Registry $ 13,762 $ 13,038 $ 54,792 $ 54,921 Personal Property Registry 2,294 2,273 9,953 9,947 Corporate Registry 2,468 2,254 10,143 9,082 Total $ 18,524 $ 17,565 $ 74,888 $ 73,950 Revenue - Services 4,035 3,427 14,902 13,639 Revenue - Other 1,030 209 3,802 786 TOTAL Revenue $ 23,589 $ 21,201 $ 93,592 $ 88,375 Expenses $ 17,539 $ 18,248 $ 71,694 $ 67,929 EBITDA 1 $ 7,842 $ 6,833 $ 30,015 $ 29,529 EBITDA margin 1 (% of revenue) 33.2 % 32.2 % 32.1 % 33.4 % Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 8,954 $ 7,336 $ 33,403 $ 33,454 Adjusted EBITDA margin 1 38.0 % 34.6 % 35.7 % 37.9 % Net income $ 18,774 $ 2,919 $ 27,789 $ 15,503 Earnings per share (basic) 2 $ 1.07 $ 0.17 $ 1.59 $ 0.89 Earnings per share, (diluted) 2 $ 1.07 $ 0.17 $ 1.58 $ 0.88 Free cash flow 1,3 $ 2,804 $ 4,084 $ 22,918 $ 19,993 EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow are not recognized as measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore, are not comparable to similar measures reported by other corporations. Refer to section “Non-IFRS Measures” in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2017 EBITDA figure does not include the gain from our sale of ownership in D&D. We base the calculation of earnings per share on net income after tax and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. ISC has changed the recognition of current income taxes within the definition of free cash flow to equal the balance recognized on the statement of comprehensive income. Comparative figures for previous years have been updated accordingly.\n2017 Results of Operations\nTotal revenue was $93.6 million, up $5.2 million (+5.9%) compared to 2016. Registries segment revenue was $74.9 million, up $0.9 million (+1.3%) compared to 2016. Land Registry revenue was $54.8 million, down $0.1 million (-0.2%) versus 2016. Personal Property Registry stable at $10.0 million (+0.1%) compared to 2016. Corporate Registry revenue was $10.1 million, up $1.0 million (+ 11.7%) compared to 2016. Services segment revenue was $14.9 million, up $1.3 million (+9.2%) compared to 2016. Consolidated expenses (all segments) were $71.7 million (+5.5%) compared to $67.9 million for 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $27.8 million or $1.59 per basic and $1.58 per diluted share. For 2016, net income was $15.5 million or $0.89 per basic and $0.88 per diluted share. The increase in net income and earnings per share was mainly due to the impact of the $15.4 million accounting gain before tax on the sale of our 30.1 per cent ownership interest in D&D on October 5, 2017. Without this gain, net income would have been $14.4 million or $0.82 per basic and diluted share. Capital expenditures for 2017 were $2.0 million, compared to $6.3 million in 2016. As at December 31, 2017, the Company held $31.3 million in cash, compared to $33.5 million as at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.2 million. The Company had $21.6 million of total debt as at December 31, 2017 compared to $23.4 million as at December 31, 2016. For more details, see section “Debt” in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nThe following section includes forward-looking information, including statements related to the industries in which we operate, growth opportunities and our future financial position and results including expected revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditures . Refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information”.\nWe see two factors influencing the outlook for our Registries segment, specifically the Saskatchewan Land Registry, those being changes to the mortgage rules and an increase in overnight lending rates. The Office of the Superintendent of the Financial Institutions Canada implemented revisions to its mortgage rules effective on January 1, 2018, which now include a requirement to “stress test” borrowers with uninsured loans to ensure they could withstand increases in interest rates. In addition, The Bank of Canada raised its overnight lending rate on January 17, 2018 following two similar increases in 2017. Interest rate changes often influence consumer behaviour and, as such, may affect ISC’s business. We expect; however, it will be some time before the impact of these changes is known. In general, we expect the performance of our Registries segment in 2018 to be in line with that of 2017.\nIn our Services segment, we expect to see further customer growth in the Financial Support Services revenue category (beginning in 2018, we will change the way in which we report revenue for our Services segment, consolidating to two categories, namely Legal Support Services and Financial Support Services – for more details, see section “Services Segment” in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017), with customers leveraging Know-Your-Customer on-boarding services as our customers’ programs come on stream during the year. With our recent acquisition of AVS, we also expect continued revenue growth in our Financial Support Services as we are now able to provide complete \"best in class\" service offerings to the market. ESC will continue to invest in its core technology platforms to enable integrated solutions in conjunction with its AVS technology in the year ahead.\nThe key drivers of our expenses will continue to be wages, salaries and information technology costs, as well as the pursuit of new business opportunities.\nThe acquisition of AVS in December 2017, with a high revenue, lower margin profile, changes ISC’s consolidated revenue and EBITDA margin profile compared to previous years. With that in mind, and based on our outlook, ISC currently expects total revenue of between $124.0 and $130.0 million with an EBITDA margin of between 24.0 per cent and 26.0 per cent. Capital expenditures are expected to range between $4.0 million and $6.0 million and will be funded through operating cash flow.\nISC’s guidance does not include revenue or costs from any potential new contracts in any of its reportable segments.\nNote to Readers\nThe Board of Directors (“Board”) of ISC is responsible for review and approval of this disclosure. The Audit Committee of the Board, which is comprised exclusively of independent directors, reviews and approves the fiscal year-end Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) and financial statements and recommends both to the Board for approval. The interim financial statements and MD&A are reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee.\nThis news release provides a general summary of ISC’s results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
