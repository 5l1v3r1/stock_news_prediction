I don’t know if it will get done. It is a tough one – there are a lot of creditors to bring in. It could just become too difficult to do,” a creditor said.\nSteinhoff declined to comment.\nIf Steinhoff seeks a waiver as expected, creditors are expected to make several requests in return.\nLenders want reassurances from Steinhoff that it has a contingency plan in place to deal with the €1.9bn equivalent of debt which matures this year.\nConvertible bondholders are also expected to ask that Steinhoff’s money or assets are not moved from South Africa to Europe to avoid diluting their guarantees.\nHEAVY TRADING Loan traders estimate that more than €1bn equivalent of Steinhoff’s loans have traded recently in euros and dollars, with around €400m-€500m trading in the last couple of weeks. Some lenders have sold as much as €200m each.\n“North of €1bn has traded in the last few weeks and the biggest tickets are €200m,” the senior loan trader said.\nConcern is mounting as the South African company’s woes start to affect its 40 plus multinational retail operations, which include Britain’s Poundland.\nSteinhoff said on February 28 that its working capital ‘dried up’ in the first quarter.\n“Each individual company seems to be struggling now as well. Before it was a South African issue,” the senior loan trader said.\nDebt in all of Steinhoff’s loans has been trading - including B1, B2 and B3 term loans, a euro-denominated revolving credit and Schuldschein loans.\nPricing across the tranches is moving into line with the euro revolving credit, which was priced at 65.67 on March 7, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.\nNatixis exited its US$110m-equivalent exposure in February and JP Morgan also sold a block in early February at around 73% of face value.\nHedge funds, including Silver Point Capital, Centerbridge Partners and Davidson Kempner Capital Management, have bought hundreds of millions of euros of Steinhoff’s debt, loan traders said.\nTaconic Capital, Blackstone, Centerbridge and SVP bought debt in February. Many early buyers have lost money, however, as the value of Steinhoff’s loans has continued to fall.\n“A few people have been burned who bought high and are now selling out and taking a bit of a loss,” the senior loan trader said.\nBanks including BNP Paribas, HSBC and Nomura have announced provisions on loans that were attributed to Steinhoff.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Citibank, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan all took hits in the fourth quarter related to Steinhoff, IFR reported.\nEditing by Tessa Walsh\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:25:30.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
