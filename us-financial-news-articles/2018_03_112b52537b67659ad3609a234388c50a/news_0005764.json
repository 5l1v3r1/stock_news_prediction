Public spending is expected to increase 4.1 percent, decelerating from 2017’s 13.9 percent jump.\nInvestment in machinery and equipment is seen rising by 3.5 percent this year, driven by the manufacturing and utilities sectors, and picking up from 2017’s 1.4 percent pace.\nAmong industrial sectors, which include both public and private spending, the oil and gas sector is expected to contract for a fourth year in a row, due to a decline in spending on non-conventional oil extraction.\nOn the upside, capital expenditure is seen increasing by 6.2 in the manufacturing sector and 6.5 percent in public administration.\nBusiness confidence in Canada has held up relatively well in the face of ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations, but economists are concerned that recently announced lower U.S. corporate taxes will sap investment in Canada.
