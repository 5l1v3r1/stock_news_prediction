The 2017 underwriting loss, combined with investment and other income of $4.8 billion, resulted in a P-C pre-tax operating loss of $1.7 billion. The underwriting loss in 2017 was driven by significant catastrophe losses. Even with these operating losses, each of the State Farm companies remains financially strong.\nThe net worth for the State Farm group ended the year at $97.0 billion compared with $87.6 billion at year-end 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the value of the P-C companies' unaffiliated stock portfolio. Valuation updates for deferred tax assets and liabilities determined using the corporate tax rate enacted as part of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also increased net worth for the group.\n\"In 2017, State Farm helped our customers recover from unexpected losses, including several catastrophic events.
