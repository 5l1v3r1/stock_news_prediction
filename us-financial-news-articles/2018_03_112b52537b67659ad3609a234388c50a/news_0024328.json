While the travel ban only applies to government employees, the U.S. Embassy said Americans should consider the security threat, which it did not specify, before traveling to the area.\nPlaya del Carmen is located about 46 miles (76 km) south of Mexico’s top beach destination, Cancun, part of a long strip of white sand beach-front resorts that attracts international tourists.\nLate last month, an explosion on a ferry docked at a Playa del Carmen pier injured 25, including several U.S. citizens.\nThe blast was caused by an explosive device, according to a U.S. embassy statement earlier this month. Local media reported that two other similar devices were later found attached to another ferry on the nearby island of Cozumel, also a major tourist draw, but neither detonated.\nBoth federal and state officials continue to investigate the incidents. The U.S. State Department has previously advised travelers to avoid five Mexican states due to soaring crime\nMexico’s long-running battle against drug cartels has in recent years bled into its iconic tourist destinations, including the once-glamorous Pacific beach resort of Acapulco and most recently Los Cabos on the southern tip of Baja California, both of which have seen murder rates jump sharply.\n(This version of the story was refiled to correct spelling of pier in fourth paragraph)\nReporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T08:54:24.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
