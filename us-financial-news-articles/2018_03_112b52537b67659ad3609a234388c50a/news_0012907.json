Smith, president and CEO, Ciena. “We also are confident in our ability to continue driving market share gains across key geographies and customer segments by intersecting the industry’s demand drivers with leading innovation.”\nFor the fiscal first quarter 2018, Ciena reported revenue of $646.1 million as compared to $621.5 million for the fiscal first quarter 2017.\nCiena's fiscal first quarter 2018 GAAP results include a non-cash $476.9 million charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result, Ciena's GAAP net loss for the fiscal first quarter 2018 was $(473.4) million, or $(3.29) per diluted common share, which compares to a GAAP net income of $3.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, for the fiscal first quarter 2017.\nCiena's adjusted (non-GAAP) net income for the fiscal first quarter 2018 was $21.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, which compares to an adjusted (non-GAAP) net income of $24.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, for the fiscal first quarter 2017.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn December 7, 2017, Ciena announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a program to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company’s common stock through the end of fiscal 2020. The Company commenced repurchases late in the fiscal first quarter 2018, and through March 5, 2018, has repurchased approximately 874,000 shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $19.5 million at an average price of $22.34 per share.\nFiscal First Quarter 2018 Performance Summary\nThe tables below (in millions, except percentage data) provide comparisons of certain quarterly results to the prior year.

At this time, Ciena does not expect to pay substantial cash taxes for U.S. federal income tax for the foreseeable future primarily due to its deferred tax asset balance. As of January 31, 2018, Ciena has net deferred tax assets of approximately $739.4 million, and consequently, over the near term, Ciena's cash taxes will continue to be primarily related to the state taxes and tax expense of Ciena's foreign subsidiaries, which amounts have not historically been significant. Ciena's foreign and domestic income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 expected to be paid using cash was $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nSupplemental Materials and Live Web Broadcast of Unaudited Fiscal First Quarter 2018 Results\nToday, Tuesday, March 6, 2018, in conjunction with this announcement, Ciena has posted to the Quarterly Results page of the Investor Relations section of its website supporting materials for its unaudited fiscal first quarter 2018 results, including prepared remarks from management and a related investor presentation.\nCiena's management will also host a discussion today with investors and financial analysts that will include the Company's fiscal second quarter outlook. The live audio web broadcast beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern will be accessible via www.ciena.com . An archived replay of the live broadcast will be available shortly following its conclusion on the Investor Relations page of Ciena's website.\nNotes to Investors\nForward-Looking Statements. You are encouraged to review the Investors section of our website, where we routinely post press releases, SEC filings, recent news, financial results, supplemental financial information, and other announcements. From time to time we exclusively post material information to this website along with other disclosure channels that we use. This press release contains certain that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, assumptions and other information available to the Company as of the date hereof. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding Ciena's expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future and can be identified by forward-looking words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" and \"would\" or similar words. Forward-looking statements in this release include: \"We demonstrated a strong start toward achieving our long-term financial goals with our fiscal first quarter results, including year-over-year top-line growth, continued cash generation and a strengthening balance sheet\"; \"We also are confident in our ability to continue driving market share gains across key geographies and customer segments by intersecting the industry’s demand drivers with leading innovation\".\nCiena's actual results, performance or events may differ materially from these made or implied due to a number of risks and uncertainties relating to Ciena's business, including: the effect of broader economic and market conditions on our customers and their business; changes in network spending or network strategy by large communication service providers; seasonality and the timing and size of customer orders, including our ability to recognize revenue relating to such sales; the level of competitive pressure we encounter; the product, customer and geographic mix of sales within the period; supply chain disruptions and the level of success relating to efforts to optimize Ciena's operations; changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting revenue and operating expense; the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, changes in estimates of prospective income tax rates and any adjustments to Ciena's provisional estimates whether related to further guidance, analysis or otherwise, and the other risk factors disclosed in Ciena's Report on Form 10-K, which Ciena filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2017. Ciena assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information included in this press release.\nNon-GAAP Presentation of Quarterly and Annual Results. This release includes non-GAAP measures of Ciena's gross profit, operating expense, income from operations, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, and measures of net income and net income per share. In evaluating the operating performance of Ciena's business, management excludes certain charges and credits that are required by GAAP. These items share one or more of the following characteristics: they are unusual and Ciena does not expect them to recur in the ordinary course of its business; they do not involve the expenditure of cash; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; or their magnitude and timing is largely outside of Ciena's control. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures below provide management and investors useful information and meaningful insight to the operating performance of the business. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to Ciena's GAAP results and these measures are not intended to be a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Ciena's non-GAAP measures and the related adjustments may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies and should only be used to evaluate Ciena's results of operations in conjunction with our corresponding GAAP results. To the extent not previously disclosed in a prior Ciena financial results press release, Appendix A and B to this press release set forth a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures contained in this release.\nAbout Ciena.

Weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding used in calculating Adjusted (non-GAAP) diluted net income per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 includes 0.9 million shares underlying certain stock options and restricted stock units and 0.7 million shares underlying Ciena's \"New\" 3.75% convertible senior notes, due October 15, 2018. Weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding used in calculating Adjusted (non-GAAP) diluted net income per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 includes 1.5 million shares underlying certain stock options and restricted stock units, 5.6 million shares underlying Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 17.4 million shares underlying Ciena's \"Original\" 3.75% convertible senior notes, due October 15, 2018. 2. The calculation of Adjusted (non-GAAP) diluted net income per common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 requires adding back interest expense of approximately $0.4 million associated with Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and approximately $2.3 million associated with Ciena's \"Original\" 3.75% convertible senior notes, due October 15, 2018 to the Adjusted (non-GAAP) net income in order to derive the numerator for the Adjusted earnings per common share calculation. APPENDIX B - Calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) Quarter Ended January 31, 2018 2017 Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) Net income (loss) (GAAP) $ (473,363 ) $ 3,861 Add: Interest expense 13,734 15,203 Less: Interest and other income (loss), net 1,575 370 Add: Provision for income taxes 477,940 410 Add: Depreciation of equipment, building, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of leasehold improvements 20,833 16,699 Add: Amortization of intangible assets 5,912 18,864 EBITDA $ 43,481 $ 54,667 Add: Shared-based compensation cost 12,393 12,825 Add: Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs 5,961 2,395 Adjusted EBITDA $ 61,835 $ 69,887 The adjusted (non-GAAP) measures above and their reconciliation to Ciena's GAAP results for the periods presented reflect adjustments relating to the following items:\nShare-based compensation - a non-cash expense incurred in accordance with share-based compensation accounting guidance. Amortization of intangible assets - a non-cash expense arising from the acquisition of intangible assets, principally developed technologies and customer-related intangibles, that Ciena is required to amortize over its expected useful life. Significant asset impairments and restructuring costs - costs incurred as a result of restructuring activities taken to align resources with perceived market opportunities. Non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt - related to certain private repurchases conducted with several holders of Ciena's 0.875% convertible senior notes, which were paid at maturity during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-cash interest expense - a non-cash debt discount expense amortized as interest expense during the term of Ciena's 4.0% senior convertible notes due December 15, 2020 relating to the required separate accounting of the equity component of these convertible notes. Non-GAAP tax provision - consists of current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the level of adjusted income before income taxes and utilizes a current, blended U.S. and foreign statutory annual tax rate of 25.87% for the first fiscal quarter of 2018, and 36.5% for the first fiscal quarter of 2017. This rate may be subject to change in the future, including as a result of changes in tax policy or tax strategy. In calculating, the Non-GAAP tax provision for the first fiscal quarter of 2018, Ciena excluded certain significant non-cash charges resulting from the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Specifically, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Ciena recorded a provisional, non-cash charge of $476.9 million, consisting of a $431.3 million charge related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets at the lower statutory rate, and a $45.6 million charge related to the U.S. transition tax described above. These amounts are provisional in nature based on Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and therefore subject to adjustment in future periods, including as a result of the availability of additional guidance and further analysis by Ciena under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005883/en/\nCiena Corporation\nPress Contact:\nNicole Anderson, 877-857-7377\npr@ciena.com\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nGregg Lampf, 877-243-6273\nir@ciena.com\nSource: Ciena Corporation", "external_links": ["http://investor.ciena.com/overview/default.aspx", "http://www.ciena.com/insights/", "https://twitter.com/Ciena", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005883/en/", "http://www.linkedin.com/company/ciena", "http://www.ciena.com/?src=PR", "http://www.ciena.com/", "http://investor.ciena.com/financials/default.aspx#section=quarterly"], "published": "2018-03-06T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T15:38:06.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
