For the full-year 2017, total revenue grew to $1.54 billion, an increase of 3.6% to 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $8.0 million, compared to net income of $12.4 million, for the same quarter of the prior year. For the full year 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $0.6 million, compared to net income of $4.9 million, for the prior year.\nTotal contribution (NOI) for the fourth quarter 2017 was $100.4 million, compared to total contribution (NOI) of $101.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The Company's fourth quarter 2016 revenues and contribution (NOI) were favorably impacted by the timing of revenue recognition associated with certain annual customer contractual volume commitments totaling approximately $5 million. Excluding this impact, total contribution (NOI) improved $4.4 million, or 4.4% for the same quarter of the prior year. For the full year 2017, total contribution (NOI) was $374.1 million, an 8.2 % increase over 2016.\nCore EBITDA was $78.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $82.0 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Fourth quarter 2016 Core EBITDA benefited from the same volume commitment revenue related items mentioned above, and approximately $2.0 million of other income related to business interruption insurance proceeds. Excluding these favorable items recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016, Core EBITDA improved $3.7 million, or 4.9% from the same quarter of the prior year. For the full year 2017, Core EBITDA grew to $287.1 million, a 9.9% increase over 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Core Funds from Operations (“Core FFO”) was $32.7 million, compared to $31.5 million for same quarter of the prior year.

For the full year 2017, AFFO was $94.6 million, compared to $71.1 million for the prior year. AFFO excludes certain expenses and income items that do not represent core expenses and income streams and the full definition and reconciliation can be found in the Company’s supplemental financial information.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Global Warehouse Segment Results\nFor full year 2017, the Global Warehouse segment were $1.15 billion, a 6.0% increase over 2016. Segment contribution (NOI) was $348.3 million, or 30.4% of segment revenue for full year 2017, compared to $314.0 million, or 29.1% of revenue, for the prior year. This represents 10.9% improvement in segment profitability over 2016 and an expansion of 130 basis points in segment margin year-over-year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Global Warehouse segment reported revenue of $297.6 million, a 2.3% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Segment contribution (NOI) was $93.9 million, or 31.6% of segment revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $92.2 million, or 31.7% of revenue, for the same quarter of the prior year. This represents a 1.9% improvement in segment contribution (NOI) over the fourth quarter of 2016. Normalizing for the portion of the revenue recognition associated with certain annual customer contractual volume commitments associated with our global warehouse segment, approximately $4.0 million, the year over year improvement in revenue and contribution (NOI) would have been 3.7% and 6.4%, respectively. Additionally, normalized contribution (NOI) margin would have expanded 100 basis points to 31.7% from 30.7%.\nThe Company ended 2017 with 146 total facilities in its Global Warehouse segment portfolio. Of the 146 total facilities, 139 meet the Company’s definition of facilities with at least 24 months of consecutive \"normalized operations\" and are reported as \"same store\".

Our core business is our warehouse segment, where we provide temperature-controlled warehouse storage and related handling and other warehouse services. In our warehouse segment, we collect rent and storage fees from customers to store their frozen and perishable food and other products within our real estate portfolio. We also provide our customers with handling and other warehouse services related to the products stored in our buildings that are designed to optimize their movement through the cold chain, such as the placement of food products for storage and preservation, the retrieval of products from storage upon customer request, blast freezing, case-picking, kitting and repackaging and other recurring handling services.\nUnder our third-party managed segment, we manage warehouses on behalf of third parties and provide warehouse management services to several leading food retailers and manufacturers in customer-owned facilities, including some of our largest and longest-standing customers. We believe using our third-party management services allows our customers to increase efficiency, reduce costs, reduce supply-chain risks and focus on their core businesses. We also believe that providing third-party management services to many of our key customers underscores our ability to offer a complete and integrated suite of services across the cold chain.\nIn our transportation segment, we broker and manage transportation of frozen and perishable food and other products for our customers. Our transportation services include consolidation services (i.e., consolidating a customer’s products with those of other customers for more efficient shipment), freight under management services (i.e., arranging for and overseeing transportation of customer inventory) and dedicated transportation services, each designed to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our customers. We provide these transportation services at cost plus a service fee or, in the case of our consolidation services, we charge a fixed fee.\nWe also operate a limestone quarry on the land we own around our Carthage, Missouri warehouse, which contains substantial limestone deposits. We do not view the operation of the quarry as an integral part of our business.\nReconciliation of Net Earnings to FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO (In thousands) Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 8,000 $ 12,359 $ (608 ) $ 4,932 Adjustments: Real estate related depreciation 22,041 21,694 86,478 85,645 Net (gain) loss on sale of depreciable real estate (126 ) (5,394 ) (43 ) (11,104 ) Impairment charges on certain real estate assets 700 9,820 9,473 9,820 Real estate depreciation on China JV 302 196 1,183 1,268 Funds from operations 30,917 38,675 96,483 90,561 Less distributions on preferred shares of beneficial interest (7,118 ) (7,118 ) (28,452 ) (28,452 ) Funds from operations attributable to common shareholders $ 23,799 $ 31,557 $ 68,031 $ 62,109 Adjustments: Net (gain) loss on sale of non-real estate assets (168 ) 375 (599 ) 464 Severance and reduction in workforce costs (a) 85 279 516 900 Terminated site operations costs (b) 502 (186 ) 2,677 6 Strategic alternative costs (c) 3,770 2,335 8,136 4,666 Litigation settlements — 89 — 89 Impairment of partially owned entities (d) — — 6,496 — Loss on debt extinguishment and modification — — 986 1,437 Inventory asset impairment — — 2,108 — Foreign currency exchange (gain) loss (279 ) (2,930 ) 3,591 (464 ) Excise tax settlement 4,984 — 4,984 — Multi-Employer pension plan withdrawal expense — — 9,167 — Core FFO applicable to common shareholders $ 32,693 $ 31,519 $ 106,093 $ 69,207 Adjustments: Amortization of loan costs and debt discounts 2,215 1,964 8,604 7,193 Amortization of below/above market leases 37 37 151 196 Straight-line net rent 3 (55 ) 101 (564 ) Deferred income taxes expense (benefit) 721 2,812 (3,658 ) (586 ) Stock-based compensation expense (e) 598 4,486 2,358 6,436 Non-real estate depreciation and amortization 7,505 8,123 30,264 32,926 Non-real estate depreciation and amortization on China JV 155 104 609 762 Recurring maintenance capital expenditures (f) (19,915 ) (20,651 ) (49,906 ) (44,445 ) Adjusted FFO applicable to common shareholders $ 24,012 $ 28,339 $ 94,616 $ 71,125 (a) Represents one-time severance from prior management team and reduction in workforce costs associated with exiting or selling non-strategic warehouses.

(d) Represents an impairment charge related to our investment in the China JV based on a determination that the recorded investment was no longer recoverable from the projected future cash distributions we expect to receive from the China JV. We did not receive any cash distributions from the China JV since the formation of the joint venture. (e) Represents stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards under our pre-IPO equity incentive plans. Notes and Definitions\nWe calculate funds from operations, or FFO, in accordance with the standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding extraordinary items as defined under U.S. GAAP and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, plus specified non-cash items, such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs, which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity REITs.\nWe calculate core funds from operations, or Core FFO, as FFO adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non-real estate assets, severance and reduction in workforce costs, terminated site operations costs, expenses related to our review of the strategic alternatives for our company prior to the IPO, litigation settlements, non-recurring impairment charges arising from our joint venture in China, or the China JV, and impairment of partially owned entities, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, inventory asset impairment charges, foreign currency exchange gain or loss, excise tax settlement and multi-employer pension plan withdrawal expense. We believe that Core FFO is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility, but which do not directly relate to our core business operations. We believe Core FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods, while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential.\nHowever, because FFO and Core FFO add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of recurring maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations, we believe the utility of FFO and Core FFO as a measure of our performance may be limited.\nWe calculate adjusted funds from operations, or Adjusted FFO, as Core FFO adjusted for the effects of amortization of loan costs, debt discounts and above or below market leases, straight-line rent, provision or benefit from deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans, non-real estate depreciation, depletion or amortization (including in respect of the China JV), and recurring maintenance capital expenditures. We believe that Adjusted FFO is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities.\nFFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are used by management, investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity REITs. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be evaluated along with U.S. GAAP net income and net income per diluted share (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures) in evaluating our operating performance. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO should be considered as supplements, but not alternatives, to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance. Moreover, other REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the NAREIT definition differently than we do. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs. In addition, there is no industry definition of Core FFO or Adjusted FFO and, as a result, other REITs may also calculate Core FFO or Adjusted FFO, or other similarly-captioned metrics, in a manner different than we do. The table above reconciles FFO, Core FFO and Adjusted FFO to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe calculate EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization. EBITDA is a measure commonly used in our industry, and we present EBITDA to enhance investor understanding of our operating performance. We believe that EBITDA provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets among otherwise comparable companies.\nWe also calculate our Core EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for impairment charges on intangible and long-lived assets, gain or loss on depreciable real property asset disposals, severance and reduction in workforce costs, terminated site operations costs, expenses related to our review of the strategic alternatives for our company prior to this offering, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment and modification, stock-based compensation expense, foreign currency exchange gain or loss, loss on partially owned entities, impairment of partially owned entities, and multi-employer pension plan withdrawal expense. We believe that the presentation of Core EBITDA provides a measurement of our operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the effects of certain items that are otherwise included in EBITDA but which we do not believe are indicative of our core business operations. EBITDA and Core EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and our EBITDA and Core EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider our EBITDA and Core EBITDA as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculations of EBITDA and Core EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, including:\nthese measures do not reflect our historical or future cash requirements for recurring maintenance capital expenditures or growth and expansion capital expenditures; these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; these measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; and although depreciation, depletion and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, depleted and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nWe use EBITDA and Core EBITDA as measures of our operating performance and not as measures of liquidity. The table above reconciles EBITDA and Core EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328006098/en/\nAmericold Realty Trust\nInvestor Relations\n678-459-1959\ninvestor.relations@americold.com\nSource: Americold Realty Trust", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americold.com&esheet=51780580&newsitemid=20180328006098&lan=en-US&anchor=www.americold.com&index=1&md5=40d0e5a699f8ccd0dd3ef8144977d06e", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328006098/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.americold.com&esheet=51780580&newsitemid=20180328006098&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fir.americold.com&index=2&md5=19fd38f11bff8344ef4b873e2962d835"], "published": "2018-03-29T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T01:02:42.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
