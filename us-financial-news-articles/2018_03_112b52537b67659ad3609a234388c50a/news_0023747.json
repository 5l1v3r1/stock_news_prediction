He was 35 seconds adrift of Soler.\nThe 24-year-old Soler in 2015 won the Tour de l’Avenir, a mini Tour de France for the under-23 riders.\nAnother Spaniard, Gorka Izaguirre, took third place overall. He was 14 seconds off the pace despite crashing in the final descent, while his Bahrain-Merida team mate and brother Jon ended up fourth.\nReporting by Julien Pretot, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T17:16:18.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
