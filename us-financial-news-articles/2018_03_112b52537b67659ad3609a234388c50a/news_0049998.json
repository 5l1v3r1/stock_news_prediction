Analysts had expected flat growth. \n“The Street is panicked about poor retail activity, panicked about Amazon. When they don’t quantify what the impact of their rationalization decisions (are), they shoot themselves in the foot. The stock should be up a lot more”, Baird analyst Eric Coldwell told Reuters. \nWalgreens said it did not see much of an uptick in prescription volumes during one the harshest flu-season in the United States in decades, surprising analysts who expected the rise in flu shots to have boosted sales significantly.

REUTERS/Mohammad Khursheed \nTo simply say ‘flu was pretty normal’ and not quantify it was a big mistake,” Coldwell added. \nSame-store sales at its pharmacies rose 5.1 percent, but missed analysts expectations for a 5.4 percent rise, according to four analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nWalgreens filled 9.1 percent more prescriptions in the quarter, but that was mainly driven by customers seeking higher-priced specialty drugs. \nDeerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $5.85 and $6.05 per share from between $5.45 and $5.70 per share. Analysts were estimating $5.78 per share for the year. \nThe raise in forecast reflects a $350 million tax benefit for fiscal year 2018, an increase of about $150 million from the company’s previous estimate. \nExcluding items, Walgreens earned $1.73 per share. Net sales rose 12 percent to $33.02 billion. \nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.55 per share on revenue of $32.19 billion.
