The maximum dose of up to 160 Units/mL may also help reduce the number of injections needed to deliver the required Toujeo dosage for some adults with diabetes.\n\"This new high capacity pen has a broader range of doses than the original SoloStar, delivering Toujeo, a long-acting insulin with established safety and efficacy,\" said Michelle Carnahan, North America Diabetes and Cardiovascular Head, Sanofi. \"By reducing the number of injections for people who need more long-acting insulin and lowering copay costs – both of which are important to patients – Toujeo Max SoloStar underscores Sanofi's continued commitment to help those living with diabetes.\"\nTo make Toujeo Max SoloStar as financially accessible as possible, it will be available at the same price as the original Toujeo SoloStar per insulin unit. Additionally, Sanofi will offer a savings program for Toujeo that includes both the SoloStar pen and Max SoloStar pen. Eligible commercially insured patients will pay a $0 copay if they are new to Toujeo for their first three prescription fills, and a $10 copay for their next 12 fills.\nSanofi will also offer support to adults with diabetes prescribed either SoloStar or Max SoloStar through the free Toujeo COACH program.
