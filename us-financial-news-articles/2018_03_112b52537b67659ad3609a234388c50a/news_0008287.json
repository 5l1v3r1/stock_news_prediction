Most analysts had expected the 2017 target would be largely maintained or come in slightly lower.\nLi also said he expects reasonable growth in broad M2 money supply and total social financing (TSF) this year, without stating a target. Targets set for 2017 were for both TSF and M2 to grow by about 12.0 percent.\nStability will be the watchword this year as President Xi Jinping pursues his vision of turning China into a \"modestly prosperous\" nation by 2020 and into a \"strong power\" on the world stage by 2050.\nAhead of the meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) this year, authorities have stepped up a crackdown on big-spending conglomerates, after a year of financial deleveraging that has targeted risky shadow financing and curbing corporate debt.\nThe NPC, which will end on March 20, is expected to approve the restructuring of various government departments and the appointment of several key officials including a vice president, vice premiers and a new central bank governor.\nIn a government work report, Li also said that China opposes protectionism and supports the settlement of trade disputes through negotiation, but will \"resolutely safeguard\" its legitimate rights and interest.\nPresident Donald Trump announced last Thursday he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners\nlike China, Europe and neighboring Canada while sending global financial markets lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T02:37:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
