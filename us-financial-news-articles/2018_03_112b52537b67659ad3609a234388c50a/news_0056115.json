An American Trucking Associations survey showed annual driver salaries rose as much as 18% from 2013 to 2017, and operators at the high end of the business working for private fleets reached top annual compensation of $86,000. Pay for the biggest share of drivers was well below that: WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes the median salary for a truckload driver working broader, “irregular” national routes was around $53,000 last year, up around 15% from four years earlier. Wages vary widely by job, but the broad trend shows trucking companies are paying more to keep drivers on board. That’s echoing across supply chains, with a growing lineup of retailers and suppliers reporting soaring logistics costs and thinning margins. With freight marketplaces persistently reporting far more loads than trucks on the spot market, those shipping costs and driver wages are likely to continue rising.\nU.S. transportation infrastructure spending is veering in a sharply different direction. The Trump administration has more than tripled the amount of money flowing from a popular transportation grant program to projects in rural areas, a shift in priorities likely to raise heated and politically-charged arguments in infrastructure circles. The Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, or Tiger, grants will send nearly $500 million to highway and transit projects, the WSJ’s Ted Mann reports, and almost two-thirds of the money will go to rural locations. The administration says it is helping regions that have been neglected since the recession with projects like freight rail enhancements in Oklahoma. Critics say the grants give weak attention to relieving congestion in the cities and suburbs where the vast majority of Americans live. With diminished federal backing, those densely populated areas may become bigger draws for the private investment the administration wants to attract.\nForeign auto makers in the U.S. are moving to align their inventories more closely with sagging American demand for new cars. Honda Motor Co. is pulling back production of its signature Accord sedan at its Maryville, Ohio, plant over the next few months, joining U.S. auto makers in reducing output. The WSJ’s Adrienne Roberts writes Honda is resetting bloated inventories that left dealers with an unhealthy 100 days of supply in February . Detroit auto makers have responded to slowing sales by scaling down their sedan production over the past year, and foreign auto makers that earlier seemed to resist the downturn now look to be easing back. Nissan Motor Corp. is acting to trim its inventories by about 15%, adding to production cuts that are hitting distribution channels. Shipments of motor vehicles and parts on U.S. and Canadian railroads were off 7.1% in the first two months of the year, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nTRANSPORTATION Photo: Bloomberg News The turmoil at Uber Technologies Inc. following a fatal auto crash is reaching the company’s freight business. Lior Ron, the head of Uber’s freight trucking operation and a key figure in developing its autonomous-vehicle technology, is leaving the company. The WSJ’s Greg Bensinger writes that Mr. Ron’s departure isn’t related to last week’s fatal accident in Arizona involving one of Uber’s self-driving vehicles , an operation he was not working on. Uber had been testing its autonomous-truck technology in Arizona before the passenger-vehicle crash, and that program was suspended following the fatal collision. Mr. Ron co-founded self-driving truck startup Otto, which Uber acquired in 2016, and was at the top of an Uber Freight division that operates as a broker, matching truck drivers looking for work with commercial shippers who have loads to haul. Uber says it remains “fully invested in and excited by” Uber Freight, which it says now reaches all states in the continental U.S.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The easiest way to get drivers is to pay them more.
