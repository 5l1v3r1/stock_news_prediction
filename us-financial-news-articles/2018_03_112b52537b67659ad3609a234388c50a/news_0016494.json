Freshman forward Aamir Simms scored 10 points and freshman guard A.J. Oliver II added nine points on 3-of-3 shooting from long range. Junior center Elijah Thomas had 12 rebounds and eight points.\nGuard Ky Bowman paced Boston College with 23 points while guard Jerome Robinson had 20. Junior guard Jordan Chatman added 15 points and forward Steffon Mitchell scored 11.\nBoston College led 12-3 early, but Clemson went on a 15-4 run capped by a Mark Donnal 3-pointer to take the lead for good at 18-16 with 11:50 left in the first half. The Tigers began to pull away and extended their advantage to 14 points on DeVoe’s second 3-pointer with 5:40 left in the first half.\nDeVoe led the Tigers with 10 first-half points and Clemson made nine shots from beyond the arc in the first 20 minutes to lead at the break 43-36.\nDeVoe continued to have a hot hand in the second half, scoring the first five points to push Clemson’s lead to 48-36. Clemson’s lead swelled to as many as 16 points, but the Eagles closed the gap late and pulled within 63-61 on a 3-pointer by Robinson with 5:47 remaining.\nThat was as close as the Eagles would get as Clemson kept them at by at the free-throw line, where the Tigers converted 20 of 22 attempts.\nClemson, which won 11 regular-season ACC games for the first time in program history, was picked for a 13th-place finish in the ACC’s preseason media poll and finished third. The jump of 10 places from preseason to postseason is the largest in ACC history since the preseason poll began in 1970.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:39:28.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
