(NASDAQ:SLGL) (“Sol-Gel” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on its clinical development programs.\n“2017 was an exciting year for Sol-Gel as we prepared for our initial public offering which we completed at the beginning of this year. The funding will allow us to advance our pipeline of branded dermatology drug candidates in acne vulgaris and subtype II rosacea,” stated Dr. Alon Seri-Levy, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sol-Gel Technologies.\nCorporate Highlights and Recent Developments\nIn February 2018, data was presented from the Company’s Phase II clinical trial of TWIN for the treatment of acne vulgaris and from its Phase II clinical trial of Epsolay ® (formerly VERED) for the treatment of subtype II rosacea at the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting which took place February 16-20 in San Diego, California.\nOn February 5, 2018, the Company successfully completed its initial public offering of 7,187,500 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase up to an additional 937,500 ordinary shares, aggregating gross proceeds of approximately $86.3 million, before underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nOn January 29, 2018, the U.S, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Perrigo Company plc (NASDAQ; TASE PRGO) a tentative approval for ivermectin cream, 1%, the active molecule in Soolantra ® , that was developed in collaboration with the Company. Soolantra ® is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. In our collaboration with Perrigo, we shared development costs and will share the gross profit 50/50.\nClinical Program Update\nPlan to have an end-of-phase II meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2018 and initiate the pivotal Phase III TWIN trials in acne vulgaris in the second half of 2018.\nPlan to initiate the pivotal Phase III Epsolay ® trials in subtype II rosacea in the first half of 2018.\nPlan to initiate bioequivalence study for a generic drug candidate in 2018.\nFinancial Results\nFourth quarter 2017 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses were $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million in payroll and related expenses, an increase of $1.3 million in Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and professional services expenses and an increase of $0.8 million in other expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 million in clinical trial expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to share-based compensation expenses.\nSol-Gel reported a loss of $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a loss of $4.9 million for the same period in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues were $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with zero for the same period in 2016. The revenues were comprised from royalties under an agreement entered by us in 2007 that granted rights to a third party for manufacturing and commercialization of encapsulated ultraviolet (UV) filters.\nResearch and development expenses were $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $17.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.5 million in payroll and related expenses due to share-based compensation, salary increases and an increase in the number of employees, an increase of $6.2 million due to acquiring an in-process research and development product candidate offset by a decrease of $3.1 million in clinical trial expenses and an increase of $2.6 million due to an increase in manufacturing expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.6 million in professional fees and $1.6 million due to share-based compensation.\nSol-Gel reported a loss of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a loss of $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Sol-Gel had $5.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $7.0 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease resulted from our loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by loans received from our controlling shareholder.\nAbout Sol-Gel Technologies\nSol-Gel is a clinical-stage dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases.
