The Glendale Heights location will officially be in use as of March 26 th , 2018.\nThe company's expansion is due to business growth and the need for more space â€“ both warehouse operations and office.

With 11 loading docks as opposed to the current 4, Convenience Valet greatly increases its capacity for smooth shipments and deliveries. The new offices are also an open, collaborative space allowing for a better work environment for current and future employees.\nSteve Jungmann, the company's CEO & President, explains, \"The decision to expand our warehouse and office space is the logical next step in our growth strategy. It sets us up to expand and grow in many new ways, while still delivering our excellent customer service. \"\nJim Blosser, EVP of Sales and a 20-year veteran adds, \"This is a huge milestone for our company.
