To qualify as a security, investors must \"contribute money to a common enterprise with the expectation of profit,\" primarily from the \"efforts of others,\" he explained.\n\"In the case of bitcoin, that just never has been the case,\" Bogart argued. \"There was nobody that launched bitcoin and said ... 'I'm going to sell you 20 percent of the coins for a specific price.'\"\n\"The software was launched into the world. People started mining it, and it grew organically,\" he added. \"There is no central enterprise that receives the money that investors pay for bitcoin and deploy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T19:18:39.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
