It's currently testing its self-driving technology at locations around the United States including suburban Phoenix using modified Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. Those vans will make up the initial fleet in Waymo's ride-share program, until the company takes delivery of modified Jaguar I-Pace SUVs in 2020.\n\"Our passion for further advancing smart mobility needs expert long-term partners. In joining forces with Waymo we are pioneering to push the boundaries of technology,\" said Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer.\nSource: Waymo Jaguar's I-Pace SUV, modified with self-driving technology, will be used in Waymo's ride-hailing fleet.
