Now is the time and I am so honored and excited to be out there,” she added.\nOrganizers said Switzer, 71, would be given the same bib number for the London race on April 22.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T16:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T17:40:10.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
