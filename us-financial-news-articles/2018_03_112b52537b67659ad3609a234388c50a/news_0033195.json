Revenue consisted of:\nService revenue of $91.6 million, an increase of 19% compared to FY17. Custodial revenue of $87.2 million, an increase of 46% compared to FY17. Interchange revenue of $50.7 million, an increase of 22% compared to FY17.\nNet income was $47.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to $26.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2017.\nNet income per diluted share was $0.77 for the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to $0.44 for the year ended January 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $84.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2018, an increase of 35% compared to $62.8 million for the year ended January 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was 37% of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to 35% for the year ended January 31, 2017.\nAs of January 31, 2018, we had $240.3 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no outstanding debt. This compares to $180.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and no outstanding debt as of January 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter financial results\nFor the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018, HealthEquity reported revenue of $60.4 million, an increase of 29% compared to $46.8 million for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2017.

Our outlook for net income is a range of $47.0 million to $51.0 million, resulting in a net income per diluted share range of $0.74 to $0.80. Our Adjusted EBITDA outlook is a range of $106.0 million to $111.0 million. We also expect our non-GAAP net income to be in a range between $63.0 million and $67.0 million. Our non-GAAP net income is calculated by adding back to net income all non-cash stock-based compensation expense, net of an estimated statutory tax rate of 24%, and the impact of excess tax benefits due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Updated (\"ASU\") 2016-09. Our non-GAAP net income outlook results in a non-GAAP net income per diluted share range between $0.98 to $1.04 (based on an estimated 64.0 million weighted-average shares outstanding).\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure used throughout this release to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is included with the financial tables at the end of this release.\nConference call\nHealthEquity management will host a conference call at 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) on Monday, March 19, 2018 to discuss the fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter and full year financial results. The conference call will be accessible by dialing 844-791-6252, or 661-378-9636 for international callers, and referencing conference ID 3494468. A live audio webcast of the call will also be available on the investor relations section of our website at http://ir.healthequity.com .\nNon-GAAP financial Information\nTo supplement our financial information presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and other certain non-operating items. Non-GAAP net income is calculated by adding back to net income all non-cash stock-based compensation expense, net of an estimated statutory tax rate, and the impact of excess tax benefits due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. The Company cautions investors that non-GAAP financial information, by its nature, departs from GAAP; accordingly, its use can make it difficult to compare current results with results from other reporting periods and with the results of other companies. Whenever we use these non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the applicable non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed in the tables below.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “ ” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding the company’s industry, business strategy, plans, goals and expectations concerning our market position, product expansion, future operations, revenue, margins, profitability, future efficiencies, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information.
