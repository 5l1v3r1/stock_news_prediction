The growth of our various business segments and our ability to attract and integrate complementary talents reflect the fine execution of this strategy. With solid financial capabilities, Mediawan will benefit from the substantial international appetite for original European productions. Thanks to our recent successes, our ongoing projects and our agreements with leading global broadcasters, 2018 should see the deployment of our strategy across Europe”.\nCreation of an independent European audiovisual content group\nAll along 2017, Mediawan gathered various companies which have been or are expected to be acquired in 2018, establishing the group’s position in Europe with combined revenues around €270m.\nGroupe AB, the first pillar in constituting Mediawan\nWith the acquisition of Groupe AB for €280 million, Mediawan carried out its first structuring operation on 31 March 2017, creating the foundations for an independent European audiovisual content group.\nFounded in 1977, Groupe AB is a leading independent editor, producer and distributor of audiovisual content in French-speaking Europe that is involved in producing and distributing TV series, TV movies, cartoons and documentaries and in editing a portfolio of 19 television channels and associated digital services focusing on major topics and brands.\nLeading producer of fiction and documentaries in France\nMediawan acquired in July, via its subsidiary Groupe AB, a majority stake in CC&C (Clarke Costelle & Co) from its founding partners. Since 2001, CC&C specializes in producing historical programs and documentaries notably built around the “Apocalypse” collection which enjoys record viewing figures in France and 165 other countries.\nEarly 2018, Mediawan announced various combination projects with production companies, thus enabling it to become the leading producer of fiction in France, via the acquisition of:\nEuropaCorp’s TV business (excluding US series), with a track record of successes in France and internationally such as “XIII”, “No Limit”, “Les Bleus” and “Taxi Brooklyn”. This transaction was completed on January 15, 2018, a majority stake in the Makever group, one of France’s leading producers developing strong franchises such as “Captain Charif”, “Kaboul Kitchen” and, more recently, “The Red Band Society”, which was finalized on March 15, 2018; 60% of Mon Voisin Productions producing the successful TV series “Call My Agent”, founded by Dominique Besnehard and Michel Feller, the announced exclusive talks being expected to be shortly finalized.\nRun by exceptionally talented people, these companies match perfectly Mediawan’s strategic objectives: premium contents with recognized and strong identifiable brands, together with a high catalogue value and substantial growth prospects.\nEuropean leader in animation\nLast December, Mediawan announced entering into exclusive talks in order to acquiring a majority stake in ON kids & Family, the European leader in animation, producer of successful TV series and feature films with exceptional brands such as “Miraculous Ladybug”, “The Little Prince”, “Playmobil”, “Robin Hood”, “Little Nicolas”, “Iron Man”, “Chaplin”, “Drôles de Petites Bêtes”, etc.\nApart from its recognized experience in creation and production, ON kids & family’s main characteristic is its unique capability to upgrade IPs in particular by generating considerable licensing & merchandising revenues notably through partnerships concluded with the market’s leading toy manufacturers.\nThe finalization of this transaction is scheduled to occur during Q2 2018.\nVarious developments across all activities\nMediawan confirms its capacity to pursue its various activities’ operational developments, rolling out its strategy announced in March 2017 at the time of its first acquisition.\nAcceleration in operational developments on the Channels & Digital segment\nMediawan has strengthened and made durable its relations with TV and telecom operators in order to distribute its channels and contents to a very large audience. These successes are the result of a proactive development policy, with notably:\nthe launch of new TV channel ABXplore in Belgium in September; its entry into eSport throught an exclusive TV partnership with the video game global leader Activision Blizzard (“Call of Duty”, “World of Warcraft”); and its digital offering’s intensification, genuine extension of the Group’s channels notably thanks to the launch of the “Mon Science & Vie Junior” app, the development of YouTube channels such as “Instant Saga” and the creation of original programs such as a news magazine monthly released on the YouTube channel “Chasse et Pêche”. Pursuance of investments for contents to increase the Group’s catalogue\nThe Group’s talents’ creativity was confirmed with the delivery of key programs’ new seasons such as “Section de Recherches”, “Alice Nevers” and “Zone Blanche”.\n2017 was an eventful year for the Group’s distribution platform. Following the sale of the worldwide SVOD rights to police series “The Mantis” to Netflix and the sale of the SVOD rights to science fiction series “Missions” for certain countries including the USA, Canada, Germany and the UK to Shudder/AMC Networks, later in the year Amazon acquired the world wide’s SVOD rights of “Black Spot” series, produced and distributed by Mediawan (Ego Productions and AB Distribution). These deals are in line with Mediawan’s global growth strategy driven by highly-appealing contents.\nLast, the Group acquired all the distribution rights in French-speaking Europe for TV series “Babylon Berlin”, a prestigious international co-production which won the MIPdrama Screenings Grand Jury award in 2017.\nAltogether, the amounts invested by the Group in audiovisual rights, both in distribution and new productions, in 2017 totalize €52 million (pro forma).\nSolid performances, beating targets: revenues of €163.8m and EBITDA of €37m (pro forma 4 )\n2017 annual revenues totaled €115.7 million based on the 9-month consolidation of Groupe AB – i.e. from April 1. Pro forma revenues, with Groupe AB consolidated on January 1, 2017, was €163.8 million.\nChannels & Digital:\nRevenues from the Channels & Digital segment, which incorporates royalties and advertising income, totalized €81.3 million in 2017 and €108.2 million pro forma. Advertising income raised significantly, notably benefiting from growing audience ratings and the opening of new regional advertising offer in Switzerland.\nEBITDA came to €9.4 million (€11.9 million pro forma), thanks to the increase in revenues and the Group’s ability to control its direct costs.\nProduction & Distribution:\nRevenues from the Production & Distribution ’s activity totalized €34.3 million (€55.6 million pro forma, +5% growth for the financial year 2017).\nThe revenues of the Production activity match with the delivery of new programs to broadcasters, in particular 8 episodes of TV series “Alice Nevers” were delivered in the 2 nd quarter of 2017 and 6 episodes of season 12 of “Research Unit” were delivered during the 2 nd half of 2017.\nThe Distribution activity was driven by sales on digital platforms: Amazon with “Black Spot”, Netflix with “The Mantis”, “Seven and Me” and numerous films from the catalogue.\nEBITDA of the activity was €19.7 million (€28.6 million pro forma in 2017), 12% growth compared to 2016.\nAltogether, the pro forma revenues totalized €163.8 million for 2017 , above expectations announced in March 2017 and +3% growth compared to 2016.\nIn 2017, Group’s EBITDA amounts to €37.0m on a pro forma basis . On a comparable basis at Groupe AB level (meaning without central costs), this represents a +9% increase compared to last year results and beating initial target by 10%.\nThe operating result indicates a loss of €(3.1) million was mainly affected by:\nnon-recurring expenses of €(9.3) million associated with acquisition costs, partly offset by a one-off indemnity of €5.2 million; amortization of the goodwill allocated to tangible and intangible fixed assets, for €(21.7) million.\nThe 2017 net revenues shows a loss of €(6.8) million, integrating also the financial expenses of €(3.7) million, principally consisting of bank loan interest subscribed for the purpose of Groupe AB’s acquisition.\nSolid financial structure: net debt of €29m and shareholders’ equity of €210m at end-2017\nAs of December 31, 2017, Mediawan had net financial debt of €28.5 million. The net cash position was €82.4 million, a significant part of which has already or shall be used for the purpose of the acquisitions already contemplated or to be finalized in 2018.\nSubstantial line-up and good prospects for 2018\nMediawan is now a key European player in audiovisual content:\nthe leading producer of fiction and documentaries in France , with 13 production companies gathering the most talented people in all creative areas; the leading player in animation in Europe , with recognized global franchises such as “Miraculous Ladybug, “The Little Prince” and “Playmobil”; a catalogue of more than 13,000 hours of programs , growing every year with over 250 hours of new productions, commercialized with high distribution capacities in France and abroad ; a leader in contents’ aggregation on focused themes , via the publication of channels and associated digital services.\nIn 2018 Mediawan intends to integrate its recently-acquired companies to create the bedrock for its European deployment. Simultaneously, it will pursue its growth strategy using clearly-identified pillars:\naccelerate the international development of production activities, notably by increasing its partnerships with European broadcasters and global platforms; accompany the development and production of its best projects in progress, in both fiction and animation; increase its international distribution capabilities, in particular thanks to strengthening of its teams and catalogue; continue the transformation plan on thematic verticals: channels repositioning, launch of new concepts and development of digital ecosystems.\nSuch ambitions are expressed by a significant improvement of organic growth, revised from 3-5% for the historic perimeter to approx. 10% for the new combined group.\nLastly, Mediawan will continue to explore external development opportunities, via the recruitment of talented staff and further acquisitions, with particular attention being paid to international activity, which will help facilitate co-production schemes and strengthen the catalogue.\nThe 2017 annual financial report is available at: www.mediawan.fr/fr/relations-investisseurs/#info\nNext financial press release : Q1 2018 revenues, at the latest on May 31, 2018\nAbout Mediawan\nMediawan was incorporated in December 2015 as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) for the purpose of acquiring one or more targeted operating businesses or companies in the traditional and digital media content and entertainment industries in Europe.
