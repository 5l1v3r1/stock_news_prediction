It increased from 72.2 billion rupees (representing 16.6 percent of GDP) in 2016 to 90.5 billion rupees (representing 19.6 percent of GDP) in 2017,” the bank said.\nIt said year-on-year exports of goods fell from 84.5 billion rupees in 2016 to 81.3 billion rupees in 2017 while imports rose by 9.7 percent, from 156.7 billion rupees in 2016 to 171.8 billion rupees in 2017.
