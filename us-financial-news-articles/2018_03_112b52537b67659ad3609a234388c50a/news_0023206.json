United Internet would be willing to contribute 1.4 billion euros - in line with its 14 percent market share - or more.\nThe combined investment would be enough to provide fibre to 70 percent of households in Germany, he estimated.\nIt was not clear whether Dommermuth, a self-made businessman with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $6.4 billion, had approached Deutsche Telekom before going public with his proposal.\nDeutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges has come under fire for defending its continued reliance on so-called ‘vectoring’, which uses the old copper telephone network to reach households and has limited potential to be upgraded.\nHoettges has hit back by saying that Deutsche Telekom is investing far more than all of its rivals put together, having spent 5.4 billion euros on broadband in Germany last year.\nUnited Internet, which operates under the 1&1 brand, rents out capacity from Deutsche Telekom, among others, to provide digital subscriber lines to homes and businesses.\nHoettges is concerned that, if the regulator stipulates that access to glass-fibre networks should be open, Telekom’s competitors will end up profiting unfairly from its investments.\nDeutsche Telekom did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Dommermuth’s proposal.
