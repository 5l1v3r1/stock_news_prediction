(TSX-V:KNE) (OTCQB:KNBIF) (the “Corporation” or “Kane Biotech”) is pleased to announce its 2017 Year End and Fourth Quarter Financial Results.\nKane Biotech Inc. is a biotechnology company engaged in the research, development and commercialization of technologies and products that prevent and remove microbial biofilms. Biofilms are thin slimy films that develop when bacteria and other microorganisms form a protective matrix that acts as a shield against attack. Biofilms attach to and grow on living and inert surfaces. When in a biofilm, bacteria become highly resistant to antibiotics, antimicrobials, biocides and host immune responses. This resiliency contributes to numerous human and animal health related problems. According to the United States National Institutes of Health, biofilms are estimated to be responsible for 80% of all animal and human bacterial infections including tooth decay, wound care infections, chronic inflammatory skin disorders and wounds, recurrent urinary tract infections, medical device associated and hospital acquired infections (HAIs), and foodborne bacterial outbreaks. Biofilms cost society billions of dollars each year. As such, there is significant interest in safe and effective products that can combat the biofilm problem. Kane Biotech’s mission is to be a royalty-based revenue company licensing its anti-biofilm technologies to global industry players.\nKey Highlights of Kane Biotech include the following:\nA specialized focus on large markets for biofilm prevention and dispersion solutions Strong patent portfolio of anti-biofilm technologies with 75 patents and patents pending First commercial licensing and distribution agreement signed (2017) Several anti-biofilm applications in development for large market opportunities\nKane Biotech has a portfolio of biotechnologies, intellectual property (patents, patents pending and trademarks) and products developed by the Company’s own biofilm research expertise and acquired from leading research institutions. StrixNB TM , DispersinB®, Aledex®, bluestem™, bluestem®, AloSera TM , coactiv+ TM and coactiv+® are trademarks of Kane Biotech Inc.\nCompany Focus\nOver the past year Kane Biotech has focused the majority of its resources on applications of its technology on oral care and skin care in the companion pet market, human skin disorders, and the disinfection of hard surfaces. Kane Biotech’s objective is to license the Company’s intellectual property to strategic partners with already established large scale market and territory access.\nKane Biotech’s premium companion pet oral care products, StrixNB™ and bluestem™, are targeted at multiple channels, including veterinary clinics, pet specialty retail, grocery/mass merchants, and e-commerce. DispersinB ® is a powerful biofilm dispersion enzyme with initial targeted applications for canines which include otic ear infections and skin “hot spot” infections. A shampoo that fights atopic dermatitis on dogs has been formulated and is ready for test marketing and in-vivo testing. The Company’s StrixNB and DispersinB technologies are licensed to Dechra Pharmaceuticals (LON:DPH) for distribution in the North American veterinary channel. Dechra markets the StrixNB™ technology under its Vetradent™ brand name. More information about the Dechra agreement is provided below.\nFor human health skin disorder conditions, Kane Biotech has several formulations in final development based on its proprietary anti-biofilm technologies that have the potential to treat conditions such as athlete’s foot, eczema and seborrheic dermatitis. Athlete’s foot afflicts 15% of the world population and its global market is estimated to be almost $1B. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) afflicts 10% of adults and 25% of children globally and by 2022 its global market is estimated to reach $5.6B. Seborrheic dermatitis (including chronic dandruff) is the fastest growing hair care segment and by 2020 its size is projected to reach $6B. In-vitro data as well as testimonials of people using Kane Biotech’s formulations for these three conditions have been strong and compelling. The Company plans to gather clinical data in 2018 on the application of its technology to these conditions to help advance discussions with potential market partners.\nKane Biotech’s antimicrobial and anti-biofilm hard surface disinfectant technology has applications in hospitals, medical device decontamination, food production and safety, and industrial process control environments where highly resistant bacteria can cause major problems. Further work on formulations and testing of this technology will continue in 2018.\nTargeted company milestones for 2018 include the following:\nUplist to OTCQB Venture Market (January 2018) Retain investor relations counsel (February 2018) File lawsuit against Nestlé to defend Kane Biotech’s intellectual property (February 2018) Existing license expansion for companion animal veterinary market in terms of geography and product applications Complete additional trials and achieve International standard of canine oral care efficacy Launch DispersinB ® based products with Dechra Execute new technology license and distribution agreements Initiate clinical trials for technologies treating human chronic inflammatory skin disorders\n2017 Financial Highlights:\nTotal Revenues:\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $1,035,302, an increase of 173% compared to $379,890 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016; For the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $83,669, an increase of 12% compared to $74,619 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nLicense, Royalty & Option Revenues:\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $688,231, an increase of 409% compared to $135,134 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016; For the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $9,672 compared to $0 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nProduct Revenues:\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $347,071, an increase of 42% compared to $244,756 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016; For the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $73,997, a decrease of 1% compared to $74,619 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
