(NASDAQ: SONC), the nation’s largest chain of drive-in restaurants, today announced results for its second fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nKey highlights of the company’s second quarter of fiscal year 2018 included:\nNet income per diluted share increased 104% to $0.51 versus $0.25 in the prior-year period; adjusted net income per diluted share increased 13% to $0.17 versus $0.15 in the prior-year period; System same-store sales declined 2.9%, consisting of a 2.8% same-store sales decrease at franchise drive-ins and a 3.7% decrease at company drive-ins; Company drive-in margins were favorable by 40 basis points; 8 new drive-ins opened; and The company repurchased 1.2 million outstanding shares.\n“Our second quarter same-store sales decline reflected unfavorable weather and continued aggressive discounting by the competition. Excluding the impact of weather, which was a particular challenge in January and February, same-store sales were flat, consistent with the first quarter and indicative of stable underlying sales performance during the first half of our fiscal year,” said Cliff Hudson, Sonic Corp. CEO. “We continued to support a simplified everyday value message via the Drive-In Duo in December and January, which featured a cheeseburger and shake for $3.99, and a Quarter-Pound Jr. Double Cheeseburger and Tots for $2.99 in February. These types of broadly appealing value offerings provide a compelling price point and highlight Sonic’s quality differentiation.\n“Looking at the second half of fiscal 2018, updated media strategies are now in the marketplace, including new television creative, an increased number of consumer impressions and a retooled digital presence on both social media and proprietary channels. On the new product front, our Signature Slinger launched to considerable fanfare, inviting guests to enjoy a savory burger with none of the guilt; and our Pretzel Twist has been very well received by customers. March also saw the launch of the first full-market rollout of mobile order ahead, backed by the complete integration of digital and traditional marketing tools, which has shown strong operational results in the first few weeks. We expect this relentless focus on delighting our core guest to generate improved traffic, accelerating operating profit growth and generating strong free cash flow for shareholders.\n“Finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares, bringing the total to 2.8 million shares through the first half of fiscal year 2018, or 6% of shares outstanding. Our targeted leverage range remains 3.5-4.5x net-debt-to-EBITDA, and we anticipate concluding the year at the higher end of the range.”\nFinancial Overview\nFor the second fiscal quarter of 2018, the company’s net income totaled $19.6 million or $0.51 per diluted share compared to net income of $11.0 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the same period of the prior year. Excluding the items outlined below, net income decreased 1% and net income per diluted share totaled $0.17. The lower tax rate resulting from federal tax reform benefited adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.04. Excluding the total impact of federal tax reform, adjusted net income per diluted share declined 13% to $0.13 in the second quarter.\nThe following analysis of non-GAAP adjustments is intended to supplement the presentation of the company’s financial results in accordance with GAAP. The company believes the presentation of this analysis provides useful information to investors and management regarding the underlying business trends and the performance of the company’s ongoing operations and is helpful for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the financial results of the company and predicting future performance.\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n﻿ Three months ended Three months ended ﻿ February 28, 2018 February 28, 2017 ﻿ Net Diluted Net Diluted Net Income Diluted EPS ﻿ Income EPS Income EPS $ Change\n% Change $ Change\n% Change Reported – GAAP $ 19,607 $ 0.51 $ 10,963 $ 0.25 $ 8,644 79 % $ 0.26 104 % Payment card breach expense (1) 228 0.01 — — Tax impact on payment card breach expense (2) (67 ) 0.00 — — Loss from debt transactions (3) 1,310 0.03 — — Tax impact on debt transactions (2) (384 ) (0.01 ) — — Discrete impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (14,120 ) (0.36 ) — — Net gain on refranchising transactions (4) — — (6,788 ) (0.15 ) Tax impact on refranchising transactions (5) — — 2,445 0.05 Adjusted - Non-GAAP (6) $ 6,574 $ 0.17 $ 6,620 $ 0.15 $ (46 ) (1 )% $ 0.02 13 % (1) Costs include legal fees, investigative fees and costs related to customer response.
