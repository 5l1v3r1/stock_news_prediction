Prison officials at the camp at Lompoc Federal Correctional Complex discovered Fabian Barragan Lombera, 28, was missing during a count at 4 p.m. local time, the Lompoc Police Department said in a brief press release on its website. The Federal Bureau of Prisons does not consider Lombera dangerous and does not know if he is armed, police said. Lombera is serving a sentence for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and was to be released in 2025, police said. Early on Sunday, prison officials discovered another prisoner, Mauricio Martinez, missing. Martinez, 29, was serving a sentence for conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, local media reported. Lombera is at least the 10th prisoner to walk away from the facility over the last two years, according to various reports on local newspaper and television news websites.
