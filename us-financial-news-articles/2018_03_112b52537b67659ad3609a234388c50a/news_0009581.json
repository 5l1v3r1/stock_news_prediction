Theo Pinson added 12.\nJohnson’s 3-pointer pushed North Carolina to a 42-29 edge early in the second half.\nDuke pulled within 46-43, and the volume rose considerably before Maye converted on consecutive possessions.\nThe Blue Devils surged again, with Trent’s 3-pointer giving Duke a 52-50 edge with 9 ½ minutes to play, going ahead for the first time in more than 28 minutes of game time. Before that, Bagley scored six straight points, as his presence became huge during the rally.\nWilliams hit a 3-pointer on the last shot of the first half for a 35-25 UNC lead.\nIn a tightly contested first half, Duke missed several shots from close range and North Carolina converted on enough possessions to create uneasy feelings in the building.\nPinson’s tip-in and another basket in the lane pushed North Carolina to a 30-23 lead.\nThe Blue Devils managed only two points in the final five minutes before the half.\nDuke went 4-for-14 on first-half free throws. The Blue Devils shot 31.3 percent, including 1-for-10 on 3s, from the field before halftime.\nThis was Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski’s 1,300th game with the Blue Devils. Of those, 1,154 have been as a nationally ranked team.\nThis was the 49th game all time between two top 10 teams in Cameron Indoor Stadium, with Duke improving to 38-11 in those.\nNorth Carolina won the first meeting, 82-78, on Feb. 8 in Chapel Hill.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:57:34.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
