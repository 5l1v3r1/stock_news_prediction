It also did not disclose the leak to users or investors,\" analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a note to clients Monday. \"We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook. â€¦ We see enhanced risks for the company, but no near-term tangible impact on its business.\"\nFacebook shares are down 7 percent Monday. Its stock has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market. The company's shares rallied 32 percent in the past 12 months versus the S&P 500's 16 percent gain.\nPivotal Research reaffirmed its sell rating on Facebook shares, predicting more restrictions on consumer personal data use for advertising purposes. The firm also reaffirmed its $152 price target for the company, representing 18 percent downside from Friday's close.\n\"Because regulators will apply more scrutiny on the use of data for targeting, it seems to us that there will be more scrutiny on Facebook products,\" Wieser wrote. \"Regulators will take a tougher line on sharing data across Facebook's apps, especially including WhatsApp and the core Facebook platform.\"\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said \"the claim that this is a data breach is completely false\" in its blog post , saying no systems were hacked and no data was stolen.\n\nOn Saturday Cambridge Analytica", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T14:24:45.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
