There were no injuries and a fire brigade responded, it said.\nEmployees from oil majors BP and Total were also evacuated from the area, a source told Reuters.\n“There is a large fire at the Schlumberger facility in Sonils,” Sonangol Chairman Carlos Saturnino told a news briefing on the company’s financial results and oil production.\n“We don’t know much more at present but should have more information by this afternoon,” he said.\nThe extent of the fire could not be independently verified by Reuters.\nIn January, Schlumberger reported a net loss of $1.51 billion, down from $1.69 billion in 2016.\nReporting by Stephen Eisenhammer and Herculano Coroado; Editing by James Macharia and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:29:16.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
