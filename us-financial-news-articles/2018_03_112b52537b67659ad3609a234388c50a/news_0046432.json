[nL8N1R90DP]\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai, Mansouri, who is also the minister of economy, said the UAE would now complain to the ICAO again.\nThe latest incidents involved a large aircraft owned by a UAE organization and a helicopter, GCAA Assistant Director General Ismaeil Mohammed al-Blooshi told a news briefing in Abu Dhabi. He declined to identify the owners of the aircraft.\nBahrain’s civil aviation authority said on Monday a private Emirati Airbus A320 en route from the emirate of Fujairah to Rome was forced to a higher altitude after Qatari war planes flew dangerously close.\nBlooshi said on Tuesday the war planes came as close as 800 meters horizontally and 213 meters vertically to the UAE aircraft.\nIt was not clear if the two incidents occurred at the same time or not.\nReporting By Alexander Cornwell and Aziz El Yaakoubi; Writing by Noah Browning; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T16:21:47.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
