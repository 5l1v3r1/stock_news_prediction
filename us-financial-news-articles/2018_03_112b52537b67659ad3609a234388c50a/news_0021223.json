Income Net Income EPS EBITDA** FY 2018 $ 943 $ 199 $ 142 $ 3.06 $ 212 YOY Growth 19 % 37 % 49 % 49 % 35 % FY 2017 $ 794 $ 145 $ 95 $ 2.05 $ 157 • Cash was $155 million net of $140 million dividend distributions from January 27, 2017\nDespite severe weather conditions which temporarily disrupted deliveries in certain markets, our third quarter top-line and bottom-line growth again led the industry,” stated Chairman and CEO Nick A Caporella. “The third quarter marked our 15 th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, and the 11 th consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. While we are compelled by regulations to record a one-time adjustment to previous deferred tax liabilities by $4.3 million, and adjust prior year-to-date income tax to the estimated effective tax rate for the full year resulting in a $7 million reduction in tax expense; after these adjustments the third quarter produced after-tax earnings of $41.1 million or earnings per share of $.88.”\n“While I certainly believe that the new tax code is beneficial for American enterprise, I may have desired alternative methods to report our stated results. We manage our consumer products and our investor business with focused dedication and passion. We believe in our philosophy and its proven results and continuously modify our business plan . . . to adjust for this tax modification was more than uncomfortable.\nThroughout these past five years, we have repeatedly identified all of the authentic circumstances pertaining to the sustainability of our brand growth and performance . . . most especially, brand LaCroix. Due to its phenomenal prospects, we are questioned constantly about sustainability. The results included in this report further confirm our operating logic,” continued Caporella.\n“Over the years, I have witnessed most major players in the carbonated soft drink (CSD) business educate retailers on ‘How to make less – Profits!’ These same players are now trying to do the same in the true sparkling water segment. But, today, the concerned retailers are rebuking these harmful efforts to destroy their opportunity to continue sustaining the high growth/better margin of the sparkling water segment. Additionally, they have resisted compromising this authentic, healthy segment of their business – with rigorous diligence . . . Advantage LaCroix!” concluded Caporella.\nNational Beverage Corp.
