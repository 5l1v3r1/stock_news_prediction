But Uzbekistan, which lies downstream, has long objected to the project, fearing it would disrupt the flow of water needed by Uzbek farmers.\nTashkent has changed its position following the death of President Islam Karimov, its leader for 27 years, in 2016.\nKarimov’s successor, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, arrived in Tajikistan on Friday in a first official visit by an Uzbek president in 18 years. Karimov had only visited the neighbouring country for multilateral meetings since 2000.\n“We share the view that the existing hydropower facilities and those under construction will help resolve the region’s water and power issues,” Tajik leader Imomali Rakhmon told reporters after meeting Mirziyoyev.\n“In this regard, we welcome Uzbekistan’s support for the development of hydropower facilities in Tajikistan, including Rogun.”\nMirziyoyev, in turn, said Uzbekistan would seek to boost the share of hydro power in its consumption by purchasing it from Tajikistan. “We will never leave our neighbours without water,” Rakhmon reassured him.
