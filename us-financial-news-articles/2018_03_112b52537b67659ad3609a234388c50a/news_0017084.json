Maersk Line said the crew of the vessel Maersk Honam sent out a distress signal after unsuccessful firefighting efforts on Tuesday. The situation is “very critical” as the fire still continues and the cause of the fire is not known yet. The company, a unit of Danish shipping firm AP Moller-Maersk A/S, said the incident happened at 1520 GMT and the vessel was en route from Singapore towards Suez. The 27 crew members included 13 from India, nine from the Philippines, two Thai nationals and one each from Romania, South Africa and the United Kingdom.
