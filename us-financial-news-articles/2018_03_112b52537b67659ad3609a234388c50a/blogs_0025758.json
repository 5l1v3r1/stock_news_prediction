Last week Paulo Rabello de Castro, chief executive officer of Brazilian development bank BNDES, confirmed the talks between the companies. \nBNDES is a common shareholder in Fibria and Suzano. Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico reported the bid earlier. \nValor had reported that Chile's Arauco, a subsidiary of industrial conglomerate Empresas Copec SA, and Finland's UPM were also interested in acquiring Fibria. \nPaper Excellence, controlled by the Wijaya family, which also owns Indonesia's Asia Pulp & Paper Co Ltd, has acquired Eldorado Brasil Celulose SA last year for $4.7 billion. Fibria and Eldorado have units in the same city, Três Lagoas, in Mato Grosso do Sul state. \nBanco BTG Pactual SA is advising Paper Excellence in the acquisition. Fibria, Paper Excellence, and BTG Pactual did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
