We can’t expect this to be resolved soon.”\nThe project is to be financed by Rosatom and its partners and will involve loans from export-import agencies and banks, Anastasia Polovinkina, director of Rosatom affiliate Rusatom Energy International told a conference in June 2017.\nFINANCING The 4,800 megawatt Akkuyu plant is a intended to reduce Turkey’s dependence on energy imports but has been beset by delays since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010.\nBut Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources said.\nThe firms are also worried that the guaranteed electricity price could eventually be lowered, reducing future revenue, they said.\nRosatom did not respond to a request for comment. Officials for EUAS and the government declined to comment.\nRosatom last year said it would sell 49 percent of Akkuyu Nukleer AS, the company which will build and operate the plant, to a consortium made up of Kolin Insaat, Kalyon Insaat and Cengiz Holding - Turkish firms that have been awarded major infrastructure projects under Erdogan.\nHowever, the final agreement was never signed and Rosatom said Kolin and Kalyon had decided to pull out of the project.\nCengiz remains as a contractor and Rosatom said last month that the two were in talks regarding other “partnership options”.\nRosatom has said it expects to find new investors for the project this year, adding that could be a single investor for the entire 49 percent or several firms taking smaller stakes.\nAt a November news conference with Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin re-affirmed the 2023 launch for the plant’s first reactor, and said construction would begin in the near future.\nHowever, Rosatom has still not received a full construction licence from Turkey’s atomic energy authority.\n“Construction time for the plant is seven years. Even if it receives the licence today, the 2023 target is not very realistic,” one of the sources familiar with the matter said.\nAdditional reporting by Katya Golubkova in Moscow; Writing by Tuvan Gumrukcu; editing by David Dolan and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T20:34:37.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
