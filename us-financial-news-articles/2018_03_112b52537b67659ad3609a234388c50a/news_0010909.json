(GBT or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:GBT) today announced the appointment of David L. Johnson as chief commercial officer, effective March 12, 2018. Mr. Johnson joins GBT from Gilead Sciences, Inc., where he was vice president, sales and marketing, Liver Disease Business Unit. At GBT, Mr. Johnson will create and lead the Company’s commercial operations, where he will be responsible for building and leading sales, marketing, business analytics and market access. GBT is currently developing voxelotor (previously called GBT440) as a potentially disease- modifying therapy for sickle cell disease (SCD).\n“David is a seasoned and accomplished executive with an extensive track record of success in building commercial infrastructures and launching specialty pharmaceuticals during his more than 25 years in the biopharmaceutical industry,” said Ted W. Love, M.D., president and chief executive officer of GBT. “His leadership, strategic vision, execution and operational excellence will be invaluable in building our commercial operations as we continue to advance the clinical development of voxelotor and as we look to expand our pipeline.”\n“I am excited to join GBT at this important time as the Company advances toward its goal of commercializing voxelotor for the potential treatment of SCD,” said Mr. Johnson. “I look forward to working with GBT’s leadership team and using my experience to build its sales, marketing and commercial organization in preparation for the potential launch of voxelotor, as well as future product candidates.”\nMr. Johnson spent 15 years at Gilead, where he held roles of increasing responsibility in the company’s commercial organization. He was instrumental in the commercial launch of Gilead’s hepatitis C treatments Sovaldi ® , Harvoni ® , Epclusa ® and Vosevi ® , and its hepatitis B treatment Vemlidy ® . As vice president, sales and marketing, for Gilead’s Antiviral Business Unit, he launched the HIV treatments Complera ® and Stribild ® . Before Gilead, Mr. Johnson had an 11-year tenure at Glaxo Smith Kline, where he held various positions in sales, product marketing, business development, global commercial strategy and portfolio development. He received a B.A. in business marketing from the University of Puget Sound and an M.B.A. from the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina.\nAbout Voxelotor in Sickle Cell Disease\nVoxelotor (previously called GBT440) is being developed as an oral, once-daily therapy for patients with SCD. Voxelotor works by increasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Since oxygenated sickle hemoglobin does not polymerize, GBT believes voxelotor blocks polymerization and the resultant sickling of red blood cells. With the potential to restore normal hemoglobin function and improve oxygen delivery, GBT believes that voxelotor may potentially modify the course of SCD. In recognition of the critical need for new SCD treatments, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted voxelotor Fast Track, Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the treatment of patients with SCD. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has included voxelotor in its Priority Medicines (PRIME) program, and the European Commission (EC) has designated voxelotor as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of patients with SCD.\nGBT is currently evaluating voxelotor in the HOPE (Hemoglobin Oxygen Affinity Modulation to Inhibit HbS PolymErization) Study, a Phase 3 clinical study in patients age 12 and older with SCD. Additionally, voxelotor is being studied in the ongoing Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, an open-label, single- and multiple-dose study in pediatric patients (age 6 to 17) with SCD. HOPE-KIDS 1 is assessing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of voxelotor.\nAbout Global Blood Therapeutics\nGBT is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company determined to discover, develop and deliver innovative treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities. GBT is developing its lead product candidate, voxelotor, as an oral, once-daily therapy for sickle cell disease.
