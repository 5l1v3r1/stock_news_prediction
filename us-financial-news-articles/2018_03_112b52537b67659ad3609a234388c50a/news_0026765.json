Michael L. Corbat, president of the Citigroup, arrives at the Planalto Palace before a meeting with Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff in Brasilia April 9, 2013. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino/Files Corbat's annual total compensation was $17.8 million while the median annual total compensation of all Citi employees was $48,249, the bank said in the filing. ( bit.ly/2panXYX ) The bank in February announced that it had raised Corbat’s annual compensation by 48 percent for 2017, a year in which the bank made more money from operations but still fell short of earlier targets. The change in Corbat’s pay compares with annual raises of 5 to 20 percent for other Wall Street bank chief executives.
