They plan to expand further in six years in line with the government’s goal to increase usage of hydrogen, the companies said.\nJapan is betting heavily on becoming a“hydrogen society” despite the high costs and technical difficulties. The government has set a goal to have 160 commercial hydrogen stations and increase the number of FCVs to 40,000 by March 2021.\nJapan has about 90 stations, of which at least 40 are operated by JXTG Nippon Oil.\nOther companies involved in the venture include Nissan Motor , Honda Motor, Idemitsu Kosan, Iwatani Corp, Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas, Air Liquide Japan Ltd, Toyota Tsusho and Development Bank of Japan.
