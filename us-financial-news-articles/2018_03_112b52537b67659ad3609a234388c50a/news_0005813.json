This has helped stabilize capital at the $9 billion firm in the last years as investors, including pension funds, have pulled money out when the fund suffered double digit losses in 2015 and 2016.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:05:33.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
