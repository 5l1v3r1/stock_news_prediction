The market has been very challenging in the past few years but finally there is a glimpse of hope. In 2017 we took significant steps to reduce our debt and improve the quality of our operations with satisfactory results.\n“The general market opinion is positive and we are pleased that it is moving out of the twilight zone.\n“Current Charter rates are healthy and the futures/FFA curves suggest further strengthening. Since we maintain a versatile approach on the employment of our vessels, it is easy for us to focus on taking advantage of the improved rate market.\n“We are optimistic in the continuous strength of the world economy as well as the restrain in newbuilding orders, and we consider both good omens for the medium term.\n“Our strategy going forward is to employ our ships on short-medium term contracts and enjoy rates above cash breakeven.\n“As the market returns to healthier levels we will then start looking at fleet renewals within 2018.”\nManagement Discussion and Analysis of the Results of Operations\nFourth quarter of the year 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of the year 2016\nTotal comprehensive loss for the fourth quarter of the year 2017 amounted to $1.3 million or $0.04 basic loss per share based on 30,503,159 weighted average number of shares, compared to total comprehensive loss of $2.5 million for the same period last year or $0.93 basic loss per share based on 2,627,674 weighted average number of shares.\nThe following table corresponds to the breakdown of the factors that led to the increase of total comprehensive loss during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the corresponding quarter in 2016 (expressed in $000’s):\n4 th Quarter of 2017 vs 4 th Quarter of 2016\nNet loss for the 4 th quarter of 2016 (2,450 ) Increase in Voyage revenues 1,680 Decrease in Management fee income (187 ) Increase in Voyage expenses (165 ) Increase in Vessels operating expenses (83 ) Decrease in Depreciation 40 Increase in Depreciation of dry docking costs (59 ) Decrease in Total administrative expenses 259 Increase in Other expenses, net (11 ) Increase in Interest expense and finance costs net, (124 ) Increase in Foreign exchange losses (177 ) Net loss for the 4 th quarter of 2017 (1,277 ) Voyage revenues\nDuring the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our revenue reached $4.1 million and $2.4 million respectively. The 71% increase in Voyage revenues was mainly attributed to the increase in the average time charter rates achieved by our vessels during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Time Charter Equivalent rate (TCE) for the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to $8,112 per vessel per day against $4,793 per vessel per day during the same period in 2016 corresponding to an increase of 69%.\nVessel operating expenses\nVessel operating expenses, which include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oils, insurance, maintenance, and repairs, reached $2.4 million and $2.3 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The breakdown of our operating expenses for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n2017 2016 Crew expenses 48% 50% Repairs and spares 26% 27% Insurance 10% 7% Stores 10% 8% Lubricants 5% 5% Other 1% 3% Average daily operating expenses during the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $5,267 per vessel per day and $5,088 per vessel per day respectively, corresponding to an increase of 4%.\nTotal administrative expenses\nTotal administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million or 47% to $0.3 million during the three month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.5 million during the same period in 2016. The increased figure during the fourth quarter of 2016 is mainly attributed to consulting and legal fees of the Company.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $6.5 million or $0.25 basic loss per share based on 25,749,951 weighted average number of shares, compared to total comprehensive loss of $9.8 million for the same period last year or $3.77 basic loss per share based on 2,603,835 weighted average number of shares.\nThe following table corresponds to the breakdown of the factors that led to the total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the total comprehensive loss ended December 31, 2016 (expressed in $000’s):\nYear end of 2017 vs Year end of 2016\nNet loss for the year 2016 (9,825 ) Increase in Voyage revenues 5,652 Decrease in Management fee income (247 ) Increase in Voyage expenses (621 ) Increase in Vessels operating expenses (447 ) Decrease in Depreciation 160 Decrease in Depreciation of dry docking costs 143 Decrease in Total administrative expenses 717 Decrease in Gain from sale of subsidiary (2,257 ) Decrease in Other expenses, net 113 Decrease in interest income (2 ) Decrease in Interest expense and finance costs 455 Increase in Foreign exchange losses (316 ) Net loss for the year 2017 (6,475 ) Voyage revenues\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our Voyage revenue reached $14.4 million and $8.7 million respectively. The 66% increase in revenue was mainly attributed to the increase in the average time charter rates achieved by our vessels during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Time Charter Equivalent rate (TCE) for the year 2017 amounted to $6,993 per vessel per day against $3,962 per vessel per day during the year 2016 corresponding to an increase of 77%.\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses reached $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.3 million during the year 2016. Voyage expenses include commissions on revenue, port and other voyage expenses and bunker expenses. Bunker expenses mainly refer to the cost of bunkers consumed during periods that our vessels are travelling seeking employment. Voyage expenses for the year 2017 and 2016 are analyzed as follows:\nIn $000’s 2017 2016 Commissions 781 468 Bunkers expenses 968 593 Other voyage expenses 143 210 Total 1,892 1,271 Vessel operating expenses\nVessel operating expenses, which include crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oils, insurance, maintenance, and repairs, reached $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.7 million during the year 2016. The breakdown of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\n2017 2016 Crew expenses 51% 56% Repairs and spares 24% 20% Insurance 8% 9% Stores 9% 7% Lubricants 5% 5% Other 3% 3% Average daily operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $5,005 per vessel per day and $4,553 per vessel per day respectively, corresponding to an increase of 10%.\nGain from sale of subsidiary\nIn March 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Commerzbank to sell the shares of Kelty Marine Ltd., to an unaffiliated third party and apply the total net proceeds from the sale towards the respective loan facility. Based on certain financial conditions agreed to beforehand with the Bank this resulted in the remaining principal amount of the loan to be written off. The financial effect from the sale of Kelty Marine Ltd. resulted to a gain of $2.3 million.\nInterest expense and finance costs\nInterest expense and finance costs reached $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.7 million during the year 2016. The decrease is mainly attributed to the conversion of $20 million of outstanding principal of two loans to 20 million shares, as described in the Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement that we entered on February 8, 2017. The weighted average interest rate on our debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2017 reached 3.8% compared to 3.5% during the year 2016. Our debt outstanding for the year ended 2017 was $41.7 million compared to $65.8 million for the year ended 2016. Interest expense and finance costs for the year 2017 and 2016 are analyzed as follows:\nIn $000’s 2017 2016 Interest payable on long-term borrowings 1,778 2,430 Bank charges 34 33 Amortization of debt discount 84 128 Other finance expenses 325 85 Total 2,221 2,676 Liquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash and bank balances and bank deposits were $2.8 million and $0.2 million respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.6 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $3.6 million during the year 2016. The $4.2 million increase in our cash from operations was mainly attributed to the $5.2 million increase in our adjusted EBITDA from $3.5 million adjusted LBITDA during the year 2016 to adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 million during the year under consideration.\nNet cash generated from/(used in) financing activities during the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nIn $000’s 2017 2016 2017 2016 Proceeds from issuance of share capital 3,842 - 9,653 - Net proceeds/(repayment) from shareholders loan Firment & Silaner Credit Facilities (280 ) 647 280 5,950 Repayment of long term debt - - (4,399 ) (3,100 ) Restricted cash - (210 ) - 290 Dividends paid on preferred shares - - - (14 ) Interest paid (986 ) (514 ) (3 ,309 ) (1,730 ) Net cash generated from/(used in) financing activities 2,576 (77 ) 2,225 1,396 As of December 31, 2017, we and our vessel-owning subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings under our Loan agreement with DVB Bank SE and HSH Nordbank AG of an aggregate of $41.7 million compared to $65.8 million as of December 31, 2016, gross of unamortized debt discount.\nAmended agreements with the banks\nIn June and July 2017 the Company agreed the restructure of its loan agreements with DVB Bank SE and HSH Nordbank AG, respectively. By these agreements the Company was successful in achieving waivers and relaxations on its loan covenants as well as deferring instalment loan payments due in 2017.\nShare and warrant purchase agreement\nAs previously reported, the Company on February 8, 2017 entered into a Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it sold for $5 million an aggregate of 5 million of its common shares, par value $0.004 per share and warrants to purchase 25 million of its common shares at a price of $1.60 per share to a number of investors in a private placement. These securities were issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act. On February 9, 2017, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with those purchasers providing them with certain rights relating to registration under the Securities Act of the Shares and the common shares underlying the Warrants.\nIn connection with the closing of the February 2017 private placement, the Company also entered into two loan amendment agreements with existing lenders.\nOne loan amendment agreement was entered into by the Company with Firment Trading Limited (“Firment”), an affiliate of the Company’s chairman, and the lender of the Firment Credit Facility, which then had an outstanding principal amount of $18.5 million. Firment released an amount equal to $16.9 million (but left an amount equal to $1.6 million outstanding, which continued to accrue interest under the Firment Credit Facility as though it were principal) of the Firment Credit Facility and the Company issued to Firment Shipping Inc., an affiliate of Firment, 16,885,000 common shares and a warrant to purchase 6,230,580 common shares at a price of $1.60 per share. Subsequent to the closing of the February 2017 private placement, Globus repaid the outstanding amount on the Firment Credit Facility in its entirety. The Firment Credit Facility expired on April 12, 2017.\nThe other loan amendment agreement was entered into by the Company with Silaner Investments Limited (“Silaner”), an affiliate of the Company’s chairman, and the lender of the Silaner Credit Facility. Silaner released an amount equal to the outstanding principal of $3.1 million (but left an amount equal to $0.1 million outstanding, which continued to accrue interest under the Silaner Credit Facility as though it were principal) of the Silaner Credit Facility and the Company issued to Firment Shipping Inc., an affiliate of Silaner, 3,115,000 common shares and a warrant to purchase 1,149,437 common shares at a price of $1.60 per share. Subsequent to the closing of the February 2017 private placement, Globus repaid the outstanding amount on the Silaner Credit Facility in its entirety. The Silaner Credit Facility expired on January 12, 2018.\nEach of the above mentioned warrants are exercisable for 24 months after their respective issuance. Under the terms of the warrants, all warrant holders (other than Firment Shipping Inc., which has no such restriction in its warrants) may not exercise their warrants to the extent such exercise would cause such warrant holder, together with its affiliates and attribution parties, to beneficially own a number of common shares which would exceed 4.99% (which may be increased, but not to exceed 9.99%) of the Company’s then outstanding common shares immediately following such exercise, excluding for purposes of such determination common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants which have not been exercised. This provision does not limit a warrant holder from acquiring up to 4.99% of the Company’s common shares, selling all of their common shares, and re-acquiring up to 4.99% of the Company’s common shares.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Share and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the “October 2017 SPA”) pursuant to which it sold for $2.5 million an aggregate of 2.5 million of its common shares, par value $0.004 per share and a warrant (the “October 2017 Warrant”) to purchase 12.5 million of its common shares at a price of $1.60 per share to an investor in a private placement (the “October 2017 Private Placement”). These securities were issued in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On that day, Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchaser providing it with certain rights relating to registration under the Securities Act of the 2.5 million common shares issued in connection with the October 2017 Private Placement and the common shares underlying the October 2017 Warrant.\nUnder the terms of the October 2017 Warrant, the purchaser may not exercise its warrant to the extent such exercise would cause the purchaser, together with its affiliates and attribution parties, to beneficially own a number of common shares which would exceed 4.99% (which may be increased upon no less than 61 days’ notice, but not to exceed 9.99%) of Globus’s then outstanding common shares immediately following such exercise, excluding for purposes of such determination common shares issuable upon exercise of the October 2017 Warrant which have not been exercised. This provision does not limit the purchaser from acquiring up to 4.99% of our common shares, selling all of its common shares, and re-acquiring up to 4.99% of our common shares.\nThe October 2017 Warrant contains a provision whereby its holder has the right to a cashless exercise if, six months after its issuance, a registration statement covering their resale is not effective. If for any reason the Company is unable to keep such a registration statement active and its share price is higher than the $1.60 exercise price, the Company could be required to issue shares without receiving cash consideration. The October 2017 Warrant is exercisable for 24 months after its issuance. A registration statement covering this transaction was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective on February 8, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, in connection with the October 2017 SPA, the October 2017 Warrant was outstanding and exercisable for an aggregate of 12,500,000 common shares.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL & OPERATING DATA\nThree months ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data) (unaudited) (unaudited) Statement of comprehensive income data: Voyage revenues 4,111 2,431 14,392 8,740 Management fee income - 187 31 278 Total Revenues 4,111 2,618 14,423 9,018 Voyage expenses (501 ) (336 ) (1,892 ) (1,271 ) Vessel operating expenses (2,423 ) (2,340 ) (9,135 ) (8,688 ) Depreciation (1,195 ) (1,235 ) (4,854 ) (5,014 ) Depreciation of dry docking costs (280 ) (221 ) (862 ) (1,005 ) Administrative expenses (80 ) (420 ) (1,224 ) (2,094 ) Administrative expenses payable to related parties (189 ) (108 ) (514 ) (351 ) Share-based payments (12 ) (5 ) (40 ) (50 ) Gain from sale of subsidiary - - - 2,257 Other expenses, net (7 ) (3 ) 83 (30 ) Operating loss before financing activities (576 ) (2,050 ) (4,015 ) (7,228 ) Interest income 3 - 3 5 Interest expense and finance costs (636 ) (509 ) (2,221 ) (2,676 ) Foreign exchange (losses)/gains, net (68 ) 109 (242 ) 74 Total finance costs, net (701 ) (400 ) (2,460 ) (2,597 ) Total comprehensive loss for the period (1,277 ) (2,450 ) (6,475 ) (9,825 ) Basic & diluted (loss)/earnings per share for the period (0.04 ) (0.93 ) (0.25 ) (3.77 ) Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA (1) 902 (594 ) 1,701 (3,466 ) (1) Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA represents net (loss)/earnings before interest and finance costs net, gains or losses from the change in fair value of derivative financial instruments, foreign exchange gains or losses, income taxes, depreciation, depreciation of dry-docking costs, amortization of fair value of time charter acquired, impairment and gains or losses on sale of vessels.

Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under IFRS.\nAdjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA is included herein because it is a basis upon which we assess our financial performance and because we believe that it presents useful information to investors regarding a company’s ability to service and/or incur indebtedness and it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs; and Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA to total comprehensive (loss) and net cash (used in)/ generated from operating activities for the periods presented:\nThree months ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited) Total comprehensive (loss)/income for the period (1,277 ) (2,450 ) (6,475 ) (9,825 ) Interest and finance costs, net 636 509 2,218 2,671 Foreign exchange gains net, 71 (109 ) 242 (74 ) Depreciation 1,195 1,235 4,854 5,014 Depreciation of dry docking costs 280 221 862 1,005 Gain from sale of subsidiary - - - (2,257 ) Adjusted (LBITDA)/EBITDA 902 (594 ) 1,701 (3,466 ) Share-based payments 2 5 30 50 Payment of deferred dry docking costs 273 (482 ) (412 ) (478 ) Net (increase)/decrease in operating assets 199 (133 ) 512 (663 ) Net (decrease)/increase in operating liabilities (1,851 ) 1,013 (1,143 ) 936 Provision for staff retirement indemnities 1 - 4 5 Foreign exchange gains net, not attributed to cash & cash equivalents 470 144 (61 ) 16 Net cash (used in)/ generated from operating activities (4 ) (47 ) 631 (3,600 ) Three months ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Statement of cash flow data: Net cash (used in)/generated from operating activities (4 ) (47 ) 631 (3,600 ) Net cash (used in)/generated from investing activities (36 ) (6 ) (263 ) 362 Net cash generated from/(used in) financing activities 2,576 (77 ) 2,225 1,396\nAs of December 31, As of December 31, (Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars) 2017 2016 (Unaudited) Consolidated condensed statement of financial position: Vessels, net 87,320 91,792 Other non-current assets 53 55 Total non-current assets 87,373 91,847 Cash and bank balances and bank deposits 2,756 163 Other current assets 1,474 1,986 Total current assets 4,230 2,149 Total assets 91,603 93,996 Total equity 43,968 20,760 Total debt net of unamortized debt discount 41,538 65,572 Other liabilities 6,097 7,664 Total l iabilities 47,635 73,236 Total equity and liabilities 91,603 93,996\nConsolidated statement of changes in equity: (Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars) Issued share Share (Accumulated Total Capital Premium Deficit) Equity As at December 31, 201 6 10 110,004 (89,254 ) 20,760 Loss for the period - - (6,475 ) (6,475 ) Issuance of common stock (1) 110 27,172 - 27,282 Issuance of common stock due to exercise of warrants (2) 6 2,365 - 2,371 Share-based payments - 30 - 30 As at December 31 , 201 7 126 139,571 ( 95,729 ) 43,968 (1) For more details see section titled “Share and warrant purchase agreement”.\n(2) Pursuant to the “Share and warrant purchase agreement”, warrants to buy 1,481,808 common shares were exercised during 2017.\nThree months ended\nDecember 31,\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Ownership days (1) 460 460 1,825 1,908 Available days (2) 445 437 1,787 1,885 Operating days (3) 435 426 1,745 1,830 Fleet utilization (4) 97.8 % 97.5 % 97.6 % 97.1 % Average number of vessels (5) 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.2 Daily time charter equivalent (TCE) rate (6) 8,112 4,793 6,993 3,962 Daily operating expenses (7) 5,267 5,088 5,005 4,553 Notes:\n(1) Ownership days are the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us.\n(2) Available days are the number of ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys.\n(3) Operating days are the number of available days less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances but excluding days during which vessels are seeking employment.\n(4) We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during the period.\n(5) Average number of vessels is measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was part of our fleet during a relevant period divided by the number of calendar days in such period.\n(6) TCE rates are our voyage revenues less net revenues from our bareboat charters less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of our available days during the period excluding bareboat charter days, which is consistent with industry standards. TCE is a measure not in accordance with GAAP.\n(7) We calculate daily vessel operating expenses by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant time period excluding bareboat charter days.\nVoyage Revenues to Daily Time Charter Equivalent (“TCE”) Reconciliation\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, Year ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Voyage revenues 4,111 2,431 14,392 8,740 Less: Voyage expenses 501 336 1,892 1,271 Net revenue excluding bareboat charter revenue 3,610 2,095 12,500 7,469 Available days net of bareboat charter days 445 437 1,787 1,885 Daily TCE rate 8,112 4,793 6,993 3,962 About Globus Maritime Limited\nGlobus is an integrated dry bulk shipping company that provides marine transportation services worldwide and presently owns, operates and manages a fleet of five dry bulk vessels that transport iron ore, coal, grain, steel products, cement, alumina and other dry bulk cargoes internationally.
