By pointing at procurement as the source of opportunity, it is possible to enlist behaviors that improve the full supply chain performance, including opportunities related to the buy, how product flows through distribution centers and both inbound and outbound transportation processes,\" Loftis says. \"I'm honored to receive this award that recognizes Transportation Insight's ability to help our clients better manage their transportation spend and improve performance without compromising service.\"\nA Supply & Demand Chain Executive 2018 Pro to Know, Loftis brings to Transportation Insight clients more than 35 years of supply chain experience that includes consulting to some of North America's largest companies across a wide variety of industries.

Rather than thinking about it simply in terms of trucks and freight, we identify the most efficient way to deliver a client's inventory to their customer's basket or doorstep. If we can do that, the qualities that allow me to deliver that item to the basket – data, communication effectiveness, speed, accuracy – start to align,\" says Zaffarano, a 2017 Food Logistics Champion. \"If you approach supply chain within that paradigm, then you are engineering it to ultimately serve your customer's customer.\"\nRecipients of this year's 2018 Food Logistics Champions: Rock Stars of the Supply Chain award are profiled in the March 2018 issue of Food Logistics, as well as online at www.foodlogistics.com.\nAbout Transportation Insight, LLC\nTransportation Insight is a multi-modal, lead logistics provider with $3.9 billion in logistics spend under management.
