Elizabeth Warren, D.-Mass. — for Trump’s “America first” approach to trade stands to complicate any GOP effort to tie the president’s hands. \nThe awkward political divisions over trade matters were on display Sunday as Warren backed Trump’s policy while Republican senators rebuked the president from their own party. “When President Trump says he’s putting tariffs on the table, I think tariffs are one part of reworking our trade policy overall,” Warren said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” \nSome Democratic lawmakers have found fault with the implementation or scope of the steel and aluminum tariffs. But Warren, to whom Trump derisively referred as “Pocahontas” again on Saturday, declined to criticize the president’s policy and said previous approaches to trade boosted profits at multinational corporations. On the GOP side, some Republican congressional aides worry that public opposition to Trump on trade could divide the party or backfire politically, pointing out that Trump is following through on explicit promises he made in his successful 2016 campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T18:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T23:18:23.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
