In January, it started selling a Whole30 meal plan. The 30-day diet plan, which was available through Feb. 26, focused on \"whole\" foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables and eliminated items like sugar, alcohol, grains, soy and dairy.\nIn addition, the company has begun to offer flexible plans and recipes. It has introduced meals that could be made within 30 minutes, meals that require less cleanup and brought back customers' favorite recipes.\nEntering grocery stores is the next step. \n\"This new multichannel offering, which will make our brand more accessible to homes across the country,\" the Blue Apron spokeswoman said. \nBlue Apron has been pressured by a growing number of competitors in the meal kit industry as well as the grocery space.\nMeal kit companies like Marley Spoon and Sun Basket have capitalized on consumers' desire for cheaper meals and more choice; grocers like Albertsons and Kroger have acquired smaller meal kit services to bring into their stores; and Walmart and Amazon announced plans to bring meal kits to supermarkets.\nEven Weight Watchers is jumping into the fray. The company announced plans last week for a line of quick prep meal kits at grocery stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T16:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T17:03:16.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
