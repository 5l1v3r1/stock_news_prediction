It was considering making a long seven-year sukuk issue, and also an issue of 12- or 30-year conventional bonds or both, depending on market conditions, documents from the banks leading the deal showed. \nOn Wednesday, Bahrain gave initial price guidance in the 7 percent area for the sukuk, documents from the banks showed, but they made no reference to the conventional bonds, and a banker involved in the deal confirmed to Reuters that the conventional tranche was no longer planned. \nBahrainâ€™s central bank and government information office did not respond to telephone calls and emails seeking comment.
