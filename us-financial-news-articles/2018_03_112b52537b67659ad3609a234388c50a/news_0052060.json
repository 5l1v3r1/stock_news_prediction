These include the consolidation of Ithaca's revenue following completion of the full company acquisition, and an increase in Delek Israel's revenue, which was offset by the decrease in the Group's Eastern Mediterranean revenue following the sale of 9.25% of the Group's working interest (WI) holdings in the Tamar project.\nGroup operating profit in 2017 totaled NIS 2.5 billion, compared with NIS 1.5 billion in 2016. The increase was due to an increased operating profit contribution from the E&P sector, an increase in Delek Israel's operating profit and the consolidation of Ithaca's profit.\nNet income in 2017 totaled NIS 1.2 billion compared with NIS 0.6 billion in 2016. The main contributing factor to the improvement was the increased contribution of the E&P segment, including a capital gain for sale from the Group's 9.25% WI in the Tamar project based on a sale valuation of $12 billion. The Group still holds indirectly 22% of rights which are exercisable until 2021.\nThe balance sheet continued to strengthen and current cash balance as of December 31, 2017 was NIS 2.0 billion, including unutilized credit lines and marketable securities.
