Eric Staal had the other goal for the Wild, and Ryan Suter collected two assists.\nJustin Abdelkader scored the only goal for the Red Wings, who have lost six of their last eight games. Jimmy Howard was credited with 23 saves.\nAbdelkader provided the only scoring of the first period. Jonathan Ericsson’s shot from the point was stopped, but Abdelkader pounced on the rebound in the slot and fired in his 11th goal. Dylan Larkin was also credited with an assist.\nThe Wings had an 11-5 advantage in shots on goal in the period but failed to convert on two power plays.\nTensions rose in the second period, as the Wings’ Luke Witkowski and the Wild’s Nick Seeler traded punches at the 6:41 mark. Concurrently, Detroit’s David Booth was called for hooking to give Minnesota a power play.\nLess than a minute later, the Wild tied the game on Staal’s 34th goal. He redirected Jared Sturgeon’s shot from the point past Howard’s left skate.\nParise’s fifth goal put the Wild on top 2-1 midway through the period. Nino Niederreiter picked up the puck inside his zone, skated along the right side and passed it across to Mikko Koivu. Then Koivu found Parise just inside the left circle, who beat Howard through the five-hole.\nThe score remained that way until Zucker provided some insurance with 4:18 remaining. He charged toward the net and tipped in a Mikael Granlund shot from the right boards.\nZucker added an empty-net goal with 3:38 left after a Wings giveaway at center ice.\nDetroit defeated Minnesota in the season opener for both clubs, 4-2, on Oct. 5.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:12:26.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
