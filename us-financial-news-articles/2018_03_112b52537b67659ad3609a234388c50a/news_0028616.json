Elevating comfort food in a way that it remains rooted in tradition.\nEATING BEANS AND rice is a cross-cultural phenomenon for a reason. This smoky black-bean braise, for instance, is the sort of ur-comfort food a person from most anywhere would happily lay claim to.\nThe recipe, from chef Mashama Bailey, dates back to a time before she garnered acclaim at the Grey in Savannah, Ga. She was working in Manhattan restaurants and living with her grandmother. Some black beans and a ham hock she found in the kitchen inspired her to whip up something hearty and warming. “It was cold the day I first made this,” Ms. Bailey recalled. “My grandmother really enjoyed it. She said, ‘You’d think a little old Cuban lady was in here cooking these beans.’ ”\nSimple as the dish is, it’s important to start with a solid flavor base. “Bloom the aromatics gently in butter,” Ms. Bailey said. “Once the garlic stops smelling raw, add the liquids. If the garlic is still raw, or cooked too hard, I taste it.”\nIf you have time, let this stew an hour or more and skip the puréeing; the beans will break down and thicken the broth on their own. And it’s wise to double the batch. “This is really good left over,” Ms. Bailey said. It’s enough to make you hope for more cold weather.\nTOTAL TIME: 35 minutes SERVES: 4\n1 smoked ham hock 6 cups chicken stock 2 tablespoons butter 1 large yellow onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 bay leaf 1 teaspoon chile flakes 1 green pepper, diced 2 (16-ounce) cans low-sodium black beans, drained and rinsed well Kosher salt Olive oil, optional, to finish Cooked rice, to serve\n1. Set a medium pot over high heat and add ham hock and stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. In another medium pot over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in onions, garlic, bay leaf, chile flakes and green pepper. Sauté until garlic is fragrant, 3-5 minutes.\n2. Pour hot stock and ham hock into pot with sautéed aromatics. Add extra water if hock is not covered at least ¾ of the way. Add half the black beans to the pot. In a blender, purée remaining beans until smooth. Stir bean puree into pot and simmer until flavors meld, at least 25 minutes. Loosen with splashes of water or extra broth if necessary.\n3. Before serving, season beans with salt and olive oil to taste, and simmer until salt dissolves, about 2 minutes more. Serve beans with ham sliced from hock, over rice.\nMore in Food & Drink\nMussels in Curried Cream Sauce: A Comforting Classic From Frenchette March 7, 2018 Simple, Spicy Chicken à la Diable From the Chefs at Frenchette March 1, 2018 A More Tender Meatball: Frenchette’s Flawless Recipe February 23, 2018 Classic Recipe: Steak au Poivre With Roast Potatoes February 15, 2018 Next-Level Quesadillas With Brussels Sprouts and Chile Oil February 1, 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T18:09:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
