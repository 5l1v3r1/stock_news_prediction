As leader of Rsam’s partner strategy and execution, Patel will drive business growth through the newly formed Rsam Partner Network. This announcement follows a banner year of record growth and performance for the company.\nPatel brings to Rsam a strong reputation for driving growth and acting as a trusted advisor with some of the largest partners in the industry. At Rsam, Patel will work closely with our ecosystem of partners from Strategic Alliances, Channel Partners, Managed Service Providers, and Technology Partners to develop joint go-to-market strategies to accelerate growth with our partners.\nAs his first order of business, Patel defined the program framework for the new Rsam Partner Network. The program is designed to drive increased partner revenue by improving the margins and rewards for partners that invest in their relationship with Rsam. In addition, the Rsam Partner Network provides joint marketing opportunities, thus enabling partners to leverage Rsam’s industry leadership to increase their services and value to their customers.\nSolutions providers in the Rsam Partner Network also position themselves to build strategic relationships with their customers. GRC projects are often associated with lengthy and complex implementations. This can result in a delayed time-to-value for customers and has the potential to delay the expected benefits and negatively impact the relationships solutions providers have with their customers.\nAs an agile, out-of-the-box GRC platform, Rsam is different. The intuitive platform enables customers to realize a fast time-to-value while enabling partners to spend less time on implementation and more time on advisory services. At the same time, with MSSP partners, they are able to provide a turnkey service quickly without customers having to worry about their resources for upkeep of an IRM platform.\nThe launch of the Rsam Partner Network positions the company to accelerate the momentum it achieved in 2017, Rsam experienced explosive growth resulting from the highest number of net new logos, ASP, and long-term TCV bookings.\n“Increasingly, companies are recognizing the importance of integrated risk management to reduce the risk of data breaches and minimize vendor risk, and they’re looking to build strategic relationship with partners to help them get there. We look forward to partnering with our solutions providers to deliver the technology and services that their customers need to achieve visibility across their enterprise and improve their security posture,” said Jaimin Patel, VP of Business Development for Rsam.\nPatel holds a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Rutgers University and a M.S. in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology. He has held leadership roles at Hewlett Packard Enterprise Software, Iron Mountain, and Fidelity Investments.\nAbout Rsam Integrated Risk Management Software\nRsam is the fastest time-to-value integrated risk management platform provider. Our enterprise software platform uses a relational architecture and captures data in a single, centralized repository. Unlike other systems, we don’t hard wire dependencies based on requirements that may be outdated before implementation even begins. Instead, the Rsam platform is built to adapt and put the user in control. Gone are the days of endlessly retrofitting a solution or failing to get it off the ground. With Rsam, you can have a baseline up and running in 30 days and iterate from there.
