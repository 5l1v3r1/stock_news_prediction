(NYSE American: IDN), an industry leader in identification authentication solutions, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 grew 32% to $967,612 versus $733,633 in the prior year comparable period. SaaS revenue in the fourth quarter grew 105% and totaled $569,000 versus $277,000 in the prior year comparable period. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues improved to 89.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 versus 80.0% in the prior year comparable period.\nIntellicheck CEO Bryan Lewis said \"I am excited to have this opportunity to lead this Company and take the steps necessary to monetize our great technology. We are going to refocus our efforts to drive revenue growth in our key markets.\"\nLewis explained that his vision for the Company underscores the key words focus and change. That change will include a number of new initiatives including retraining the sales force and placing a new emphasis on marketing and advertising to build product awareness. Lewis noted he is also implementing a new approach to product sales. “We are redeploying the sales force and will have a team focused exclusively on the Law ID product. To maximize our effectiveness, we have begun hiring sales people specifically for Law ID and I believe that this focused approach will be more efficient than the shotgun sales approach that has been in place to date. We will also build on our solid traction for Age ID, but with a specific concentration on large opportunities that provide economies of scale and strong revenue growth. At the same time, because banks are integrated with the end customers and are ultimately the ones most impacted by fraud, we will enhance our efforts with current and expected additional partners, recognizing that banks are one of our best partners to drive growth. Recognizing Retail ID's potential to generate the most significant revenue growth, we are going to further hone our focus on implementations with partners that provide clear opportunities for market expansion,\" he concluded.\nThe net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was ($2,910,350) or ($0.19) per diluted share versus ($1,089,152) or ($0.10) per diluted share in the comparable prior year period. The net loss includes a $500,000 expense attributable to the employment contract of the former CEO. Additionally, during the fourth quarter the Company had an impairment charge on intangible assets of $1,375,422 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges that includes the impairment charge) was a loss of ($1,327,603) for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a loss of ($851,990) in the prior year comparable period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided elsewhere in this release.\nRevenue for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $3,598,296 versus $3,838,963 in the prior year comparable period. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved to 85.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus 80.0% in the prior year comparable period.\nThe net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, that includes the $500,000 expense attributable to the employment contract of the former CEO and the $1,375,422 impairment charge was a loss of ($6,020,505) or ($0.48) per diluted share versus a loss of ($5,734,681) or ($0.58) per diluted share in the comparable prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges that includes the impairment charge) improved by $0.5 million to a loss of ($3,856,894) for fiscal 2017 versus a loss of ($4,379,421) for fiscal 2016. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided elsewhere in this release.\nCash at the end of fiscal 2017 totaled $8.0 million versus $3.1 million in the prior year comparable period. During the third quarter of 2017 the Company closed a public offering of 4,168,750 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.25 per share. Gross proceeds, before underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering costs, was approximately $9.4 million.
