That statement followed subpoenas and information requests across the cryptocurrency industry.\nRegulatory developments in the Asia Pacific region also likely put a dampener on prices this week.\nJapan's Financial Services Agency issued punishment notices to a number of exchanges in the country on Thursday, Reuters reported. Regulators also suspended operations at Bit Station and FSHO for a month, the news agency reported. \nRegulatory scrutiny in the country increased after $530 million worth of virtual tokens were stolen from Coincheck, a Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange, earlier this year. \nâ€” CNBC's Evelyn Cheng and Thomas Franck contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-09T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T06:52:38.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
