Its total market value is 5 billion euros.\nAtlantia sold its small towers unit TowerCo to Abertis in 2014. The Spanish firm then spun off its combined masts assets the following year and listed them under the Cellnex name.\n($1 = 0.8086 euros)\nReporting by Agnieszka Flak and Francesca Landini; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:23:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
