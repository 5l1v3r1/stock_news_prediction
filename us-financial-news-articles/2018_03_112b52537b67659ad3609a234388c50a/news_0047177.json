He has played in 12 tests since. \nThis year’s Rugby Europe Championship also serves as the European qualifying tournament for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. Georgia have secured qualification automatically and Romania booked their place in the tournament after finishing second ahead of Spain and Russia. \nThe third-placed team will meet Portugal in a playoff on April 4 and the winners face Samoa in a two-legged playoff for a World Cup place. \nTahiti were kicked out of World Cup qualifying last week after they were found to have breached player eligibility regulations in an Oceania Cup match.
