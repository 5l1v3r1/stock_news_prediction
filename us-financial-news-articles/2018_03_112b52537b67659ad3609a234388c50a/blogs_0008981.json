A BRF board meeting was scheduled to take place on Monday, but it is unclear whether it had occurred. \nThe police said on Monday they would serve 11 temporary arrest warrants and 53 search and seizure warrants. \nThe arrest and search warrants were carried out in the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Goiás and São Paulo, police said. \n($1 = 3.2523 reais) (Reporting by Pedro Fonseca, Ana Mano and Gabriela Mello; editing by Gareth Jones and Jason Neely and Christian Plumb)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T17:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T22:40:25.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
