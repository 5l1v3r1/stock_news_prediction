The council blocked, for example, a sale of luxury division Audi's motorcycle brand Ducati.\n\"Even though a partial IPO limits the attractiveness to investors, it signals management's strategic focus and the company's ability to shape the business,\" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a Feb. 8 note. He has an \"outperform\" rating on the stock.
