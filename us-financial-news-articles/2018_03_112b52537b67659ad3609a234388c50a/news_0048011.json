Lara is away, so I’m stepping in as temporary captain of the good ship CMO Today. Our first port of call is Amsterdam, where Dutch brewer Heineken NV is facing a maelstrom of controversy after airing an ad with the tagline “sometimes lighter is better.” The brewer acknowledged that its ad “missed the mark,” saying the tagline intended to evoke its Heineken Light beer and not, as critics suggested, racial implications. Chance the Rapper disagreed, calling the ad “terribly racist” on Twitter and suggesting the company was deliberately “baiting consumers and tweeters.” Watch the ad and decide for yourself.\nFTC Pokes Facebook The hits keep coming for Facebook. After the Guardian and the New York Times revealed that data company Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed reams of the social giant’s user data, speculation quickly turned to the possibility of regulators jumping in. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed it has opened an investigation into the social network, hours after the company acknowledged that it logs the text and call histories of some Android users, WSJ’s Robert McMillan reports . Separately, the attorneys general of 37 states and territories have formally demanded explanations from Facebook. Meanwhile, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has continued something of an apology tour. Look no further than the pages of major newspapers, where Facebook took out full-page ads signed by Mr. Zuckerberg personally apologizing for the breach of trust.\n— Regulation interrogation —\nMr. Zuckerberg has chosen his words carefully when responding to questions about government regulation of Facebook. In interviews with Wired and CNN , the Facebook founder endorsed elements of the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would increase transparency around political advertising on the internet. But he has not endorsed any new regulations around privacy or handling of user data, the issues thrown up by the Cambridge Analytica crisis. What would a regulatory response to the fallout look like? And would Facebook executives support it? We might get some answers at a congressional hearing about the future of privacy.\nGuess who’s back...back again What’s old is new at Meredith Corp. The company is reorganizing ad sales personnel at Time Inc. , which it recently acquired, to emphasize individual titles rather than industry-specific categories, WSJ’s Jeffrey Trachtenberg reports. The shift effectively reverses a strategy that Time Inc. had begun putting in place two years ago, under which its ad teams focused on major categories like pharmaceuticals, technology, telecom and automotive. The new strategy is intended to strengthen ties with ad agencies and marketers and give specific magazines greater visibility at a time when print ad revenue continues to be under pressure. The realignment includes reappointing individual publishers at Time Inc. titles, including those brands Meredith has put on the sales block: TIME, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated. The goal is to correct what Meredith sees as an unforced error by the previous management team.\nApple Pays Publishers have long complained that Apple doesn’t allow them to make money from the readership they get through Apple News. That equation could be changing, according to Digiday’s Tim Peterson , now that Apple is increasing the amount of publishers that can serve ads on Apple News using DoubleClick for Publishers. As publishers explore alternatives to Facebook, they’re finding representatives from Apple News greeting them with open arms. Despite the olive branch, some publishers may never fully embrace Apple News because the app does not send readers to their websites, essentially serving as an intermediary at a time when news organizations are seeking to build direct relationships with their audiences.\nNo deal? No problem! That’s the consensus from sources at CNN who spoke with Vanity Fair’s Joe Pompeo for a look at the network’s prospects if Time Warner’s merger with AT&T doesn’t survive a legal challenge from antitrust enforcers. Time Warner has been a safe harbor for CNN, according to people close to CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker, who suggested that employees are more concerned with the prospect of life under AT&T than they are at a traditional content company. Their jobs might be safer in a combined company with the scale and distribution to compete with the likes of Google and Facebook — but then again, it’s possible that the platforms might be in the antitrust crosshairs before long.\nBest of the rest Google’s approach to Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation could be a template for other tech giants.
