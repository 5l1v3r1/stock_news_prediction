The creation of the benchmark, which would exist alongside the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), Canada’s version of LIBOR, echoes efforts in other countries to develop new risk-free or nearly risk-free reference rates. The central bank said the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) would be sponsored by the Canadian Fixed-Income Forum and co-chaired by a senior representative of the bank and a member of the forum. “To maximize transparency and achieve broad consensus on the working group’s proposals, feedback will be sought from a wide range of stakeholders through targeted industry round tables and the publication of consultation papers,” the bank said in a statement. The group will also explore possible enhancements to the existing Canadian overnight risk-free rate, the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), to consider ways to broaden the volume of trades used to calculate the rate, the bank said. CDOR is a rate at which banks will lend to corporate clients using bankers’ acceptances, a short-term credit instrument. It is calculated daily by Thomson Reuters based on rate submissions from banks.
