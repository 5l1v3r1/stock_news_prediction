Aramchol™'s ability to modulate hepatic lipid metabolism was discovered and validated in animal models, demonstrating downregulation of the three key pathologies of NASH: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. The effect of Aramchol™ on fibrosis is mediated by downregulation of steatosis and directly on human collagen producing cells. Aramchol™ has been granted Fast Track designation status by the FDA for the treatment of NASH.\nNASH is an emerging world crisis impacting an estimated 3% to 5% of the U.S. population and an estimated 2% to 4% globally. It is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S. due to the rise in obesity. NASH is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that can lead to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis and liver-related mortality.\nAbout Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGalmed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol™, a first in class, novel, once-daily, oral therapy for the treatment of NASH for variable populations, as well as other liver associated disorders. Galmed is currently conducting the ARREST Study, a multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aramchol™ in subjects with NASH, who are overweight or obese, and who are pre-diabetic or type-II-diabetic. More information about the ARREST Study may be found on ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02279524.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galmed-pharmaceuticals-to-report-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-and-provide-business-update-on-tuesday-march-13-300607900.html\nSOURCE Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galmed-pharmaceuticals-to-report-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2017-financial-results-and-provide-business-update-on-tuesday-march-13-300607900.html", "http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=128520"], "published": "2018-03-05T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T14:58:05.050+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
