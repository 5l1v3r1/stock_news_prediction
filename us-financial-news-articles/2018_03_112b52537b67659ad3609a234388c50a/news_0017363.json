We expect some disruptions, possibly over Easter, maybe over the summer period,” he said.\nChief Operations Officer Peter Bellew said at a separate news conference in Berlin that Ryanair expected to achieve a collective wage agreement in Germany over the coming months.\nA meeting has been scheduled with German pilots’ union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) for next week, he said.\nThe union had called the first-ever pilots strike at Ryanair in December, saying it did not believe Ryanair was serious about negotiating with unions.\nRyanair has not yet sought similar collective agreements with staff other than pilots, though Bellew said there had been some early discussions with unions representing cabin crew.
