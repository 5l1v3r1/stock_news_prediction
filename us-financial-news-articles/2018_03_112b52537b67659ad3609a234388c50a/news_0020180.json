Trump’s aides have been wary of North Korea’s diplomatic overtures because of its history of reneging on international commitments.\nThe chance of any easing in geopolitical tensions in the region helped Japan’s Nikkei climb 2.3 percent. South Korean stocks enjoyed their best day since May with a rise of 1.76 percent.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, while Australia firmed 0.5 percent.\nThe mood had already brightened a little after Trump pressed ahead with tariffs but offered conditional exemptions for Canada and Mexico, offering at least the hope a full-blown trade war could be averted.\nThe White House said other countries could apply for exemptions on the 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminium, but details were sparse on when they might be granted and under what terms. Several major trading partners have said they will respond with tariffs or direct action of their own. “Markets have cheered up a little but exclusions are likely to come with caveats demanding reciprocity - that’s the kind of guy the President is,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at broker AxiTrader.\n“Fears have been eased in the immediate term, but it’s clear that China, and to a lesser extent the EU, is about to come in for greater scrutiny.”\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added another 0.1 percent. The Dow ended Thursday with a gain of 0.38 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.45 percent and the Nasdaq 0.42 percent.\nThe Canadian dollar and Mexican peso inched higher, though both countries remain locked in tough negotiations with the United States over NAFTA.\nRising protectionism was a risk cited overnight by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi following the central bank’s latest policy meeting.\nWhile the ECB did drop its easing bias as some expected, Draghi sounded in no rush to start unwinding stimulus.\nBOJ ON THE BLOCKS The dovish tone was enough to see the euro fade back to $1.2305, having shed 0.8 percent on Thursday. That helped the U.S. dollar firm on a basket of currencies to 90.232.\nThe dollar gained 0.6 percent on the yen to 106.84, amid the recovery in risk appetite. Attention now turns to the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting later on Friday.\nFears of a global trade war, recent market volatility and a strong yen give the bank plenty of reason to maintain its massive asset buying campaign, and to play down the prospect of an exit anytime soon.\n“Actual policy tweaks in terms of asset purchases or yield-curve control settings remain some way off, but words can be very powerful,” said analysts at ANZ.\n“Any more detailed hints about timing will move the yen,” they added. “The global liquidity being provided by the BOJ and ECB has taken on added importance for asset markets since the Federal Reserve starting winding back its own quantitative easing programme.”\nOil prices recouped some ground in Asia after slipping overnight. U.S. crude bounced 32 cents to $60.44 per barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 39 cents to $64.00 per barrel.\nReporting by Wayne Cole Editing by Eric Meijer and Sam Holmes\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T08:47:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
