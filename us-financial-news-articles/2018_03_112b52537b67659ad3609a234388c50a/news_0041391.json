In 2017, Dropbox lost $111.7 million, which was 47% less than the $305.0 million it lost the previous year. \nSilicon Valley investor Sam Altman , the president of venture capital firm Y Combinator, congratulated Dropbox on Twitter and shared a picture of the checks investor Jessica Livingston wrote to Dropbox CEO Drew Houston in 2007, when the company was founded.
