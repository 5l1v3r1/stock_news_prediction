We must become more relevant to more people offering the right products at the right prices to appeal to our core customers and attract new ones,” said McDonald.\nFerrer, design director since 2015, is moving to Amsterdam to be with her family, while Earl, style director since 2012, is stepping down from her commercial role but will continue to work in an advisory capacity.\nM&S also said Michael Kerr, currently menswear and kidswear director, was leaving the retailer after 35 years.\nIt said Laura Charles has been promoted to the new position of lingerie director, while home director Neil Harrison will also take on responsibility for beauty.\nM&S re-set its strategy in November, two months after retail veteran Archie Norman joined as chairman.\nThe firm said it would speed up store closures, accelerate the relocation and downsizing of other stores, and reposition its food offering.\nLast week M&S replaced food boss Andy Adcock with Steinhoff UK executive Stuart Machin.\nThis year it has also detailed changes to its technology function, clothing and home logistics and food marketing.\nShares in M&S, which have fallen 19 percent over the past year, were little changed at 1445 GMT.
