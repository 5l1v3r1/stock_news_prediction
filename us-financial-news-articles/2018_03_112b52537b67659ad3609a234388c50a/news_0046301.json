REUTERS/Carlf Zhang The World Bank has published a new study which highlights the incidence and significant consequences of agricultural pollution in China, Vietnam and the Philippines, it said.\n“This report shows that a reorientation of public policy and spending toward pollution control can benefit farmers and consumers alike,” Victoria Kwakwa, the bank’s vice president for East Asia, said in the statement.\nIn China, the bank’s efforts include projects reducing ammonia from fertilizer application in Hebei province, and reducing crop and livestock pollution in Guangdong province.\nChina has been hit by a series of food safety scandals in recent years such as contaminated milk powder and recycled cooking oil, and has embarked on its own nationwide crackdown on farm pollution.\nThe country will form a powerful new competition and food safety regulator to strengthen oversight of mergers and acquisitions and price-fixing as the world’s second-largest economy seeks to make policymaking more efficient.\nWorld Bank financing will also help scale up innovative aquaculture practices that increase shrimp yields while reducing water pollution on about 100,000 hectares over the next 5 years in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, the statement said.\nIn the Philippines, a World Bank-financed irrigation project has trained farmers in alternate wetting and drying growing methods that save water and energy while increasing rice yields.\nReporting by Naveen Thukral; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T03:40:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
