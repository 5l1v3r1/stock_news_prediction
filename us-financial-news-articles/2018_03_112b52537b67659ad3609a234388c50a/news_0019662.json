REUTERS/Adnan Abidi The Washington museum’s rescission of its Elie Wiesel Award to Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is the latest honor to be retracted over her silence about widespread abuses against the Rohingya.\nSuu Kyi and her National League for Democracy have refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, fed hate attacks on the Rohingya and denied reporters access to areas where alleged abuses have taken place, the museum said in a letter to Suu Kyi that was posted on its website.\n“It is with great regret that we are now rescinding that award. We did not take this decision likely,” it said in the letter dated March 6.\nA spokesman for the Myanmar Embassy was not available to comment about the move by the museum, which is dedicated to victims of Nazism.\nThe United Nations and human rights organizations have collected evidence of widespread abuses by the Myanmar military against the largely stateless Rohingya, including murder, rape and arson. The attacks have prompted nearly 700,000 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar denies the abuse charges and says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against “terrorists” it blames for attacks on security forces.\nThe plight of the Rohingya has sparked outrage around the world. There have been calls for Suu Kyi to be stripped of her Nobel prize, won for her decades-long pro-democracy fight, for not speaking out to condemn the Myanmar military’s actions.\nSuu Kyi is Myanmar’s state counselor and foreign minister. She has had other honors rescinded, including the freedoms of the cities of Dublin and Oxford, England. Last month, three Nobel peace laureates urged Suu Kyi and the military to end the “genocide” of Rohingya Muslims now or face prosecution.\nReporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T21:30:17.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
