Also fuelling fears of a trade war, Trump has fired his Secretary of State, regarded as a moderate in his administration. ** Investors shrugged off stronger-than-expected data from China which showed the country’s industrial output expanded at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also handily beat forecasts, while retail sales improved from December. ** Larry Hu, analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd, forecast that China’s growth in March will slow. “As domestic demand is clearly softening, we expect Jan-Feb growth to be the peak for the year,” he wrote. **The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares rose 0.3 percent, while the IT sector rose 0.01 percent, the financial sector was 0.93 percent lower and property sector rose 0.17 percent. ** The top gainer on Hang Seng was Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd up 1.6 percent, while the biggest loser was AAC Technologies Holdings Inc which was down 2.81 percent. ** China’s main Shanghai Composite index closed down 0.57 percent at 3,310.2389 points, while its blue-chip CSI300 index ended down 0.44 percent. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.41 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei index closed down 0.87 percent. ** The yuan was quoted at 6.3156 per U.S. dollar at 08:20 GMT, 0.13 percent firmer than the previous close of 6.324. ** As of the previous trading session, the Hang Seng index was up 5.62 percent this year, while China’s H-share index was up 8.9 percent.
