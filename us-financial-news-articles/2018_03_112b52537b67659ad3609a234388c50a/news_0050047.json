Its clients range from the Royal Ascot Racecourse in England to the U.S. Marine Corps.\nBut its businesses in healthcare and education - such as schools and universities - in north America experienced a fall in first-half revenues, while cost savings to improve profits in that region had not yet kicked in.\nSodexo also said profits from several large contracts had had a slower ramp up.\nNew Chief Executive Denis Machuel, who took over in January, said: “It is very disappointing to start with having to reduce our guidance ... We have identified specific areas of underperformance and are acting quickly to implement a series of corrective measures,” Machuel said.\nSodexo said it would address underperforming contracts and carry out a full review of its costs.\nMachuel said Sodexo would aim for a better balance between large contracts and medium or smaller-size contracts, and look to reinforce its focus on smaller, local food contracts.\n“I am confident we will deliver strong growth over the medium term,” he added.\nSHARES SLUMP Sodexo shares were down 12.7 percent in mid-session trading, with the stock on track for its worst one-day percentage loss since September 2002. Sodexo’s troubles also hit the shares of rivals Compass and Elior.\n“Given management guidance we see potential for consensus EBIT downgrades of over 10 percent and material share pressure near term,” UBS analysts wrote in a note.\nSodexo said it now expected to deliver organic revenue growth of between 1-1.5 percent for the 2018 fiscal year, and an underlying profit margin of around 5.7 percent.\nIn January, Sodexo had forecast revenue growth of between 2-4 percent and a flat operating margin at 6.5 percent of sales for the full year ending August 31, 2018, excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency movements.\nFor the first-half ended Feb. 28, organic revenue growth was 1.7 percent and underlying operating margin was 6.1 percent, with both coming below expectations, the company said.\nJefferies analysts said Sodexo was likely to be preoccupied with devising and implementing a reboot strategy over the next few quarters to recover lost market share.\nCost savings, which the group has yet to quantify, will be used to improve competitiveness, invest in digital, IT, marketing and sales to boost revenue, Sodexo said.\nSodexo, which continues to generate “substantial free cash flow” will also make targeted acquisitions, notably in the food sector, said Machuel, who took over CEO Michel Landel who retired at the annual shareholders meeting on January 23. Machuel was Sodexo’s digital boss and deputy CEO since September 2017.\nThe group has a medium-term objective of average annual revenue growth, excluding currency effects, of between 4 percent and 7 percent. Machuel said he was not revising it.
