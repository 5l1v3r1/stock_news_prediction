An effective duration of 4.769 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 4.769% decrease in the value of the MBS in the Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2016. These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio but not the effect of the Company’s funding cost hedges. Effective duration Quote: s for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc.\nFinancing, Leverage and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding repurchase obligations of approximately $200.2 million with a net weighted average borrowing rate of 1.52%. These agreements were collateralized by MBS with a fair value, including accrued interest, of approximately $210.0 million. At December 31, 2017, the Company’s liquidity was approximately $6.5 million, consisting of unpledged MBS and cash and cash equivalents.\nWe may pledge more of our structured MBS as part of a repurchase agreement funding, but retain cash in lieu of acquiring additional assets. In this way, we can, at a modest cost, retain higher levels of cash on hand and decrease the likelihood we will have to sell assets in a distressed market in order to raise cash.

The Company has not elected hedging treatment under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in order to align the accounting treatment of its derivative instruments with the treatment of its portfolio assets under the fair value option election. As such all gains or losses on these instruments are reflected in earnings for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2017, such instruments were comprised entirely of Eurodollar futures contracts.\nThe table below presents information related to outstanding Eurodollar futures positions at December 31, 2017.\n($ in thousands) Repurchase Agreement Funding Hedges Average Weighted Weighted Contract Average Average Notional Entry LIBOR Open Expiration Year Amount Rate Rate Equity (1) 2018 $ 60,000 1.90 % 1.97 % $ 41 2019 60,000 2.32 % 2.27 % (31 ) 2020 60,000 2.60 % 2.36 % (145 ) 2021 60,000 2.80 % 2.42 % (230 ) Total / Weighted Average $ 60,000 2.41 % 2.25 % $ (365 )\n($ in thousands) Junior Subordinated Debt Funding Hedges Average Weighted Weighted Contract Average Average Notional Entry LIBOR Open Expiration Year Amount Rate Rate Equity (1) 2018 $ 26,000 1.84 % 1.97 % $ 33 2019 26,000 1.63 % 2.27 % 166 2020 26,000 1.95 % 2.36 % 107 2021 26,000 2.22 % 2.42 % 51 Total / Weighted Average $ 26,000 1.91 % 2.25 % $ 357 (1) Open equity represents the cumulative gains (losses) recorded on open futures positions.\nBook Value Per Share\nThe Company's Book Value Per Share at December 31, 2017 was $4.40. The Company computes Book Value Per Share by dividing total stockholders' equity by the total number of shares outstanding of the Company's Class A Common Stock. At December 31, 2017, the Company's stockholders’ equity was $55.7 million with 12,660,627 Class A Common shares outstanding.\nManagement Commentary\nCommenting on the fourth quarter, Robert E. Cauley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The fourth quarter of 2017 was another strong growth quarter for Bimini. This caps a strong year as we continue to take advantage of our tax net operating loss carryforwards to organically grow our MBS portfolio at our subsidiary, Royal Palm Capital. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed late in the year, lowered the corporate rate from 35% to 21% and therefore caused us to record a significant tax provision of $18.1 million primarily due to the lowered value of our deferred tax asset, we continued to generate positive net cash flows to deploy into the MBS portfolio. As the external manager of Orchid Island Capital, our management fees increase as Orchid Island is able to grow its capital base. During the fourth quarter of 2017 Orchid grew its capital base by approximately 12% and approximately 39% for all of 2017. This caused our advisory services revenue to increase by 5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 35% for the year. The incremental revenues enabled us to grow the MBS portfolio at Royal Palm by 6% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 61% for all of 2017. As the portfolio grows our net interest income typically grows as well, depending on changes in the average yield of our assets in relation to our funding costs. For the fourth quarter of 2017 our net interest income grew by 28% and the sum of our net interest income and dividends on our Orchid Island shares increased by 22%. For the year the comparable figures are 22% and 30%.\n“As Orchid Island management fees increase and/or the Royal Palm portfolio grows, the potential net interest income generated by the MBS portfolio grows. With the tax net operating losses we are able to retain any net income and increase the size of the portfolio further. We intend to use this organic growth model to utilize our available loss carryovers. We estimate these loss carryovers to be $19.1 million at Bimini and $253.5 million at Royal Palm as of December 31, 2017\nTurning to macroeconomic developments for the quarter, the fourth quarter of 2017 marked a reversal of the trend in place for the first nine months of the year. The shifts that occurred were numerous. Perhaps the most significant from a long-term perspective was the surprise success the Trump administration had in passing a substantive tax package – The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”). The significance of the Act was two-fold. On the one hand, its passage ended the Trump administration’s string of legislative failures, and on the other, we believe the legislation should be stimulative for the economy – at least for the first five years after passage and before certain provisions are reduced or eliminated. The effect of the passage of the Act was reinforced by strong economic data that bolstered the “risk on” sentiment in the markets. The equity markets continued to set new record high closes almost daily, while other risk assets, such as commodities and investment grade and sub-investment grade debt, continued to perform very well.\n“A second significant event that impacted the markets during the fourth quarter actually occurred late in the third quarter. Following the September 2017 meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”), chair Yellen stated the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”) viewed recent soft inflation data as owing to transitory factors and that they remained confident that inflation would trend towards their 2% target level over the medium term. This acknowledgement by the Fed that they would look past soft inflation data in the near term, and continue to remove accommodation, forced the market to reprice expectations for additional interest rate hikes. Just prior to the September 2017 meeting, the market was pricing in an approximately 50% chance of one hike by the Fed over the next 12 months. In contrast, the Fed’s most recent “dot plot” implies three interest rate hikes in 2018. By January 2018, the market was pricing over 2.5 hikes in 2018, and the gap that existed in August and early September 2017 had essentially been closed. Further, the yield on the 10-year U.S. T-Note reached 2.406% by December 29, 2017, and surpassed 2.9% in February 2018. This represents a significant movement from August 2017 when the 10-year U.S. T-Note was threatening to break below 2%. Combined, these two events drove the yield curve flatter, with the January 29, 2018 yield spread between the 5-year U.S. T-Note and 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond at the lowest level since late 2007.\n“The mortgage market was impacted by these events in a positive way. The strong “risk on” tone of the markets continued to drive spreads available in the various investment grade and sub-investment grade markets tighter. By comparison, Agency MBS spreads appeared relatively attractive and continued to tighten over the course of the fourth quarter. In early January 2018, the spread of the 30-year, fixed rate conventional mortgage to the 10-year U.S. T-Note hit its tightest level since early 2013. This spread has since widened as longer-term rates continue to inch higher, as extension fears entered the market. Extension refers to the phenomenon by which the weighted average life of a mortgage cash flow extends as prepayment activity slows due to higher prevailing mortgage rates available to borrowers. Going forward, the balance between the volume of mortgage supply – generally a function of the level of available mortgage rates and prepayment levels - and the effect of reduced purchases by the Fed will be critical for Agency MBS performance.”\nSummarized Financial Statements\nThe following is a summarized presentation of the unaudited consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, and the unaudited consolidated statements of operations for the calendar quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
