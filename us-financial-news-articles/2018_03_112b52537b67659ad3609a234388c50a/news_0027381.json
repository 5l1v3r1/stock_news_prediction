Think Wright Brothers, not F-22 fighter jet.

They concluded it could fly in bursts over relatively short distances like pheasants, peacocks and roadrunners. Birds evolved in the Jurassic Period from small feathered dinosaurs, and represent the only dinosaur group to have survived the mass extinction event 66 million years ago. Crow-sized Archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago in a tropical archipelago that is now Bavaria, combined primitive dinosaur characteristics with traits seen in modern birds. Its fossils were first discovered in 1861 and it was long considered the earliest-known bird, though there is now a spirited scientific debate about defining the first birds. “Many researchers have assumed that Archaeopteryx exhibited a very primitive way of flying that would have been equivalent to that of gliding from tree to tree, like extant flying squirrels do,” said palaeontologist Sophie Sanchez of Uppsala University in Sweden. “It, therefore, is a big surprise to actually recognise adaptations consistent with active flight.” The Munich specimen of the transitional dino-bird Archaeopteryx is shown in this picture taken in 2014 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France and released on March 13, 2018. Courtesy ESRF/Pascal Goetgheluck/Handout via REUTERS “We are convinced that this presents the best indication for active flight in Archaeopteryx brought to light in the last 150 years,” added palaeontologist Dennis Voeten of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France, though he called it “a poor flyer.” Archaeopteryx boasted teeth, a long tail and had no bony, keeled sternum where flight muscles attach. Its flight capabilities may have enabled Archaeopteryx to escape predators or fly among islands. The researchers focused on a cross-section of the wing bones and their density of blood vessels. They found similarities to birds capable of short-distance flight, not gliding and soaring varieties like birds of prey. Archaeopteryx was likely able to take off from the ground, but must have used a unique flying style, Sanchez said. It lacked important traits in the shoulders of modern birds, making it impossible to beat its wings the way they do. “We propose that it would have been able to use its wings to propel its body in a fashion that superficially resembles the stroke of butterfly swimmers,” Sanchez said. The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.
