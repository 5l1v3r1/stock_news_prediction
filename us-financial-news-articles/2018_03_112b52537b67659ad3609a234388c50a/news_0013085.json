(NYSE American: CMT) (\"Core Molding\" or the \"Company\") today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"The Company continued to see a rebound in product sales in the fourth quarter of 2017,\" stated Kevin Barnett, Core Molding Technologies President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our product sales in the fourth quarter 2017 were up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of last year as a result of stronger demand from our heavy-duty truck and marine customers and sales from new products launched during 2017. Overall, total net sales were lower in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017 when compared to 2016, due to a sizeable decrease in tooling sales that are project based and sporadic in nature. We are disappointed that the higher product sales in the fourth quarter 2017 did not result in higher profitability as we experienced inefficiencies as a result of both the increase in overall volume and challenging new product startups.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016:\nNet sales were $39.1 million compared to $49.1 million. Product sales were $37.9 million compared to $33.5 million. Gross margin was 13.0% compared to 14.6%. Operating income was $0.8 million compared to $3.1 million. Net income was $0.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $2.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share.\nYear ended 2017 Compared to Year ended 2016:\nNet sales were $161.7 million compared to $174.9 million. Product sales were $148.6 million compared to $146.6 million. Gross margin was 15.3% compared to 16.0%. Operating income was $8.0 million compared to $11.5 million. Net income was $5.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared with $7.4 million, or $0.97 per diluted share.\nGross margin decreased in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher raw material and labor costs. The Company received raw material price increases from several vendors primarily driven by underlying cost pressures. Labor costs were impacted by tighter labor markets, training and overtime related to multiple new program launches, volume ramp and other production inefficiencies. The fourth quarter was also impacted by $600,000 of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Horizon Plastics International, Inc. (\"Horizon Plastics\") completed in January 2018. The Tax Cuts and Job Act enacted on December 22, 2017 had a positive impact on net income for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 of $185,000, or $.02 per share.\nFinancial Position at December 31, 2017:\nCash and cash equivalents of $26.8 million. Total assets of $137.6 million. Total debt of $6.8 million. Stockholders' equity of $101.9 million.\nThe Company's financial position remains very healthy with stockholders' equity exceeding $100 million at year-end for the first time ever.\nOutlook\nMr. Barnett stated, \"Product revenues in 2017 stabilized compared to 2016, which saw a year over year decrease in product revenues of 22%. In 2018, we expect product sales to increase versus 2017, driven largely by further strengthening in demand by heavy-duty truck and marine customers. Industry sources forecast an increase in heavy-duty truck production levels for 2018 of approximately 25%. We anticipate that raw material prices will remain elevated and that labor conditions will remain tight as the economy continues to grow. However, we are focused on improving our operational performance, including product startup inefficiencies, as we move forward.\"\nMr. Barnett concluded, \"We have started integration of our recently announced acquisition of Horizon Plastics and are excited about the opportunities the acquisition brings to our combined organization. The acquisition met several of our strategic goals including diversifying our end markets, expanding our material and process offerings and increasing our geographic reach. We look forward to successfully bringing our combined technologies to both our traditional markets and to those opened by this acquisition.\"\nDividend\nThe Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 19, 2018.\nAbout Core Molding Technologies, Inc.\nCore Molding Technologies, Inc. is a manufacturer of sheet molding compound (SMC) and molder of fiberglass reinforced thermoset and thermoplastic materials.
