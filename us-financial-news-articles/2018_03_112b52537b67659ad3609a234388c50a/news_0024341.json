My charitable trust club knows this one killed me, but you know what? Down here, I'm going to say it's OK to buy.\"\nDominion Energy Inc. : \"I want you to buy more. Remember, it's totally [beholden to] interest rates. Let's see what the 10-year Treasury does [on Friday]. Maybe pick some up. But it's a good long-term hold.\"\nLululemon Athletica Inc. : \"I think Lulu's fine. Obviously I was stunned by the departure of the previous CEO, but Glenn Murphy's good.

I've got a couple others, but I think Bank of America's fine.\"\nEPR Properties : \"I am torn about EPR. We've had them on a bunch of times, but candidly, they missed the quarter and they missed badly and there were real concerns about credit issues. It was bad, what can I say?
