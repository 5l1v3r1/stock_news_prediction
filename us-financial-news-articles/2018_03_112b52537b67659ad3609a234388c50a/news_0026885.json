(NYSE American: LEU) today reported results for the fourth quarter 2017 and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n2017 Summary:\nGross profit of $56.8 million on revenue of $218.4 million for full year Net income of $12.2 million Cash balance of $208.8 million at year’s end Completed a private exchange for majority of PIK Notes, reducing long-term debt by more than half and extending maturity Long-term LEU sales order book at $1.3 billion Contract to advance U.S. uranium enrichment technology extended through September 2018 Memorandum of Understanding with leading advanced reactor company to develop next generation reactor fuel\n“In 2017, Centrus completed several initiatives critical to our long-term success, including a restructuring of our balance sheet, improvements to our business operations, securing new fuel supply and sales contracts, and extending our contract to advance U.S. gas centrifuge technology for future energy and national security purposes,” said Daniel B. Poneman, Centrus president and chief executive officer.\n“For the year, we met our guidance for revenue and year end cash, earned net income of $12.2 million, and met our internal milestones for the decontamination and decommissioning of our demonstration cascade on time and ahead of budget,” Poneman added. “As we look to the future, we are working to leverage our unique technical and advanced manufacturing capabilities to diversify our business through new services and partners, such as our recent agreement with X-energy to develop next-generation reactor fuel.”\nFinancial Results\nCentrus reported a net income of $35.5 million, or $3.69 per common share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $8.2 million, or $0.90 per share (basic and diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, the Company reported net income of $12.2 million, or $0.58 per share (basic and diluted), compared to net loss of $67.0 million, or $7.36 per share (basic and diluted), in 2016.\nFavorable factors in 2017 include an $11.7 million increase in gross profit, including an increase in gains on the remeasurements of retirement plan obligations of $24.9 million, a $32.2 million decline in advanced technology license and decommissioning costs, a $14.4 million decline in interest expense, and a $33.6 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt. The Company also recorded $9.5 million in special charges in 2017.\nRevenue and Cost of Sales\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $116.9 million, a decrease of 14 percent compared to $136.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for 2017 was $218.4 million, a decrease of 30 percent compared to $311.3 million in the prior year. Total revenue for 2017 was within guidance previously provided for 2017.\nFor the full year, revenue for the LEU segment totaled $195.4 million, a decline of $77.4 million, or 28 percent, in 2017 compared to 2016. The volume of SWU sales decreased 21 percent. The average price billed to customers for sales of SWU declined 4 percent, reflecting the particular contracts under which SWU were sold during the periods and the trend of lower SWU market prices in recent years. Revenue from the LEU segment for 2017 was within guidance provided throughout 2017 and reflects expected declines in SWU and uranium volumes delivered compared to 2016.\nRevenue from the contract services segment was $23.0 million in 2017, a decline of $15.5 million, or 40 percent, compared to 2016 due to the reduced scope of contract work for American Centrifuge technology services in the current year and the timing of revenue recognition in the prior year. As a result of the contract signed with UT-Battelle in March 2016, revenue in 2016 included $30.4 million for work in 2016 as well as $8.1 million for March 2016 reports on work performed in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCost of sales for the LEU segment declined $98.2 million, or 42 percent, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the changes in SWU sales volumes noted above and declines in the average cost of sales per SWU. Cost of sales is affected by sales volumes, unit costs of inventory, and direct charges to cost of sales including legacy costs related to former Gaseous Diffusion Plant (GDP) employees.\nRetiree benefit costs for former GDP employees resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of $23.1 million in 2017 compared to an increase in cost of sales of $4.2 million in 2016. These results included the impacts of periodic remeasurements of pension and postretirement benefit obligations. In 2017, the net gain recognized for retiree benefit costs reflects favorable investment returns relative to the expected return assumption, changes in mortality and healthcare claim assumptions, and favorable claims experience, partially offset by declines in market interest rates and changes in retiree benefits. Excluding direct charges for the retiree benefit costs, the average cost of sales per SWU declined 5 percent, reflecting declines in the Company’s purchase costs per SWU in recent periods.\nCost of sales for the contract services segment declined $6.4 million, or 20 percent, in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the reduced scope of contract work.\nGross Profit\nCentrus realized a gross profit of $56.8 million in 2017, an increase of $11.7 million compared to $45.1 million in 2016. The Company realized an increase in gross profit of $20.8 million for the LEU segment primarily due the net gain in 2017 related to retiree benefit costs and the decline in the average cost of sales per SWU, partially offset by the decline in sales volumes and the decline in the average SWU price billed to customers. Centrus realized a gross loss of $2.5 million for the contract services segment in 2017 compared to a gross profit of $6.6 million in 2016. Revenue for the contract services segment in 2016 included a billing for March 2016 reports on work performed in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nAdvanced Technology License and Decommissioning Costs\nAdvanced technology license and decommissioning costs consist of American Centrifuge expenses that are outside of our contracts with UT-Battelle, including ongoing costs to maintain the demobilized Piketon facility and the Company’s U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses at that location. For 2017, costs declined $32.2 million, or 67 percent, compared to 2016. Costs in the prior year included demobilization costs of approximately $7.0 million incurred in early 2016 in preparation for the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of the Piketon facility. Charges in 2016 also included $19.0 million to increase the accrued D&D liability based on updated cost estimates that reflected changes in the approach and schedule. D&D costs commenced in the second quarter of 2016 and are charged against the D&D liability. Most of the D&D work was completed by December 31, 2017, and a credit of $5.9 million to advanced technology license and decommissioning costs was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of using primarily internal resources and less contractor support as well as efficiencies achieved. Centrus will continue to incur costs of approximately $20 million to maintain the demobilized Piketon facility until the facility is returned to the U.S. Department of Energy when the lease expires in June 2019.\nSG&A and Special Charges\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined $3.1 million, or 7 percent, in 2017 compared to 2016, of which $2.3 million relates to the periodic remeasurements of pension benefit obligations. Remeasurements in 2017 resulted in a net gain of $0.7 million and remeasurements in 2016 resulted in a net loss of $1.6 million. The gain and loss are mainly attributable to (a) changes in market interest rates used to measure long-term pension obligations and (b) investment returns relative to expected return assumptions. In 2017, consulting costs declined $1.4 million compared to 2016 and compensation and benefit costs increased $0.7 million compared to 2016.\nSpecial charges were $9.5 million for 2017 and included estimated employee termination benefits of $3.5 million, less $0.3 million for unvested employee departures. Special charges for estimated employee termination benefits were $0.4 million in 2016. Advisory costs related to the Company’s project to align its corporate structure to the scale of its ongoing business operations and to update related information technology were $6.3 million in 2017 and $1.0 million in 2016.\nCash Flow\nCentrus ended 2017 with a consolidated cash balance of $208.8 million. During 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $25.1 million. American Centrifuge expenditures have been a use of cash, including the $37.6 million reduction in the D&D obligation. Sources of cash included $17.7 million resulting from the monetization of inventory offset by an increase in customer receivables.\n2018 Outlook\nCentrus anticipates SWU and uranium revenue in 2018 in a range of $150 million to $175 million, reflecting a decline in average sales prices compared to 2017 as more sales are made under contracts that reflect more recent market conditions. The Company anticipates total revenue in a range of $175 million to $200 million. Revenue continues to be most heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, and Centrus expects more than one-half of its annual revenue to be generated in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company expects to end 2018 with a cash and cash equivalents balance in a range of $100 million to $125 million. The anticipated decrease in cash and cash equivalents in 2018 is driven by the expected timing of purchases under supply agreements and an increase in required cash contributions to the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.\nCentrus’ financial guidance is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties that could affect results either positively or negatively. Variations from these expectations could cause differences between the Company’s guidance and its ultimate results. Among the factors that could affect its results are:\nAdditional short-term purchases or sales of SWU and uranium; Timing of customer payments, orders, related deliveries, and purchases of LEU or components; The outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies; Potential use of cash for strategic initiatives; Actions taken by our customers, including actions that might affect our existing contracts, as a result of market, financial and other conditions impacting our customers and the industry; and Additional costs for decontamination and decommissioning of the Company’s facility in Ohio.\nConference Call\nCentrus Energy’s investor conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results is scheduled for March 15, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EDT. A live webcast of the conference call can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.centrusenergy.com , and a recording of the call will be available on the site through March 29, 2018.\nAbout Centrus Energy Corp.\nCentrus Energy is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry.
