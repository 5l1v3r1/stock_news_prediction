He was acquitted of looting Retrophin to reimburse investors in the two hedge funds.\nThough Judge Matsumoto has certainly not taken it easy on Shkreli throughout the case, the ruling is more mild than the 20 years he could have served for his crimes .\nOn Mar. 5, the judge ordered him to turn the $7.4 million he made from his crimes over to the government (including the one-and-only copy of a Wu Tang clan album he purchased and proceeded to hold ransom last year).\nShkreli, who has been in jail since September when he put out a $5,000 bounty on a strand of Hillary Clinton’s hair , was hoping for a sentence of 16 months or less .\nThis sentencing was not related to that bounty or to the inflation of drug prices. This jail time only addresses his misleading investors about his MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare hedge funds .\n“The fact that he continues to remain unaware of the inappropriateness of his actions or words demonstrates that he may well be an ongoing danger or risk to the community,” Matsumoto said when ordering the pharma bro to remain behind bars prior to sentencing on Friday.\nShkreli said in a letter that jail “has some redeeming qualities .” He plans to appeal his conviction .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T01:38:01.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
