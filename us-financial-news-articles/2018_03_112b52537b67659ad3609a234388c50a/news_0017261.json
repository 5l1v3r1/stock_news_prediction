His tweets often shape news and are retweeted tens of thousands of times.\nBaer, who works for the U.S. Department of Justice, has also argued that Trump’s use of Twitter was personal, and did not qualify as a “state action.”\nIn contrast, Katherine Fallow, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Buchwald the record “shows unambiguously that the president operates his account in an official capacity.”\nShe said Trump often uses Twitter to announce policies or policy proposals, such as banning the military from accepting transgender recruits.\nTwitter lets users post snippets of text, called tweets, to which other users may respond. When one user blocks another, the blocked user cannot respond to the blocker’s tweets.\nIt is not clear when Buchwald will rule.\nReporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T18:51:19.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
