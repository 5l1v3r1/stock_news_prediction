The acquisition complements Algolia's new Search Analytics and Click Analytics solutions, which for the first time give customers a view into the entire search lifecycle from query to click-through to conversion.\nConsumer expectations for an intuitive and personalized digital experience are putting the pressure on businesses to take a smarter, data-driven approach to building an amazing user experience.

Algolia's Search API is central to how digital search and discovery experiences are built, managed, and now today -- measured and optimized.\n\"Our customers are sitting on a wealth of data - every search query, every click contains valuable insights about what their users are ultimately looking for,\" said Nicolas Dessaigne, CEO and Co-Founder of Algolia. \"Our mission is to give developers the building blocks to create intuitive and rewarding user experiences. The addition of SeaUrchin.IO to the Algolia toolkit helps us deliver on that mission by providing the data and insights to make a meaningful impact on the business.\"\nBetter Insight into User Search Behavior - From Query to Conversion\nAlgolia's new Analytics and Click Analytics APIs help product teams see not only what users are searching for and how they are searching, but also what they are clicking on and the conversion and engagement performance for each query. Businesses can then use this information to improve search relevance and user experience, leading to increased user satisfaction, search result click through rates, and higher conversion rates.\nEnhanced Analytics API Searches : Optimize and refine search results with improved visibility into the queries and keywords people type as well as the queries that return zero results. Results : Improve relevance on every query by getting insights into the results users see when performing a search. Identify and analyze low quality search results and find problematic queries such as common typos, obscure queries and query reformulations in order to improve content and relevance. Filters : Create faster paths to conversion by predefining filters on specific keywords based on the most popular filters users are selecting when searching. New Click Analytics API Clicks : Increase performance by gaining insights into which results users are clicking on, the position in which those results appear, and the average click position of specific search queries. Conversions: Bring search and conversion data together in order to understand which results are converting and optimize those search queries that lead to user abandonment.\nFor more information, visit: https://www.algolia.com/products/analytics and read more about today's news on our blog .\nAbout Algolia\nAlgolia is the leading hosted Search & Discovery solution for websites and mobile apps -- helping the most innovative companies across e-commerce, media and SaaS industries create powerful, relevant and scalable discovery experiences for their users.
