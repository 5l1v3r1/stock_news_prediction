I can count on the quality of their work because the company only hires and retains the top-tier quality workers. I’m always impressed by the quality and skills of my coworkers.” \n“Management is very approachable and they are willing to go out of their way to help employees. Great benefits and rewards, especially the Wellness program. The company offers wellness reimbursements up to $150 per month for working out and staying fit.” 4. ESL Federal Credit Union \nHeadquarters: Rochester, New York \nNumber of U.S. employees: 738 \nEmployees say: \n“Management goes above and beyond for employees. We had a rough week in my department recently and were fed lunch/breakfast every single day during that week. Management always goes out of its way to recognize each person on an individual basis.” \n“ESL is a unique place to work because the Board and senior management truly care about the employee experience. Time and resources are allocated to plan and deliver spectacular special events such as the Annual Celebration, Spring & Fall Forums, numerous wellness events, a family Santa’s Visit party, and more. ESL shares profits with employees and has an exceptional total rewards package that puts us above benchmark in almost every category. People care about each other and I believe each person and department truly aspires to continuously improve.” 5. Funeral Directors Life Courtesy of Funeral Directors Life \nHeadquarters: Abilene, Texas \nNumber of U.S. employees: 168 \nEmployees say: \n“Our company wants to better each individual who works here, as an employee but also as an individual. We are encouraged to better our personal lives, which is very different from the ‘leave the baggage at the door’ mindset all other companies have.” \n“The atmosphere is hard to describe, unless you have experienced it. When I first started working here, nearly every person made it their mission to get to know me and for me to get to know them. I thought some of the amiability would fall off as time went by, but that is not the case. This company has a great culture built into their DNA and I hope that never changes.” 6. First American Equipment Finance \nHeadquarters: Fairport, New York \nNumber of U.S. employees: 211 \nEmployees say: \n“The ability to generate an idea, present a business plan to management, and execute on your own idea is rare and very satisfying. It is a pleasure to be part of an organization that facilitates this type of empowerment.” \n“This company gives you the guidance, development and technology to succeed. They are an established organization with a clear vision for the future that they can successfully articulate to their employees. This not only motivates me as an employee, but makes me feel as if I am a large contributor to the company’s success and long term goals.” 7.
