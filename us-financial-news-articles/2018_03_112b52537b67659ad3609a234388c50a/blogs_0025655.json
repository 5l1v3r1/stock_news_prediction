Afghan President \nAshraf Ghani’s \ngovernment recently invited the Taliban—the country’s largest insurgency—to discuss a political settlement . \nAs a result, some elements of the Taliban, which Mr. Mattis and other officials say is fracturing, have expressed interest in dialogue. That’s buoyed U.S., Afghan and international coalition officials even as they execute a new phase of military operations against some of the very same groups. \n“We do look toward a victory in Afghanistan,” he told reporters traveling with him aboard a military jet heading to Kabul, of the country’s 16-year war. \nMr. Mattis, who has long argued the need to force militant fighters to the table through effective military action, also said he didn’t think it was too early to be talking about peace—even as the Taliban resort to sensational bombings and continue a campaign to seize provincial governments. \n“All wars come to an end,” he said. “You don’t want to miss an opportunity because you weren’t alert to an opportunity, so you want that door open.” \nMr. Mattis said on the jet that he would receive a military assessment of how the new strategy was proceeding, but all in the context of a future political settlement. \nPakistan figures prominently in the new U.S. strategy in Afghanistan under President \nDonald Trump. \nThe so-called South Asia Strategy calls out Islamabad for harboring terrorists, and calls on it to do more to stop militants with the Pakistan-based Haqqani network from crossing the border to foment violence. \nMr. Mattis will attempt to get an assessment of what Pakistan has been doing during his stop in Afghanistan. But he said there’s already evidence of ongoing operations by the Pakistan military along the border between the two countries. \n“There are operations by the Pakistan military that they are helping right now, ongoing as we speak, and have been for some time,” he said. \nMr. Mattis has sought to moderate the U.S. administration’s get-tough posture toward Pakistan in order to get Islamabad to do more—which some officials, including national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster , believe it should. \nGen. Joe Votel, commander of U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for the region, is the administration’s chief interlocutor with Pakistan and talks to leaders there each week. \nLate last month, Gen. Votel testified in Washington, saying he didn’t yet think the relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan was “trustful” due to the history between the two countries. But there are positive signs, he told the House Armed Services Committee. \n“It does not yet equal the decisive action that we would like to see them take, in terms of a strategic shift, but they are positive indicators, and it gives me hope that our approach is the right one,” he said. \nWrite to Gordon Lubold at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T10:52:11.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
