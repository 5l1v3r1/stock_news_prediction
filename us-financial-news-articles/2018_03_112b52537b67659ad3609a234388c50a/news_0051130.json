Abic sees consumption in Brazil growing at a higher rate than the global average growth which is below 3 percent.\nBrazilian total coffee exports reached a record of 37 million bags in 2015, but sales abroad have been declining since then due to falling supplies, high global stocks and competition from other producing countries.\nBrazil is approaching the start of harvesting of its 2018-19 crop (July/June). The first new crop volumes should start to reach warehouses around May.
