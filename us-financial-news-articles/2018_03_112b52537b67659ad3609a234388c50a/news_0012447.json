M. Huber’s silica operations, Evonik on Tuesday reported an 8 percent gain to 474 million euros ($585 million) in fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted for one-offs.\nThat was slightly below the 479 million expected by analysts in a Reuters poll as weak prices for poultry feed additives outweighed strong demand for engineering plastics and rubber silica.\nEvonik in November said it would slash administrative costs as profit margins narrowed and after recent acquisitions accounted for most of its earnings growth.\nThe company, which is controlled by a state-backed foundation, lags peers such as BASF, Lanxess or DSM in trading multiples of expected core earnings.\nEvonik has targeted an adjusted group EBITDA for 2018 of 2.4-2.6 billion euros, up from 2.36 billion last year. Analysts’ current consensus is 2.46 billion.\n$1 = 0.8099 euros Reporting by Ludwig Burger; editing by Arno Schuetze and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:38:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
