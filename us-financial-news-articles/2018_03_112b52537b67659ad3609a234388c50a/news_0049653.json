It is a political matter and we cannot control it,” Kharafi said. “But what we are trying to do is to protect the assets of the shareholders.”\nZain Sudan’s profit increased 173 percent in 2017, when measured in Sudanese pounds, but fell 29 percent in dollars.\nZain Group largely blamed the devaluation of the Sudanese pound for costing the company $82 million in group profit in 2017.
