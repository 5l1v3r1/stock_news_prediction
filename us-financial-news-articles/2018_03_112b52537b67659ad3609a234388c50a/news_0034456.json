All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this release regarding Northern's financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, industry conditions, and indebtedness covenant compliance are forward-looking statements. When used in this release, forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by terms or phrases such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “target,” “could,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “goal,” “will,” “should,” “may” or other words and similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Items contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential future sales, market size, collaborations, and trends or operating results also constitute such forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and important factors (many of which are beyond Northern's control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements, including the following: Northern's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the exchange agreement with certain of its senior noteholders on the terms originally contemplated or at all, including, without limitation, Northern's ability to successfully obtain shareholder approval, obtain the required consent of its first lien term loan lenders and complete the equity raise and the exchange transaction, changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, the pace of drilling and completions activity on Northern's properties, Northern's ability to acquire additional development opportunities, changes in Northern's reserves estimates or the value thereof, general economic or industry conditions, nationally and/or in the communities in which Northern conducts business, changes in the interest rate environment, legislation or regulatory requirements, conditions of the securities markets, Northern's ability to raise or access capital, including as a condition to any transaction with its bondholders, changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines, financial or political instability, acts of war or terrorism, and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting Northern's operations, products, services and prices.\nNorthern has based these forward-looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events. While management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Northern's control. These and other applicable risks and uncertainties have been described more fully in Northern’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2018 and in Northern’s subsequent SEC filings. Northern does not undertake any duty to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as may be required by the federal securities laws.\nClick here to subscribe to Mobile Alerts for Northern Oil and Gas .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180319006240/en/\nNorthern Oil and Gas, Inc.\nBrandon Elliott, CFA, 952-476-9800\nInterim President\nbelliott@northernoil.com\nSource: Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180319006240/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3DFl8hDv-dTW_xahtxmv_nGQ2b4bfvQNHdgdfLBOY7iCgboylYo2mktehJNA6buAR7ZOePu8kBG5B_sHGGLwYHEbbM84khHy923Ui5jR5ILI0%3D&esheet=51775536&newsitemid=20180319006240&lan=en-US&anchor=syndprospectus%40stifel.com&index=1&md5=f07d0a07e186120b6778addc89c92214", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Falerts.businesswire.com%2Fsubscribe%2Fnorthern_oil_and_gas&esheet=51775536&newsitemid=20180319006240&lan=en-US&anchor=Click+here+to+subscribe+to+Mobile+Alerts+for+Northern+Oil+and+Gas&index=3&md5=5fbf699469a7cd0bb88585cafeb3b192", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&esheet=51775536&newsitemid=20180319006240&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&index=2&md5=096af03bff15fc4e1ad838cabcfdd412"], "published": "2018-03-19T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T02:22:37.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
