None knew his background, but said his thick, Russian accent stood out in Salisbury, a city in southwestern England of 45,000 people.\nWeronika Paliszewska, who runs the Polish delicatessen, said Mr. Skripal would visit her shop to buy sausage, mackerel and herring. “He wanted food that reminded him of home, that he couldn’t get from English shops,” said Ms. Paliszewska, who has known him since 2012.\nDespite their frequent interactions, she said she knew little about him other than that he was from Moscow. “We talked about the weather, about life around here,” she said. “But normally it’d be him asking me questions.”\nJust down the road, at the Railway Social Club, Mr. Skripal also kept a low profile. He would wave hello to the other regulars, mostly older men, and sit by himself with a pint, according to locals.\n“We didn’t take any notice—he was just another person,” said John McKeown, a 70-year-old bus driver and club member. “It’s nice to come to a place like this when you’re a complete stranger.”\nPolice officers, forensics specialists, and military personnel were combing Salisbury over the weekend looking for evidence of how Mr. Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who has lived in Britain since a 2010 spy exchange, and Ms. Skripal were poisoned by a rare nerve agent— and by whom. Mr. Skripal had been imprisoned in Russia in 2006 for 13 years for passing secrets to Britain’s MI6 in return for money.\nMr. Skripal, at a 2009 military-court hearing in Moscow, was imprisoned in Russia for passing secrets to Britain’s MI6 in return for money.

Mr. Skripal had offered his expertise on Russia to the U.K. government in the years after he arrived in 2010, according to an official who attended a briefing he gave to U.K. special forces two years ago, but his knowledge was somewhat dated. U.K. intelligence officials are trying to work out what made him a target now.\nWiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard said at a press conference Sunday that the investigation was fast-paced and complex. British politicians have said that if Russia were behind the attempted murders, the country will face sanctions . The Kremlin has denied involvement.\nMr. McKeown, the bus driver, and others at the Railway Social Club said Mr. Skripal had been coming to the bar for a few years but had only joined officially late last year, paying the £15 annual fee (about $20). Mr. Skripal’s daughter took the bus that Mr. McKeown drives when she was visiting from Moscow.\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Railway Social Club was packed with older men drinking beer and watching horse-racing or soccer on television. Several dart boards hung on the yellow walls.\nOriginally, the club was a place for men who worked on the railways to socialize after work, but in recent decades, people from all parts of society have joined, said Nicholas Sebright, the club coordinator.\n“It doesn’t pretend to be anything it isn’t,” Mr. Sebright said. “We don’t have great pretensions.”\nSalisbury residents described Mr. Skripal as quiet and courteous, but said he stood out in a place where there were few, if any, other Russians. Locals remembered seeing him in a jewelry shop, dining at Cote Brasserie, a chain restaurant, eating pork sandwiches in cafes or frequenting the Polish delicatessen.\nMehmet Beykanoglu, a 49-year-old taxi driver, said he frequently drove Mr. Skripal from the Salisbury train station to his house in the evenings over the last seven years. He said Mr. Skripal was well-spoken, but never initiated conversation. “If you don’t ask him he doesn’t say anything,” he said, adding he said he worked for the government. He was usually well-dressed in a dark suit, he said. \nOver the weekend, large parts of the city, including the modest street where Mr. Skripal lived, remained cordoned off. Authorities on Sunday warned Salisbury residents who had been near Mr. Skripal and Ms. Skripal to wash their clothes and wipe down their phones with baby wipes.\nPam Wyles, a neighbor, said the community was mostly made of up English working-class people and that people in the neighborhood kept to themselves. “They’re ordinary folk down there,” Ms. Wyles said.\nAt the delicatessen, Ms. Paliszewska said Mr. Skripal seemed like any other customer, calm and polite. “I would never have guessed,” she said, “but then I guess spies don’t normally flaunt it.”\nWrite to Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.com and Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T01:46:55.060+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
