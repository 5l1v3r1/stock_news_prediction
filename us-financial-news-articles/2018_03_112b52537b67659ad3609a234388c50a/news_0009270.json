It kills head lice and lice eggs using controlled heated air. No pesticides are used, and the AirAllé has successfully treated more than 350,000 cases of head lice.\n“We use a 3-step process, which includes the AirAlle treatment,” Rainya said. “The entire process takes 60-90 minutes. That's it. It is safe, highly effective, and fast with no follow up needed, including a 30-day guarantee.”\nThe St. Cloud clinic is located at 3700 West Division Street, Suite 105, and is open seven days per week by appointment.\nWith more than 300 clinics in 34 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences, Inc., which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nAttachment:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9d613b36-ed40-4bbc-874b-63de339ec67e\nRainya Strack Lice Clinics of America 320 423 1652 info@liceclinicstcloud.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Nr48wR6GH0_PmqRB8IQNa4K_yIhB1O_9bJRbvcw6dhJa7VyWQ1YlbqKT3Y09w67rX0hx1ZvafXUJPEbW9ftEFo1mEUMO9_GnoW1yirZQyvs1bKcPrcgVhCFATqKDnrGlb1dBCf3FnEYqRzr3h8rMz-0GDNwieaxR7B9pWkwT1YLAd3Sghzy9lDzWT_kBqeTG60EJW8NwKUFda5oFHmvglcFvdwWpSm2LcVxjS9fqErp77gmKpJ0VTFG8Zz1dfkQAMIdbNkGqX0fGg88_n5NEQQ==", "http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9d613b36-ed40-4bbc-874b-63de339ec67e", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9d613b36-ed40-4bbc-874b-63de339ec67e/en"], "published": "2018-03-06T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T20:17:41.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
