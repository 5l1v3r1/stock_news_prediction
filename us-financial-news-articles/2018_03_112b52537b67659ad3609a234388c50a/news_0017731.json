The Cowboys beat the Jayhawks in both of their regular-season meetings, including last weekend’s 82-64 win to wrap up the regular season.\nThe Cowboys jumped out to a 14-point lead in the first half thanks to seven 3-pointers and a dominant performance on the glass.\nOklahoma State outrebounded the Sooners 31-15 in the first half, including 11-2 on the offensive side. The Cowboys outscored Oklahoma 12-0 on second-chance points to take a 39-28 lead into the break.\nOklahoma State stretched that lead to 16 in the first five minutes of the second half before the Sooners made their run.\nOklahoma reeled off a 14-2 stretch over the next five-plus minutes, thanks to back-to-back 3-pointers by Young and one each from Kameron McGusty and Brady Manek.\nThe Sooners had a chance to cut the lead even further with less than nine minutes remaining after Young’s steal got the Sooners out and running, but Mitchell Solomon disrupted Young’s lob to Manek, leading to a Carroll layup on the other end to stretch the Cowboys’ lead back out a bit and stem the tide.\nOklahoma State led by five with five minutes remaining before the Sooners went cold from the field.\nThe Sooners missed six consecutive shots, while the Cowboys started taking advantage on the other end with back-to-back layups to stretch the lead back to 11 with three minutes left and keep their faint tournament hopes alive.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:16:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
