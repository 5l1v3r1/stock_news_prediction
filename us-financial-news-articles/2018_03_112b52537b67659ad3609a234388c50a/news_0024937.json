The company designs, develops and markets a revolutionary ultrasound platform, Aixplorer®, which uses the UltraFast™ technology that can acquire images around 200 times faster than conventional ultrasound systems. In addition to providing exceptional image quality, this unique technology gave rise to several innovations which have changed the paradigm of ultrasound imaging: ShearWave™ Elastography (SWE™), UltraFast™ Doppler technology, Angio PL.U.S – Planewave UltraSensitive™ Imaging and, more recently, TriVu. ShearWave Elastography allows physicians to visualise and analyse the stiffness of tissue in real-time using a reliable, reproducible and non-invasive procedure. This is an important parameter in diagnosing potentially malignant lesions or other diseased tissue. As of today, over 300 publications have demonstrated the value of SWE in the care of patients with a wide range of diseases. The UltraFast Doppler combines colour flow imaging and pulsed wave Doppler into one simple test, providing physicians with the results of both simultaneously, therefore enhancing efficiency. The latest innovation, Angio PL.U.S, provides a higher level of microvascular imaging through significantly improved colour sensitivity and spatial resolution, while maintaining exceptional 2D image quality. SuperSonic Imagine has been granted regulatory clearances for the commercialization of Aixplorer® on the main markets. Since April 2014, the SuperSonic Imagine company has been listed on Euronext (symbol: SSI).\n1 Gross margin on sales = Sales – Cost of sales\n2 Gross margin on sales (%) = Gross margin on sales / Sales\n3 2017 EBITDA corresponds to the current operating income, i.e. -€9.9 million, minus taxes of -€724 thousand and amortization and provisions of -€2.5 million. 2017 EBITDA was thus -€6.6 million.\n2016 EBITDA correspond to the current operating income, i.e. -€10.3 million, minus taxes of -€379, amortization and provisions of -€2.1 million. 2016 EBITDA was thus -€7.8 million.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006102/en/\nSuperSonic Imagine\nMarketing & Communication\nEmmanuelle Vella\nemmanuelle.vella@supersonicimagine.com\n+33 4 86 79 03 27\nor\nFP2COM\nMedia Relations - EU\nFlorence Portejoie\nfportejoie@fp2com.fr\n+33 6 07 76 82 83\nor\nNewCap\nInvestor Relations – EU\nPierre Laurent / Florent Alba\nsupersonicimagine@newcap.fr\n+33 1 44 71 98 55\nor\nPascale Communication\nMedia Relations - US\nAmy Phillips\namy@pascalecommunications.com\n+1 412 327 9499\nSource: SuperSonic Imagine", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180313006102/en/"], "published": "2018-03-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T22:55:12.063+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
