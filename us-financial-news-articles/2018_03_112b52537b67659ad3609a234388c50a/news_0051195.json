In February, the company announced plans to offer free two-hour delivery on Whole Foods goods in some locations. And after acquiring Whole Foods in August, the company immediately cut prices on several items.\nThe company has also installed Amazon.com lockers in some stores, letting shoppers instantly pick up certain items. Those have brought more customers into the grocery chain for quick trips as well.", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/whole-foods-thinks-about-offering-discounts-for-amazon-prime-members.html", "http://www.businessinsider.com/r-short-visits-rise-at-whole-foods-stores-with-amazon-lockers-2018-3"], "published": "2018-03-30T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T07:13:46.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
