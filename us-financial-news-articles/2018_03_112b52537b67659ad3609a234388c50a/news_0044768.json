The Japanese currency gained 0.3 percent against the dollar to 104.95 yen, the first time it has been below 105 since November 2016.\nThe Swiss franc, another currency bought in times of market uncertainty, rose 0.2 percent versus the dollar, although it remained flat against the euro.\nThe dollar fell 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies.\n“The FX market itself isn’t sure, and its reaction to risk-off and lower bond yields across the board is to buy the yen and the Swiss franc,” Kit Juckes, an FX strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a daily note.\nIn commodity markets, oil prices recouped overnight losses after Saudi Arabia said that OPEC and Russian-led production curbs introduced in 2017 will need to be extended into 2019 .\nU.S. crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $64.48 per barrel after losing 1.3 percent on Thursday and Brent rose 0.45 percent to $69.22 before giving up most of those gains.\nSafe-haven spot gold rose more than one percent to $1,342 an ounce, its highest since Feb. 20.\nCopper and iron prices both fell, as investors bet demand for the metals would suffer in a trade war. MET/L.\nDaniel Lockyer, senior fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said financial markets had got ahead of themselves and were failing to price in the risk a number of factors could trigger a sell-off.\n“It’s not that we thought trade wars would cause the market to fall, it’s that there was too much optimism priced into stock markets,” he said.\nElsewhere, South Africa’s rand firmed 0.4 percent and was set to end the week up around 1.5 percent ahead of a decision by Moody’s on the fate of South Africa’s last remaining investment grade credit rating.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar\nAdditional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, Helen Reid and Marc Jones in London, editing by Larry King and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-03-23T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T11:33:25.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
