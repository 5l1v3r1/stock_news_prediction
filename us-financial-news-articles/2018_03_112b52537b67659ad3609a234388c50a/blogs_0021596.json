Loans that were little understood or that ended up being unaffordable contributed to millions of homeowners losing their homes to foreclosure.\nOne of the things implemented by Dodd-Frank was the creation of a \"qualified mortgage.\" Basically, if lenders meet a variety of strict guidelines — such as ensuring a borrower's loan is no more than 43 percent of their income — they get legal protection if a consumer later makes a claim that they were sold an inappropriate mortgage.\nThe Senate bill now under consideration ( S. 2155 ) would let those smaller banks and credit unions still qualify for those legal protections without meeting all of the requirements that typically go with underwriting qualified mortgages.\nHowever, the bill would still require them to assess the borrower's financial resources and debt as part of the underwriting process.\nThe loan also could not be interest-only or one whose balance could grow over time (so-called negative amortization). Those types of loans proliferated leading up to the mortgage crisis and contributed to homeowners' inability to keep up with their payments.\nshow chapters What you need to know before you flip a house      6:04 PM ET Wed, 7 March 2018 | 01:34 The lender also would be required to keep the mortgage in its own portfolio instead of selling it to investors. That would mean the risk remains with the bank.\nNevertheless, consumer advocates worry that reduced regulation could allow lenders to put borrowers in inappropriate mortgages while protecting the lender from legal recourse.\n\"This opens up a window for the return of some of the reckless financial practices that caused the crisis,\" said Yana Miles, senior legislative counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending.\nPart of the problem with the mortgage crisis, however, was that some lenders sold mortgages with little or no effort to ensure the borrower could actually afford the loan. And once that loan was resold on the secondary market to investors, the originator no longer retained the risk.\nTo banking industry insiders, the bill's requirement for the bank to hold onto the loan will help prevent the type of abuse that consumer advocates fear.\n\"If they hold on to … the credit risk, they probably underwrote the loan very carefully.\" -Joe Pigg, Senior vice president of mortgage finance, the American Bankers Association \"The bank will have done its due diligence. They are the one holding the loan and it will directly impact their bottom line,\" said Joe Pigg, senior vice president of mortgage finance for the American Bankers Association. \"If they hold on to … the credit risk, they probably underwrote the loan very carefully.\"\nWhile the Senate bill is expected to clear the upper chamber in the next several days with some bipartisan support, it would still need to get approval by the House before it could be sent to President Trump and signed into law.\nMore from Personal Finance: \nAre you considering an adjustable rate mortgage?
