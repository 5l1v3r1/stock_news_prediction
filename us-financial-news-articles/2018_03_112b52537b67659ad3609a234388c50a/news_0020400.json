Electricity production in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18% higher than in the same quarter of 2016 in this segment.\nIn the year 2017, our fleet of solar assets in Spain delivered very good production levels, underpinned by high solar radiation levels in the region, which coupled with higher prices per GWh compared to 2016 contributed to an increase in revenues. In the US, after a good first half of the year, an incident in the electric transformers of Solana in the third quarter impacted production at the peak of the summer season. Once the transformers' repairs were completed, US assets delivered good levels of production and revenues in the fourth quarter, ending the year with higher production than in 2016. Kaxu, in spite of technical problems during the year, showed good performance in the fourth quarter with the start of its summer season, delivering a capacity factor over 40%.\nIn our wind assets, performance in 2017 was significantly higher than in 2016 due to higher levels of wind, and the average capacity factor was 37% for the full year 2017.\nACT, our efficient natural gas plant in Mexico, continued demonstrating outstanding operational performance. Availability levels remain very high.\nOur assets in the transmission segment have shown stable performance with high levels of availability. Water assets have once again achieved excellent availability levels.\nLiquidity and Debt\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash available at the Atlantica Yield corporate level was $148.5 million, which together with an available revolver capacity of $71.0 million, represents a total corporate liquidity of $219.5 million. At the project level, cash and cash equivalents and cash classified as short-term financial investments at the project level amounted to $596.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, net project debt was $4,954.3 million ($4,857.9 million as of December 31, 2016). Net project debt increased versus last year mainly due to translation differences arising from the conversion of our project debt in euros to U.S. dollars. Net corporate debt was $494.6 million. The net corporate debt / CAFD pre-corporate debt service ratio [9] is 2.3x.\nNet project debt is calculated as long-term project debt plus short-term project debt minus cash and cash equivalents at the project level.

The corresponding annualized dividend represents a 73% payout ratio over the CAFD generated in 2017. This dividend is expected to be paid on or about March 27, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 19, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nWe are initiating guidance for 2018 with an expected Further Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $770 million to $820 million and CAFD in the range of $170 million to $190 million. Regarding our dividend, we target an 80% pay-out ratio 10 on an annual basis.\nStrategic Update and New Agreements Signed\nIn November 2017, Algonquin reached an agreement with Abengoa for the acquisition of a 25% stake in Atlantica, with an option to acquire the remaining 16.5%. All conditions precedent have been satisfied and the parties are working to close the transaction, they have commenced the process for the transfer of the 25% stake in Atlantica, expected in the upcoming days. Once the transaction closes, Algonquin will become our largest shareholder and new sponsor, with the possibility of reaching over time ownership of up to 41.5% interest in Atlantica. Algonquin is a leading North American diversified generation, transmission and distribution company with proven expertise in developing and managing contracted assets, strong access to capital markets and investment grade credit rating. For Atlantica, this represents a new phase with a strong and aligned sponsor, who is expected to foster our growth.\nIn connection with the transaction, Atlantica has signed important agreements to ensure access to future accretive investment opportunities and to reinforce Atlantica's strong corporate governance:\nRight of First Offer (ROFO) 11 agreement with AAGES, the joint venture created between Algonquin and Abengoa to invest in the development and construction of clean energy and water infrastructure contracted assets.\nShareholders agreement with Algonquin, covering among others, the following key aspects: Two directors appointed by Algonquin in accordance with our articles of association. Algonquin has committed to limit its ownership of Atlantica to 41.5%. Algonquin has committed to providing incremental equity investment of up to $100 million in a capital increase for the acquisition of new assets during 2018 and 2019, subject to the approval of the board of directors of Algonquin. Algonquin has been granted certain preferred rights when participating in further equity issuances with the possibility of increasing Algonquin's ownership in us up to 41.5%.\nIn addition, we have agreed to discuss periodically with Algonquin the possibility of dropping down certain assets into Atlantica.\nSantiago Seage, CEO of Atlantica Yield, said \"The completion of the 25% acquisition by Algonquin will lay the foundations for a new and promising chapter for Atlantica. We now have an agreement with a strong sponsor and shareholder ready to support us.\"\nAccretive Transactions\nAtlantica will be deploying in the short term some of its available cash on hand at the corporate level on accretive transactions.\nWe plan to purchase certain dollar denominated tranches of our own project debt in South America, for a total amount of $25 to 40 million in the first half of 2018. We expect the CAFD yield to be higher than 12% from 2019 and the after tax equity IRR of approximately 9%.\nIn addition, on February 28, 2017, we closed the previously announced acquisition of a dollarized 4 MW mini-hydro plant in Peru for approximately $9 million. The asset comes with a solid operational track record and is expected to generate a 10% after tax equity IRR. The asset has a fixed-price contract with the Ministry of Energy of Peru (BBB+/A3/BBB+ 1 2) and has an indexation mechanism to U.S. CPI.\nStrategy and Outlook\nTaking into account our new sponsor, the new ROFO agreement signed with AAGES, and the internal and external opportunities we are seeing, we have set a dividend per share growth target of 8-10% compounded annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") through 2022 1 3 .\nOur ROFO agreements with AAGES and Abengoa are expected to be our primary source of accretive growth and we expect to be offered contracted assets representing between $600 and $800 million 1 4 in equity value in the next 2-3 years. Onwards, we expect AAGES to offer Atlantica assets representing approximately $200 million 14 per year in equity value. In addition, we are active in several sectors and geographies where we believe we can generate proprietary opportunities for third-party acquisitions. We also believe we have some organic growth opportunities in certain sectors such as transmission lines and we are actively pursuing other partnership opportunities. Finally, we will always compare any investment versus the option of investing in our own shares.\nWe expect to deliver double-digit CAGR in dividends per share through 2019 with the existing portfolio, by reaching the target payout ratio of 80% and the expected production levels in all assets in our current portfolio.\nDetails of the Results Presentation Conference\nAtlantica Yield's CEO, Santiago Seage, and its CFO, Francisco Martinez-Davis, will hold a conference call today, March 7 th , at 8:30 am EST.\nA live webcast of the conference call will be available on Atlantica Yield's website.

The non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS as issued by the IASB. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS as issued by the IASB and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the year or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities.\nWe define Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates as profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the Company, after adding back loss/(profit) attributable to non-controlling interest from continued operations, income tax, share of profit/(loss) of associates carried under the equity method, finance expense net, depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, and dividends received from the preferred equity investment in ACBH.\nOur management believes Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. This measure is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates is also used by management as a measure of liquidity.\nOur management uses Further Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated affiliates as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with our Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.\nWe define Cash Available For Distribution as cash distributions received by the Company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the Company, including debt service and general and administrative expenses. Management believes cash available for distribution is a relevant supplemental measure of the Company's ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors.\nWe believe cash available for distribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions. In addition, cash available for distribution is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFor the three-month period ended December 31, For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue $ 233,202 $ 208,847 $ 1,008,381 $ 971,797 Other operating income 24,345 17,881 80,844 65,538 Raw materials and consumables used (5,774) (2,438) (16,983) (26,919) Employee benefit expenses (5,602) (4,140) (18,854) (14,736) Depreciation, amortization, and impairment charges (74,529) (98,522) (310,960) (332,925) Other operating expenses (90,788) (83,713) (284,461) (260,318) Operating profit/(loss) $ 80,854 $ 37,915 $ 457,967 $ 402,437 Financial income (124) 2,302 1,007 3,298 Financial expense (155,147) (103,924) (463,717) (408,007) Net exchange differences 202 (4,635) (4,092) (9,546) Other financial income/(expense), net 17,132 7,330 18,434 8,505 Financial expense, net $ (137,937) $ (98,927) $ (448,368) $(405,750) Share of profit/(loss) of associates carried under the equity method 1,651 1,542 5,351 6,646 Profit before income tax $ (55,432) $(59,470) $ 14,950 $ 3,333 Income tax benefit/(expense) (94,507) 44,298 (119,837) (1,666) Profit/(loss) for the period $ (149,939) $(15,172) $ (104,887) $ 1,667 Loss/(profit) attributable to non-controlling interests (4,447) 659 (6,917) (6,522) Profit for the period attributable to the Company $ (154,386) $(14,513) $ (111,804) $ (4,855) Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding (thousands) 100,217 100,217 100,217 100,217 Basic earnings per share attributable to Atlantica Yield plc (U.S. dollar per share) $ (1.54) $ (0.15) $ (1.12) $ (0.05) Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nAssets As of December 31, 2017 As of December 31, 2016 Non-current assets Contracted concessional assets $ 9,084,270 $ 8,924,272 Investments carried under the equity method 55,784 55,009 Financial investments 45,242 69,773 Deferred tax assets 165,136 202,891 Total non-current assets $ 9,350,432 $ 9,251,945 Current assets Inventories 17,933 15,384 Clients and other receivables 244,449 207,621 Financial investments 210,138 228,038 Cash and cash equivalents 669,387 594,811 Total current assets $ 1,141,907 $ 1,045,854 Total assets $ 10,492,339 $ 10,297,799\nEquity and liabilities Share capital $ 10,022 $ 10,022 Parent company reserves 2,163,229 2,268,457 Other reserves 80,968 52,797 Accumulated currency translation differences (18,147) (133,150) Retained Earnings (477,214) (365,410) Non-controlling interest 136,595 126,395 Total equity $ 1,895,453 $ 1,959,111 Non-current liabilities Long-term corporate debt $ 574,176 $ 376,340 Long-term project debt 5,228,917 4,629,184 Grants and other liabilities 1,636,060 1,612,045 Related parties 141,031 101,750 Derivative liabilities 329,731 349,266 Deferred tax liabilities 186,583 95,037 Total non-current liabilities $ 8,096,498 $ 7,163,622 Current liabilities Short-term corporate debt 68,907 291,861 Short-term project debt 246,291 701,283 Trade payables and other current liabilities 155,144 160,505 Income and other tax payables 30,046 21,417 Total current liabilities $ 500,388 $ 1,175,066 Total equity and liabilities $ 10,492,339 $ 10,297,799 Consolidated Cash Flow Statements\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFor the three-month period ended December 31, For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Profit/(loss) for the period (149,939) (15,172) (104,887) 1,667 Financial expense and non-monetary adjustments 320,432 130,026 848,840 664,775 Profit for the period adjusted by financial expense and non-monetary adjustments $ 170,493 $ 114,854 $ 743,953 $ 666,442 Variations in working capital 38,706 59,262 (8,797) 2,033 Net interest and income tax paid (150,866) (141,890) (349,533) (334,057) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 58,333 $ 32,226 $ 385,623 $ 334,418\nInvestment in contracted concessional assets 15 16 15 37,564 -
