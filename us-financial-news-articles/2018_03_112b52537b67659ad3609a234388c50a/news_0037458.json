(Nasdaq:STAF), (“STAF 360” or “the Company”), a staffing solutions company executing an international buy-and-build strategy in the U.S. and the U.K., today announced preliminary, unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter (Q4 2017) and year (FY 2017) ended December 30, 2017. Financial results for both reporting periods include the full impact of the two acquisitions, CBS Butler Holdings Limited in the U.K. and first PRO Georgia in the U.S., completed in September 2017.\nSubject to the completion of the audit of STAF 360’s full financial statements for FY 2017, and filing of its Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the results for Q4 2017 and FY 2017, are expected to be as follows 1 :\nQ4 2017 revenue is expected to be $59.5 million (including $17.7 million from acquisitions), an increase of approximately 29% from the $46.1 million reported in the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, revenue is expected to increase by $11.2 million, or 6%, to $192.7 million from $181.5 million reported in 2016. The increase was mainly due to $24 million of revenue generated from the acquisitions of CBS Butler Holdings Limited and first PRO Georgia, offset by $1.5 million attributable to unfavorable foreign currency translation and the $4.5 million impact of low margin business that we exited during the year, as previously discussed.\nQ4 2017 gross profit is expected to be $11.9 million, a 50% increase from gross profit of $7.9 million reported in the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, gross profit is expected to increase by $5.2 million, or 16%, to $36.7 million from gross profit of $31.6 million reported in 2016.\nQ4 2017 gross margin improved to 20% from 17.2% for the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, gross margin increased to 19.1%, from 17.4% in 2016. The gross margin improvement, for both reporting periods, was due to our strategy to exit low margin business, the acquisition of two higher margin businesses, the strengthening of our permanent placement business, and the continued improvements made in our Monroe Staffing Services operation over workers compensation insurance costs.\nQ4 2017 net loss is expected to be $9.1 million, after $7.9 million of non-cash costs, $0.9 million of acquisition-related and non-recurring charges and $0.8 million associated with the Company’s reorganization, as compared to a net loss of $1.6 million in the same period of 2016. For FY 2017, net loss is expected to be $18.4 million, after $18.6 million of non-cash costs, $2.1 million of acquisition-related and non-recurring charges and $0.8 million associated with the Company’s reorganization, as compared to a net loss of $7.8 million reported in the prior year. The company took a one-off, non-cash, impairment of goodwill charge of $4.8 million related to its PeopleSERVE operation, and $6.1 million of non-cash debt extinguishment costs mostly related to the September 2017 refinancing, both of which are included in the $18.6 million number above.\nQ4 2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $2.8 million, an increase of over 130% as compared to $1.2 million in the same period of 2016. FY 2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $7.4 million, an increase of 46% from $5.1 million in 2016.\nPro Forma FY 2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $10.9 million; this includes adjusted EBITDA of the two acquisitions for the pre-acquisition period.\nBrendan Flood, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “Fiscal 2017 was a transformative year for us. We completed two acquisitions which, on a pro forma annual basis, added approximately $85 million to the top line, and more than doubled adjusted EBITDA of our overall business to $11 million. Additionally, we reorganized our business into three distinct segments (Commercial Staffing – U.S., Professional Staffing – U.S. and Professional Staffing – U.K.), a strategic move which allows us to further leverage our international presence, drive growth, increase operating efficiencies, and generate sustainable profitability. We look forward to reporting our progress in the coming months.”\nDavid Faiman, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “During 2017, we completed a number of capital and M&A transactions. Although these activities resulted in a significant amount of one-time non-cash accounting charges, they expanded our international presence and placed STAF 360’s business on a stronger financial footing, as we cleaned up our balance sheet and significantly improved our capital structure.”\nThe Company expects to file its audited results for FY 2017 on Form 10-K before the SEC filing deadline of March 30, 2018 and will host an earnings conference call around the same time to discuss the results.\nFor more information about Staffing 360 Solutions and complete investor materials such as investor presentations, white papers and webcasts of past earnings calls, please visit: www.staffing360solutions.com/res.html .\nAbout Staffing 360 Solutions, Inc.\nStaffing 360 Solutions, Inc.
