We look forward to seeing another dynamic group of women join corporate boards around the world.”\nMary Thistle, Chief of Staff of the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute, has more than 25 years of experience in finance, strategy and business development functions across different therapeutic areas, including gene therapy, and participated in the first class of the Boardroom Ready program in 2016. Prior to joining the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute, Ms. Thistle was Chief Operating Officer of Dimension Therapeutics Inc. where she oversaw the company’s Series B financing and initial public offering, expanded the pipeline through strategic business development transactions, and led the sale of the company to Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.

Intensive board competency building curriculum at George Washington University, held annually to refine each candidate’s understanding of the duties, responsibilities, and commitments related to serving on both public and private boards, is only the beginning. Boardroom Ready candidates also work with a professional resume writer to craft a board-tailored Curriculum Vitae and biography. In addition, each candidate is partnered with an experienced board mentor to help navigate the path to board service. Throughout the program and following completion, WIB, LifeSci Advisors and other sponsors work to facilitate matching program graduates with companies seeking new board members.
