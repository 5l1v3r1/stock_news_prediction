(NASDAQ:FINL) today announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018. The company’s fiscal 2018 ended on March 3, 2018, reflecting a 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week year, compared to the 13-week and 52-week periods in fiscal 2017.\nFor the 14-week fourth quarter, consolidated net sales were $561.3 million, up 0.7% compared with the 13-week period last year driven by an 8.5% increase in Finish Line Macy’s sales largely offset by a 0.9% decrease in Finish Line sales. Fourth quarter comparable sales for Finish Line decreased 7.9%. The company now expects to report fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.39 and $0.40 on a GAAP basis. Excluding adjustments detailed in the following table, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $0.58 and $0.59 compared to the previous adjusted guidance range of $0.50 to $0.58. Despite the flat sales, disciplined expense and inventory management helped offset top-line pressure.\nFor the 53-week fiscal 2018, consolidated net sales were $1.84 billion, down 0.3% compared with the 52-week fiscal 2017 driven by a 1.9% decrease in Finish Line sales, partially offset by a 7.5% increase in Finish Line Macy’s sales. Full year comparable sales for Finish Line decreased 3.9%. The company now expects full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.35 and $0.36 on a GAAP basis. Excluding adjustments detailed in the following table, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to be between $0.68 and $0.69, compared to the previous adjusted guidance of $0.59 to $0.67.\n“Fourth quarter comparable sales were more challenging than we expected,” said Sam Sato, Chief Executive Officer of Finish Line. “I’m pleased with how our team responded to the top-line headwinds by controlling inventories and expenses which we expect will deliver profitability at or above the high-end of our guidance range.”\nFinish Line now plans to report actual fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results on March 29, 2018 versus April 3, 2018 as previously announced. Based on today’s announcement that Finish Line has agreed to merge with JD Sports, the Company will not host a conference call and webcast in conjunction with its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 earnings report.\nReconciliation of Diluted Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Outlook, GAAP to Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Outlook, Non-GAAP (Unaudited)\nFourteen Weeks Ended March 3, 2018\nFifty-Three Weeks Ended March 3, 2018\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations, GAAP $0.39 to $0.40 $0.35 to $0.36 Impairment charges and store closing costs 1 $0.43 to $0.44 $0.57 to $0.58 Revaluation of deferred tax liability as a result of tax reform enactment 2 ($0.24) to ($0.25)\n($0.24) to ($0.25)\nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations, Non-GAAP $0.58 to $0.59 $0.68 to $0.69 Notes:\n1\nEstimated charges primarily represent write-off of long-lived assets of underperforming stores and technology assets no longer used by the Company. 2 Amount represents the Company’s current estimate for the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax liabilities due to the United States tax reform legislation enacted December 22, 2017.
