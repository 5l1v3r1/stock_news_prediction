ANZ economists said the fall was partly due to employers recalibrating after a robust 2.9 percent lift in January and also to an ongoing slow-down off historic highs in recent years.\nOn an annual basis, growth in job ads eased to 5.8 percent from 5.9 percent the previous month.\n“As the economic cycle has matured, growth in job ads has eased to a more gradual pace, in contrast to the breakneck pace set over 2016,” said Kyle Uerata, economist statistician at ANZ Bank.
