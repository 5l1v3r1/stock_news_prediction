The projection was unchanged from last month when the agency said the La Niña weather cycle was likely to transition into more neutral conditions by spring.\nLa Niña is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and is linked with floods and droughts. It is the opposite phase of what is known as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle.\nLa Niña emerged in 2016 for the first time since 2012, before fading in early 2017.\nTypically less damaging than El Niño, La Niña tends to occur unpredictably every two to seven years. During a La Niña year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the Southeast United States and cooler than normal in the Northwest, according to the U.S. National Ocean Service.\nThe Southwest typically sees drought conditions during a La Niña cycle as a high-pressure ridge prevents storms moving west from the Pacific to the states of New Mexico and Arizona.\nReporting by Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T20:19:41.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
