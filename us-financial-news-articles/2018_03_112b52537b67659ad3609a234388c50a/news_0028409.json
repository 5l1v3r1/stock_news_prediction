(TSX:BOS)\n(US$ except where otherwise noted)\nHighlights:\nQuarterly EBITDA improved 59% to $6.8 million Quarterly earnings per share of $0.16, compared to $0.06 in the same period in 2016 Earnings per share of $0.55 and $0.54 based on basic and diluted shares outstanding, respectively Quarterly dividend of C$0.07 per common share for a total annual payment of C$0.28, a 9.8% annual increase over 2016\nThree months ended\nDecember 31 Twelve months ended\nDecember 31 (In thousands of US dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Sales 74,214 63,040 289,855 267,628 Gross profit 11,562 8,881 44,520 46,596 EBITDA (1) 6,846 4,311 27,653 29,646 Net income 3,772 1,401 12,632 13,822 (In US dollars, except shares) Net income per share (EPS) -Basic 0.17 0.06 0.55 0.60 -Diluted 0.16 0.06 0.54 0.59 Common shares outstanding (millions) -Basic 23.1 23.1 23.1 23.1 -Diluted 23.5 23.6 23.5 23.6 Dividend\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has approved a quarterly dividend of C$0.07 per common share, to be paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2018.\nFull Year Results\nNotwithstanding higher consolidated net sales in 2017, profitability was dampened by a highly competitive business environment and volatile raw material prices which impacted the Rubber Solutions segment as well as a decline in net sales in the automotive business in the Engineered Products segment. The strong fourth quarter results demonstrated that the Company’s internal investments, integration and reorganization should position it well to overcome these challenges heading into 2018.\nNet sales increased by 8.3% from 2016, to $289,855, with increases in both Rubber Solutions and Engineered Products. Consolidated gross profit declined by 4.5% in 2017, as a result of a decline in net sales in the automotive business which more than offset increases in the defense business, as well as the impact of volatile raw material prices in the Rubber Solutions segment. Consolidated net income declined by 8.6% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to the lower consolidated gross profit and a 1.0% increase in operating expenses. EBITDA for 2017 decreased by 6.7% compared to 2016.\nThe Company remains in strong financial condition. With year-end cash and cash equivalents of $17,748, an undrawn revolving credit facility of $60 million and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.9x, the Company enters 2018 with significant resources with which to pursue organic and acquisitive growth opportunities.\nIn addition, the Company renewed its normal course issuer bid for its common shares in 2017, pursuant to which the Company may re-purchase up to 1,359,443 of its common shares (representing approximately 10% of the Company's public float of 13,594,433 common shares). Further details on the bid will be provided in the management information circular mailed to shareholders for the upcoming annual general and special meeting.\nFourth Quarter\nConsolidated results\nConsolidated net sales in the fourth quarter increased by $11,174 (or 17.7%) compared to the same period in 2016, reflecting higher raw material prices (which results in price increases to customers), increased volume and the commencement of shipments under a previously delayed defense contract. Gross profit increased by $2,681 (or 30.2%) and net income increased by $2,371 (or 169.2%), primarily because of the increase in net sales.\nSegment Results\nAt Rubber Solutions, net sales increased by 26.7%, to $31,235 compared to the same period in 2016, as a result of increased raw material prices of approximately 24.2% that resulted in price increases to customers and an increase in volume (measured in pounds shipped) of 15.2%, primarily in the off the road (“OTR”), conveyor belt, track and mining sectors, which was partially offset by softness in the solid tire and chemical sectors. As a result of the increase in net sales, gross profit increased by $528, to $5,038.\nAt Engineered Products, net sales increased by 11.9%, to $42,979, compared to the same period in 2016. Although sales in the defense business increased by $6,593 in the quarter, principally in the filters, bunny boot and shelter product lines, as well as the commencement of shipments under a previously delayed contract, sales in the automotive business decreased by $2,011, driven mainly by lower net sales in the bushings, boot and muffler hanger product lines.\nOutlook\nThe Company enters 2018 with a strengthened senior management team across all its businesses which complements an experienced workforce, both of which are committed to growth, quality, customer satisfaction and profitability. Management’s focus in 2018 is to continue to diversify the Company’s product offerings and customer base and refine business processes and operating systems to further enhance the platform, with the objective of stimulating growth and sustainably improving bottom-line results. With its strong balance sheet position, the Company is well positioned to continue making the required investments in resources, technology and capital expenditures to support innovation, improve operational efficiencies, while maintaining the capacity to execute on potential acquisitions.\nIn 2017 the rubber compounding business was integrated with industrial products to form the new Rubber Solutions segment. This new structure aligns well with the Company’s strategic focus on increasing and diversifying its portfolio of higher margin compounds, while maintaining its market leadership as a rubber-based solutions provider to a diversified customer base. This integration positions the Company to optimize lead-generation, product development and commercialization timelines and processes, as well as capacity utilization, across our various assets and geographies. The challenges faced in 2017 with increased raw material costs are expected to continue in 2018. Management, under the leadership of the Company’s new Chief Operating Officer Chris Bitsakakis, will be focused on further process improvement initiatives and adopting effective purchasing and pricing strategies to be more proactive in the marketplace. The goal is to increase operational efficiencies and profitability across all its plants and improve return metrics.\nWithin the Engineered Products segment, the automotive business’ management team has been rebuilt. Having attracted new talent in sales, engineering, marketing, business development and operations, the Company is in a stronger position to win share of new platforms to be introduced by automakers. The new business development focus is geared at developing proactive strategies to win new multi-year contracts that replace programs that have expired or are nearing the end of their platform lifecycle. As these activities are necessarily focusing on platforms that start production in 2019 or later, they are not expected to have a significant impact on sales in the near term. In addition, the Company will continue to pursue its strategy of diversifying its anti-vibration and noise abatement solutions into ancillary markets, such as industrial and agricultural. Again, the Company expects it will take some time to see a significant impact to the top-line with this initiative. However, in the near term, the focus will be on operations and driving a concentrated effort to ensure rapid-response engineering and manufacturing to meet escalating industry standards and improve profitability. In the defense business, the Company expects momentum to continue to build into 2018, with increased tendering activity worldwide and heightened rate of inquiries across all product lines. While there can be no certainty as to timing and nature of government policy changes, nor with respect to timing or size of tenders and awards, the current pipeline is strong and the business is well positioned to win new business and deliver strong growth in 2018.\nAirBoss remains committed to enhance shareholder value by driving sustainable profitable growth. With its strong balance sheet and strengthened management team, the Company is well positioned to achieve this goal through organic and in-organic growth opportunities.\nContact: Lisa Swartzman, President or Gren Schoch, CEO at 905-751-1188.\nA conference call to discuss the quarterly results is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. (EST) on Thursday, March 15, 2018.

This measure is neither required by, nor calculated in accordance with IFRS, and therefore is considered a Non-IFRS Financial Measure. The Company discloses EBITDA, a financial measurement used by interested parties and investors to monitor the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations for debt service, financing working capital and capital expenditures and paying dividends. It should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than net income (or any other IFRS financial measure) as an indicator of the Company’s performance. Because EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income, the EBITDA presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income is presented below.\nThree Months ended\nDecember 31 Twelve Months ended\nDecember 31 In thousands of US dollars 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income 3,772 1,401 12,632 13,822 Finance costs 472 653 2,567 2,830 Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 2,648 2,665 10,684 10,344 Income tax expense (46 ) (408 ) 1,770 2,650 EBITDA 6,846 4,311 27,653 29,646\nAIRBOSS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT DISCLAIMER\nCertain statements contained or incorporated by reference herein, including those that express management’s expectations or estimates of future developments or AirBoss’ future performance, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and can generally be identified by words such as “will”, “may”, “could” “expects”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “forecasts”, “plans”, “intends” or similar expressions.
