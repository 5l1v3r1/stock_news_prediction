(the “Company” or “RavenQuest”) – (CSE:RQB) is pleased to announce it has appointed Dr. Simerjeet Kaur, PhD, to lead Scientific Research & Development.\nDr. Kaur will lead the Company’s R&D and scientific training efforts, specifically relating to the development of new high yielding, stress resistant Cannabis varieties for medicinal as well as recreational purposes.\n“Dr. Kaur is a leader in her field. RavenQuest is thrilled to bring an accomplished and highly respected plant breeder and geneticist onboard. In assembling our senior team members, our focus has been upon attracting thought leaders with proven results in their respective fields. The addition of Dr. Kaur is yet another example of this. The addition of Dr. Kaur, combined with our McGill University research partnership, positions RavenQuest to lead the cannabis industry with stable, high yielding cannabis expression based in science,” stated George Robinson, CEO of RavenQuest. “As our industry matures, it’s important to deliver a consistent, repeatable experience for our end users while maximizing plant yields that keep margins healthy for shareholders. To that end, Dr. Kaur’s expertise is instrumental to RavenQuest as we continue to build a very unique cannabis company.”\nDr. Kaur is an expert in plant breeding, genetics, plant physiology and biochemistry. She obtained her Doctor of Philosophy in plant breeding and genetics from McGill University, and Master’s Degree in plant physiology and biochemistry from Punjab Agricultural University. During her PhD, she was a visiting scholar at Washington State University (USA) to work with experts in the field of molecular breeding and varietal development.\nHer research led to significant contributions in varietal development, novel gene identification and gene function prediction. Through association mapping, she discovered novel genes that can be used as markers for breeding programmes to improve the ability of plants to cope with biotic and abiotic stress resistance. Dr. Kaur has published in several peer reviewed journals on crop genetics, breeding and physiology. Her breeding program led to the development of a high yielding, stable rice variety that is currently being used in commercial rice production. She also has delivered lectures on genomics, molecular biology and plant breeding.\nAbout RavenQuest BioMed Inc.\nRavenQuest BioMed Inc. is a diversified publicly traded cannabis company with divisions focused upon cannabis production, management services and consulting, and specialized research and development.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors of\nRAVENQUEST BIOMED INC.\n\"George Robinson\"\nChief Executive Officer\nFor further information, please contact:\nMathieu McDonald, Corporate Communications 604-484-1230\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nAll statements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are \"forward-looking information\" with respect to the Company within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
