All of the conditions and benefits we obtained are above market-average,” said Sergio Munoz, president of Los Pelambres’ largest union of workers.\nAntofagasta did not immediate reply to requests for comment.\nLos Pelambres, which recently received environmental approval for a $1.1 billion infrastructure upgrade plan, produced 356,300 tons of copper last year.\nChile is the world’s top copper producer.
