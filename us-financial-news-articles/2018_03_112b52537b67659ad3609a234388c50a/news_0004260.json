Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), “disasters do not affect people equally”.\n“In many parts of the world more women die in disasters than men as a consequence of higher levels of poverty and other forms of discrimination,” she said in a statement on Wednesday.\nSome 90 percent of those who died in a 1991 cyclone in Bangladesh – one of the deadliest on record – were women, while 77 percent of victims in Indonesia of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami were women and children, according to UN Women.\nWomen and girls are routinely subjected to sexual and domestic violence following a disaster or conflict, a panel of researchers and campaigners at the launch event noted.\nBut it is daily manifestations of violence – including domestic violence and harassment – that most hamper their ability to recover from disasters, said Virginie Le Masson, a research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, a think tank.\nResearch in Chad from the Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) program, funded by the British government, shows that discrimination and violence against women limit their access to financial and health resources in times of crises, she added.\nSunil Pant, a Nepalese activist and former politician, said LGBT people also suffer more as a result of disasters and are often denied relief as “they do not fit the traditional family set-up of husband and wife”.\n“For example, I’ve seen Nepalese authorities refuse to certify that the houses of two transgender people that had been destroyed in the 2015 earthquake needed to be rebuilt,” he told the audience.\nEfforts to reduce disaster risks should do more to target LGBT people, Pant said.\n“LGBT people in shock-prone countries like Nepal, India and Haiti have zero information on disasters. They’ve never taken part in earthquake drills and have no idea who to contact in case of an emergency,” he added.\nReporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Laurie Goering.
