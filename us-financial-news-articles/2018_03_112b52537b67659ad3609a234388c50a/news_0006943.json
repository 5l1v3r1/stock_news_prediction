The company said a judge will assess potential objections to the accord at a hearing scheduled for June 1. In early January, Petrobras, as the company is known, agreed to pay $2.95 billion to U.S. shareholders due to corruption-related losses, in what was said to be the biggest such payout in the United States by a foreign entity. That number could be slightly higher due to legal and administrative fees.
