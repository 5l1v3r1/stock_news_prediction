Mar 27, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; Alexander Zverev of Germany hits a forehand against Nick Kyrgios of Australia (not pictured) on day eight of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park. Zverev won 6-4, 6-4. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports \nThe 20-year-old German is looking to win the third Masters event of his career and advanced to a last-eight showdown against Croatia’s Borna Coric, who ended the run of Canadian prospect Denis Shapovalov 7-6(2) 4-6 6-4 in a tight encounter. \nThe fourth-seeded Zverev had battled through a pair of three-set wins in his opening two rounds but was keen to make short work of Kyrgios when he broke serve in the first game and stormed to a 5-1 advantage. \nThe 22-year-old Kyrgios battled back to win three straight games to make it 5-4 but Zverev held his nerve and serve to close out the opener in 34 minutes. \nKyrgios, who had reached the Miami semi-finals in the previous two years, saw his hopes of at least matching that feat evaporate in the second set after his opponent secured the only break in the fifth game and rode it out for a well-earned win. \nEarlier, big-serving American John Isner overcame second-seeded Croatian Marin Cilic 7-6(0) 6-3 to advance to the quarter-finals, where he will face South Korean Chung Hyeon, who dominated Joao Sousa in a routine 6-4 6-3 win.

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports \nIn a battle of power against power, it was Isner’s booming serve that made the difference as the towering 32-year-old fired 12 aces while never giving Cilic a look at a break point on a hot, windy day. \n“I was very happy with how I played, especially with how I served,” Isner told reporters. “That’s certainly the best I’ve served all year.” DEL POTRO TRIUMPHANT \nIsner took firm control of the match in the first set tiebreaker, where he stepped up his return game to shut out the world number three before finally breaking Cilic’s powerful serve in the second set and cruising to the win.
