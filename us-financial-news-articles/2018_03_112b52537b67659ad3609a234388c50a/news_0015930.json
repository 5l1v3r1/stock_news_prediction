Her award was a one-time payment that came to $264 million after taxes.\nIn court papers, Shaheen, a former federal prosecutor who is married to New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen, had asked a judge to allow the winner to amend her ticket to show only the name of a trust. He argued that had the winner created the trust before signing the ticket, she could have collected her winnings without making her identity public.\n“We recognize the tremendous interest this prize has generated but hope you appreciate our client’s desire to maintain a sense of normalcy by keeping her name confidential,” Shaheen said in a statement.\nHe said the winner immediately donated $250,000 of her winnings to four New Hampshire charities aimed at improving girls’ lives and fighting hunger.\nA state court judge is still determining whether to allow the winner to keep her name out of the public record. The state lottery commission last month agreed to pay out the prize while the court case continued.\nReporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T02:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:37:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
