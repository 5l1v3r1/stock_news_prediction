In 2016, following the U.K.'s historic decision to leave the European Union, he told CNBC that \"the euro is gone within three to five years, as it currently exists.\"\nBiotech is the one to watch Asked about the areas of tech that investors should look at, Mellon cited biotech as a sector to watch, with its ability to \"have a positive impact on human beings as opposed to a time-wasting impact on two billion people around the world.\"\nA known advocate of the industry, Mellon has written books on the how investors can benefit from advancements in the biotech space. Some of the companies that he has said he likes in the area include Gilead , Editas and Adaptimmune .\nBrad Quick | CNBC \"There's stuff out there now that's going to keep people alive till a 110 or 120,\" he said. \"This is not science fiction in the future.\"\nAs technologies such as gene therapies, stem cell therapies and organ transplants from animals to humans become commonplace, the average human life expectancy could reach 150, Mellon said.\nSaying that there were great investment opportunities in the sector, Mellon asked: \"If we do live to a 120, how are you going to support yourself? The government's not going to do it.\"\n\"You might as well invest in the things that keep people alive longer and in healthy condition.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T05:11:15.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
