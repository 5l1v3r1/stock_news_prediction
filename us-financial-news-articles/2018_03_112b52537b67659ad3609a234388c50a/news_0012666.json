Nobody should have any doubts about that.” (Additional reporting by Andrey Ostroukh, Maria Tsvetkova, Vladimir Soldatkin, Polina Devitt, Katya Golubkova, Polina Nikolskaya and Denis Pinchuk Writing by Andrew Osborn Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T20:08:34.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
