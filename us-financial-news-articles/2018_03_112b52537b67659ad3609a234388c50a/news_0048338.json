Early on Wednesday, China's Global Times newspaper, a mouthpiece for the ruling Communist Party, said in a sharply worded article that China will soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States exports. Meanwhile, investors continued to ditch major U.S. tech stocks, which pushed down Wall Street's major indices and dragged many world markets along with it. Also on Wednesday, Canada's chief NAFTA negotiator struck a downbeat tone on a quick renegotiation of the accord. \"The fear of Trump continuing to push for 'America First' and increasing protectionism is something that will keep international markets volatile,\" analysts at Sao Paulo brokerage Guide Investimentos wrote in a note to clients. All Latin American indices were down on Wednesday. Mexico's IPC, which is particularly sensitive to U.S. trade issues, was the big loser, falling 1.05 percent in morning trading. Brazil's Bovespa was off 0.55 percent, while Argentina's Merval dropped 0.62 percent and Chile's IPSA fell 0.22 percent. Losses were intensified in Brazil and Mexico by corporate news events affecting heavily weighted stocks, as well as weak commodity prices. Shares in water and sewage provider Cia de Saneamento Basico do Estado de Sao Paulo SA, known as Sabesp, fell 3.6 percent after posting disappointing fourth quarter results. Shares in state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA also posted significant losses due to weak oil prices. In Mexico, shares in cement maker Cemex SAB de CV , which have proved volatile in recent months, shed 4.35 percent, helping drag down the IPC and completely erasing gains that occurred last week when the company canceled a proposed capital increase.
