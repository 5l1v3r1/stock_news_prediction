Pets are family,\" he wrote.\n@SenJohnKennedy tweet\nKennedy, in his letter, said United's \"pattern of animal deaths and injuries is simply inexcusable.\" He cited figures from the Transportation Department that of the 24 animals that died on U.S. carriers last year, 18 were on United flights.\nThe actions came after a United flight attendant insisted that the bulldog's owner, Catalina Robledo, put her pet, which was in a dog carrier case, in an overhead storage bin during a 3-1/2-hour flight from Houston to New York on Monday.\nRobledo's 11-year-old daughter, Sophia Ceballos, in an interview with CBS, recounted her reaction when the attendant ordered that the dog carrier case be placed in the overhead bin.\n\"I was like 'It's a dog, it's a dog. He can't breathe there,'\" Ceballos told CBS. \"(The flight attendant) was like 'it doesn't matter.'\"\nThe family told CBS they heard the puppy, named Kokito, barking for two hours during the flight before he went silent. The family said they were unable to check on the dog because of turbulence that forced them to stay seated.\nThe Department of Transportation \"is looking into the circumstances surrounding the recent death of a pet onboard a United Airlines flight,\" an agency spokesman said on Wednesday.\nThe department \"is in contact with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency that enforces the Animal Welfare Act and handles complaints about alleged animal mistreatment,\" the spokesman said.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration is also looking into the incident and will \"review the airline's investigation,\" FAA spokesman Greg Martin said.\nUnited said that despite the puppy owner's telling the flight attendant that there was a dog in the carrying case, the flight attendant either did not hear or did not understand that there was a pet in the bag, and \"did not knowingly place the dog in the overhead bin.\"\nUnited said it had concluded its investigation into the matter.\nThe $125 fee that Robledo paid for her dog to fly in the cabin and the cost of the airfare have been refunded.\nSeveral high-profile incidents of animal deaths and misplacements on United flights have plagued the airline over the last year, including the death of a giant rabbit on one of its flights last July and a dog that died in a plane cargo hold in August.\nThe airline's animal troubles compound a public relations nightmare tracing back to last spring when a man was dragged from his seat and down the aisle of a parked United plane in order to make room for an airline employee.\nUnited said that by next month, it would issue brightly colored bag tags to passengers traveling with in-cabin pets to help flight attendants easily identify the animals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T12:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T12:49:36.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
