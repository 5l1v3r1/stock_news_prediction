He has been a member of the Teagle Foundation board of directors since 2009 and has served as chair of its program committee since 2014.\nWalter C. Teagle III, chair of Teagle's board of directors, commented that, \"Andy will be a strong leader with vision and respect for the Teagle mission. He is a thoughtful, committed educator with over three decades of experience as a teacher and scholar. His life's work has been dedicated to promoting excellence in teaching and improving and enhancing student learning.\"\nMr. Delbanco earned his A.B. (summa cum laude), M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. He has been a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2001. That same year, he was named \"America's Best Social Critic\" by Time.

Now, more than ever, philanthropy can be an important force in higher education, especially on behalf of students whose aspirations are larger than their resources. I look forward to supporting liberal learning for students from all backgrounds and for the future of our democracy.\"\nJudith Shapiro began her Teagle presidency in 2013 and has served on the foundation's board since 2009. Under her leadership, the foundation expanded its commitment to excellent liberal arts instruction at a wide range of institutions, including liberal arts colleges, comprehensive institutions, community colleges, and research universities.

He will guide the foundation's future work with focus and dedication while continuing to serve as an inspiring, eloquent voice for higher education.\"\nMs. Shapiro will continue her involvement in various non-profit boards and advisory committees, including the Association of American Colleges and Universities, Scholars at Risk, and University of the People.\nAbout the Teagle Foundation\nThe Teagle Foundation was founded in 1944 by Walter C.
