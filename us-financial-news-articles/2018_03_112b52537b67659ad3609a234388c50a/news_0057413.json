The decisions followed an administrative review of the July 2016 shooting, and both officers plan to appeal, Paul said. \nThe steps are designed “to bring closure to a cloud that has been over our community for far too long,” he said. \nSterling was among black men slain by police whose deaths sparked U.S. protests and helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. \nPolice released four videos of the confrontation with Sterling outside a convenience store, where he was selling CDs. \nPaul called the footage from a police dash camera, officers’ body cameras, and a store surveillance camera “graphic and shocking to the conscience.” \nSalamoni’s camera shows him yelling at Sterling with expletives to put his hands on a car. He points a gun at his Sterling’s head and shouts he will shoot him if he moves. \nWhile struggling with Sterling, both officers’ cameras came loose. Lake’s footage ends by showing Sterling on his back in the parking lot, blood draining from his body. \nSterling, 37, was shot after a resident reported he had been threatened by a black man selling CDs. Police said Sterling was trying to pull a loaded gun out of his pocket when Salamoni opened fire. \nLawyers representing Sterling’s five children applauded Salamoni’s firing, but expressed disappointment that the officers would not face charges. \n“The person who was out of control was Blane Salamoni,” attorney Michael Adams said at a news conference. “The person who stood by and let him be out of control was Howie Lake. That’s a tragedy.” \nLouisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said this week that Lake and Salamoni would not face charges since they had reason to believe that Sterling was armed and was resisting arrest. \nThe U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute the officers for civil rights violations in 2017, citing insufficient evidence.
