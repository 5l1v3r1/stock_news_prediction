She is expected to make a statement at 1630 London time and could announce that Downing Street believes that Moscow was behind the poisoning, according to British media.\nThe government could also announce any retaliatory measures, such as expelling Russian diplomats or more sanctions on Russian individuals and entities. Last week, U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson called Russia a \"malign and disruptive force.\"\nThe nerve agent used has not been named but can usually only be produced in specialist government laboratories.\nSkripal's links to Russia's security services, and his subsequent work as a double agent for the U.K., put Moscow firmly in the spotlight for being behind the attack, although Russia has so far denied any involvement.\nAhead of any possible comments from the British government, the Kremlin's government spokesman said he had not heard of any allegations from U.K. lawmakers directed at Russia, Reuters reported. He also said that Skripal worked for British intelligence and the attack happened in Britain meaning \"it was not a matter for the Russian government.\"\nMonday's National Security Council meeting comes as specialist counter-terrorism police continue to search for the source of the nerve agent that was used to attack Skripal and his daughter. They were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in Salisbury, a small town in the rural county of Wiltshire in England. Both are in a critical condition in hospital. A policeman who attended to the pair was also hospitalized, although his condition is now stable.\nTraces of the nerve agent used were found at a pub and restaurant where the Skripals had been on the day they were taken ill.\nHundreds of people who were also in those locations on March 4 and 5 have been told to wash their clothes and any personal items, in case they had come into contact with the nerve agent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T11:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T11:53:17.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
