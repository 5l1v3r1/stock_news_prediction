(“Gran Tierra”) (NYSE American:GTE) (NYSE MKT:GTE) (TSX:GTE), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia today announces that it intends to implement a normal course issuer bid (the “ Bid ”) through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (“ TSX ”). Pursuant to the Bid and subject to regulatory approval, Gran Tierra would be able to purchase for cancellation up to approximately 5% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “ Shares ”) for a one year period at prevailing market prices at the time of purchase.\nManagement of Gran Tierra believes that the Shares, at times, have been trading in a price range which does not adequately reflect their value in relation to Gran Tierra’s current operations, growth prospects and financial position. At such times, the purchase of Shares for cancellation or to satisfy awards granted under Gran Tierra’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan may be advantageous to stockholders by increasing the value of the Shares. Gran Tierra currently has a strong balance sheet and, at current Brent oil prices, its cash from operating activities is expected to exceed its capital expenditures.\nWithin the past twelve months, Gran Tierra purchased 7,704,377 Shares at a volume weighted average price of C$3.07 under a previously approved normal course issuer bid through the facilities of the TSX and NYSE American (February 8, 2017 to February 7, 2018) permitting the purchase of up to 19,540,359 Shares.\nAbout Gran Tierra Energy Inc.\nGran Tierra Energy Inc. is an independent international energy company focused on oil and natural gas exploration and production in Colombia.
