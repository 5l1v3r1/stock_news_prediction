His work ranged from the origins of the universe itself, through time travel and probing black holes in space. \nHe achieved international renown after the publication of “A Brief History of Time” in 1988. \nHis coffin was topped with white “Universe” lilies and white “Polar Star” roses and carried by pallbearers from the University of Cambridge, where he worked. It was greeted by a large crowd outside the church who clapped as it was carried in. \nThe 76-year-old scientist was mourned by his children Robert, Lucy and Timothy, joined by guests including playwright Alan Bennett, businessman Elon Musk and model Lily Cole. \nEddie Redmayne, the actor who played Professor Hawking in the 2014 film “The Theory of Everything” was one of the readers in the ceremony and Felicity Jones, who played his wife, Jane Hawking in the film also attended the service.

The concept of an imprisoned mind roaming the cosmos plainly grabbed people’s imagination,” he said.
