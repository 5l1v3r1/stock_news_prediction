REUTERS/Henry Romero In a joint news conference with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said the first agreement aimed to promote joint cooperation to stop illegal merchandise crossing the border.\nThe two agreed to implement programs of joint inspections of cargo between the neighbors, whose bilateral trade is worth half a trillion dollars a year.\n“It’s about creating efficiencies,” Videgaray said.\nFinally, the governments signed an accord that would promote the trade of agricultural goods, the minister added.\nNielsen said the two countries were also working on about 20 further memorandums of understanding and letters of intent.\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Mexico's Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete Prida pose for a picture after delivering a joint message in Mexico City, Mexico March 26, 2018.
