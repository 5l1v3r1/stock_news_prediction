Many of them find factory jobs in Asian nations like Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia.\nMigrant workers in these countries are under tremendous pressure to finish their contracts so they can continue to financially support their families back home, campaigners say.\nThe report states that Malaysia - a export manufacturing hub and the largest destination for migrant workers in Southeast Asia - has the most restrictive legal environment for female migrants.\nThey are required to take a pregnancy test prior to departure from their home country, and on a yearly basis thereafter, according to the report entitled “Triple Discrimination: Woman, Pregnant and Migrant”.\nA migrant working in a Malaysian factory found to be pregnant is immediately deported at her own expense. To avoid deportation, many enter the informal workforce where labor laws are often ignored and abuses are common.\n“If you don’t have money to pay for an abortion or to break your contract, and you cannot go home, then what else can you do?” the report Quote: d a worker in Malaysia saying.\nWhile Taiwan bans pregnancy testing and prohibits employers from terminating a pregnant worker, it provides no legal status for their children.\nWorkers are therefore forced to choose between having abortions, going home, or even abandoning their children to keep their jobs, the report states.\nIn Thailand, pregnant workers from Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia are eligible for pre and post natal care. But they are subjected to pregnancy tests as part of a general medical exam when they apply for a work permit.\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Jared FerriePlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
