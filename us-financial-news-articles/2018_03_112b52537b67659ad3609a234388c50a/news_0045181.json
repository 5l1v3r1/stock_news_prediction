Puigdemont was detained in Germany on Sunday, five months after going into self-imposed exile in Belgium.\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:12:55.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
