Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski addresses the nation as he resigns at the Presidential Palace in Lima, Peru March 21, 2018. Peruvian Government Palace/Handout via REUTERS Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker who once held U.S. citizenship, has led Latin American criticism of President Nicolas Maduro’s government over rights and democracy, even banning him from attending a summit in Lima next month. But he resigned on Wednesday in the face of near-certain impeachment over a graft investigation into his connections to Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company that has acknowledged bribing officials across Latin America. “These fireworks are because someone is going! Goodbye PPK, farewell PPK!” boomed Cabello to a cheering crowd, using an acronym for Kuczynski’s full name, as fireworks went off overhead during a rally late on Wednesday. “Here are some fireworks to remind the world - if you mess with Venezuela, you’re out!” he added in the event broadcast on his weekly TV show ‘Bashing with the Sledgehammer.’ Supporters chanted: “He’s gone, he’s gone!” Despite Kuczynski’s fall, Maduro still faces strong opposition from most major nations around Latin America. Peru’s new leader - Vice President Martin Vizcarra - may follow the same hard line on Venezuela as his predecessor. Defying Peru’s ban, Maduro has vowed to be at the mid-April Summit of the Americas, which his biggest international critic - U.S. President Donald Trump - is also due to attend. “See you in Lima!” added a jubilant Cabello, naming Trump among other international leaders opposed to Venezuela’s government. Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez also laid into Peru’s outgoing president, calling him, on Twitter, a “self-styled imperialist lapdog” and “evil person” who was heading for the “rubbish bin of history.” Reporting by Andrew Cawthorne and Vivian Sequera;Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Bernadette Baum", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T14:34:06.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
