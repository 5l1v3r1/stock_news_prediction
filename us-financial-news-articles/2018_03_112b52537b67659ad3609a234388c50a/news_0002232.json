The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, on Thursday affirmed the EUIPO’s decisions, saying that the design Shoe Branding had proposed would take unfair advantage of Adidas’ reputation and that it had not demonstrated due cause for its use.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T11:19:12.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
