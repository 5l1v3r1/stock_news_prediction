REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/Files The comments came in response to a report by local newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, suggesting Petrobras would seek an initial public offering for the unit.\n“Petrobras is still evaluating alternatives for divesting Liquiqas and still adheres to the strategy included in its business plan to completely exit the (liquified petroleum gas) market,” Petrobras said in an emailed statement.\nEarlier this week, antitrust watchdog Cade rejected a bid by Brazil’s top LPG distributor, Ultragaz, owned by conglomerate Ultrapar Participacoes Ltda to buy the unit for 2.8 billion reais ($860 million).\nCade’s board found that the merger with Liquigas, Brazil’s second largest LPG distributor, had anticompetitive risks and could hurt consumers.\nReporting by Alexandra Alper Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:56:23.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
