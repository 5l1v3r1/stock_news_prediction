Martin Truex Jr. was second in a Toyota with Larson third.\n“The 4 (Harvick) was pretty much in his own zip code again,” said Truex, last season’s Las Vegas winner and overall champion.\nHarvick led most of the second stage as well, ultimately winning it by 5.170 seconds.\nPole-winner Ryan Blaney was second in a Ford with Larson third.\nHarvick restarted fourth after a slow pit stop and quickly dropped to fifth.\nKirt Busch spun on Lap 183, collecting Chase Elliott in the process after both had run in the top 10 most of the day. Soon after, Harvick was back in the lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T13:15:59.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
