The data is expected at 10 a.m. ET.\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley and Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan are due to speak at different events on Tuesday.\nFocus will also be on the upcoming February jobs data due on Friday that will show the strength of the labor market.\nLast month’s U.S. payrolls report showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than eight years, fueling concerns that both inflation and interest rates would rise faster than expected that led to a steep market selloff.
