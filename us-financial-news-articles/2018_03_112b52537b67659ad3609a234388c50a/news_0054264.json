It was just the third win in 17 games (3-10-4) for New York, which was officially eliminated from playoff contention on Monday night with a 3-0 loss to the Florida Panthers.\nMatt Duchene and Bobby Ryan each had a goal and two assists and Erik Karlsson tallied his ninth goal of the season for Ottawa. Mike Condon finished with 27 saves while falling to 5-16-5 on the season.\nLee opened the scoring with his team-leading 39th goal of the season, backhanding in a rebound of a John Tavares shot from in front of the crease.\nOttawa rebounded to a take a 2-1 lead after one period on goals by Duchene, who deflected a one-time shot by Jean-Gabriel Pageau for his 24th goal, and by Karlsson, who fired a wrist shot past Halak’s glove from the right circle off a nifty between-the-legs drop pass by Duchene.\nThe Islanders, despite being outshot 13-7, regained the lead with a pair of second-period goals.\nBeauvillier tied it with his 17th off a nice pass from Calder Trophy favorite Mathew Barzal, who finished with two assists to give him 58 helpers and 78 points on the season, the most points for any rookie in the NHL.\nNelson then scored his 18th with a wrist shot from the top of the left circle to give New York a 3-2 lead with less than two minutes remaining in the second period.\nOttawa tied it with 4:34 left when Islander defenseman Brandon Davidson deflected Ryan’s pass through Halak’s pads.\nLadd answered with the game-winner, redirecting Thomas Hickey’s shot from the left point past Condon.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:59:20.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
