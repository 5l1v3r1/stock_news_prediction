She took the lie-detector test as part of an agreement to sell her story to Life & Style magazine for $15,000.\nMs. Clifford’s interview with Life & Style wasn’t published at that time and she was never paid, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Slay’s report said he found Ms. Clifford’s responses about having unprotected sex with Mr. Trump in July 2006 to be truthful. His report said the test was inconclusive about the truth of her statement that Mr. Trump had promised her a spot on his reality show, “The Apprentice,” according to the copy reviewed by the Journal.\n“There were no observable indications of intent to deceive,” Mr. Slay’s report said.\nMichael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, declined to comment. Mr. Avenatti posted a picture Tuesday morning on Twitter that appeared to be of Ms. Clifford taking a lie-detector test. His tweet said, “#searchforthetruth” and “buckle-up.”\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in January that Ms. Clifford had been paid $130,000 in October 2016 by the president’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement about the alleged affair. The White House and Mr. Cohen have denied any affair occurred between Ms. Clifford and the president.\nThe two sides currently are involved in a legal battle over Ms. Clifford’s claim that she is free to discuss the alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s lawyer said in a court filing Friday that Ms. Clifford could be liable for more than $20 million in damages so far for alleged violations of the nondisclosure agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T00:43:47.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
