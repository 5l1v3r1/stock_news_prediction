But Continental Grain, which invests in the farm and food processing industry, has increased its stake in agricultural merchant Bunge to more than 1 percent, the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\nOn Monday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission publicly granted Continental Grain approval for its increased position, a filing that signals the company intends to engage with Bunge management.\nContinental Grain’s“focus is on the path to maximize value, including the potential sale” of Bunge, the source said. A Bunge spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAgricultural merchants such Bunge and rival ADM have struggled recently as a global oversupply of food commodities has made it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing and selling corn, soy and wheat.\nIn January, a source said ADM had approached Bunge about a takeover. The companies have declined to comment on the matter. Last year, Bunge rebuffed an approach from commodity trader Glencore Plc.\nFive years ago, when Continental Grain held a stake in U.S. pork producer Smithfield Foods, the investor sent Smithfield a letter urging a breakup and also filed a presentation with U.S. securities regulators. China’s Shuanghui International Holdings, now known as WH Group Ltd, eventually bought Smithfield. (Reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago Editing by P.J.
