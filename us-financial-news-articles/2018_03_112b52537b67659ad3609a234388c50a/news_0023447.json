SQM also has significant fertilizer production.\nBitran said that then-Potash CEO Jochen Tilk, who visited Chile in December, had “threatened” to take the case to international arbitration court should Chile attempt to block the sale of its stake in SQM.\nNutrien did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nSQM operates primarily in Chile’s Salar de Atacama, a lithium-rich resource that has the globe’s lowest costs of production. Lithium is a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries.\n“If this company is controlled by the development interests of the Chinese automobile industry then the electric vehicle and (anti)-climate change movements at the global level will have a problem,” said Bitran.\n“This is why I’m asking prosecutors to investigate, and that they join with anti-trust regulators of the OECD countries,” Bitran said.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Daly in Hong Kong; editing by Caroline Stauffer, Rosalba O'Brien and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T07:13:03.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
