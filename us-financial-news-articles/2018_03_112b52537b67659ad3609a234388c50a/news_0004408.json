Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!” he tweeted.\nStill, it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would follow Trump’s lead or which plan lawmakers would support.\nJohn Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, has offered a plan with narrower changes to the background check system.\nOther bills, including one floated by Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin with his Republican colleague Pat Toomey and another narrower background check bill already passed by the House, are also circulating.\nToomey, who attended the meeting, told MSNBC on Thursday it was clear Trump“wants to get something done.”\nThe Florida school shooting rekindled a sharp debate over guns in a nation deeply divided over how to balance gun rights and safety, with a call for legislation to curb gun-related violence driven by the students who survived the February massacre.\nThe issue is also likely to factor in November’s midterm elections.\nRubio, whose state saw 49 people gunned down at an Orlando night club in 2016, has said he does not support the arming of teachers, as Trump has suggested, but was in favor of raising the legal age to buy more types of guns to 21 from 18.\nReporting by Susan Heavey Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:56:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
