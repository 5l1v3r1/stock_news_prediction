(NASDAQ: BIOC), a leading commercial provider of liquid biopsy tests designed to provide physicians with clinically actionable information to improve the outcomes of cancer patients, reports financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, and provides an update on its business progress.\n\"Revenues for 2017 increased 57% over 2016, as we capitalized on relationships with health plans and reaped the rewards of improved billing and collection processes to increase reimbursement for our Target Selector liquid biopsy tests, which contributed to our ability to successfully change to accrual-based revenue recognition,\" said Michael Nall, President and CEO of Biocept. \"In addition, during 2017 we expanded our capacity, generated clinical data, validated more test offerings, grew our salesforce and increased the number of new customers compared to 2016.\"\n\"Billable sample volume for 2017 increased 7% over the prior year. Due to a slight decline in year-over-year sample volume for the fourth quarter, we have taken actions to refine our sales strategy that have resulted in a return to sample volume growth so far in the first quarter of 2018. Specifically, we evaluated billable sample volume by geography and are replacing or repositioning our sales professionals in underperforming territories. We also are placing more focus on our Empower TC™ program, which is the only liquid biopsy offering that includes pathologists in the decision chain. Initial acceptance of this program has been strong with several major healthcare institutions agreeing to use our service. We anticipate this program will gain further traction with additional large clients and together with other recent developments will support growth,\" he added.\n\"Earlier today, we announced a collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific that gives us access to their proprietary Oncomine™ molecular oncology assay panel and the ability to team up to market companion diagnostic products and services to pharmaceutical companies. We also intend to validate their panel in our CLIA laboratory and to become a Thermo Fisher liquid biopsy Center of Excellence. Importantly, our agreement includes the potential to develop additional products and services through the combination of technologies from both companies.\n\"We anticipate benefits from new evidence-based treatment guidelines jointly issued by four prominent clinical associations pertaining to the use of liquid biopsy testing in patients with lung cancer. These guidelines call for using liquid biopsy at the time of cancer diagnosis or recurrence when tissue is inadequate or unavailable, as well as for patients who fail first-line targeted therapy and must be reassessed for second-line targeted treatment. The new recommendations further validate the clinical utility of liquid biopsy and its benefits for rapidly obtaining information about a patient's tumor while reducing the risk of invasive tissue biopsies. We are leveraging these guidelines into our commercial programs,\" Mr. Nall concluded.\nReview of 2017 and Recent Accomplishments\nCommercial Programs and Distribution Agreements\nLaunched Empower TC™, a novel initiative to enable community pathologists to report molecular biomarker information to their patients with cancer using Biocept's liquid biopsy technology.
