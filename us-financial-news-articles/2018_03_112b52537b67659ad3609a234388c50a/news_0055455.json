He added he has a solar array built onto the roof of his California home.\n“It only takes a day or two without power for people to realize how important energy is to our lives,” said Johnson, who joined Chevron 37 years ago and has been in his current role since 2015.\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:50:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
