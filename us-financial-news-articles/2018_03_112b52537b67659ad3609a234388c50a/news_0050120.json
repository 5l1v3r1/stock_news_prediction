The Vancouver-based company said it will use VaultChain to directly sell gold to dealers and banks and work with Tradewind to add new services. \n“There’s now a base from which gold is digitized and that creates all kinds of opportunities for increases in the usage of gold,” Stephens said. “Anything that gives gold more utility has to be beneficial for the price.” \nTradewind, whose investors include Goldcorp and investment firm Sprott Inc, will store gold at the Royal Canadian Mint. \n“We believe that our technology will enable gold producers like Goldcorp to overcome existing limitations and move into the electronic age,” said Tradewind President Matt Trudeau in a statement. \nBlockchain is currently used in the diamond industry and planned for cobalt mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nDiamonds get digital fingerprints that are tracked by blockchain as gems are sold, providing a forgery-proof record of the gems’ origin.
