Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports The last time the 25-year-old Johnson-Thompson contested a pentathlon three years ago, she became European indoor champion with a magnificent 5,000 point performance that was just 13 points shy of Nataliya Dobrynska’s world record.\nIt was supposed to be the signal for this one-time world-beating junior to become the pre-eminent senior woman multi-eventer.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Yet subsequent struggles with her weaker throws and lack of belief in her jumping meant she could only finish sixth in the heptathlon at the Olympics and fifth in last year’s world championships in London.\nYet in a second year since moving to France to train under French coach Bertrand Valcin, she consistently looked the class act in a field in Birmingham which did not include Belgium’s Olympic champion Nafi Thiam.\n“It’s been very difficult for me,” she explained afterwards.“I had to leave my dogs and my mum back home and it’s been very lonely out there in France, with the language barrier there too.\n“But this is what I wanted. It’s not my personal best but hopefully it can be the start of something.”\nReporting by Ian Chadband; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T01:01:33.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
