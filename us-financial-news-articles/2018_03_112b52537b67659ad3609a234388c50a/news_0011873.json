In addition, the Company recorded a 24-hour IP rate from its Southern Hunter Amber two-well pad of 5,092 BOEPD. Both pads utilized the Company’s slickwater completion design; Produced 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBOE”), or 10,353 BOEPD (73% crude oil), for full year 2017, including 12,340 BOEPD (74% crude oil) in the fourth quarter of 2017 – a 32% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Achieved a 2017 exit rate (average of last five days of 2017) of approximately 14,650 BOEPD. Targeting year-over-year production growth of ~125% (1) for 2018 under its current development program; Increased proved reserves by approximately 47% to 72.6 MMBOE (85 MMBOE pro forma for the Hunt acquisition discussed below), representing 710% of 2017 production at a drill-bit finding and development cost of approximately $4.40 per barrel of oil equivalent (“BOE”) (2) ; Increased drilling locations at year-end (pro forma for the Hunt acquisition) to 500 net (589 gross), of which approximately 80 net locations (100 gross) are higher rate of return extended reach laterals (“XRLs”) (12 in Area 1 and 68 in Area 2), which provides the underpinning for the Company’s 2018 development program; and Closed the previously announced acquisition of Eagle Ford assets located primarily in Gonzales and Lavaca Counties, Texas, from Hunt Oil Company (“Hunt”) on March 1, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nIncurred a net loss of $10.8 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income (3) was $15.8 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income was $32.7 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, for the full year 2017. Adjusted net income (3) was $43.4 million, or $2.88 per diluted share, for the full year 2017; Generated adjusted EBITDAX (4) of $37.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 78% over the fourth quarter of 2016, or approximately $32.97 per BOE. For the full year 2017, the Company generated adjusted EBITDAX (4) of $102.2 million, or approximately $27.05 per BOE; and Increased the borrowing base under its credit facility by more than 40% to $340 million, effective March 1, 2018. Current availability under the credit facility is $164.2 million.\n(1) Assumes mid-point of production guidance.\n(2) For an explanation of these supplemental measures, see the section titled “Reserve Replacement Ratio and Drill-bit Finding and Development - Definition” at the end of this release.\n(3) Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP-based financial measures appear at the end of this release.\n“2017 was a very successful year,” commented John A. Brooks, President and Chief Executive Officer of Penn Virginia. “We increased production in the fourth quarter by more than 30% over the fourth quarter of 2016, grew adjusted EBITDAX by 78% over the same period, significantly increased proved reserves and executed two strategic acquisitions that increased our drilling inventory.”\nMr. Brooks added, “We are off to a terrific start in 2018. We entered the year with a production rate that was 19% higher than the fourth quarter average, driven by the strong performance of the Geo Hunter pad. We also recently turned to sales our latest confirmation of slickwater completions in Area 2, the two-well Southern Hunter Amber pad, and are excited about the strong initial performance from these two wells. Additionally, we have expanded our technical team and upgraded our drilling and completion equipment and are seeing dramatic improvements in cycle times and performance. As a result of this improved operational execution of our current drilling program, along with the Devon and Hunt acquisitions, we are targeting fiscal 2018 production growth of approximately 125% over full year 2017 levels. With the anticipated higher production levels, we expect to see a material increase in our cash flow, thereby further strengthening our balance sheet and positioning the Company for additional growth and success.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nTotal production in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased approximately 32% from the fourth quarter of 2016, to 1,135 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (“MBOE”), or 12,340 BOEPD (74% crude oil). At year-end, the Company’s exit rate (average of last five days of 2017) was approximately 14,650 BOEPD.\nPenn Virginia drilled and turned to sales nine gross (5.3 net) wells during the fourth quarter of 2017, all in the Eagle Ford. At year-end, Penn Virginia turned to sales the Geo Hunter pad, which had a 24-hour IP rate of 5,465 BOEPD, or 394 BOEPD per 1,000 feet of lateral. For the IP 30-day, the well produced 3,767 BOEPD, or 271 BOEPD per 1,000 feet of lateral. As a result of the Devon acquisition, which closed in the third quarter of 2017, the Company holds a 93.2% working interest. In early February, Penn Virginia turned to sales the Southern Hunter Amber (“SHA”) pad in Area 2. On average, the SHA wells were completed with lateral lengths of approximately 8,100 feet. The SHA pad recorded a combined 24-hour IP rate of 5,092 BOEPD or 314 BOEPD per 1,000 feet of lateral. The Company has a 98.1% working interest. Both the Geo Hunter and SHA pads were Area 2 slickwater completions.\nThe table below shows the current status of Eagle Ford pads that are either completing, waiting on completion, or drilling:\nPad Name Working\nInterest Status (1) Area 1/2 Elk Hunter 3 Well 74 % Drilling 1 Lott 3 Wells 100 % Drilling 2 Snipe Hunter 3 Wells 80 % Drilling 1 Dubose 3 Wells 83 % Completing 1 Bongo Hunter 3 Wells 82 % Completing 1 Schacherl Effenberger 2 Wells 71 % Waiting on Completion 2 McCreary-Technik 3Wells 74 % Waiting on Completion 2 Medina 3 Wells 100 % Waiting on Completion 2 At year-end 2017, Penn Virginia held approximately 73,400 net acres in the Eagle Ford, net of expirations. Pro forma for the Hunt acquisition, the Company has approximately 83,100 net Eagle Ford acres with 39,100 in Area 1 and 44,000 in Area 2.\nPenn Virginia at year-end (pro forma for the Hunt acquisition discussed below) had an estimated 589 gross (500 net) drilling locations of which 99% are Company-operated and 100 gross (80 net) are anticipated to be XRLs. Approximately 93% of Penn Virginia’s core acreage is held by production.\nYear-End 2017 Proved Reserves\nPenn Virginia's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 increased approximately 47% to 72.6 MMBOE (pro forma for the Hunt acquisition, 85 MMBOE) compared to 49.5 MMBOE reported at year-end 2016. The composition of the reserves at the end of 2017 was 77% oil, 12% NGLs and 11% natural gas, with 44% of the reserves classified as proved developed. Penn Virginia’s independent reserve engineering firm, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, Inc., completed its estimate of the Company's year-end 2017 proved reserves in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines using pricing of $51.34 per barrel for crude oil and $2.98 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) for natural gas, which in each case was 20% higher than year end 2016 SEC oil and natural gas pricing.\nThe Company's standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves (“Standardized Measure”) was $590.5 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $317.6 million as of year-end 2016. The increase in the Standardized Measure of the Company's proved reserves was primarily a result of an increase in proved reserves and the average NYMEX oil and natural gas price. The value of the Company’s total proved reserves, utilizing the SEC price guidelines, discounted at 10% and before tax (“PV-10 value”) (1) , was $609.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The PV-10 value of the Company's total proved developed producing (PDP) reserves utilizing the SEC price guidelines was $442.2 million as of December 31, 2017 (1) . Using strip pricing at December 31, 2017 (disclosed in the Appendix of this release), the PV-10 value of the Company's total proved reserves and PDP reserves was $681.2 million and $482.2 million, respectively .\n(1) PV-10 value is a non-GAAP measure reconciled to Standardized Measure in the Appendix of this release.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the Company’s proved reserves during 2017:\nNatural Total Proved Oil NGL Gas Equivalents Reserves (MBbls) (MBbls) (MMcf) (Mboe) Beginning Reserves (December 31, 2016) 36,611 6,765 36,682 49,490 Production (2,764) (523) (2,949) (3,779) Revisions to Previous Estimates (5,735) (2,071) (10,468) (9,550) Extensions and Discoveries 23,850 3,571 16,840 30,228 Purchase of Reserves 3,867 1,122 7,162 6,183 Sale of Reserves in Place - - - - Ending Reserves (December 31, 2017) 55,829 8,864 47,267 72,572 Proved Developed Reserves 22,412 4,882 27,229 31,832 Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal direct operating expenses, which consist of lease operating expense (“LOE”), gathering, processing and transportation (“GPT”) expense, severance and ad valorem taxes, and cash general and administrative (“G&A”) expense, were $14.9 million, or $13.11 per BOE, in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $12.7 million, or $14.81 per BOE, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.8 million, or $0.72 loss per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.

As of March 1, 2018, following the closing of the Hunt acquisition, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $175.0 million, resulting in $164.2 million available under the credit facility.\nThe Company is committed to maintaining financial discipline and a strong balance sheet with a targeted net debt to EBITDAX ratio (as referenced in the Company’s credit agreement) of 1.5x or below. Penn Virginia believes it will achieve its leverage target by the end of 2018 and spend within cash flow by the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, pro forma for the Hunt acquisition, the Company’s net debt to Adjusted EBITDAX ratio (1) was approximately 2.6x.\n(1) As defined in the Company’s credit facility.\n2018 Capital Plans\nCapital expenditures for 2018 are expected to total between $320 and $360 million, with 95% of capital being directed to drilling and completions in the Eagle Ford. The capital plan provides for drilling a total of 55 to 60 gross wells (45 to 50 net). Penn Virginia plans to drill between 33 to 35 gross wells (26 to 28 net) in Area 1 and to drill between 22 to 25 gross wells (19 to 22 net) in Area 2. In 2018, the Company expects to drill 22 XRL wells.

For more information, please visit our website at www.pennvirginia.com .\nCautionary Statements Regarding Reserves\nThe SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves that a company anticipates as of a given date to be economically and legally producible and deliverable by application of development projects to known accumulations. We use certain terms in this news release, such as total resource potential, that the SEC’s rules strictly prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These measures are by their nature more speculative than estimates of reserves prepared in accordance with SEC definitions and guidelines and accordingly are less certain. We also note that the SEC strictly prohibits us from aggregating proved, probable and possible reserves (3P) in filings with the SEC due to the different levels of certainty associated with each reserve category.\nThe estimates and guidance presented in this release are based on assumptions of capital expenditure levels, prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, current indications of supply and demand for oil, well results and operating costs. IP-24 production results might not be indicative of production over longer periods in the life of the well. Data regarding acreage that is expected to be acquired is based on currently available information about such acreage, including reserves and production, that was provided to us by third parties. The guidance provided in this release does not constitute any form of guarantee or assurance that the matters indicated will be achieved. While we believe these estimates and the assumptions on which they are based are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and are subject to, among other things, significant business, economic, operational and regulatory risks and uncertainties and are subject to material revision. Actual results may differ materially from estimates and guidance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein that are not descriptions of historical facts are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

unaudited\n(in thousands, except per unit amounts)\nReaders are reminded that non-GAAP measures are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, or superior to financial measures prepared according to GAAP. They should be evaluated in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that the Company’s non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.\nTable 1\nReconciliation of GAAP \"Net income (loss)\" to Non-GAAP \"Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders\"\nAdjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the effects, net of income taxes, of non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives, net gains and losses on the sales of assets, acquisition transaction costs, reorganization items, strategic and financial advisory costs, restructuring expenses and account write-offs and reserves prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. We believe that Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) and non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) per share amounts provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance. This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors. Since management finds this measure to be useful, the Company believes that our investors can benefit by evaluating both non-GAAP and GAAP results. Adjusted net income (loss) non-GAAP is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income (loss).\nSuccessor Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Three Months Three Months Three Months Year September 13 January 1 Ended Ended Through Ended Through Through December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, September 12, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 2016 Net income (loss) $ (10,801 ) $ (5,947 ) $ (1,855 ) $ 32,662 $ (5,296 ) $ 1,054,602 Adjustments for derivatives: Net losses (gains) 33,621 12,275 12,253 17,819 16,622 8,333 Cash settlements, net (1,841 ) 788 384 (3,511 ) 384 48,008 (Gain) loss on sale of assets, net (24 ) (9 ) 49 36 49 (1,261 ) Acquisition transaction costs (165 ) 1,505 - 1,340 - - Reorganization items, net - - - - - (1,144,993 ) Strategic and financial advisory costs - - - - - 18,036 Restructuring expenses - - (116 ) (20 ) (98 ) 3,821 Account write-offs and reserves prior to emergence from bankruptcy - - - - - 3,123 Impact of adjustment on income taxes (4,943 ) - - (4,943 ) - - Adjusted net income (loss) $ 15,847 $ 8,612 $ 10,715 $ 43,383 $ 11,661 $ (10,331 ) Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders, per diluted share $ 1.06 $ 0.57 $ 0.71 $ 2.88 $ 0.78 $ (0.08 ) Table 2\nReconciliation of GAAP \"Net income (loss)\" to Non-GAAP \"Adjusted EBITDAX\"\nAdjusted EBITDAX represents net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, exploration, and share-based compensation expense, further adjusted to exclude the effects of gains and losses on sales of assets, accretion of firm transportation obligation, non-cash changes in the fair value of derivatives, and special items including acquisition transaction costs, reorganization items, strategic and financial advisory costs, restructuring expenses and account write-offs and reserves prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts for the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within our industry. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income (loss). Adjusted EBITDAX as defined by Penn Virginia may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) and other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Penn Virginia's results as reported under GAAP.\nSuccessor Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Three Months Three Months Three Months Year September 13 January 1 Ended Ended Through Ended Through Through December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, September 12, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 2016 Net income (loss) $ (10,801 ) $ (5,947 ) $ (1,855 ) $ 32,662 $ (5,296 ) $ 1,054,602 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted EBITDAX: Interest expense, net 3,378 1,202 661 6,392 879 58,018 Income tax benefit (4,943 ) - - (4,943 ) - - Depreciation, depletion and amortization 17,104 10,659 9,623 48,649 11,652 33,582 Exploration - - - - - 10,288 Share-based compensation expense (equity-classified) 1,102 1,013 81 3,809 81 1,511 (Gain) loss on sale of assets, net (24 ) (9 ) 49 36 49 (1,261 ) Accretion of firm transportation obligation - - - - - 317 Adjustments for derivatives: Net losses (gains) 33,621 12,275 12,253 17,819 16,622 8,333 Cash settlements, net (1,841 ) 788 384 (3,511 ) 384 48,008 Adjustment for special items: Acquisition transaction costs (165 ) 1,505 - 1,340 - - Reorganization items, net - - - - - (1,144,993 ) Strategic and financial advisory costs - - - - - 18,036 Restructuring expenses - - (116 ) (20 ) (98 ) 3,821 Account write-offs and reserves prior to emergence from bankruptcy - - - - - 3,123 Adjusted EBITDAX $ 37,431 $ 21,486 $ 21,080 $ 102,233 $ 24,273 $ 93,385 Adjusted EBITDAX per BOE $ 32.97 $ 24.85 $ 24.60 $ 27.05 $ 23.35 $ 27.91\nTable 3\nReconciliation of GAAP “Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows” to Non-GAAP “PV-10”\nNon-GAAP PV-10 value is the estimated future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent before giving effect to income taxes. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is the after-tax estimated future cash flows from estimated proved reserves discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We use non-GAAP PV-10 value as one measure of the value of our estimated proved reserves and to compare relative values of proved reserves among exploration and production companies without regard to income taxes. We believe that securities analysts and rating agencies use PV-10 value in similar ways. Our management believes PV-10 value is a useful measure for comparison of proved reserve values among companies because, unlike standardized measure, it excludes future income taxes that often depend principally on the characteristics of the owner of the reserves rather than on the nature, location and quality of the reserves themselves.\nDecember 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 (1) Standardized measure of future discounted cash flows $590,484 $317,550 Present value of future income taxes discounted at 10% 18,486 - PV-10 value $608,970 $317,550 (1) Due primarily to our net operating loss carry forwards, our standardized measure of future discounted cash flows does not include any income tax effect.\nTable 4\nNYMEX Pricing Used in the Calculation of PV-10 at Strip\nCalendar Year Average Oil Natural Gas (per barrel) (per MMBtu) 2018 $59.55 $2.87 2019 $56.22 $2.81 2020 $53.79 $2.82 2021 $52.29 $2.85 2022 $51.70 $2.89 2023 $51.59 $2.93 2024 $51.76 $2.97 2025 $52.07 $3.01 2026 $52.47 $3.07 The Company used the average pricing for the year shown above and flat pricing after 2026.\nTable 5\nReconciliation of GAAP \"General administrative expenses\" to Non-GAAP \"Adjusted cash-based general and administrative expenses\"\nAdjusted cash-based general and administrative expense (\"Adjusted G&A\") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain non-recurring expenses and non-cash share-based compensation expense. We believe that the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted G&A is useful to investors because it provides readers with a meaningful measure of our recurring G&A expense and provides for greater comparability period-over-period. The table details all adjustments to G&A on a GAAP basis to arrive at Adjusted G&A.\nSuccessor Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Three Months Three Months Three Months Year September 13 January 1 Ended Ended Through Ended Through Through December 31, September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, September 12, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 2016 General and administrative expenses - direct $ 2,360 $ 5,939 $ 3,531 $ 14,453 $ 5,007 $ 37,434 Share-based compensation - equity-classified awards 1,102 1,013 81 3,809 81 1,511 GAAP General and administrative expenses 3,462 6,952 3,612 18,262 5,088 38,945 Less: Share-based compensation - equity-classified awards (1,102 ) (1,013 ) (81 ) (3,809 ) (81 ) (1,511 ) Significant special charges: Acquisition transaction costs 165 (1,505 ) - (1,340 ) - - Strategic and financial advisory costs - - - - - (18,036 ) Restructuring expenses - - 116 20 98 (3,821 ) Adjusted cash-based general and administrative expenses $ 2,525 $ 4,434 $ 3,647 $ 13,133 $ 5,105 $ 15,577 Adjusted cash-based general and administrative expenses per BOE $ 2.22 $ 5.13 $ 4.26 $ 3.48 $ 4.91 $ 4.66\nDefinitions and Calculations\nDrill-Bit Finding and Development Cost - Definition\nDrill-bit finding and development costs for full year 2017 of approximately $4.40 per BOE was calculated by dividing the sum of exploration costs and development costs of $133.0 million by total reserve, extensions and discoveries of 30.2 MMBOE. Drill-bit finding and development cost is a supplemental used to assist in an evaluation of how much it costs the Company, on a per BOE basis, to add proved reserves. This calculation does not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves.\nReserve Replacement Ratio - Definition\nThe Company uses the reserves replacement ratio as an indicator of the Company’s ability to replenish annual production volumes and grow its reserves, thereby providing some information on the sources of future production. The reserves replacement ratio is a statistical indicator that is limited because it typically varies widely based on the extent and timing of discoveries and property acquisitions. Its predictive and comparative value is also limited for the same reasons. In addition, since the ratio does not embed the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, it cannot be used as a measure of value creation. The reserve replacement ratio of approximately 710% was calculated by dividing net proved reserve additions of 26.9 MMBOE (the sum of extensions, discoveries, revisions and purchases) by production of 3.8 MMBOE.\nSource:Penn Virginia Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tdS00anPl7IG93DjrA8lhOTQkkgJEJgVMx2gkOLld880iadRv8QzN7W5pvJKCc6qaUVyLc0eFrE1GEP9AYEuGZ6IycZwa1yiEJFmxtVPbSvzX_oMhiviQVfenymb8yT7FuhgbDLddabTH_UXOpx9iTlHhva4ELrWI8onyKx18xng4uhHUXy016Q2PhhpNVjmVs5mCEk1Eb962QdrmL6VQUAvmaYUUaiZwfvWcMinJIFHm43V3Xkkt05Vep0vV2crJ_1gz4YlGEEammv3Pc-4HA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a735d629-d48a-4a66-841a-43e3b477e26a", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MsfD7WdTy5A_dNZ2GbMz0FhiVDL4hx7gRBYH2eaw5vEzRbYrR4FtPBQJwJBLCqNivLb7iDFtSNaacU5qkydJaSaqbkfoZkU_tDiUBv3QdmL_jbeDd8QR-T7OHGMvL4c3l3tnvcDbwHn_mNwcB4HUtKnC9GWMSS2SCsXFLeDNQpptoQC0Q8RITb1W4pJ2paINOoyNjVV_glOJiZwql2slPYh6IKAAewlpsAA3QtnNcqvKaJIHlkOVYNIYiQg9xKEGL5biCRaiw_eRjMu6AqH1ig=="], "published": "2018-03-02T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T05:29:38.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
