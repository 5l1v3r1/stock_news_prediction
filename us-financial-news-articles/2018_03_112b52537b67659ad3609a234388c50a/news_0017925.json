The ripple effect is that countries, producers of bauxite or iron ore, will have downward pressures on the value of their commodity,” Kituyi said.\n“There will be concentration: bigger companies in the smaller producers will take over the smaller suppliers because of vulnerabilities created by this anxiety,” he said.\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Kevin Liffey\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:24:53.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
