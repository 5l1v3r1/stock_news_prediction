For example, people who drink three of the marijuana-infused beers would, in theory, feel the same effect as if they had consumed three traditional beers. \nThat’s departure from how traditional marijuana edibles, whose effects can be delayed several hours, making it difficult for consumers to judge how much to eat, The Reno Gazette Journal notes . \nThe name of the beer and pricing are still unknown. \nA number of “marijuana-infused” beers are already on the market. However, those all contain CBD, a non-psychoactive component in cannabis. Federal law prohibits brewers from including the psychoactive compound THC in their beers, but Villa’s product circumvents that because it doesn’t actually contain any alcohol. His original creation, Blue Moon, is owned by MillerCoors. \nVilla is expected to introduce his marijuana beer in Colorado this fall, and then expand distribution stores in other states where marijuana is legal for recreational use by next year. Marijuana is still illegal at a federal level.
