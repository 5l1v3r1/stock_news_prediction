That compared with a 16.1 percent rise forecast in a Reuters poll.\nThe yearly growth in January was the strongest since February last year.\nThe ministry sees the value of February orders possibly dropping 21-23.4 percent compared with January, as the new year fell in February this year.\nTaiwan won record export orders in 2017 after orders rose 17.5 percent in December and 11.6 percent in November from a year earlier.\nExport-reliant Taiwan last month raised its 2018 economic growth forecast to 2.42 percent from 2.29 percent as strong exports continued to drive economic momentum, while consumption and private investment gradually improved.\nTaiwan’s orders are a leading indicator of demand for Asia’s exports and for hi-tech gadgets, and typically lead actual exports by two to three months.\nSTRONG GLOBAL DEMAND While Taiwan’s solid order growth points to continuing strength for Asian exporters thanks to strong global demand for new smartphone models and memory chips, analysts said orders will cool in the coming months.\nTraditionally, the first quarter is Taiwan’s weakest for exports after the holiday season in the fourth quarter.\nCarl Liu, an analyst at KGI Securities, said Taiwan’s annual export order growth in the first quarter could reach 10-13 percent helped by a better-than-expected recovery in the global economy.\nThe ministry said January’s performance was boosted by growth of key products, including information communications and electronic goods.\nExport orders from China rose 31 percent from a year earlier and were up 16.3 percent from the United States. Orders rose 15.3 percent from the European Union and 17.8 percent from Japan.
