Starbucks now has 113 stores across the populous states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. \n\"With Starbucks, we see continued opportunities for growth in existing markets ... as well as new markets like Brasilia and the South,\" he said. \nSouthRock, founded in 2015, also owns Brazil Airport Restaurants, which operates in the country's biggest airports. \nShares in Starbucks opened up 0.5 percent but closed down 0.58 percent. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.64 percent.
