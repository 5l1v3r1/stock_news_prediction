It also trickles down to computer parts suppliers, specifically chipmakers like Micron , the \"Mad Money\" host said.\nIn fact, Cramer argued that Micron, which makes DRAM and flash memory chips, is the top beneficiary of the PC comeback. Shares of Micron hit a 52-week high on Monday.\nMarket-watchers have been concerned for months that pricing for Micron's chips — which are subject to a boom-bust cycle — was on the cusp of breaking down, which would make earnings estimates too high. But HP Inc.'s quarter showed that pricing would remain strong for 2018.\n\"That means Micron will likely meet or even exceed the numbers, and if that's the case, its stock is way too cheap,\" Cramer said. \"It is a buy on this breakout.\"\nStocks like Nvidia , which makes semiconductor chips for a host of industries including PCs, gaming and the data center, and Intel also stand to benefit from the PC comeback, Cramer said.\nEven shares of companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research , which produce the equipment used to make processing chips, could recover as a result, Cramer said.\n\"I see tremendous pin action off of Micron. The themes are too great to ignore,\" he concluded. \"The PC suppliers are back and most of them are way too cheap. Even though their stocks have run, I bet they'll end up looking like bargains down the road when these companies start beating their estimates left and right as their underlying business is finally booming again.\"\nWATCH: Cramer's call to action for the PC comeback show chapters Cramer: Ride the wave of the PC comeback with stocks like Micron 17 Hours Ago | 03:43 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T01:58:19.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
