Even when comparing the sexes with the same job title at the same company and using similar education and experience, the gender pay gap persists across the board: Men earned 2.4 percent more than women on average, down slightly from last year, according to a study by salary-tracking website PayScale .\nshow chapters Three-time medalist Lindsey Vonn reflects on likely final Olympics      9:53 AM ET Fri, 23 Feb 2018 | 03:35 For Vonn, who has four World Cup championships and raced in more World Cup raevents than any other American in addition to her Olympic medals, monetary success came in the form of lucrative endorsements.\nThe superstar athlete has signed on with Red Bull, Rolex, Head and Under Armour among others.
