For those of you who slept through junior high school math, Pi starts with the numbers 3.14 (the numeric representation of March 14).\nUnlike Google (goog) , which chose to honor Pi Day with a Google Doodle and pie recipe , or restaurants like Marie Calendar’s that are selling actual pies , Microsoft (msft) chose to play up on Pi Day’s mathematics roots by discounting computers.\nSome of the deals available on the Microsoft Store include a Dell XPS 13 Laptop that costs $1,099 instead of $1,399. An Alienware 17 R4 laptop now costs $1,499 instead of $1,699, while an HP Inc. (hpq) Spectre laptop costs $1,099 instead of $1,249.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nMicrosoft also dropped the price of couple of laptops to exactly $314, including a Dell Inspiron 13, an Asus VivoBook, and an HP Pavillion laptop.", "external_links": ["https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/pcdeals?cat0=devices&icid=en-us-deals-page_hero1_20180313_pcdeals", "http://time.com/5198663/30th-anniversary-of-pi-day-2018-facts/"], "published": "2018-03-15T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T22:56:53.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
