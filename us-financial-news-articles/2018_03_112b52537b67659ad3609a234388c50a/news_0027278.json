By definition, the Company's same-store sales growth calculations do not include the non-comparable 53 rd week in the 2016 periods.\n2 See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for reconciliation of Adjusted Diluted EPS to Diluted EPS; see also “Non-GAAP Disclosure” herein.\n“I am pleased with our overall fourth quarter performance, as we delivered strong same-store sales growth of 3.3%, while achieving a healthy rate of gross margin expansion. For the year, we opened a record 1,315 new stores and delivered a same-store sales increase of 2.7%, marking our 28th consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. At the same time, we proactively made significant investments in the business that we expect will contribute to sustainable sales and profit growth in the years ahead. As we move into 2018, we continue to build momentum behind initiatives that we believe will further enhance our strong value and convenience proposition with consumers and drive long-term success,” said Todd Vasos, Dollar General’s chief executive officer.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet sales increased 2.0% to $6.1 billion in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $6.0 billion in the 2016 fourth quarter, which included net sales of $398.7 million for the 2016 53 rd week. The 2016 53 rd week net sales negatively impacted the 2017 fourth quarter growth rate by approximately seven percentage points. The net sales increase in the 2017 fourth quarter was positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores. Same-store sales increased 3.3% from the 2016 fourth quarter due to an increase in average transaction amount, partially offset by a slight decline in customer traffic. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and seasonal categories, partially offset by negative results in the apparel and home categories.\nThe Company’s gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 32.1% in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to 31.6% in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 43 basis points. The 2017 fourth quarter gross profit rate increase was primarily attributable to higher initial inventory markups, an improved rate of inventory shrink, and a reduction in markdowns; partially offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower-margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, and increased transportation costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) as a percentage of net sales was 21.9% in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to 20.3% in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase of 159 basis points. The 2017 fourth quarter SG&A increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased occupancy costs, increased retail labor expenses, including the Company’s investment in store manager compensation, and increased incentive compensation, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was a reduction in advertising costs. The 2016 fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of net sales was favorably impacted by net sales of $398.7 million from the 2016 53 rd week.\nAdditionally, as a result of a strategic review of its real estate portfolio, the Company closed an incremental 35 stores during the 2017 fourth quarter (the “Incremental Store Closures”) resulting in approximately $28.3 million of related pre-tax costs during the 2017 fourth quarter, most of which were in the form of SG&A expenses associated with the remaining lease liability on these stores.\nThe effective income tax rate in the 2017 fourth quarter was a benefit of 18.9% compared to expense of 36.8% in the 2016 fourth quarter. The effective income tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was lower than the 2016 quarter due primarily to the effect of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Under accounting standards for income taxes, the impact of new tax legislation must be taken into account in the period in which the new legislation is enacted, including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which such items are expected to reverse in future periods. Subsequent to the signing of the TCJA, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which allows companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis. As a result, the Company has recorded provisional impacts for the 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year. Among other things, the TCJA lowered the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA had the effect of reducing the Company’s effective tax rate in the 2017 fourth quarter primarily as a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21% rate, accompanied by benefits associated with a reduced federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2017 of 33.7%, as a result of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year straddling the effective date of the TCJA.\nThe Company reported net income of $712 million, or diluted EPS of $2.63, for the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to net income of $414 million, or diluted EPS of $1.49, in the 2016 fourth quarter, an increase in diluted EPS of 76.5%. Excluding the provisional benefit of $311 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities discussed above, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the 2017 fourth quarter were $401 million and $1.48, respectively.\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted EPS for the 2017 fourth quarter also include an approximate $0.09 provisional benefit primarily due to the reduced federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2017. These provisional benefits were partially offset by a $0.07 charge from the Incremental Store Closures in the 2017 fourth quarter, as discussed above.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nFiscal year 2017 net sales increased 6.8% to $23.5 billion compared to net sales of $22.0 billion in 2016, which included net sales of $398.7 million for the 2016 53 rd week. The 2016 53 rd week negatively impacted the fiscal year 2017 growth rate by approximately two percentage points. The net sales increase was positively affected by sales from new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores. Same-store sales increased 2.7% from fiscal year 2016, due to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic. Same-store sales were driven by positive results in the consumables and seasonal categories, partially offset by negative results in the home and apparel categories.\nThe Company’s gross profit rate as a percentage of net sales was 30.8% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 30.8% in fiscal year 2016, a decrease of eight basis points. The gross profit rate decrease was primarily due to a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than other product categories, sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, higher markdowns, which were primarily for promotional activities, and increased transportation costs. These factors were partially offset by higher initial inventory markups and an improved rate of inventory shrink.\nSG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2% in fiscal year 2017 compared to 21.5% in fiscal year 2016, an increase of 75 basis points. The 2017 fiscal year SG&A increase as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to increased retail labor expenses, including the Company’s investment in store manager compensation, increased occupancy costs, and higher incentive compensation, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. Partially offsetting these increased expenses were reduced advertising costs, and costs that increased at a rate less than the increase in net sales, including utilities and waste management costs primarily resulting from the Company’s recycling efforts. Fiscal year 2017 SG&A also include approximately $24.0 million of costs related to the Incremental Store Closures in the 2017 fourth quarter, as well as an increase in hurricane and other disaster-related expenses of approximately $18.0 million over fiscal year 2016. SG&A as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2016 was favorably impacted by net sales of $398.7 million from the 2016 53 rd week.\nThe effective income tax rate was an expense of 19.3% for fiscal year 2017 compared to an expense of 36.3% for fiscal year 2016. The effective income tax rate was lower in fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the effect of the TCJA, as detailed above. The TCJA had the effect of reducing the Company’s fiscal year 2017 effective tax rate primarily as a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new lower federal corporate rate, accompanied by benefits associated with a reduced federal corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2017 of 33.7%, as a result of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year straddling the effective date of the TCJA.\nThe Company reported net income of $1.54 billion, or diluted EPS of $5.63, for fiscal year 2017 compared to net income of $1.25 billion, or diluted EPS of $4.43, for fiscal year 2016, an increase in diluted EPS of 27.1%. Excluding the provisional benefit of $311 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities discussed above, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the 2017 fiscal year were $1.23 billion and $4.49, respectively.\nMerchandise Inventories\nAs of February 2, 2018, total merchandise inventories, at cost, were $3.61 billion compared to $3.26 billion as of February 3, 2017, an increase of approximately 1.5% on a per store basis.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal additions to property and equipment during fiscal year 2017 were $646 million, including approximately: $231 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $203 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $176 million for distribution and transportation related projects; and $30 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During fiscal year 2017, the Company opened 1,315 new stores and remodeled or relocated 764 stores.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company repurchased $580 million, or 7.1 million shares, under its share repurchase program in fiscal year 2017, at an average price of $82.11 per share. From the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011 through the end of fiscal year 2017, the Company has repurchased 81.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $63.21 per share, for a total cost of $5.1 billion. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases was approximately $354 million at the end of fiscal year 2017. On March 14, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the authorization under the share repurchase program by $1.0 billion. Under the authorization, purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions. The authorization has no expiration date.\nDividend\nOn March 14, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, which is a 12% increase over the prior quarterly dividend, payable on or before April 24, 2018 to shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock on April 10, 2018. While the Board of Directors intends to continue regular cash dividends, the declaration and amount of future dividends are subject to the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon, among other things, the Company’s results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and other factors the Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion.\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance and Store Growth Outlook\nFor the 52-week fiscal year ending February 1, 2019 (“fiscal year 2018”), the Company expects net sales to increase approximately nine percent, with same-store sales growth estimated to be in the mid-two percent range. The Company expects the fiscal year 2018 operating margin rate to be relatively unchanged as compared to the fiscal year 2017 operating margin rate.\nThe Company expects fiscal year 2018 diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. This diluted EPS guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of 22% to 23%.\nThe Company currently anticipates a cash benefit of approximately $300 million in fiscal 2018 as a result of the TCJA.\nShare repurchases for fiscal year 2018 are expected to be approximately $850 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 are expected to be in the range of $725 million to $800 million.\nThe Company plans to open approximately 900 new stores, remodel 1,000 stores and relocate 100 stores in fiscal year 2018.\nLong-Term Growth Model\nThe Company expects to continue to use the long-term growth model, which was announced on March 10, 2016, internally to assess and benchmark its results and strategic plans; however, the Company does not intend to discuss externally any guidance or results in the context of the long-term growth model. Over the longer term, the Company’s goal is to grow adjusted diluted EPS at a rate of 10% or higher. Diluted EPS derived in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) may include the impact of certain discrete items of which we are currently unaware, which may be excluded in calculating Adjusted diluted EPS. In the past, discrete items for which the Company has made adjustments to GAAP diluted EPS have primarily included restructuring costs, legal settlements, and income-tax related remeasurements. The Company is not currently aware of any such discrete items in the future.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. CT/10:00 a.m. ET, hosted by Todd Vasos, chief executive officer, and John Garratt, chief financial officer. If you wish to participate, please call (877) 868-1301 at least 10 minutes before the conference call is scheduled to begin. The conference ID is 5996418. The call will also be broadcast live online at www.dollargeneral.com under “Investor Information, News & Events, Events & Presentations.” A replay of the conference call will be available through Thursday, March 29, 2018, and will be accessible online or by calling (855) 859-2056. The conference ID for the replay is 5996418.\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the 2017 fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 have not been derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather exclude an income tax benefit of $311 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, and $311 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, respectively, as a result of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities discussed above. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in assessing the Company’s operating performance as these measures provide an additional relevant comparison of the Company’s operating performance across periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are provided in the accompanying schedules.\nThe non-GAAP measures discussed above are not measures of financial performance or condition, liquidity or profitability in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, diluted EPS or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, including statements regarding the Company’s outlook, plans and intentions including, but not limited to, statements made within the quotations of Mr. Vasos and in the sections entitled “Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance and Store Growth Outlook” and “Long-Term Growth Model”.
