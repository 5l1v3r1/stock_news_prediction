The deal is expected to close on April 27, 2018.\nThe acquisition adds to the $30 million of Webcom's digital book manufacturing investments and reconfirms its commitment to meet the growing publisher demand for unique casebinding capabilities. This is Webcom's second major expansion of its casebinding services in 2018, following the recent investment in digital casebinding systems from GP2 Technologies .\n\"The integration of York Bookbinders into Webcom's Toronto manufacturing facility significantly improves Webcom's capacity to support book publishers with cost-competitive, responsive service for hardcover books in quantities ranging from book of one to thousands of copies,\" said Mike Collinge, President and CEO of Webcom. \"This acquisition will augment Webcom's current POD , ASR, digital inkjet and softcover production capabilities supporting Canadian and global book publishers with an efficient, full-service North American book manufacturing and distribution hub.\"\nNew capabilities allow Webcom to meet the high-quality standards for NASTA-compliant educational titles, library bookbinding and a wide range of elaborate casebound book formats.
