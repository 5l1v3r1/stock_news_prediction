Kanter, MD , dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC), will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of AAHC and the Association of Academic Health Centers International (AAHCI), effective July 1, 2018.\nAAHC is a non-profit association dedicated to advancing health and well-being through the vigorous leadership of academic health centers in health professions education, biomedical and health services research, and healthcare delivery. The association represents around 150 institutions globally.\n“After an extensive search, Dr. Kanter emerged as the Board’s unanimous choice to lead the association. He is committed to serving the association’s membership around the globe and I am confident he will lead the association with distinction during this transformative moment for academic health centers,” said Dr. Hawgood.\n“This is a period of dynamic change for academic health centers and a pivotal time for AAHC as it approaches its 50th anniversary. I am honored to assume the presidency of AAHC and look forward to advancing the interests of our member academic health centers around the world,” said Dr. Kanter.\nDr. Kanter has served as the Dean of the UMKC School of Medicine since 2014.

Further, his experience as Editor-in Chief of a major journal will prove most valuable in supporting and developing programs and member services that impact issues involving the core missions of academic health centers. As I leave my position at AAHC, I am confident that the association will be well-guided in the hands of its new president,” said Steven A. Wartman, MD, PhD , current AAHC president/CEO.\nFrom 2008 to 2012, Dr. Kanter served as Editor-in-Chief of Academic Medicine, the journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges, where he led a highly collaborative team, improved the journal’s online presence, established new policies and practices that brought the journal to the forefront of publication ethics, and introduced several new features.\nDr. Kanter has served in faculty appointments at UMKC, UPSOM, and at Texas A&M University College of Medicine.
