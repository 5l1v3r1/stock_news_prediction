Some seven of 15 participants now expect at least four rate increases this year, an increase from four of 16 participants at the December meeting. \nMost Fed officials also expect the Fed would need to raise rates at least another three times next year. At the December meeting, officials projected around two increases would be needed in 2019. \nOfficials also penciled in two rate increases in 2020, which would leave them in a range between 3.25% and 3.5%. \n“The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,” the Fed’s rate-setting committee said in its postmeeting statement. \nThe vote to raise interest rates at the meeting, the first led by Fed Chairman \nJerome Powell, \nwas unanimous, with all eight participants in favor of the rate increase. \nThe rate increase approved Wednesday was widely expected. Traders in futures markets already anticipated the Fed would raise rates a total of three times this year, and before the two-day meeting ended Wednesday, investors placed a roughly 40% probability on at least four interest-rate increases this year, according to \nCME Group . \nOfficials marked up slightly the estimate of interest rates they expect to prevail over the long run, to a range between 2.75% and 3%. Because they now expect a slightly more aggressive path of rate increases in the coming years, this means more officials now anticipate they will need to tap harder on the brakes to cool down the economy after next year. \nOfficials release their economic projections every quarter. The new figures released Wednesday show they now expect inflation to rise above their 2% target next year and in 2020. Inflation has remained below that target for most of the last six years. \nAfter a surprising deceleration last year that defied the Fed’s forecasts, inflation in recent months has firmed. Consumer prices rose 1.7% in January from a year earlier, according to the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge. So-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 1.5%. \nFed officials now see core inflation rising to 2.1% next year, up from an earlier projection of 2%, and they see it staying at 2.1% in 2020. \nAn open question for Mr. Powell is how the Fed would respond to inflation if it rises above the 2% target. Officials have said their target is symmetric, meaning they are as willing to tolerate periods of inflation slightly below the target as they are periods when it rises slightly above the target. \nBut because inflation has run below the Fed’s target since officials formally adopted it in 2012, markets don’t have a good read on how policy makers would chart interest-rate policy when inflation is above target. \nOfficials also raised their estimates of economic growth this year and next, likely reflecting an increase in federal spending Congress approved last month. Officials in December revised their growth projections higher because Congress was nearing completion of a bill to cut taxes by $1.5 trillion over a decade. \nThey now see the economy growing by 2.7% this year and 2.4% in 2019, versus earlier projections of 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Their forecasts beyond that—2% growth in 2020 and 1.8% growth over the long run—didn’t change. \nBecause officials see the economy growing significantly faster than the level they expect will prevail over the long run, the forecasts imply officials see rising pressure on the economy’s productive resources, which could complicate their rate decisions. \nThe big question heading into their two-day meeting was how much Fed officials expected to lift rates in coming years, particularly after lawmakers approved a more generous federal funding bill in addition to cuts in corporate and individual tax rates at the end of last year. \nIn February, Congress approved a $300 billion spending bill that could add around 0.4 percentage point to gross domestic product this year and next, on top of last year’s tax cuts that could add a similar boost to output over the same period. \nWall Street economists expect the measures will push unemployment down to the low 3% range next year. U.S. joblessness hasn’t been at that level since the Korean War, and no one is quite sure what that could do to inflation or financial stability. \nFed officials now project the unemployment rate, which has held at 4.1% since October, will fall to 3.8% this year, down from 3.9% in their December projection. They see it falling to 3.6% in 2019 and 2020, versus earlier projections of 3.9% and 4%, respectively. \nThat would leave unemployment well below the level they see prevailing over the long run. They marked down that forecast a touch, to 4.5% from 4.6% in December. The revision indicates officials believe there might be a little more labor slack than previously estimated. \nSince officials last met at the end of January, glimmers of rising wages jolted financial markets, illustrating how investors’ anticipation of stronger price pressures and a shift in the Fed’s rate path might usher in more volatility in stock markets. \nThe Fed raised interest rates three times last year and began allowing their large bond portfolio to slowly shrink. \nMr. Powell, in recent congressional testimony, indicated he had turned more bullish on the economy since the start of the year. \n“We’ve seen continuing strength in the labor market. We’ve seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target,” he said. “We’ve also seen continued strength around the globe, and we’ve seen fiscal policy become more stimulative.” \nWrite to Nick Timiraos at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T23:39:35.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
