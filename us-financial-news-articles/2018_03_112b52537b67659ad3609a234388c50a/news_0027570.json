The OHA members will immediately see the value of implementation and how it will help their teams provide a superior patient experience while managing the cost of care.\"\n\"Improving outcomes and reducing costs for patients is imperative, but despite large investments in electronic medical records, surgical care continues to rely heavily on manual-based processes such as faxes and phone calls that hinder communication and challenge surgical outcomes,\" says Harold Mondschein, CEO and Founder of Medtel. \"The Medtel platform provides an environment that helps the financial and surgical teams identify both financial and clinical risks prior to the incision and continues to monitor information about the patient throughout the entire episode of care.\"\nAs a result, in 2013, Medtel's solution emerged as the first surgical care management platform designed to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better outcomes. The following are 3 keys to Medtel's success with client implementations:\nBelow is a brief description of Medtel's surgical care management solution that has assisted hospitals such as NYU Medical Center's Hospital for Joint Diseases in improving their surgical profitability. For NYU's hip and knee total joint program, they have reduced their costs by $10,000 per patient per 90-day episode of care. This translates into significant dollars. In NYU's case, it is roughly $40 million. Medtel is not solely responsible for these savings, but they credit us as being a big part.\nAutomating manual-based processes, improving workflows and capturing structured data easily and reliably connecting a large variety of patient information. Creating the earliest opportunity to identify the clinical and financial risks of a procedure before the incision. Sustaining surgeon and staff compliance to clinical guidelines, care pathways, and protocols that lead to an institution's improved financial health.\nArmed with the Medtel solution, providers now have the necessary agnostic, cloud-based tools to easily connect with their surgical offices and sustain compliance to best practices which results in better outcomes for their patients and financial health for their institution.\nAbout OHA : The Oklahoma Hospital Association is the voice of hospitals in Oklahoma.
