But the second most-chosen answer is four this year and three in 2019, suggesting that the risks are to the upside when it comes to rate hikes.\nThe Fed funds rate is forecast to rise to 2.23 percent this year and 2.85 percent next year.\n\"The Fed will raise rates at the March meeting, and begin to signal in the pronouncement and future commentary that four hikes in 2018 is the new expectation of the committee,'' said Rob Morgan, chief investment officer at Sethi.\nMorgan is one of the survey's 40 respondents, who include economists, fund managers and strategists.\nAndrew Kelly | Reuters Most respondents to the CNBC survey said they were unconcerned by the recent market volatility, with 60 percent saying it represents a healthy part of the market cycle and 73 percent saying it hasn't changed their view on stocks. But respondents marked down their outlook for the S&P 500 in March for the first time since July.\nThe S&P is now seen ending the year at 2,839, about 5 percent higher than the current level but down from the January forecast of 2,937. For 2019, the average forecast fell to 2,928, from 3,005 in January.\nThe growth in outlook for GDP is pretty much unchanged, at 2.76 percent for the year in 2018 and 2.72 percent for next year.\nRespondents to the survey also said a looming trade war is their greatest concern.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T13:01:51.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
