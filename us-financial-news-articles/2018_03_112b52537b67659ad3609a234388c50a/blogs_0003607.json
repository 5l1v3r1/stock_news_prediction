You know, the list goes on. ' Hold You Down .' I have done records with Jay-Z. By the way, Jay-Z is my manager now ,\" Khaled added.\nIn fact, Khaled's lastest single, \"Top Off,\" released Friday, features Jay-Z as well as Beyonce and Future. The single teases the release of his upcoming album, \"Father of Asahd,\" according to Billboard . \n\"I am like the hip-hop Quincy Jones, you know what I am saying? ... I am an entrepreneur. I am a young mogul,\" said Khaled. \n\"I am blessed, you know what I am saying?\" \nAs Khaled told DeGeneres about being a music producer and founder and CEO of his record label and management and production company We the Best Music Group , he leaned back in his chair. Wearing a brown silky jumpsuit, a wreath of gold necklaces and displaying a patch of dark chest hair, Khaled gestured to the audience confidently and rubbed his carefully coiffed beard in conversation with DeGeneres. (Khaled celebrates being well groomed. He recommends getting a hair cut twice a week as well as a weekly pedicure and manicure.)\nAt the end of his six-minute bit with DeGeneres, Khaled thanked the talk show host for having him. He was wide-eyed with excitement.\n\"I want to let you know, I am very inspired by you. I love everything you do,\" gushed Khaled to DeGeneres. \n\"I always watch Ellen's show. To be on here is real amazing for me,\" he told the audience.\n\nIndeed, Khaled has a knack for constantly promoting himself while still appearing agog at his own success. So it's hard not to be charmed when listening to Khaled riff â€” and he does riff, rising and dropping his words to some ever-present internal vibe. \nIt's at the heart of his appeal and it's helped turn the pudgy 42-year-old Palestinian-American into social media star. \n\n\"Being authentic always wins,\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T21:07:15.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
