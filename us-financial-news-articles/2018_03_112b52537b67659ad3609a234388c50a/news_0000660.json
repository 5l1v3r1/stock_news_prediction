It had previously guided for the ratio to fall below 2.7 times by the end of 2018.\nThe former state phone monopoly said domestic revenues would remain broadly stable over the life of the plan, while core earnings would grow at a low single digit rate on average between 2017-2020.\nFor 2017, the company reported a 4.2 percent rise in group revenues to 19.8 billion euros ($24.6 billion), in line with an analyst consensus provided by the company.\nEarnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 2.6 percent to 7.79 billion euros, hit by one-off charges of 883 million euros mainly due to staff restructuring costs. This compares with an analyst consensus forecast of 8.34 billion euros.
