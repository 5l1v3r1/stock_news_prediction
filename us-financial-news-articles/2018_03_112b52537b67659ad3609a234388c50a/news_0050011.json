It can draw water from deep underground, and it retains the ability to photosynthesise even when exposed to high temperatures and solar radiation. \n“It’s one of the few species that we can plant on these slopes that have nothing on them,” said Shabtai Cohen of Israel’s Volcani Agricultural Research Centre, who has been working with France’s National Institute for Agricultural Research and researchers at Israel’s Hebrew University. \n“We only know maybe one or two other species that can do that.” \nVarious plants have been proposed as the source of the crown of thorns the New Testament says was placed on Christ’s head in the lead-up to the crucifixion, and no-one knows for certain. But the consensus among Christian scholars tends toward Ziziphus Spina-Christi. \nJust as that crown is associated with suffering and death followed by resurrection, the researchers hope the tree, which provides sustenance to bees and insects, can help support life in areas threatened by deadly heat. \n“Studying its attributes and its traits is going to help us to breed species that we want in the future,” said Cohen.
