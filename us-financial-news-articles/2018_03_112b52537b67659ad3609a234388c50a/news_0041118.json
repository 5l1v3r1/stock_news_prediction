He had stepped down in January, while remaining on the federal payroll ahead of his full resignation.\nHis firing was recommended by the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility, and was later accepted by Attorney General Jeff Sessions .\nPreviously, a review by the Justice Department's inspector general had concluded that the ex-deputy had shown a lack of candor regarding his decision to allow FBI officials to talk to the press during an investigation into the Clinton Foundation in 2016.\nNeither report has been released to the public.\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized McCabe numerous times on Twitter , accusing him of political bias. Trump evidenced his claims in part by noting that McCabe's wife, in a campaign for Virginia's state senate, received more than $600,000 from entities associated with Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\nTrump tweet How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation? \nTrump tweet FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!! \nWray told NBC that his commitment to \"doing things objectively and independently and by the book\" extends to \"personnel decisions and disciplinary decisions.\"\nBut McCabe, in an incendiary statement released Friday evening, said his experience provided an example \"of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.\"\nRead the full report on the upcoming interview from NBC News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T21:07:58.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
