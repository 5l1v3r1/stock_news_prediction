As we look ahead to 2018, we are focused on continuing to execute on our corporate initiatives as we drive loan growth and seek to deliver a consistent, competitive risk-adjusted return to stockholders.\"\nIn addition, the Company today also announced a series of actions designed to maximize stockholder value.

The increase in net loss was primarily the result of the following:\nSettlement expense recorded of approximately $2,627,000 related to the repurchase of 810,937 shares of Common Stock from Freestone in December 2017 and January 2018 pursuant to the Freestone settlement agreement. Income tax expense of approximately $1,952,000 in ZRV as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets from higher construction costs and lower expected gains from sales of assets in the future and due to a decrease in the Federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% in 2018 and beyond as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017, which required the Company to remeasure its deferred tax assets at the lower rate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $8,680,000 or $0.85 per fully-diluted common share as compared to net income of $24,410,000 or $2.38 per fully-diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of the following:\nThe sales of seven real estate properties during 2016 resulting in aggregate gain on sales of approximately $24,498,000 (or $20,782,000 net of $3,716,000 attributable to a non-controlling interest) as compared to gain on sales of approximately $14,729,000 from the sales of eight properties during 2017. Income tax benefit of $7,249,000 recorded during 2016 as a result of the transfer of two properties into ZRV and conversion of ZRV into a taxable REIT subsidiary during 2016. During 2017, the Company recorded income tax expense of $4,042,000 related to ZRV as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and a decrease in the Federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% in 2018 and beyond. Settlement expense recorded of $2,627,000 related to the repurchase of 810,937 shares of Common Stock from Freestone in December 2017 and January 2018 pursuant to the Freestone settlement agreement.\nQuarter End Loan Portfolio Summary\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nBy Property Type:\nCommercial\n$\n127,873,281\n$\n102,442,111\nResidential\n13,170,795\n19,001,677\nLand\n5,127,574\n8,238,523\n$\n146,171,650\n$\n129,682,311\nBy Position:\nSenior loans\n$\n142,782,492\n$\n126,873,673\nJunior loans\n3,389,158\n2,808,638\n$\n146,171,650\n$\n129,682,311\nCommercial loans by property type:\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nCommercial Real Estate Loans:\nOffice\n$\n29,480,103\n$\n33,608,898\nRetail\n32,329,395\n19,959,635\nStorage\n15,807,016\n13,015,175\nApartment\n24,582,181\n11,366,570\nHotel\n11,777,351\n9,567,143\nIndustrial\n2,690,000\n7,376,477\nWarehouse\n3,000,000\n—\nMarina\n3,580,000\n3,500,000\nAssisted care\n1,650,000\n1,328,213\nChurch\n—\n1,175,000\nGolf course\n1,212,851\n1,145,000\nRestaurant\n1,764,384\n400,000\n$\n127,873,281\n$\n102,442,111\nLoans by geographic location:\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nBalance\nPercentage\nBalance\nPercentage\nCalifornia\n$\n110,884,117\n75.86%\n$\n98,319,923\n75.81%\nArizona\n815,890\n0.56%\n4,655,517\n3.59%\nColorado\n4,380,616\n3.00%\n1,595,000\n1.23%\nHawaii\n1,450,000\n0.99%\n1,450,000\n1.12%\nIllinois\n1,364,384\n0.93%\n—\n—%\nIndiana\n388,793\n0.27%\n—\n—%\nMichigan\n10,714,764\n7.33%\n10,337,157\n7.97%\nNevada\n1,653,107\n1.13%\n3,669,584\n2.83%\nOhio\n3,755,000\n2.57%\n3,627,506\n2.80%\nTexas\n6,625,000\n4.53%\n6,027,624\n4.65%\nWashington\n3,159,460\n2.16%\n—\n—%\nWisconsin\n980,519\n0.67%\n—\n—%\n$\n146,171,650\n100.00%\n$\n129,682,311\n100.00%\nQuarter End Real Estate Property Portfolio\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding the Company's real estate portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nReal Estate Held for Sale:\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nResidential\n$\n24,627,710\n$\n—\nLand (including land under development)\n14,389,620\n73,140,659\nRetail\n7,632,893\n—\nGolf course\n1,999,449\n1,970,437\nMarina\n2,207,675\n—\nAssisted care\n5,253,125\n—\nOffice\n—\n732,539\n$\n56,110,472\n$\n75,843,635\nReal Estate Held for Investment:\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nRetail\n$\n16,623,238\n$\n16,829,995\nLand\n2,018,068\n4,234,806\nResidential\n2,356,995\n2,405,439\nAssisted care\n—\n5,820,709\nOffice\n3,357,352\n3,962,869\nMarina\n—\n4,025,945\n$\n24,355,653\n$\n37,279,763\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the results on Wednesday, March 14, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. PT / 1:00 p.m. ET.\nTo participate in the call, please dial (844) 850-0545 (United States) or (412) 317-5202 (International) and request the Owens Realty Mortgage call.
