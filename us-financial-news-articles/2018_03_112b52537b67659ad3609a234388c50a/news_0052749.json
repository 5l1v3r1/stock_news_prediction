REUTERS/Mike Blake/Illustration/File Photo \nBumble said it was seeking $400 million from Match, which owns popular dating app Tinder, because it obtained sensitive competitive information through deceptive means and has wrongfully disparaged its competitor in the investment market. \nThe lawsuit, filed in a Texas state court, comes two weeks after Match brought a lawsuit against Bumble alleging intellectual property infringement. \n“This lawsuit is a petulant and meritless response to our patent, trademark and trade secret claims,” Match said in a statement. “We obviously think their lawsuit has no substance and look forward to proving that in court.” \nWhitney Wolfe Herd, a co-founder of Tinder, left that company and co-founded Austin, Texas-based Bumble in 2014. \nWolfe Herd sued Tinder that year, alleging her co-founders at that company subjected her to sexual harassment. Tinder parent Match, which denied the allegations, paid about $1 million to settle the dispute. \nBoth Tinder and Bumble allow users to swipe right or left to signal their interest or lack of it in meeting prospective partners. \nUnlike Tinder, conversations on Bumble between heterosexual matches can only be initiated by women. \nDallas based Match made a $450 million offer to acquire Bumble in 2017, according to the lawsuit. Bumble said it turned down the offer, considering it to be a lowball bid. \nNegotiations stalled and Match sued Bumble on March 16, alleging patent and trademark infringement, as well as trade secrets misappropriation. \nMatch said Bumble has sought to mimic Tinder’s functionality “and build a business entirely on a Tinder-clone, distinguished only by Bumble’s women-talk-first marketing strategy.” \nBumble said in Wednesday’s lawsuit that Match’s legal action was a baseless attempt to harm Bumble by scaring away potential investors. \nBumble also said that during the acquisition talks Match induced the production of confidential information solely for “the financial benefit of its dating app businesses.” \nMatch also owns the dating services OkCupid and Meetic.
