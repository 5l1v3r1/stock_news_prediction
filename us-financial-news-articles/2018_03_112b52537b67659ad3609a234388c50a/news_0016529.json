Some 600 senior managers left the company after the initial restructuring.\nDIVIDEND BOOST? The strong performance in 2017 was driven by a jump in engine deliveries and higher maintenance volumes. Rolls also reported rising sales in its power systems business, which makes engines for use in trains, agriculture and mining.\n“We’re seeing this as an encouraging set of results,” East said.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said the performance should convince any investors still skeptical about East’s plans and the results raised hopes about the dividend, which the company had halved in 2016 to shore up its finances.\n“The chances of Rolls-Royce meaningfully increasing its returns to shareholders in the years to come look much better now,” he said.\nRolls paid out 11.7 pence per share for 2017, unchanged from the previous year.\nENGINE REPAIRS Rolls would take a hit of about 340 million pounds this year to account for the cost of carrying out repairs on existing engines, primarily the Trent 1000 installed on Boeing 787s.\n“Clearly the engine issues are significant,” said East.\n“However, we are being transparent with our customers, we’re being transparent with the market. We’re prioritizing resolving the situation for our customers. We have our arms around the solution.”\nRolls has said that 400 to 500 Trent 1000 engines were affected by problems with components wearing out earlier than expected, needing extra inspection and maintenance.\nAir New Zealand, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Japan’s ANA Holdings are amongst those affected.\nFor 2018, Rolls forecast group underlying operating profit of about 400 million pounds, give or take 100 million pounds. At the lower end of expectations that would represent a decline from its 2017 level of 321 million pounds.\nThat broad guidance was issued under a new accounting standard, which changes how the company books earnings on long-term contracts.\nAnother part of East’s turnaround plan is the potential sale of the Rolls-Royce’s loss-making commercial marine business, the part of the business which designs and makes equipment used in oil and gas extraction.\n“At this stage there’s no new news, we’ll update you when we’ve got something to talk about,” Chief Financial Officer Stephen Daintith told reporters, adding that the update could come in May at its annual meeting or in June at an investor day.\nReporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Paul Sandle and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T10:37:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
