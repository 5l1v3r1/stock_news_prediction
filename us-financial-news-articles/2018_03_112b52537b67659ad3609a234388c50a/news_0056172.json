We left too much space to our opponents and maybe we did not make enough efforts.”\nCaptain Hugo Loris, however, is confident that France, who won their only World Cup 20 years ago, will be ready on time.\n“What matters is our opening game against Australia on June 16,” he said.\n“Collectively, there is a big room for improvement. Whatever the system, what makes the difference in high-level football is the intensity you put into the games, the heart and the aggressiveness.”\n“Against Russia, we only played well for parts of the game. We had trouble putting intensity into the match, to put rhythm into it and we let them score in the second half while we wanted to get a clean sheet,” said striker Olivier Giroud.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T14:33:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
