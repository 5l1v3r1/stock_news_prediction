That demand has dragged down yield spreads.\n“The first quarter was all about one thing: loan spread compression – lower and tighter spreads,” said Michael Nechamkin, senior portfolio manager and co chief investment officer at Octagon.\nThree-month Libor, at 2.31%, has jumped from about 1.70% at the year’s start and is the highest since the financial crisis. One-month Libor at 1.88% is up from 1.56%.\n“Libor moved up so fast that despite the spread compression, the average coupon is still higher than three or six months ago,” Nechamkin said.\nWhile average leveraged loan spreads of 3.3% in the first quarter were the lowest since the third quarter of 2007, average yields jumped to 5.42% in the first quarter from 5.02% at the end of last year, LPC data show.\n“For the last six months loans have outperformed high-yield bonds consistently month after month for the first time in well over 10 years,” said John Fraser, head of Investcorp Credit Management US. “Loans have also dramatically outperformed investment-grade bonds.”\nCollateralized Loan Obligation funds, the biggest buyers of leveraged loans, could intensify their purchases, with more capital freed up now that they are exempt from “skin in the game” requirements to hold 5% of their funds’ risk.\nRetail investors, meantime, have pumped in a net US$3.5bn into loan funds this year through March 21, while yanking out almost US$19bn from high-yield bond funds, according to Lipper.\n“Loans do benefit from rising interest rates,” said Fraser. “Increases in Libor year to date have more than offset spread compression, so investors are realizing an improvement in yield and market prices have held up.”\nReporting By Lynn Adler; Editing By Michelle Sierra, Leela Parker Deo\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:11:16.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
