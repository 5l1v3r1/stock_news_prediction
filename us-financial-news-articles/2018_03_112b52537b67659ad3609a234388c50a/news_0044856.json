Atlanta officials said they have determined the hackers’ identity but declined to elaborate. City representatives were not immediately available for further comment.\nBottoms said only that the hackers entered the city’s digital system remotely as opposed having had internal access.\nRansomware is a type of malware that infects computers or computer networks and then freezes them, with the attackers demanding a ransom in order to restore services. The initial assault often comes via a phishing link that someone within the network opens on their email.\nAs the disruption in Atlanta persists, the city is losing out financially, Bottoms told an earlier news conference on Friday. It was unclear how much it stands to lose or when the city expects to get its computer system fully operational again.\nReporting by Laila Kearney in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T02:29:24.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
