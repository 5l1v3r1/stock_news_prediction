He joined Gyrus (later Gyrus ACMI) in 2001 as a Business Unit Director, where he was responsible for directing all activities in the company’s laparoscopic business, including the introduction of new electrosurgical products.

In this role, he assisted in the creation and implementation of Olympus’s product development, clinical and reimbursement strategies, overseeing departments including R&D, Clinical, Reimbursement, Program Management and Product and Procedure Development. Beginning in 2011, he served as Executive Director of Clinical Marketing of Olympus’s global surgical energy group, coordinating the company’s product development plans and providing clinical training and support for its global salesforce and physician customer base.\nBefore joining Olympus / Gyrus ACMI, Mr. Sanders worked for 13 years at Pfizer Valleylab in a variety of sales and marketing positions of increasing responsibility, culminating in his promotion to Director of Corporate Sales.

J-Plasma® utilizes a helium ionization process to produce a stable, focused beam of plasma that provides surgeons with greater precision, minimal invasiveness and an absence of conductive currents through the patient during surgery. The new J-Plasma® handpieces with Cool-Coag™ technology deliver the precision of helium plasma energy, the power of traditional monopolar coagulation and the efficiency of plasma beam coagulation - enabling thin-layer ablation and dissection and fast coagulation with a single instrument, minimizing instrument exchange and allowing a surgeon to focus on their patient and their procedures. With Cool-Coag technology, the new J-Plasma handpieces can deliver three distinctly different energy modalities - further increasing the utility and versatility of the J-Plasma system. Bovie Medical Corporation is also a leader in the manufacture of a range of electrosurgical products and technologies, marketed through both private labels and the Company’s own well-respected brands (Bovie®, IDS™ and DERM™) to distributors worldwide. The Company also leverages its expertise through original equipment manufacturing (OEM) agreements with other medical device manufacturers.
