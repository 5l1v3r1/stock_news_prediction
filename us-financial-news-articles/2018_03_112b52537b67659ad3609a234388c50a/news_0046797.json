REUTERS/Rafael Marchante The National Statistics Institute said on Monday that the deficit reflecting regular spending and revenue, without one-offs, narrowed to just 0.92 percent in 2017, the year when economic growth reached its strongest pace since the turn of the century, at 2.7 percent.\nIn 2016 Portugal had a deficit of 2 percent, the lowest in over four decades of its democratic history.\nThe gap this year is expected to total 1.1 percent, the INE said, confirming an earlier forecast by the government. It also said that the public debt should end this year at 123.1 percent of GDP, down from last year’s 125.7 percent.\nLast year, Portugal delivered the biggest cut in the debt-to-GDP ratio in 19 years, from almost 130 percent in 2016.\nThis is still a huge debt; the European Union wants it at, or heading down towards, 60 percent.\nBrussels last year removed Portugal from the list of the countries with excessive deficits although it knew about the 4 billion euro recapitalization of CGD, or Caixa Geral de Depositos, by the state worth 2 percent of GDP. The European Commission has itself used projections without the CGD impact.\nEuropean Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said earlier this month that if the 2017 deficit was not substantially higher than 3 percent and if it was expected to be clearly below 3 percent this year, then Portugal should avoid the renewal of the disciplinary process.\nPortugal exited an international bailout program in 2014 with many European officials holding the country up as a success story in reforming its economy. Last year, the country won back investment-grade credit ratings from two of the three largest rating agencies.\nThe complex CGD operation was needed to shore up Portugal’s largest bank by assets, which ended up with massive bad loans on its books following the country’s 2010-13 economic and financial crisis.\nReporting By Andrei Khalip; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-26T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T14:14:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
