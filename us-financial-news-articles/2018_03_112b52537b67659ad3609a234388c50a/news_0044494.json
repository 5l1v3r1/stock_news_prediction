The pods are designed to accommodate two or three people and come complete with beds and bathrooms. The pod can fit up to 100 people safely in the event of a tsunami. \nThe hotel expects to have the pod rooms available to rent by this summer. \nIn 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Japan triggered a tsunami.
