SSP (Chawrasia) held it for a couple of years there and I am so happy to get my name on the trophy.\n“I asked on 15 what the score was. I didn’t hit many great iron shots on the back nine but I knew where I stood. I like to know what I have to do,” added the 27-year-old.\nSharma, 21, had another final round to forget following last week’s collapse at the WGC-Mexico Championship, as the Indian went three-over 75 to finish at four-under along with Scotland’s Stephen Gallacher.\nKim Sihwan sealed third position on eight-under after carding an impressive 68 in the final round while Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal and Austrian Matthias Schwab were a shot behind at joint-fourth.\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T13:16:33.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
