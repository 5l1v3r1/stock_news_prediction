She accused him of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007, and later groping her in a Beverly Hills hotel at a meeting about a possible job.\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeatedly said at rallies and on Twitter that all accusations made by women after the \"Access Hollywood\" recording became public were \"lies.\"\nHe also republished on Twitter another a post that called Zervos' accusations a \"hoax.\"\nZervos said Trump's denials of her accusations amounted to defamation and that being branded a \"liar\" caused diners to stay away from her restaurant. Her lawsuit sought damages and an apology.\nIn allowing Zervos' case to go forward, Schecter cited a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court precedent allowing former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones to pursue a sexual harassment case against then-President Bill Clinton to proceed. That paved the way for Clinton's impeachment the following year.\nTrump's legal team had argued the Jones decision applied only to federal courts and that Trump's campaign statements were political speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\nBut the judge said any listener, recognizing that Trump knew \"exactly what transpired,\" could reasonably believe based on his statements that Zervos was \"contemptible\" because she had \"fabricated\" events for personal gain.\n\"In their context, defendant's repeated statements ... cannot be characterized simply as opinion, heated rhetoric or hyperbole,\" Schecter wrote.\nThe case is Zervos v Trump, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 150522/2017.
