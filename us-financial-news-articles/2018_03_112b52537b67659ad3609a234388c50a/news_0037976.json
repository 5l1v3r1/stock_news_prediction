In addition to PNH, we are focused on advancing Coversin into Phase II trials in the first half of 2018 in our other key disease targets involving both the complement and leukotriene pathways, the eye disease atopic keratoconjuntivitis (AKC) and the skin disorder bullous pemphigoid (BP), both of which are orphan indications with significant unmet need. We are also continuing our Phase II trial of Coversin in patients with aHUS, which commenced in late 2017. Additionally, we are advancing Coversin SC in a patient-convenient auto-injector pen device, and are advancing Coversin in topical eye-drops for AKC, and a long-acting formulation. Having ended 2017 with good momentum, 2018 is set to be an exciting year for the company as we work towards commercializing treatments for orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\"\nClinical Development Programs Highlights\nComplement Program\nParoxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)\nRegulatory clearance recently received in Europe to open the first clinical trial site for CAPSTONE, the Phase III trial of Coversin in PNH patients who have not previously been treated with a complement inhibitor, in patient-convenient SC dosing.\nPrimary endpoint met in Phase II COBALT clinical trial of Coversin™ for patients with PNH who have never received a complement blocking therapy. The last three patients enrolled into the trial on the new dosing regimen of 45 mg per day saw a more rapid decline in LDH than those in the original dosing regimen.\nThe 45mg dosing regimen is the intended dose for the Phase III PNH trials of Coversin discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2017.\nSeven of the eight enrolled patients in the Phase II COBALT trial completed the 90-day trial. 1 These patients continue to be evaluated in a long-term safety study, CONSERVE, and have been receiving Coversin subcutaneously for between 5 to 14 months. To date there have been no drug-related serious adverse events reported and patients are self-administering.\nFDA granted Fast Track designation for Coversin for treatment of PNH in patients who have polymorphisms conferring eculizumab resistance.\nAtypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)\nA Phase II clinical trial for Coversin in aHUS was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDual C5 and Leukotriene B4 Program\nAtopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and Bullous Pemphigoid (BP)\nThe Company anticipates the start of two Phase II clinical trials, in the inflammatory-mediated eye disorder AKC and in the skin inflammatory disease BP, in the first half of 2018. In AKC, Coversin expected to be delivered in a topical eye drop formulation.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash position: As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $28.1 million, as compared to cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $44.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses: R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $7.1 million as compared to $6.6 million in the same quarter the prior year. R&D expenses for full year 2017 were $23.3 million, as compared to $17.3 million for the prior year. These increases were due primarily to expenses associated with the expanded clinical trial programs.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses: G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $3.7 million, as compared to $3.3 million in the same quarter last year, and, for the full year 2017, $11.7 million as compared to $9.9 million in 2016. These increases were due primarily to higher legal, accounting and professional service fees, and increased personnel and recruiting expenses, offset by lower share-based compensation expense.\nNet loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.3 million compared to a net loss of $8.3 million for the same period in 2016. Net loss for full year 2017 was $32.6 million, compared to $18.1 million for full year 2016. These year over year increases in net loss were due primarily to higher R&D and G&A expenses in 2017.\nGuidance\nBased on its current cash position and operating plan, the Company expects that it has sufficient cash to fund operations into the second quarter of 2019. This estimate assumes no additional funding from new partnership agreements or debt or equity financing events.\n1 For the seven patients that completed the study, LDH as a multiple of ULN (xULN) was 1.4, 2.2, 2.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.6 and 1.3 at day 28; 1.5, 2.1, 1.8, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4 and 2.2 at day 60; and 1.6, 2.4, 2.0, 1.9, 1.2, 1.5 and 2.5 at day 90.\nConference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET today to review the Company's fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. The call can be accessed by dialing (844) 461-9933 or (636) 812-6633 (international), and referencing conference ID 2096211.

Akari's lead drug candidate Coversin™ is a C5 complement inhibitor currently being evaluated in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In addition to its C5 inhibitory activity, Coversin independently and specifically inhibits leukotriene B4 (LTB4) activity. Akari intends to evaluate Coversin in two conditions, the skin and eye diseases bullous pemphigoid and atopic keratoconjunctivitis, where the dual action of Coversin on both C5 and LTB4 may be beneficial. Akari is also developing other tick derived proteins, including long acting versions.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
