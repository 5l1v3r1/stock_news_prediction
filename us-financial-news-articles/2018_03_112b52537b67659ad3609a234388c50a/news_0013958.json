So far in 2018 we have completed one well, are completing another well, and have spud and reached total depth on another well\n25% increase in year-end reserves, an increase of 37.5 Bcfe\n55% increase in SEC PV-10 value of year-end reserves, an increase of $91.1 million\nIncreased commodity price hedge protection to approximately 28% of forecasted PDP gas production and 69% of forecasted PDP oil production for 2018, and to 38% of forecasted PDP oil production for 2019\nSummary Fourth Quarter Financial Results\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million, or $(0.23) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $16.8 million, or $(0.69) per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. Last year’s quarter was negatively impacted by a commodity price driven impairment charge of $6.3 million compared to a current quarter impairment charge of $0.4 million. The impairment charge for the current quarter was related to the partial impairment of an unused offshore platform in onshore storage and impairment of our Tuscaloosa Marine Shale properties, while the impairment for the prior year quarter was related to non-core undeveloped acreage that we were not likely to drill prior to expiration. Average weighted shares outstanding were approximately 24.8 million and 24.6 million for the current and prior year quarters, respectively.\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined below, of approximately $10.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $8.2 million for the same period last year. The improvement was attributable to $1.7 million more in realized proceeds from derivatives and $1.9 million less in cash G&A costs, offset in part by a $1.6 million decrease in revenues from lower production.\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $20 million compared to $21.7 million for the same period last year, a decrease attributable to lower production during the current quarter and a 4% decrease in natural gas prices, partially offset by a 20% and 38% increase in crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, respectively.\nAs previously reported, production for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately 4.8 Bcfe, or 51.8 Mmcfe per day, compared to 64.3 Mmcfe per day for the fourth quarter of 2016, and within our previously provided guidance. This expected decrease in production can be attributed to the addition of only five new producing wells since the initiation of our drilling program in the Southern Delaware Basin beginning in late 2016. We also experienced cold weather shut-ins in some of our West Texas properties during the month of December. Crude oil and natural gas liquids production during the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately 2,700 barrels per day, or 31.5% of total production, compared to approximately 3,080 barrels per day, or 28.8% of total production, in the fourth quarter of 2016, a decline related to the slower than planned pace of bringing on new production in our Southern Delaware Basin program. Our first quarter 2018 production guidance is 50 – 55 Mmcfed, though we expect to commence production on two new wells in March and April.\nThe weighted average equivalent sales price during the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4.20 per Mcfe, compared to $3.66 per Mcfe for the same period last year. As previously noted, stronger prices for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and a higher percentage of liquids in the production mix, contributed to the weighted average increase.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $7.0 million, or $1.47 per Mcfe, compared to $6.3 million, or $1.07 per Mcfe, for the same period last year. Included in operating expenses are lease operating expenses, transportation and processing costs, workover expenses and production and ad valorem taxes. Operating expenses exclusive of production and ad valorem taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $6.4 million, or $1.34 per Mcfe, compared to approximately $5.9 million, or $1.00 per Mcfe, for the same period last year, and below our previously provided guidance for the quarter. The increase is due to accruing higher minimum volume charges for an ongoing throughput deficiency in our Madisonville Field.\nDD&A expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $11.5 million, or $2.42 per Mcfe, compared to $13.7 million, or $2.32 per Mcfe, for the same period last year, a decrease primarily attributable to lower production during the quarter.\nImpairment and abandonment expense from oil and gas properties was $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Of this amount, $0.1 million related to the partial impairment of an unused offshore platform in onshore storage and $0.3 million related to revised estimated reserves for our Tuscaloosa Marine Shale properties. For the same period last year, impairment and abandonment expense from oil and gas properties was $6.3 million which related to the impairment of undeveloped leases in non-core areas.\nG&A expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $5.5 million, or $1.16 per Mcfe, compared to $8.0 million, or $1.36 per Mcfe, for the prior year quarter. G&A expenses for the current and prior year quarters include $1.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in non-cash stock compensation expense. Other items contributing to the decrease in G&A costs for the current quarter were lower bonus accruals for the 2017 performance period and lower insurance and office costs for the current quarter. For the first quarter of 2018, we have provided guidance of $4.5 million to $5.0 million for general and administrative expenses, exclusive of non-cash stock compensation (“Cash G&A”).\nGain from affiliates for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $0.2 million, compared to a loss from affiliates of $0.3 million for the same period last year, both associated with our 37% equity interest in Exaro Energy III.\n2018 Capital Program & Liquidity\nCapital costs incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $13.6 million, which was primarily related to our Southern Delaware Basin acreage in Pecos County, Texas. As previously reported, we have budgeted to invest approximately $52 million in 2018 to continue to develop that area with a one rig program. We expect that program to be funded by internally generated cash flow, proceeds from non-core asset sales and/or temporary borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We will continue to monitor commodity prices, drilling results and service/supply costs during the year, and if deemed appropriate, may make adjustments to our drilling strategy for the remainder of the year\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $85.4 million of debt outstanding under our credit facility, provides for a borrowing base of $115 million through May 1, 2018.\n2017 Year End Reserves\nAs previously disclosed in our March 5, 2018 release on reserves and production, proved reserves at December 31, 2017, as estimated by William M. Cobb & Associates, Inc. and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., Contango’s independent petroleum engineering firms, in accordance with reserve reporting guidelines mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), were 189.3 Bcfe, a 25% increase over our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, consisting of 105.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas, 3.4 million barrels of crude oil, and 4.4 million barrels of natural gas liquids. As of December 31, 2017, the SEC PV-10 value of our proved reserves was approximately $257.3 million, compared to $166.2 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, 48% of our proved reserves were natural gas and 65% were proved developed.\nThe following table summarizes Contango’s total proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 (1) :\nPresent Value OIL NGL Gas Total Discounted Category (MBbl) (MBbl) (Mmcf) (Mmcfe) at 10% ($000) Developed 3,364 3,596 82,133 123,895 200,723 Undeveloped 7,285 2,011 9,586 65,359 56,560 Total Proved 10,649 5,607 91,719 189,254 257,283 These estimates do not include net reserves of approximately 30.7 Bcfe (PV-10 of approximately $24.4 million) attributable to our 37% equity ownership investment in Exaro as of December 31, 2017.\nDerivative Instruments\nAs previously disclosed in our March 5, 2018 operations update, we took advantage of rising commodity prices and added additional minimum price protection for our forecasted monthly production volumes and now have the following financial derivative contracts in place with members of our bank group. These contracts represent approximately 28% of our currently forecasted 2018 PDP natural gas production; 69% of our currently forecasted 2018 PDP crude oil production and 38% of our currently forecasted 2019 PDP oil production.\nCommodity Period Derivative Volume/Month Price/Unit Natural Gas Jan – July 2018 Swap 370,000 MMbtu $3.07 (1) Aug – Oct 2018 Swap 70,000 MMbtu $3.07 (1) Nov – Dec 2018 Swap 320,000 MMbtu $3.07 (1) Crude Oil Jan - Jun 2018 Swap 20,000 Bbls $56.40 (2) Jul – Oct 2018 Collar 20,000 Bbls $52.00 x $56.85 (2) Nov – Dec 2018 Collar 15,000 Bbls $52.00 x $56.85 (2) Jan – Dec 2018 Collar 2,000 Bbls $52.00 x $58.76 (3) Jan – Jul 2018 Collar 6,000 Bbls $58.00 x $68.00 (2) Nov – Dec 2018 Collar 5,000 Bbls $58.00 x $68.00 (2) Jan – Dec 2019 Collar 7,000 Bbls $50.00 x $58.00 (2) Jan – Dec 2019 Collar 4,000 Bbls $52.00 x $59.45 (3) Based on Henry Hub NYMEX natural gas prices Based on Argus/LLS oil prices Based on West Texas Intermediate oil prices\nSelected Financial and Operating Data\nThe following table reflects certain comparative financial and operating data for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree Months Ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 % 2017 2016 % Offshore Volumes Sold: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 21 31 -32 % 99 137 -28 % Natural gas (Mmcf) 2,571 3,369 -24 % 11,189 14,211 -21 % Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 76 97 -22 % 330 420 -21 % Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 3,154 4,137 -24 % 13,762 17,552 -22 % Onshore Volumes Sold: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 109 96 14 % 419 460 -9 % Natural gas (Mmcf) 689 846 -19 % 2,721 3,892 -30 % Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 44 60 -27 % 187 296 -37 % Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 1,610 1,779 -9 % 6,361 8,430 -25 % Total Volumes Sold: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 130 127 2 % 518 597 -13 % Natural gas (Mmcf) 3,260 4,215 -23 % 13,910 18,103 -23 % Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 120 157 -24 % 517 716 -28 % Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 4,764 5,916 -19 % 20,123 25,982 -23 % Daily Sales Volumes: Oil and condensate (Mbbls) 1.4 1.4 2 % 1.4 1.6 -13 % Natural gas (Mmcf) 35.4 45.8 -23 % 38.1 49.5 -23 % Natural gas liquids (Mbbls) 1.3 1.7 -24 % 1.4 2.0 -28 % Natural gas equivalents (Mmcfe) 51.8 64.3 -19 % 55.1 71.0 -23 % Average sales prices: Oil and condensate (per Bbl) $ 55.30 $ 46.08 20 % $ 48.90 $ 38.52 27 % Natural gas (per Mcf) $ 2.87 $ 2.98 -4 % $ 2.97 $ 2.42 23 % Natural gas liquids (per Bbl) $ 28.59 $ 20.76 38 % $ 22.97 $ 15.79 45 % Total (per Mcfe) $ 4.20 $ 3.66 15 % $ 3.90 $ 3.01 30 %\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 % 2017 2016 % Offshore Selected Costs ($ per Mcfe) Lease operating expenses (1) $ 0.61 $ 0.66 -8 % $ 0.72 $ 0.60 20 % Production and ad valorem taxes $ 0.06 $ 0.05 20 % $ 0.06 $ 0.07 -14 % Onshore Selected Costs ($ per Mcfe) Lease operating expenses (1) $ 2.78 $ 1.77 57 % $ 2.32 $ 1.81 28 % Production and ad valorem taxes $ 0.25 $ 0.13 92 % $ 0.28 $ 0.25 12 % Average Selected Costs ($ per Mcfe) Lease operating expenses (1) $ 1.34 $ 1.00 34 % $ 1.22 $ 1.00 22 % Production and ad valorem taxes $ 0.12 $ 0.07 71 % $ 0.13 $ 0.13 0 % General and administrative expense (cash) $ 0.83 $ 1.00 -17 % $ 0.90 $ 0.78 15 % Interest expense $ 0.27 $ 0.13 108 % $ 0.20 $ 0.15 33 % Adjusted EBITDAX (2) (thousands) $ 10,213 $ 8,159 $ 35,087 $ 30,142 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding (thousands) Basic 24,757 24,563 24,686 21,424 Diluted 24,757 24,563 24,686 21,424 LOE includes transportation and workover expenses.

Adjusted EBITDAX represents EBITDAX as further adjusted to reflect the items set forth in the table below, all of which will be required in determining our compliance with financial covenants under our credit facility.\nWe have included EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX in this release to provide investors with a supplemental measure of our operating performance and information about the calculation of some of the financial covenants that are contained in our credit agreement. We believe EBITDAX is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and so highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use EBITDAX in the evaluation of companies, many of which present EBITDAX when reporting their results. Adjusted EBITDAX is a material component of the covenants that are imposed on us by our credit agreement. We are subject to financial covenant ratios that are calculated by reference to Adjusted EBITDAX. Non-compliance with the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in a default, an acceleration in the repayment of amounts outstanding and a termination of lending commitments. Our management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, also use EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX to assess:\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\nthe ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness;\nour operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing or capital structure; and\nthe feasibility of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\nEBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX are not presentations made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. As discussed above, we believe that the presentation of EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX in this release is appropriate. However, when evaluating our results, you should not consider EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX in isolation of, or as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance as determined in accordance with GAAP, such as net income (loss). EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX have material limitations as performance measures because they exclude items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. Because other companies may calculate EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX differently than we do, EBITDAX may not be, and Adjusted EBITDAX as presented in this release is not, comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net loss $ (5,578 ) $ (16,844 ) $ (17,643 ) $ (58,029 ) Interest expense 1,278 757 4,100 3,802 Income tax provision (benefit) (792 ) (68 ) (395 ) 342 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 11,537 13,737 47,215 63,323 Exploration expense 416 728 1,106 1,816 EBITDAX $ 6,861 $ (1,690 ) $ 34,383 $ 11,254 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative instruments $ 1,593 $ 1,046 $ (2,204 ) $ 3,446 Non-cash stock-based compensation charges 1,540 2,142 6,100 6,457 Impairment of oil and gas properties 385 6,301 1,785 10,438 Loss (gain) on sale of assets and investment in affiliates (166 ) 360 (4,977 ) (1,453 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 10,213 $ 8,159 $ 35,087 $ 30,142 Guidance for First Quarter 2018\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for the first calendar quarter of 2018.\nProduction 50,000 - 55,000 Mcfe per day LOE (including transportation and workovers) $6.4 million - $6.9 million Production and ad valorem taxes (% of Revenue) 3.0 - 3.5% Cash G&A $4.5 million - $5.0 million DD&A Rate $2.30 - $2.55 Teleconference Call\nContango management will hold a conference call to discuss the information described in this press release on Friday, March 9, 2018 at 9:30am Central Standard Time.
