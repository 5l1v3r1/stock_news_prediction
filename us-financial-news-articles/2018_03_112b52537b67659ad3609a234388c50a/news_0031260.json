The fires, believed to have been sparked by lightning on Saturday, were fanned by dry, hot winds as temperatures reached 41 C (106 F) throughout Sunday. Emergency officials said conditions should ease on Monday but “watch and act” warnings remained in place for five locations. Up to 35 homes and a school were destroyed in the small coastal town of Tathra in New South Wales, authorities said, where people fled to the beach to avoid the flames. Evacuation centers have been set up and several schools in affected areas were closed on Monday.
