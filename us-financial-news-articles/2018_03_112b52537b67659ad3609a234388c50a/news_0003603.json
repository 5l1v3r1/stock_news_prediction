We are seeing pretty strong global growth and demand,” said Jacqui Douglas, chief European macro strategist at TD Securities.\nFactories across the euro zone are still enjoying their best growth spell in almost two decades which, alongside price pressures at a near seven-year high, will be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank as they move closer to unwinding their ultra-easy monetary policy.\nIHS Markit’s final manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)for the euro zone fell to 58.6 in February from 59.6, just pipping an earlier flash estimate of 58.5 and comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.\nThat robust growth came even though a sub-index measuring output prices rose to 58.4 from 58.0, its highest reading since April 2011.\nDespite a marked upturn in orders, Britain’s factory PMI inched down to 55.2 in February, its second-lowest reading since June 2016’s Brexit vote though a shade above the average forecast of 55.0 in a Reuters poll.\nTaken at face value, the figures suggest British factory output growth so far this year has slowed to a three-monthly rate of 0.4 percent compared with a robust 1.3 percent in the last three months of 2017, IHS Markit said.\n“Growth in the manufacturing sector is moderating, now that the recovery in the euro zone has started to lose a little pace and more than 18 months have elapsed since sterling’s huge depreciation,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\nSurveys from the United States later on Thursday are expected to confirm the strong momentum in global trade.\nFederal Reserve chief Jerome Powell, in his first public appearance since talking the helm at the U.S. central bank, said this week he aimed to prevent the economy from overheating, cementing market expectations for three or four interest rate increases this year.\nOther central banks such as the Bank of England and Bank of Canada have already raised interest rates and the ECB is widely expected to shut down its money printing presses by the end of 2018.\nA worker fixes a hose on substation for liquid paint in the factory Helios in Kolicevo May 29, 2013.

REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo State-owned firms service China’s domestic demand more and their weaker showing may point to weakness stemming from property-cooling measures, higher interest rates and tougher rules against risky financing, factors expected to weigh throughout the year.\nGovernment measures to reduce pollution over the winter have also led to cuts in production, economists said, while the Lunar New Year holidays disrupted activity, suggesting the slowdown in some of the economies could be temporary.\n“These numbers imply that the low reading is likely driven by holiday effects, rather than by any underlying slowdown in coming manufacturing activity,” said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.\nEXPORT HITS Manufacturing was a relative bright spot for Britain’s economy late last year but growth in overseas orders slowed to its weakest in four months in February.\nJapanese manufacturing expanded at a slightly slower pace in February as a stronger yen weighed on new export orders and Taiwan’s factory growth was the slowest in four months, although both economies still posted relatively solid numbers.\nSouth Korea’s export growth slowed in February to its weakest in more than a year.\nThe Japanese yen is currently trading around its strongest in more than a year, the Korean won in more than three years and the Taiwanese dollar in more than five.\n“For Asia, the strength of the currencies will have some impact but generally how growth in the G3 economies fares is more important,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.\n“We should continue to see a strong momentum in exports going into the second half, when base effects come into play,” Goh said, cautioning against reading to much into the holiday-distorted numbers.\nEditing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T07:46:51.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
