We will have to protect our industry with rebalancing measures, safeguard,” she added when asked if she would consider taking the dispute to the international trade regulator.\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday pressed ahead with import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminium but exempted Canada and Mexico and offered the possibility of excluding other allies, backtracking from an earlier “no-exceptions” stance.
