Social enterprise should be recognized in that category,” said Englebrook.\nShe doesn’t think the political climate for social entrepreneurs in the United States has shifted since President Donald Trump took office.\n“I don’t know if social enterprise is on (his) radar ... (but) I have no reason to think it is because he hasn’t said anything about it,” Englebrook said.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
