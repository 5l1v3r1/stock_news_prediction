(AGT), a leading gene and cell therapy company, today congratulates Robert R. Redfield, M.D., on his appointment as the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nDr. Redfield has served as an advisor to AGT since 2011 and later became chair of the Clinical Advisory Board for its HIV Cure Program . In these roles at AGT, he provided input and guidance for developing the AGT103-T cell product for HIV, helping AGT with trial design, site selection, FDA communications, Data Safety and Monitoring Board recruitment, and many other tasks needed to advance the company toward its IND submission and clinical trial launch. Dr. Redfield has resigned his AGT position to become the Director of the CDC.\n“We are proud to have had the opportunity to work with someone of Bob’s caliber and are very glad that his skill and experience has been recognized by the President,” said David Pauza, Chief Science Officer of AGT. “The country will benefit enormously from his service as CDC Director. His inspirational leadership, compassion, and deep insight into medicine will be an invaluable asset to the agency. While we will miss Bob’s input, he has already helped guide AGT to a transitional point in clinical development of our HIV cure program.\"\nIn response to his new appointment, Jeff Galvin, Chief Executive Officer of AGT remarked, “Dr. Redfield has been a significant contributor to our HIV gene therapy cure program, enabling us to accelerate the project towards an IND submission, which we anticipate occurring in mid-2018. Although we will miss his wisdom and insight, we are delighted that he is moving to this critical public service position where he will help protect Americans and others across the globe from infectious diseases. We thank Dr. Redfield for his contributions to AGT and wish him the best as the head of the CDC.”\nAmerican Gene Technologies\nAGT is an emerging gene and cell therapeutics company with a proprietary lentiviral platform capable of broad applications including: large and orphan indications, infectious disease, immune-oncology, and monogenic disorders. AGT expects to take its lead candidate for HIV Cure into the clinic in 2018, and is also pioneered a novel immuno-oncology approach of stimulating gamma-delta (γδ) T cells to attack a variety of cancers. Two key patents in AGT’s novel immuno-oncology approach have already been granted, and AGT has a diverse portfolio of patent filings surrounding key tools and components in viral vectors, gene therapy, and regenerative medicine.\nMore information can be found at www.americangene.com .\nAmerican Gene Technologies Contact:\nC.
