( OTCQB:TPNL ), a vertically integrated provider of innovative prepaid card programs and processing services for corporate, consumer and government applications, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are very pleased with our 2017 results. We recorded record revenue, increased our cardholder base significantly, and increased our net profits,” said Mark Newcomer, Chief Executive Officer, 3PEA International. “We are executing on our strategy focused on expanding both the PaySign brand and our cardholder base in existing markets as we continue to build our sales team. In 2017, there were over 1,550,000 PaySign cardholders nationwide. We are extremely optimistic as we continue to experience a robust sales pipeline in both new and existing markets.”\n“2017 was a breakthrough year for 3PEA,” said Brian Polan, Chief Financial Officer, 3PEA International. “The Company successfully grew revenues and net profit, maintained gross margins, increased its cash flow from operations, and continued to operate debt free.”\n2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $15,234,091, an increase of $4,817,419 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, when revenues were $10,416,672. The increase in revenue approximating 46% was primarily due to an increase in the number of new corporate incentive prepaid card products and growth within our existing card products.\nGross profit in 2017 increased to $6.7 million, or 44.0% of total revenues, compared to $4.5 million, or 43.6% of total revenues in 2016. The Company expects gross profit margins will improve in 2018.\nTotal operating expenses in 2017 were $4.9 million compared to $3.2 million in 2016. The increase was due to increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization as we continued to add administrative staff, invest in infrastructure, and build out our Sales, Marketing and Business Development departments.\nNet income in 2017 was $1.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share in 2016.\nCompany Update\nIn 2018, the Company’s revenue focus will be to increase our footprint in our existing markets, expand our product and services offerings to existing cardholders, while aggressively targeting new, high margin business in new markets and geographies. Recent investments in sales and marketing have resulted in the most robust sales pipeline in the company’s history. For 2018, the Company believes it will experience growth rates comparable to, or better than, those experienced in 2017 as a result of growth in our existing card products and the expected addition of new card products in various market verticals. The Company expects gross profit margins to see improvement in 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had over 1,550,000 PaySign Cardholders participating in 205 card products and continues to increase the number of card products in its portfolio.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, The Company has begun taking the necessary steps to meet the various requirements to apply for uplisting to a national exchange.\nAbout 3PEA International\n3PEA International ( OTCQB:TPNL ) is an experienced and trusted prepaid debit card payment solutions provider as well as an integrated payment processor.
