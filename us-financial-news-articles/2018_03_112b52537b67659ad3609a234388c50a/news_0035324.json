On a more positive note, the Welsh side are 14th in the league, three points above the drop zone after losing just one of their last eight matches and Bartley is keen to continue that run. “We have to focus on the Premier League now and make sure we get the right amount of points to stay up,” Bartley told the club’s website (www.swanseacity.com). “There are a few tired minds and bodies. The players have played a lot of minutes, so it’s time to recharge... “We’ve got eight cup finals so, hopefully, we can remain confident and go into our next match trying to get three points.” Carlos Carvalhal’s side face three of the league’s top five sides in their next five games, starting with a trip to second-placed Manchester United on March 31.
