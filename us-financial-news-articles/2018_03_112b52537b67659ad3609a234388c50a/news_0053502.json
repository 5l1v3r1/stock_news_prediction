Nearly one year into his tenure, Mr. Pearce has set strict financial targets and pledged to stick to one big project at a time. So far, Anglo American’s capital spending is down to $2.2 billion in 2017, from a high of $6.1 billion in 2013.\nThe laser focus on costs comes after some hard lessons. Anglo American notched four straight years of losses starting in 2012, posting its largest net loss of $5.6 billion in 2015. The company had plowed billions into multiple large projects during the tail end of the yearslong commodities boom. But as the price of copper, coal, iron ore and other resources plunged to multiyear lows, Anglo American was forced to shed assets and write down billions from the value of its mines.\n“We are fundamentally different from what we used to be,” Mr. Pearce said in an interview with CFO Journal.\nAnglo American has continued to reduce net debt, which totaled $4.5 billion at the end of 2017, down from $8.5 billion at the end of 2016. The company also slashed head count by 45% between 2012 and 2017 to around 69,000, cutting about 11,000 positions throughout 2017 alone.\n“We are running a more conservative balance sheet now,” said Mr. Pearce. That means not getting “too excited if today’s [commodity] prices are high,” but to think about where commodity prices will be in 30 or 40 years from today.\nMr. Pearce is continuing the efforts to curb costs and spending instilled by his predecessor René Médori. The London-based mining company expects to reduce costs by $3 billion to $4 billion annually between 2018 and 2022, in part by squeezing the existing assets harder, Mr. Pearce said. He previously served as finance chief at Australian mining company Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. , a role he held since March 2010.\nThe company currently has 36 assets in 13 countries, down from 68 at the end of 2013.\n“If you overextend the balance sheet, it can take you a couple of years [to recover] and you will miss out,” Mr. Pearce said.\nThe miner set strict financial targets after those immediate rescue measures. Anglo American aims to keep net debt at 1.0 times to 1.5 times to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization during a prolonged period of low commodity prices. Anglo American’s net debt to ebitda ratio was 0.5 times as of Dec. 31, 2017, compared with a high of 2.6 times on Dec. 31, 2015.\nThe finance chief’s efforts are bearing fruit. Earnings rose 48% to $3.3 billion at the end of 2017, compared with $2.2 billion at the prior year end.\nThe company’s improved results are getting attention from shareholders. Volcan Investments Ltd., the firm’s largest shareholder, last September said it was “encouraged by the performance of Anglo American” and planned to increase its stake.\nVolcan currently holds 19.35% of Anglo American’s outstanding shares, up from 11.44% in September, according to FactSet.\nMany analysts also consider the restructuring successful. “Anglo American has done an exceptionally good job in fixing its balance sheet,” said Christopher LaFemina, a mining analyst at Jefferies LLC.\nA rebound in commodity prices is also lending Anglo American a helping hand. Commodity prices are up 17% from last year, according to a basket of raw materials tracked by the S&P GSCI index.\nAnalysts expect the rally in resource prices to continue. Platinum, which accounts for around 17% of Anglo American’s revenue, is forecast to reach $1,012.77 a troy ounce, up 6.8% from $948 an ounce in 2017, according to IHS Markit. Thermal coal is primed for a 19% jump to $104.10 a metric ton, but iron ore prices are forecast to pull back 3.4% to $68.54 a metric ton.\nBut when commodities prices next turn lower, Mr. Pearce is confidence Anglo American’s efforts to keep down costs make the company better prepared to ride out the rough patch. “We have the right building blocks in place,” he said.\nAt Quellaveco, the large copper deposit in southern Peru that will cost roughly $5 billion to develop, the miner is searching for a syndication partner to shoulder costs. Anglo American is looking to reduce its current 82% stake to around 50% to 70%, a spokesman said. The remaining 18% is owned by Mitsubishi Corp.\nTrucks used to haul ore will run an average 6,000 hours a year instead of 4,500 hours, generating additional savings, said Mr. Pearce. Anglo American also wants to use less water and energy and overhaul the operation of its mines. “Cents ultimately become dollars,” Mr. Pearce said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T00:04:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
