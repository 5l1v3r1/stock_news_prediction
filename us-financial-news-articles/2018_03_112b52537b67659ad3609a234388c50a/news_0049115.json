The adults, as well as the accompanied children, will be sent back to their home countries.\nLast month, 103 Central Americans, including 36 minors, were rescued from an abandoned truck in the violent northern state of Tamaulipas, where migrants often attempt illegal border crossings.\nIn July, 10 people died after a truck stuffed with more than 100 Guatemalan and Mexican migrants was abandoned in a Texas parking lot.\nReporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-30T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T21:27:33.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
