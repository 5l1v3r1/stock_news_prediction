These recent raises bring the total financing round close to $44 million.\nThe funding will be used to fully develop the company's lead molecule, OTL38, in ovarian and lung cancers as well as introduce an additional molecule into the clinic. Coincident with the closing, Aaron Davidson, an H.I.G. BioHealth Partners Managing Director has joined the board of directors of On Target Laboratories.\n\"With our lead candidate OTL38 and our pipeline of tumor-targeting dyes, we can enhance a surgeon's ability to see diseased tissue and are seeking to improve outcomes for patients in all major cancers,\" commented Martin Low, CEO of On Target Laboratories. \"This substantial investment exceeded our expectations. The raise led by Johnson & Johnson Innovation â€“ JJDC, Inc. in September 2017 was for $32.5 million with an additional $7.5 million guaranteed if there were no additional investors. The second close of $11.1 million completes the financing with $3.6 million raised above the $7.5 million goal. This newest investment from H.I.G. BioHealth Partners, Elevate Ventures and Helsinn shows the great confidence healthcare investors have in our company and this technology.\"\nWedbush served as exclusive strategic adviser and placement agent to On Target Laboratories in connection with the financing.\nAbout OTL38\nOTL38, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial in ovarian cancer and a phase 2 clinical trial in lung cancer, is given to patients intravenously before surgery. In ovarian cancer surgery studies, OTL38 is being evaluated for its ability to help surgeons locate and remove hard-to-find cancerous lesions that are often widespread. Similarly, in clinical trials of OTL38 in lung cancer surgery, On Target Laboratories is evaluating whether OTL38 allows surgeons to better locate smaller nodules, synchronous lesions and positive margins.\nAbout On Target Laboratories, Inc.\nOn Target Laboratories Inc., is in the business of discovering, developing and commercializing small molecules that, when conjugated with fluorescent dyes, target and illuminate specific cancerous cells and other diseased tissue. These conjugates can be used by doctors, including surgeons, worldwide to better diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases from cancer to inflammation-related disorders. OTL38 is currently under clinical development for use in ovarian and lung cancer surgery. For more information visit www.ontargetlaboratories.com .\nAbout H.I.G. BioHealth Partners\nH.I.G.
