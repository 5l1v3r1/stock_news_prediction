In January, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg had announced the changes here that first rolled out in the United States and would expand to a global audience. The changes come amid allegations that the British consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to Facebook users’ information to build profiles of American voters that were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016. Facebook also faces criticism that its algorithms may have prioritized misleading news in people’s feeds.
