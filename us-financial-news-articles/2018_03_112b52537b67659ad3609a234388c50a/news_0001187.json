Tan, the president of the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association (SSIA), told Reuters on the sidelines of the 2018 SSIA summit.\n“Right now these two months, you will see some softness depending on the market segment. I think automotive continued to be strong. Those that apply to the consumer market, like handsets...there’s a little bit of a slowdown,” Tan said.\n“When you compare it with a very good (performance) last year, this year will not be as good, but there will be growth,” said Tan, who declined to give a specific forecast.\nSpeaking at the same event, Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon said growth in the broader Singapore electronics industry was also likely to moderate this year.\n“In 2017, output of the electronics cluster grew by more than 30 percent compared to 2016, supported by strong growth in the semiconductors segment which made up close to two-thirds of the electronics manufacturing GDP,” Koh said.\n“With demand in the global electronics and semiconductor equipment markets expected to remain firm, the electronics sector should continue to expand in 2018, albeit at a more moderate pace,” he said.\nThe overall electronics cluster, including the semiconductor segment, accounts for more than a quarter of Singapore’s manufacturing gross domestic product, at about S$90 billion ($67.9 billion), Koh added.
