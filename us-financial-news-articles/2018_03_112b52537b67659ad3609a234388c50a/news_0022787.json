That is why the family has decided to give the shareholder structure of Erwin Hymer Group a broader foundation,” Chief Executive Martin Brandt said in a statement. The Hymer brand is a familiar sight on European motorways during the summer holiday season. The Hymer family has commissioned Macquarie Capital to help with the evaluation and implementation of its planned measures. Erwin Hymer Group traces its roots to a craft business founded by wheelwright and coachbuilder Alfons Hymer in southern Germany in 1923.
