That law has its own provisions for citizens to file suit over unsafe water, although they cannot seek monetary damages like those available under the civil rights law.\nThe predominantly black city of Flint switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in a cost-cutting move in April 2014. The polluted river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Lead poisoning stunts children's cognitive development, and no level of exposure is considered safe.\nThe city switched back to Lake Huron water in October 2015, but lead levels remained above federal standards until early 2017.\nThe crisis led to several lawsuits against the city, the state, Republican Governor Rick Snyder and several individual city and state officials. Two of those suits were the subject of the Supreme Court appeals.\nIn one, Melissa Mays and several other Flint-based parents brought suit in November 2015 on behalf of themselves and their children. In the other, Flint residents Beatrice Boler, Edwin Anderson and others sued in January 2016 on behalf of Flint residents and businesses.\nThe city and state argued that the federal claims were preempted by the Safe Drinking Water Act.\nIn June 2017, six current and former state and city officials were charged criminally - including five accused of involuntary manslaughter - for their roles in the crisis, which also was linked to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that caused at least 12 deaths.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Barbara Grzincic; Editing by Will Dunham)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T23:03:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
