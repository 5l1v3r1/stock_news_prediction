Jakub Vrana also ended a 25-game scoreless drought for the Capitals.\nZach Hyman and Nazem Kadri had goals for the Maple Leafs, who have dropped three straight on the current four-game road trip.\nThe teams had to deal with difficult conditions as a wind storm swept through the area. Neither team was able to go through a morning skate because of the weather. There was also nearly a 15-minute delay midway through the third period because the lights went out.\nThe Capitals were more poised from the opening faceoff and remain in first place in the Metropolitan Division with the Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and New Jersey Devils close on their heels.\nToronto pulled to within 3-2 when Kadri scored with 12:38 left in the second period. However, the Capitals responded with goals by Carlson and Vrana two minutes apart.\nMaple Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen, who entered the game 3-0-1 with a 2.00 goals-against average against the Capitals, was then replaced by Curtis McElhinney, who finished with nine saves. Andersen stopped 20 shots.\nFrom there, the Maple Leafs dominated the third period but could not overcome the deficit.\nBraden Holtby got the start in goal for Washington and finished with 27 saves. Holtby snapped a six-game winless streak and bounced back from a tough month of February, when he had a 4.62 goals-against average.\nWashington took a 1-0 lead just 3:50 into the opening period on a goal by Kuznetsov. The Maple Leafs answered just two minutes later when Hyman tied the game off a pass from Roman Polak. However, the Capitals retook the lead on Ovechkin’s goal with 13:41 remaining in the first.\nBackstrom provided a 3-1 margin with a power-play goal with 3:40 left in the first period.\nEach team had won its previous two regular-season outdoor games. The Capitals were able to extend their streak with a dominant performance.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:56:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
