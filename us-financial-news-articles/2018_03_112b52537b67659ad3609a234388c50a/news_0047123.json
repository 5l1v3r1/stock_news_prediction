REUTERS/Satish Kumar “I am not surprised the watch went up to a hammer price of $750,000. This watch, for sure, was going to hit a record,” Bob Xue, an associated specialist in the watch department at Christie’s in Dubai, told Reuters on Monday.\nThe watch’s sale tag of $912,500 included a buyer’s premium, he said.\nMade in 1944 and embossed with an old Egyptian royal crest, the Patek Philippe 1518 with perpetual calendar and chronograph is said to be one of only 281 such models ever made by the prestigious Swiss watchmaker.\nAn exhibitor displays the Patek Philippe 18k gold perpetual chronograph wrist watch with moon phases belonging to the King Farouk, at the Christie's auction in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, March 19, 2018.
