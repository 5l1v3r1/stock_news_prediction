They remain hospitalized in critical condition. In the wake of the attack, the U.K., the U.S. and more than a dozen European countries have expelled a total of more than 100 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers, deepening tension between Moscow and the West. Russia denies any involvement. \nDean Haydon, deputy assistant commissioner and senior national coordinator for U.K. counterterrorism policing, said that after finding evidence the Skripals were exposed to the nerve agent from their front door, “we are therefore focusing much of our efforts in and around their address.” Police didn’t comment on how the poison was delivered or by whom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T04:15:34.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
