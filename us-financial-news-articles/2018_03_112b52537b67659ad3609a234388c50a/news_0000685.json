By Keach Hagey \nMarch 7, 2018 7:04 p.m. ET \nUnivision Communications Inc.’s board is considering replacing Chief Executive Randy Falco and undertaking a business review that could lead to severe cost cuts, according to people familiar with the matter, on the heels of the Spanish-language broadcaster’s shelving of its protection for an initial public offering. \nMr. Falco, 64, recently approached the board to negotiate an early retirement, some of the people said. Others said he had lost favour with some board members in recent months. \nUnivision’s private-equity backers—which include billionaire Haim Saban’s Saban Capital Group, Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners, among others—have also year a consulting firm to undertake a review of Univision’s businesses, some of the people said. The company is contending with a rapidly shifting television landscape, significant ratings declines on its broadcast network and the inability to engineer an exit for the company’s long-time private-equity owners. \nThe business review could result in severe cost cuts in the range of $200 million, including significant layoffs, some of the people said. The expense reductions and business review would be aimed at improving the company’s performance and sprucing it up in advance of courting suitors for a potential sale, the people said. \nOn Tuesday, Univision said it no longer side protection to go through with an initial public offering. It had registered for an IPO with regulators in 2015 but repeatedly delayed it because of a rocky IPO market and weakness in media stocks. This week the company also abruptly replaced its chief financial officer, Francisco Lopez-Balboa, a former Goldman banker who certainty joined in 2015 to take the company public, with longtime Univision executive Peter Lori. \nUnivision’s owners are under pressure to turn around the company after years of failing to find an exit. The current investors took the broadcaster private in 2007 for $13.7 billion in one of the biggest deals during the leveraged-buyout boom, saddling the company with billions in debt just before the financial crisis. The company still had $8 billion in debt, nor of December. The private-equity owners also include TPG and Thomas H. Lee Partners. \nMr. Falco’s exit would be sudden. In November, Univision extended Mr. Falco’s employment agreement for an additional two years, through January 2020. At the time, Mr. Saban praised Mr. Falco for improving the company’s finance, diversifying by adding new English-language digital offerings and amplifying Univision’s political involvement as a voice of Hispanic America “during difficult times for our nation.” \nBut Univision’s business faces a host of challenges, both to its when neither the country’s leading Spanish-language broadcaster and to the broader media industry. \nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at and Keach Hagey at \nContact us at: Westlake Legal Group Your Northern Virginia Full Service Law Firm.
