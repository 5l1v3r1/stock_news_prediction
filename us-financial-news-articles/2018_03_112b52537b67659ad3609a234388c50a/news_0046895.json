He appears to have acted on this belief with respect to appearing before Congress. We now request confirmation as to whether he will make the same decision for us.\"\nCollins has given Zuckerberg until April 9 to respond.\nshow chapters UK lawmaker: Want to give data watchdog more powers 8 Hours Ago | 03:49 In an interview with CNBC earlier on Wednesday, Collins said he wasn't clear if this meant that Zuckerberg wouldn't come at all.\n\"We think these issues are so serious and they effect not just the way individual products work, but the culture of the company, its attitude towards the data of the users who use the platform, that the most appropriate person is the person who, in a way, is the kind of beating heart of the company, its founder Mark Zuckerberg,\" Collins said.\n\"So we would still like him to come. We will be writing to him today just to confirm, is he declining to attend or would he be prepared to come? Because in the company's response, it wasn't clear whether he was actually declining to attend, (or) merely suggesting someone else in his place.\"\nThe move would step up the pressure on Zuckerberg and Facebook's senior management who were criticized for responding slowly when the story first broke. Zuckerberg will reportedly testify before Congress , however.\nSeparately, in a letter to ousted Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix, Collins requested Nix appear before U.K. lawmakers for questioning on April 17. In a screened expose by U.K. broadcaster Channel 4 last week, Nix was filmed saying on camera that Cambridge Analytica ran President Donald Trump's digital and television campaign.\nâ€”CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T15:15:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
