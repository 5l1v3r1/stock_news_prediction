Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in a statement said the fraud cost investors more than $26 million.\nAccording to court papers, the case related to a probe of individuals including investment banker Jason Galanis involved in market manipulation for reinsurer Gerova Financial Group Ltd .\nWeston had done a deal with Gerova in 2010 that prosecutors said prompted the first of two schemes involving Bergstein and Wellner. Galanis in 2016 pleaded guilty to securities fraud in connection with the Gerova fraud.\nAlbert Hallac, Weston's founder, pleaded guilty in 2016 to charges that he schemed to defraud Weston investors.\nBergstein previously controlled several movie production companies including ThinkFilm and Capitol Films Development. He took an advisory role in Walt Disney Co's 2010 sale of Miramax to an investor group that included a business partner.\nHis movie credits include serving as an executive producer of 2004's \"The Whole Ten Yards\" and 2007's \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.\"\nIn 2010, five of Bergstein's film companies including Capitol Films and ThinkFilm were forced into bankruptcy at the urging of a group of creditors, court records showed.
