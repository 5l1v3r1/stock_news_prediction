It will now start at 7.45 p.m. to allow for community and club rugby to be played during the day. \n“Saturday afternoon footy is traditionally the showcase window for our community game and by recognising that and working with our key partners we have been able to ensure that all levels of the game is a winner,” Waratahs chief executive Andrew Hore said.
