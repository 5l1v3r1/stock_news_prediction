Some investors have grown concerned that such improvements could end due to geological or technological limitations.\n“We’ve seen very significant increases in efficiencies,” Chief Executive Jack Harper said at the Scotia Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans. “The changes won’t be this dramatic and this obvious in the future, but there are many small improvements that can occur over the next two to three years.”\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:37:59.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
