In 2000, the peak was at 79,600 MW, rising to 89,000 MW in 2007 and rising above 90,000 MW for the first time in 2009 with a peak of 92,400 MW.\nWith about a third of all homes relying on electricity for heating, French power demand is highly sensitive to the change in temperatures, with a fall of one degree corresponding to about 2,400 MW of extra power demand, the equivalent of two large nuclear reactors.
