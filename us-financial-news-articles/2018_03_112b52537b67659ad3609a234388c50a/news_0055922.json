Joseph Dunford during their meeting at the Presidential Blue House in Seoul, South Korea, August 14, 2017. \nBy Bob Davis Kwanwoo Jun \nThe U.S. granted South Korea a permanent exemption to new steel tariffs in return for trade concessions, giving the Trump administration a limited victory and putting the spotlight on what the U.S. got in the bargain. \nThe U.S. and South Korea agreed to amend a 2012 trade pact in response to U.S. concerns about its $18 billion merchandise trade deficit with Seoul. The U.S. threatened to slap tariffs of 25% on all steel imports, which would hit South Korea as the third largest foreign supplier of steel to the U.S. \nThe agreement removed a point of contention between Washington and Seoul that had come at an awkward time, as the two countries were working toward summits between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, followed by a meeting between Mr. Kim and President Donald Trump. \nAmong the biggest winners of the renegotiated deal will be U.S. auto makers, who have long-complained that the original Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, known as Korus, was too lax. Mr. Trump had called it a “horrible deal” and blamed it for expanding the U.S. trade deficit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T21:22:28.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
