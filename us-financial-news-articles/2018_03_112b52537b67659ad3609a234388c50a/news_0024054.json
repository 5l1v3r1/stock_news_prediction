They like roots,” he said. “Most people don’t want to leave.”\n“ON YOUR BIKE” Haldane praised the recent electrification of a railway line between the fairly buoyant northern city of Manchester and Blackpool, a rainswept seaside resort that has suffered since Britons have been able to afford to travel to sunnier places.\nBritish policymakers have not always appeared sympathetic toward people in poorer regions.\nThe Conservative Party divided public opinion in the early 1980s, a time of high unemployment, when its chairman Norman Tebbit said those without jobs should follow the example of his father, who in the 1930s “got on his bike and looked for work”.\nA former BoE Governor, Eddie George, said in 1998 that job losses in northern England were an undesirable but acceptable price to pay to curb inflation in the south.\nBritain suffers one of the highest degrees of regional inequality of any European country, and some of the strongest support for leaving the European Union in the June 2016 referendum was found in poorer areas outside major cities.\nHaldane said the Brexit vote had moved the issue up the agenda, and that solving it should be a priority.\n“In some ways for me, that probably is the largest of the economic issues facing ‘UK plc’ right now.”\nUnemployment in Britain recently touched its lowest since 1975, at 4.4 percent, but wages have stagnated in real terms for the past decade since the global financial crisis.\nReporting by David Milliken; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T19:58:04.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
