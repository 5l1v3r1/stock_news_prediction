It did not provide a timeframe for the investment.\nAksu, Kashgar and Hotan in southern Xinjiang are among the poorest parts of China, with more than 1.6 million people living below the poverty line as of the end of 2017, the report added.\nThese three areas have also been at the epicenter of what China terms its war on terror, with hundreds having died in violence over the past few years.\nThe Uighurs are a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language.\nRights groups and exiled Uighurs say repressive Chinese government policies are more to blame for the unrest than any organized Islamist or separatist groups. China denies any repression in Xinjiang.\nBut recognizing the economic roots of some of the violence and frustration of many young Uighurs at missing out on China’s economic boom, Beijing has increased its focus on southern Xinjiang, pumping in money and encouraging development.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-31T11:13:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
