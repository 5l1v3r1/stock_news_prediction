The offer has been accepted by Eurocom’s creditors and submitted to court for approval.\nAmid a 29 percent drop in Bezeq’s shares last year, activist investor Elliott, which has a 4.8 percent stake, called for the resignation of all Bezeq directors implicated in the investigation and those affiliated with Eurocom.\nAdvisory firm Entropy, representing certain Israeli institutional investors, has submitted a request to call a special shareholder meeting to appoint three external directors to the board, Bezeq said.
