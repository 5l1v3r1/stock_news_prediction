We will not sit idly while our industry is hit with unfair measures that put thousands of European jobs at risk,\" said Juncker.\nThe European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union.\nThe Commission next will take the matter to the World Trade Organization , the statement said. The WTO refused to comment on the news when contacted by CNBC.\nshow chapters Top sources of U.S. steel, aluminum imports 20 Hours Ago | 01:05 European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, who is currently touring Asia , said the problem facing the global steel and aluminum market is overcapacity caused by \"non-market based production.\"\nMalmström did not name any countries that are overproducing steel and aluminum. China has been criticized for years for dumping its state-subsidized, excess steel on Europe, the United States and other countries.\nSuch a tactic drives down prices to unsustainable levels for domestic producers. China denies that it engages in dumping, and it does not rank among the top 10 sources for U.S. steel imports, according to data from IHS global Trade Atlas. China is the fourth biggest exporter of aluminum to the United States.\n\"This can only be addressed at the source, and by working with the key countries involved. This go-it-alone action by the U.S. will not help,\" said Malmström.\n\"These U.S. measures will have a negative impact on transatlantic relations and on global markets. In addition, they will raise costs and reduce choice for U.S. consumers of steel and aluminum, including industries that import these commodities,\" she said. \"The EU will seek dispute settlement consultations with the U.S. in Geneva at the earliest opportunity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T02:46:06.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
