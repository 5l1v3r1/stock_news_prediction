And now is the first time that we are standing up and saying, 'Enough's enough, we're going to fight back.'\"\nIn the announcement Thursday, Trump claimed trade trends \"destroyed\" American steel and aluminum industries.\n\"People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,\" the president said.\nTrump's actions sparked fears of a trade war, as well as higher prices for consumers.\nThe stock market fell on Thursday , with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down more than 400 points.\nDiMicco says investors are missing the point, calling the market drop a \"major overreaction.\"\n\"What the market needs to focus on is the long-term impacts of his total economic plan, which does include trade reform and rightfully so,\" he argued.\nThat plan also includes tax, regulatory and energy reform, as well as some infrastructure spending, he said.\n\"It's a great buying opportunity,\" he said. \"Costs of steel are a small portion of most of the products that people are afraid about influencing.\"\n— CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T00:26:42.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
