President Donald Trump has said that he wants China to come up with a plan to slash its $375 billion merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. by $100 billion .\nNumbers Game The Trump administration is looking at steep tariffs to try to reverse the U.S.-China merchandise trade deficit.

The administration, according to the individuals involved, estimates the damage to U.S. companies from forced technology transfer at $30 billion annually. The administration has been working for months on a report laying out the evidence for their allegations.\nNo final decisions about retaliation have yet been made, according to a White House spokeswoman.\nMore\nIrish Leader to Stress Benefits of U.S. Trade Ties U.S. Allies Plot Tough-on-China Approach to Tariffs China’s Economy Grows Faster Than Expected U.S. Companies Could Get Few Exclusions to Tariffs Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter The measures being considered include: tariffs of at least an annual $30 billion on a wide range of Chinese products; strengthened restrictions on Chinese investment into the U.S.; and limits on visas to Chinese students, academics and executives to visit or study in the U.S., said individuals briefed on the measures.\nThese options were discussed in a White House meeting last week that included officials from the Commerce Department, Defense Department, the Council of Economic Adviser and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, the White House official said.\nAlong with these unilateral measures, the administration is also considering filing a case at the World Trade Organization against China, alleging a variety of violations of trade rules. The WTO case is seen as a way to try to rally support from other trading nations that are also concerned about China’s trade behavior and present a united front.\nYet the administration has undercut multilateral action by planning to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Japan, Korea, the European Union and other allies, say critics.\n“Multilateral action is what’s absolutely necessary,” said James McGregor, the head of the China office of APCO Worldwide, a communications and lobbying firm. “But when you are going around and attacking your trading partners, who is going to work with you?”\nMr. Trump sees tariffs as an important negotiating tool, and “he may have to use it in some cases, and that includes China,” said Lawrence Kudlow, who Mr. Trump is set to name as the director of the White House National Economic Council , in an interview Wednesday.\nChina has objected to the intellectual-property investigation and said that the country is making a serious attempt at reforming its economy.

Photo: AP (Originally Published January 24, 2018) Pressing China on trade has wide support among U.S. businesses, which complain that Beijing unfairly subsidizes its state-owned firms to develop technology and hinders U.S. companies doing business in China. But many companies fear that imposing tariffs would backfire by inviting retaliation from the Chinese and would raise costs for U.S. businesses.\n“Tariffs would be incredibly counterproductive,” said Josh Kallmer, senior vice president at the Information Technology Industry Council.\nOn Wednesday, about two dozen trade groups met at the offices of the National Retail Federation to confer on the administration’s China plans and to consider joint action, said Naomi Wilson, the ITIC’s director of global policy. No decisions were made, but the groups generally oppose tariffs and plan further sessions, she said.\nAdministration officials argue that tariffs and other trade measures are necessary to put pressure on Beijing, say business executives who have met with them. Otherwise, the administration argues, China will talk about making changes, but not carry them out.\nUSTR is examining which products to hit with tariffs. It is trying to minimize the harm to the U.S. economy by picking items that are produced by countries other than China too. One possibility is shoes, the White House official said. But the official also said the U.S. would specifically target products outlined in Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” report, released in 2015, which is a blueprint for making China a world leader in a number of technology areas, including robotics, semiconductors and electric vehicles.\nTo deal with the Chinese challenge, the administration is looking at remaking investment rules, so that they are “reciprocal”—meaning that the U.S. would impose similar restrictions on Chinese investment that U.S. firms face in China. Those restrictions include requirements to do business as joint ventures with Chinese partners and government pressure to transfer technology to those partners. The U.S. already has made it more difficult for Chinese companies to invest in the U.S. by blocking Chinese bids to purchase U.S. semiconductor firms .\nSome in U.S. business circles argue that limiting Chinese investment could backfire. Instead of liberalizing investment rules, Beijing could simply make its restrictions permanent. “Reciprocity, as a concept is fine, but it has to be applied carefully to advance U.S. goals,” said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group.\n​The administration is also considering limiting the number of visas to Chinese who work and study in the U.S. said people briefed on the deliberations. Also under discussion is ending a program that allows frequent travelers to get visas that last 10 years. The goal is to limit the technology transfer, but any such effort is bound to kick up stiff opposition from U.S. universities, which count on revenue from Chinese students.\n—William Mauldin and Jacob M.
