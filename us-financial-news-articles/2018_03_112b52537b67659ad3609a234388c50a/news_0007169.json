The EU is now the biggest market where Internet neutrality still prevails, but Portugal has been singled out as allowing practices that undermine it.\nAnacom said certain packages offered by MEO, NOS and Vodafone violated the Telecom Single Market Regulation. Still, Anacom Chairman Joao Antonio Cadete de Matos said the law was unclear on what sanctions could ultimately be applied to the operators.\nReporting By Axel Bugge and Daniel Alvarenga\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:35:44.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
