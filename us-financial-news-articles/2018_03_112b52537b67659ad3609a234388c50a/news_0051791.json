It was always a downside risk that China would start to slow. Financial institutions have cautioned things can’t go on forever,” said Jeremy Platt, analyst at steel consultancy MEPS.\n“We’re expecting prices to fall in the second half because of China, but equally we’re not anticipating a crash.”\nChina aside, worldsteel data showed output in India, which last month overtook Japan to become the world’s second largest steel producer, rose 3.4 percent in February, while Japan’s output fell 0.5 percent.\nIn the western world, output in the European Union fell 0.8 percent, while output in the United States rose 0.4 percent.\n“The rebound in U.S. production was not too surprising given the prospect of a 25 percent tariff on U.S. steel imports and the recent stratospheric rise in prices. We expect production to pick up further over the coming months as higher prices encourage capacity restarts,” said Capital Economics in a note.\nThe steel industry, worth about $900 billion a year, is a seen as a gauge of the world’s economic health.
