For these reasons we have decided to approve it.”\nCritics say VAR has led to confusion in competitions where it has been used, especially for spectators in stadiums who are often unaware that a decision is being reviewed.\nThere have been incidents in Italy where goals have been disallowed following a three-minute wait, after celebrations have died down, and penalties revoked with the ball on the spot and the attacking player waiting to take the kick.\nFOUR CASES According to IFAB protocols, VAR should only be used in four key cases: goals, penalties, direct red cards and mistaken identity.\nSoccer Football - FA Cup Fifth Round Replay - Swansea City vs Sheffield Wednesday - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - February 27, 2018 General view of the VAR (Video Assistant Referee) system Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers A trained referee with access to a video monitor, and in constant communication with the main match official, checks all such decisions.\nIf a“clear and obvious” mistake is spotted the incident can be reviewed and changed. The referee, who has access to a pitchside monitor, can also initiate a review himself.\nInfantino brushed aside concerns over the readiness of World Cup referees or concerns that the VAR system was taking the spontaneity and excitement out of the sport.\n“I can guarantee that the referees that will be at the World Cup will be ready,” he said on Saturday.\n“Regarding the flow of the game, the intervention takes around one minute. I believe that VAR at the World Cup will certainly help us to have a fairer World Cup.”\n“Those who used to complain about the referee will complain about VAR,” he added.“When the referee reviews a decision, this creates maybe an additional moment of emotion, tension, everyone is waiting... then you either celebrate or you scream.”\n“What is more important for us is that we can help the referee to take the right decision, we bring fairness to the game.”\nIFAB technical director David Elleray added that the video assistant had a complex and technical role.\n“This is far more complex than most people realize and we want to protect football,” he said.\n“The referee is not sitting in at home with a cup of coffee in one hand and a mobile phone in the other, watching TV and giving the referee a call when something goes wrong. It is highly complicated.”\nWriting by Brian Homewood; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T14:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T15:04:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
