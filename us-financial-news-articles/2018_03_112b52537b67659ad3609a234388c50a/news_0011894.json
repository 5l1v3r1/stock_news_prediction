Metro Nashville Police Department/Handout via REUTERS Barry, a Democrat, had faced calls to resign and was the subject of multiple investigations, including a criminal inquiry by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations.\nShe said Vice Mayor David Briley would be sworn in as mayor on Tuesday.\nForrest also pleaded guilty on Tuesday to the same charges and agreed to repay the city $45,000 for salary and overtime earned on the job when he was not performing his duties as the mayor’s security detail, prosecutors said. Both Barry and Forrest received three years probation.\nAs part of the plea deals both had negotiated, Davidson County District Attorney General Glenn Funk said in a statement that Barry and Forrest could petition the court to expunge their criminal records if they successfully complete probation.\nEditing by Ben Klayman and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T19:57:47.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
