PROMESA gave the board authority to push Puerto Rico into a court-supervised debt restructuring akin to U.S. bankruptcy.\nThe island is navigating the largest government bankruptcy in U.S. history, with $120 billion of combined bond and pension debt when it declared bankruptcy in May 2017 after more than a decade of recession.\nREBUILD\nSeptember's Hurricane Maria was Puerto Rico's worst natural disaster in 90 years, killing dozens, decimating local infrastructure and knocking out power to the island's 3.4 million U.S. citizens.\nMore than five months later more than 8 percent, or 120,991 customers remain without power, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\nJaresko said it was safe to say approximately $35 billion to $45 billion has been appropriated for relief and rebuilding, including earmarks from the U.S. Congress and money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is not fixed.\nThat overall range does not include $4.8 billion in Medicaid money, nor roughly $4.8 billion in unreleased Community Development Loans. She noted another estimate of $21 billion in private insurance that will provide an economic stimulus.\nOne of the board's main focus points is to restructure the electrical grid, lower the cost of electricity and make the power supply more reliable, Jaresko said.\nIf electric rates are low and stable, they would create a revenue stream that would allow the government to restructure the more than $9 billion of defaulted PREPA debt, she said.\nPREPA had a deal with creditors but it was never certified by the board.\n\"Frankly speaking, one of the reasons that deal was not approved by the board... is if we don't bring down the cost of electricity, we will continue to have people moving off the grid,\" and the ability to repay debt becomes even more of a challenge, she said.\nFor decades, favorable U.S. tax treatment allowed the economy to be built with a competitive advantage. While those advantages eroded over time and led to the recession, December's U.S. tax law changes stripped away the last benefits.\n\"To remove it without the ability to plan and build other competitive advantages is extraordinarily difficult. To have to do that without notice and then have to do that while rebuilding the economy... I think it is very difficult policy timing.\" (Reporting By Daniel Bases; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T18:46:27.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
