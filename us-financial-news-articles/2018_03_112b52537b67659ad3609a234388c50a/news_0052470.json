The two companies will not merge their respective autonomous vehicle development programs.\n“The target isn’t to do a little bit here and a little bit there,” Schwarzenbauer said. “We want to become the leading provider when it comes to mobility services.”\nBut before that can happen, the two companies will have to go through the complicated process of merging their operations and determine whether to rebrand existing businesses such as Daimler’s car2go and BMW’s DriveNow and ReachNow car-sharing units or to leave those names intact. The deal also has to be reviewed and approved by antitrust regulators.\nThe number of businesses currently operating under each company illustrate the complexity of this new enterprise, and hint at how long it might take BMW and Daimler to integrate them.\nFor example, BMW’s DriveNow and Daimler’s Car2Go have 20,000 vehicles spread out among 31 cities globally. Other BMW or Daimler-owned mobility operations include moovel, ReachNow, ride-hailing services such as mytaxi, Chauffeur Privé, Clever Taxi and Beat, and parking businesses ParkNow and Parkmobile. Some 13 million customers and 140,000 drivers are already using BMW’s and Daimler’s ride-hailing services.\nBMW and Daimler are also projecting that the deal will increase profits. If the merger is approved, Daimler expects earnings before taxes for its financial services unit will be “significantly higher than the previous year.”\nBMW said the joint venture will trigger a one-time valuation and earnings effect in its group financial statement. Pre-tax earnings would increase slightly in 2018 compared with the previous year, BMW said.\nThe companies have gone into business together before. In 2015, a coalition of German carmakers that included Daimler, Audi, and BMW agreed to acquire Nokia’s HERE and its mapping technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T23:42:30.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
