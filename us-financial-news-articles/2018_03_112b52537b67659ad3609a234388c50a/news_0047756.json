(TSX Venture:BLN), a leading manufacturer of connected worker safety monitoring solutions, announced record first quarter revenue in its results for the quarter ended January 31, 2018.\n“Blackline continues to see significant revenue growth based on the success in the field of our award-winning connected safety technology,” said Cody Slater, Blackline Safety CEO and Chairman. “No other vendor of wireless gas detection or lone worker systems offers a turnkey solution with 3G connectivity, voice calling and plug-and-play cartridges as offered by our G7 product line.”\n“During the quarter, we launched a range of new sensors to address new customer scenarios and completed development of a major firmware update for the G7. This new firmware will enable users to choose their preferred language for the G7 interface, including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Dutch,” said Slater. “This capability will provide additional support for our growth in the European market where this quarter we saw a 245% increase in revenue over last year.”\nSlater stated, “Traditional gas detectors require every single detector to be removed from the field and handled individually to update their firmware, resulting in a labor and logistics-intensive program. In contrast, when we deploy new G7 firmware updates wirelessly ‘over-the-air.’ there’s zero impact on end users, further demonstrating the value of our connected technology for businesses.”\n“The full G7 product line, which started shipping only last quarter, targets a wide variety of industries — from the energy sector to petrochemical, utilities, manufacturing and many others,” said Slater. “Already, we are seeing the results of the launch of the G7 with product revenue up over 80%, as more customers throughout this range of industries recognize the value of our revolutionary G7 connected safety product.”\nHighlights\nTotal revenue of $3.8M, a 51% increase over the prior year’s Q1 Product revenue of $1.5M, an 83% increase over the prior year’s Q1 Service revenue of $2.3M, a 36% increase over the prior year’s Q1 European revenue of $701k, a 245% increase over the prior year’s Q1 Contracted future service revenue grew to $4.5M, a 34% increase over the prior year’s Q1 Blackline launched new gas sensors and G7 device firmware with multi-language support Blackline Safety named Manufacturer of the Year at the Oil & Gas Awards\nThe subsequent values in this release are in thousands, except for percentages and per share data.­­\nFinancial Highlights\nQuarter Ended January 31 2018 2017 Change Revenue $ 3,803 $ 2,515 51 % Gross Margin $ 1,693 $ 1,251 35 % Gross Margin Percentage 45 % 50 % (10 )% Net Loss ($ 1,604 ) ($ 2,065 ) 22 % Net Loss excluding stock-based compensation expense ($ 1,501 ) ($ 1,481 ) (1 )% Adjusted EBITDA ($ 136 ) ($ 191 ) 29 % Loss per Share ($ 0.05 ) ($ 0.07 ) 29 % Key Financial Information\nFirst quarter revenue was $3,803 compared to $2,515 in the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year, resulting in an increase of 51% or $1,288.\nProduct revenue during the first quarter was $1,465, an increase of 83% compared to $802 in the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year.
