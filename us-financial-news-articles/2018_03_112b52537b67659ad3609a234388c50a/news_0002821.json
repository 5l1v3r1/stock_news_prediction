All Chinese over the age of 18 are technically allowed to vote for delegates and stand for election to the NPC, but most delegates are handpicked by local-level officials.\nReporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Stephen Coates and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T01:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T02:08:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
