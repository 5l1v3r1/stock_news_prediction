Our wholly - owned subsidiary, Vidler Water Company, sold 102,500 Long Term Storage Credits in 2017 for $25.9 million and also in 2017 we wound down our oil and gas operations. Return of Capital to Shareholders: In the fourth quarter of 2017, we paid a special dividend to shareholders of $5 per share for a total distribution of $115.9 million. The payment is classified for federal income tax purposes as a tax - free return of capital to shareholders. Reduction in costs: We continued to reduce our general, administrative and other costs to $12.4 million in 2017 from $32.8 million in 2016 primarily by reducing employee headcount, executive compensation, stock-based compensation, directors’ fees and certain legal and other professional fees. The 2016 costs include a charge of $10.4 million for severance and related payments to our former CEO. General, administrative and other costs were $20 million for 2015.\n“Also during 2017, we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives including the possible sale of the Company and as a result we engaged JMP Securities LLC as the Company’s exclusive financial advisor and Cooley LLP as PICO’s legal counsel. That exploration is proceeding and we will provide an update to our shareholders as and when this process concludes.”\nThe foregoing discussion of the tax treatment of the special dividend is general in nature, is not intended for any particular shareholder and is not intended as tax advice. Each shareholder is strongly encouraged to consult its financial and tax advisors regarding the appropriate treatment of the special dividend and the corresponding tax consequences that may be relevant to such shareholder’s particular circumstances, because the tax treatment is complex and uncertain at this time, and the actual current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Company for 2017 could vary from the Company’s present estimate and such variance could result in different consequences to a particular shareholder.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $185.5 million of (pre-tax) federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, that could be utilized in certain circumstances to offset our taxable income and reduce our federal income tax liability. Additional information with respect to these NOLs is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout PICO Holdings, Inc.\nPICO Holdings is a diversified holding company.
