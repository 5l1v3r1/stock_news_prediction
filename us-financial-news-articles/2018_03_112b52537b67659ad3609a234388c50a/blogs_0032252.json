Smoke billows from tanks of Brazil's state-run Petrobras oil company at Presidente Bernardes Refinery in Cubatao, Brazil February 3, 2018. Picture taken February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker Petrobras, as the state-controlled company is known, posted a net loss of 5.48 billion reais ($1.68 billion), according to a securities filing, down from a 2.51 billion real profit during the same period last year. The average estimate in a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts was for a 294 million reais profit. Petrobras shares fell 2 percent in Sao Paulo, as the stock retreated from a more than three-year high last week. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) slid 32 percent from a year earlier to 12.986 billion reais in the final three months of the year. Petrobras narrowed its 12-month net loss to 446 million reais in 2017 from the 14.824 billion hole in 2016, but still posted its fourth straight annual net loss. The world’s most indebted oil company said it would have reached a net profit of 7.089 billion reais in the year, without the extraordinary expenses. The settlement, announced in January, was a milestone for the oil firm as it seeks to emerge from a scandal over a massive corruption scheme, in which Petrobras executives and contractors conspired to inflate prices and bilk the company of billions. The bribery scheme has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country’s corporate executives. Petrobras has denied wrongdoing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T16:21:00.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
