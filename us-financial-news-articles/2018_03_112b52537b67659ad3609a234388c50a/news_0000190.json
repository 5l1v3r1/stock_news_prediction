High winds of up to 75 miles per hour (120 kmph) could also bring extensive power outages.\n“People need to take this very seriously,” Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told a Thursday press conference, telling people to prepare for a repeat of the flooding that affected much of state’s east coast during the Jan. 4“bombogenesis” winter storm.“If you live in an area that is told to evacuate, we strongly encourage you do so first thing Friday morning.”\nThe National Weather Service had coastal flood watches and warnings in place from southern Maine through coastal North Carolina, including New York’s eastern suburbs, and also warned that a snowstorm heading east from the Ohio Valley could drop significant amounts of snow in northern New York State. It forecast storm surges of up to four feet (1.2 m) for eastern Massachusetts.\nOcean-facing homes could be destroyed by the storm surge and waves, while people who live in neighborhoods reached by low-lying roads could be cut off from services for hours or days, officials and government forecasters warned.\n“This could be another storm with prolonged onshore flooding,” said Paul Walker, a senior meteorologist with private forecasting services Accuweather. Flooding could begin to pick up around high tide, forecast to occur shortly after 11 a.m. ET (1600 GMT) around Boston, he said.\nWalker also noted that the combinations of high winds and sustained rain, which softens the ground, could lead extensive downed trees and power outages.\nElsewhere along the coast, work crews beefed up coastal dunes and residents installed plywood sheeting over their windows to protect homes from wind- and water-borne debris.
