The goal is part of a set of objectives which also focus on80 percent on-time deliveries and limiting the number ofaircraft quality problems, they said, citing internal postings. Like rival Boeing ( BA.N ), Airbus aims to increase the amountof revenue it gains from services rather than manufacturing, ina bid to emulate the wider margins of third parties whotraditionally control the market for repairs and services.However it has so far given little detailed guidance on thetargets by business activity. An Airbus spokesman confirmed the $10 billion target.
