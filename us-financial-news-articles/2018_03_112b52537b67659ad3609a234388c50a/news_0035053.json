Former oil minister Eulogio Del Pino and former PDVSA President Nelson Martinez are the most high-profile prisoners of the sweep that began late last year. \nAuthorities had issued an arrest warrant for Luongo and four other oil executives, the two sources with knowledge of the detention said. Luongo turned himself on Monday in the northwestern Paraguana peninsula, home to Venezuela’s biggest refining complex, which he once led, one of the sources said. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, the other source added. \n  www.reuters.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T14:54:03.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
