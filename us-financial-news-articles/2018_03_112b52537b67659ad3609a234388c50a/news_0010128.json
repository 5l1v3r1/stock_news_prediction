While the League still says it wants to leave the single currency at the earliest feasible moment, the 5-Star says the time for quitting the euro has passed.\nThe euro started the week on a solid footing as two-thirds of SPD members supported the coalition, clearing the way for a new government in Europe’s largest economy after months of political uncertainty.\nThe U.S. currency was also on slippery footing after President Donald Trump last week proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, raising fears of retaliation from its trade partners that could trigger a trade war.\n“I would think the market will soon digest European politics and shift focus back to the trade issues, in which case the dollar is likely to come under pressure,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nThe dollar was also easier against the yen at 105.55 yen , near Friday’s 16-month low of 105.24.\nBank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ would consider an exit from its ultra-easy monetary policy if it met its inflation target in the next fiscal year from April 2019.\nTraders will be looking at confirmation hearing in the parliament by two nominees for BOJ Deputy Governors, Masazumi Wakatabe and Masayoshi Amamiya.
