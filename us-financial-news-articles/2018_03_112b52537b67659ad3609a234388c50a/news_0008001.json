As part of the proposal, the Board also approved the elimination of NBB’s contingent term policy. Both of these changes require shareholder approval. If each fund obtains the necessary shareholder approvals at its annual shareholder meeting to be held later this year, shareholders of the combined fund who do not wish to maintain their investment in the combined fund will be given an opportunity following completion of the Merger to sell a portion of their investment in the combined fund at net asset value, less a small repurchase fee.\nIn addition, the Board approved the expansion of NBB’s investment policy of investing at least 80% of its Managed Assets in Build America Bonds (“BABs”) to investing at least 80% of its Managed Assets in all types of taxable municipal securities, including BABs. NBB would at the same time change its name to Nuveen Taxable Municipal Income Fund.\nThe proposal is intended to benefit shareholders in a number of ways, including continued ownership through the combined fund of scarce Build America Bonds with above-market purchase yields, the potential for meaningfully higher common net earnings and avoidance of sizeable capital gain distributions that would result upon termination of the funds.\nMore information on the proposal will be contained in proxy materials expected to be filed in the near future.\nAbout Nuveen\nNuveen, the investment manager of TIAA, offers a comprehensive range of outcome-focused investment solutions designed to secure the long-term financial goals of institutional and individual investors.
