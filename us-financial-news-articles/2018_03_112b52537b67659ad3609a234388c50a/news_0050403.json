It'll all be recorded on a virtually unchangeable digital ledger: a blockchain. \nEmergent Technology is partnering with NYSE-listed Yamana Gold to create \"g-coins\" backed by gold, where one coin is said to be equivalent to one gram of responsibly sourced gold, and is pegged to the spot price of gold. As a blockchain-based asset, each g-coin is a digital certificate of ownership that could be used for investing, wealth transfer and payments. \nThis isn't the only attempt at tracking gold on a blockchain, but the company said its approach is \"fundamentally different\" from what others have adopted so far in part because of its focus on \"responsibly sourced gold.\" \n\"Emergent is looking to build an ecosystem,\" Davis told CNBC in an email. As such, the company tracks the gold from its source mine, helping to \"connect all steps in the supply-chain.\" \nBy attaching a cryptographic seal to the gold, they are able to use technology to track it at every point along the way, says Davis. show chapters ", "external_links": ["https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emergent-technology-and-yamana-gold-to-improve-gold-supply-chain-300596816.html"], "published": "2018-03-27T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T08:09:40.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
