In addition, Wind River Titanium Cloud brings field proven and mature technology to the open source community. Already compact and performant for edge computing, these technologies will reduce the effort needed to optimize the packages for deployment, and enable operational efficiencies and reliability. The components include new open source assets, as well as many patches to existing open source projects, such as OpenStack, QEMU and Ceph.\nThe Intel NEV SDK contribution provides a suite of reference libraries and APIs to enable edge-computing solutions for different network deployment scenarios, including small cells, macro cells, wireline, aggregation sites, and central offices. The SDK is designed to remove the need for application developers to understand the complexity and implementation attributes of the underlying network protocols. The Intel NEV SDK libraries have already been validated and deployed with Wind River Titanium Cloud technology.\nThe community has established a lightweight governance structure that welcomes technical contributions from all participants. The technical steering committee, responsible for setting the technical direction of the project, will be composed of active committers within the community with no prerequisite of financial contribution.\n\"We've seen strong interest in Akraino Edge Stack since introducing the project, and are gratified that Intel is taking a leadership role with key Wind River code contributions,\" said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. \"As we move toward a full launch of Akraino Edge Stack in the coming months, we invite organizations and developers interested in contributing to the community to join us in working to define an open source solution for edge computing.\"\n\"Intel's contribution of production-quality edge computing infrastructure software offers users new levels of flexibility to scale edge cloud services faster, maximize the applications or subscribers supported on each server, and help ensure the reliability of systems,\" said Imad Sousou, corporate vice president and general manager of the Open Source Technology Center, Intel. \"This project helps provide an open and scalable platform to encourage broad community involvement, accelerating innovation and edge stack productization across the ecosystem.\"\n\"The industry needs to address the gaps that exist from building solutions with 'best-of-breed' components from multiple open source projects.
