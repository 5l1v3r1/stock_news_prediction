(“Pete”) Grum, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rand Capital, commented, “We finished 2017 with a strong year of investments, totaling $5.4 million. We made great progress in structuring those investments to increase our investment income. Our net investment income, along with net increases in realized gains and unrealized appreciation on certain investments favorably impacted net asset value per share during the third and fourth quarters of 2017.”\nHe continued, “As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, federal tax rates decreased to 21% from 35%. During the fourth quarter, we were required to revalue our deferred tax assets based on the new, lower rates, resulting in a write-down amounting to $0.05 per share. As we monetize and exit portfolio companies in the future, we will significantly benefit from the lower tax rates beginning in 2018.”\nMr. Grum added, “We continue to work with the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to finalize an arrangement for additional SBA capital.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nReported $5.05 net asset value (NAV) per share at December 31, 2017, compared with $5.01 at September 30, 2017. The sequential improvement was driven by higher investment income, realized gains and unrealized appreciation on investments. These were partially offset by $0.05 per share to revalue the Company’s deferred tax assets at new, lower federal tax rates. For the full year, completed nine investment transactions totaling $5.4 million. The fourth quarter included $1.5 million invested as a follow-on in Tilson Technology Management, Inc. During the fourth quarter, Rand sold its position in Athenex, Inc., generating approximately $781,000 of gross proceeds and realizing a $638,000 pretax gain. Investment income increased 26% and 41% over the prior-year fourth quarter and full year, respectively. At December 31, 2017, portfolio fair value was $32.3 million and consolidated cash was $6.3 million.\nTotal investment income in the fourth quarter of 2017 grew to approximately $380,000, up from approximately $301,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The $79,000 increase was driven by the Company’s success with focusing investments in income producing instruments. Total expenses in the 2017 and 2016 fourth quarters were approximately $448,000 and $486,000, respectively.\nTotal investment income was approximately $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Similar to the fourth quarter, the growth was driven by the Company’s recent investment focus on income-generating instruments. Total expenses for the year were approximately $2.0 million in 2017, down from $3.4 million in 2016. The 2017 expenses included approximately $133,000 associated with the Company’s application process for its second SBIC. The 2016 expenses included higher incentive compensation expenses related to the Company’s Gemcor exit.\nSelected Portfolio Highlights\nTilson Technology Management, Inc. is an award-winning, veteran owned IT professional services and network deployment firm. The company primarily operates in two fast growing markets: 1) network deployment for cellular carriers, utilities, and governments; and 2) consulting for construction IT, broadband and energy, and government institutional markets. Recognized for its sustained high growth, Tilson has been on the prestigious Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private U.S. companies for seven consecutive years, from 2011 through 2017. As a result of this distinction, Tilson joins a select group of firms on the Inc. 5000 ‘Honor Roll,’ a milestone which just two percent of the Inc. 5000 companies ever achieve, according to the publisher. Tilson has grown more than 410% to become one of the top 25 telecommunications firms on the list as of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Rand invested $1.5 million in both debt and equity capital, to support Tilson’s ongoing growth. This represents Rand’s third investment in Tilson since its initial investment in January 2015. At December 31, 2017 Rand’s investment in Tilson was valued at $2.5 million. Carolina Skiff, LLC is a leading manufacturer of high quality, versatile outboard boats, including the #1 fiberglass outboard brand within their size range. Offering more than 60 models, Carolina Skiff boats provide the most features and the best functionality available. The company has an established footprint with 94 dealers across 23 states. Since 2014, revenue and EBITDA have grown at compound annual growth rates exceeding 9% and 27%, respectively. Rand initially invested in Carolina Skiff in 2004. The company’s recent strong financial performance has driven Rand to increase its carrying value by $650,000 during the fourth quarter, resulting in a carrying value of $1.75 million in Rand’s portfolio as of\nDecember 31, 2017. GiveGab, Inc. provides a user-friendly social platform that cultivates long-term giving relationships by connecting donors and volunteers with nonprofits. The GiveGab team helps nonprofits thrive, providing an affordable, secure and customized way to engage with supporters, raise funds online, and manage data. In January 2018, GiveGab announced that they acquired Austin, Texas-based Kimbia . This synergistic acquisition results in significant growth for GiveGab, especially driven by Kimbia’s Everyday Giving solution. The combination of these two organizations allows them to benefit from each other’s knowledge and experience, resources, and customer base. At December 31, 2017 Rand’s investment in GiveGab was valued at approximately $424,000.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Rand’s portfolio consisted of 30 active companies. At that date, the portfolio was comprised of approximately 58% in equity investments and 42% in debt investments, compared with 64% in equity investments and 36% in debt investments at December 31, 2016. The change in investment mix reflects Rand’s strategy to generate sufficient investment income to cover operating expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nRand will host a conference call and live webcast today, March 8, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time to review its financial condition and results for the 2017 fourth quarter and full year, as well as its strategy and outlook.
