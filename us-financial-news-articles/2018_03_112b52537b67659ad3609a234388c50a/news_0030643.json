The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering together with proceeds from the issuance of new indebtedness, cash on hand and common stock consideration, to fund the company’s previously announced acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited, refinance its existing 2.50% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related fees and expenses.\nUnder certain circumstances the mandatory convertible preferred stock is subject to redemption at Assurant’s option, in whole but not in part, if the acquisition is not consummated. If for any reason the acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited is not consummated (and if Assurant does not exercise its option to redeem the mandatory convertible preferred stock), the net proceeds from this offering would be available for the refinancing of the 2018 Senior Notes and general corporate purposes.\nThe offering of the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
