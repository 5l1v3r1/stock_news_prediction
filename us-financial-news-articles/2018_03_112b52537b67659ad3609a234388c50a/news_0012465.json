The NAFTA market, which includes the United States, was the primary destination for both products.\nProtectionist measures from the United States have tested bilateral relations, which have generally improved since President Mauricio Macri took office in late 2015 and sought to boost Argentina’s foreign trade after more than a decade of populist rule. Macri has said he is willing to challenge U.S. tariffs on biodiesel imports at the World Trade Organization.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Peter Cooney\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T08:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:08:31.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
