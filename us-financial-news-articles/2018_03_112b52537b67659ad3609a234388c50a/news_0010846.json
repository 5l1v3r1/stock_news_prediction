Vital Conversations provides evidenced based psychological health programs and a digital platform that connects with Medibio’s technology to provide a complete suite of products and solutions for the Corporate Wellness market.\nWith a 3-year history of partnership, the acquisition will create a new corporate health offering for Medibio.

Mental health is one of the most significant and also the most treatable issues on the planet. Employees and their organizations deserve the best that science and technology have to offer, and we are delighted to become part of Medibio.”\nVital Conversations’ clients who have participated in the Mental Health Check-in program include PricewaterhouseCoopers, Wesfarmers and others for whom Vital Conversations delivers large-scale services to tens of thousands of employees. Such programs could provide Medibio a clear pathway for revenue generation.\nJack Cosentino, CEO and Managing Director at Medibio, says, “We are delighted to welcome our long-term partner into the fold of Medibio’s rapidly growing international team.
