Given Italy’s fiscal dynamics, this is concerning.”\nAt 132 percent of GDP, Italy has the European Union’s worst debt ratio after Greece.\nItalian government bond yields rose sharply on Monday in the wake of the election results, with investors positioning for a period of political instability.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield was trading at 2.09 percent, up 5 basis points on the day.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, Editing by Abhinav Ramnarayan and Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T19:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:07:21.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
