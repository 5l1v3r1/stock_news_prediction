We've been working with our vendors to plan for our increased capacity. Premier has always built fantastic boats and set the standard in the industry. Our customers can be confident that will continue. Several innovative projects paused over the past year are resuming. We're excited to show the marketplace what the Premier team and our dealers will accomplish next.\"\nFounders Bob and Betty Menne and Lori Melbostad will continue with the company under the new ownership as Premier starts to build its new story.\nAbout Premier Marine:\nPremier Marine Inc. is a manufacturer of luxury pontoon boats under the Premier brand.
