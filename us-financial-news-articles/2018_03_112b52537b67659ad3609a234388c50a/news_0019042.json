AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n* The impact of foreign exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. The Company uses a Constant Currency basis to show the impact from foreign exchange rates on current period revenue compared to prior period revenue using the prior period's foreign exchange rates. In order to properly understand the underlying business trends and performance of the Company's ongoing operations, management believes that investors may find it useful to consider the impact of excluding changes in foreign exchange rates from the Company's net operating revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders and Adjusted EBITDA. Constant currency results are calculated by dividing the current quarter or year to date local currency segment results by the prior year's average exchange rates for the quarter or year and comparing them to actual U.S. dollar results for the prior quarter or year. The prior year's average exchange rates are reported in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The average exchange rates for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are presented below.\nFor the three months\nended December 31,\nAverage Rates\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nCanadian dollar (CAD)\n1.2708\n1.3351\n4.8%\nEuros (EUR)\n0.8491\n0.9278\n8.5%\nPolish zloty (PLN)\n3.5922\n4.0649\n11.6%\nBritish pound (GBP)\n0.7534\n0.8051\n6.4%\nSource: Pacific Exchange Rate Service\nCENTURY CASINOS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n** The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders before interest expense (income), net, income taxes (benefit), depreciation, amortization, non-controlling interests (earnings) losses and transactions, pre-opening expenses, acquisition costs, non-cash stock-based compensation charges, asset impairment costs, (gain) loss on disposition of fixed assets, discontinued operations, (gain) loss on foreign currency transactions and other, gain on business combination and certain other one-time items. Intercompany transactions consisting primarily of management and royalty fees and interest, along with their related tax effects, are excluded from the presentation of net earnings (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA reported for each segment. Not all of the aforementioned items occur in each reporting period, but are included in the definition based on historical activity. These adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). Adjusted EBITDA is not considered a measure of performance recognized under US GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the Company and its properties. The gaming industry commonly uses Adjusted EBITDA as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to compare the relative operating performance of separate operating units by eliminating the above mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is used by the Company's lending institution to gauge operating performance. The Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry. Please see the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings (loss) attributable to Century Casinos, Inc. shareholders above.\n*** The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net operating revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure. Management uses this margin as one of several measures to evaluate the efficiency of the Company's casino operations.\nCENTURY CASINOS, INC.
