Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption.\nThe latest quake came as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country’s main island.\nThe impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner since the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s ( XOM.N ) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices. The company is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.\nReporting by Jane Wardell and Alison Bevege in SYDNEY.
