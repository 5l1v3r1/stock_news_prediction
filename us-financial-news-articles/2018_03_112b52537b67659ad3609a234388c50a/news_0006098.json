A value below zero indicates a drop in comparison with the same period a year ago.\nAccording to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private consumption.\nThe “willingness to buy” indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: “Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?”\nThe income-expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.\nThe additional business-cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:17:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
