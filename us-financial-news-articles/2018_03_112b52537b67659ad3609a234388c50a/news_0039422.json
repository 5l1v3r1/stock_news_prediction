Higgins was CEO of Ascendant Group Ltd, a Bermuda-based energy and infrastructure holding company, from 2012 to 2016, and has 40 years of experience in energy industry management roles, PREPA said in a statement. Hurricane Maria cut electricity to all of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million American citizens when it struck in September. Former CEO Ricardo Ramos stepped down in November.
