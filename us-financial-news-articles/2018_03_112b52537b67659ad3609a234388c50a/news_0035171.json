The government hopes to raise some 12.2 billion reais ($3.71 billion) from the privatization of Eletrobras. Speaking at an event in Rio de Janeiro, Maia said Congress had faced political difficulties trying to set up a commission to deal with the company’s privatization, which could portend difficulties in whipping up the votes needed to pass the program. “I’m still optimistic, but worried, because I felt last week that the atmosphere to vote on privatization isn’t so simple,” he said. $1 = 3.29 reais Reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by Sandra Maler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T21:34:13.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
