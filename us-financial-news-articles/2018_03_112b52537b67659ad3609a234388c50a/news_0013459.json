The offering was upsized from a previously announced amount of $3.5 billion. Net proceeds from the Notes are expected to be used to repay approximately $2.3 billion outstanding indebtedness under its U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen term loan agreements and, together with cash on hand, to redeem all $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of its 1.40% Senior Notes due 2018 and all $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% Senior Notes due 2019.\n“With the successful pricing of $4.5 billion of senior notes, we have completed an important piece of our financial plan. Furthermore, having taken care of our financing requirements for the coming years, Teva will now focus on execution of our restructuring plan and optimization of our business,” said Mike McClellan, Teva’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Notes consist of (i) $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.000% USD-denominated senior notes maturing in 2024 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.750% USD-denominated senior notes maturing in 2028, and (ii) €700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% EUR-denominated senior notes maturing in 2022 and €900 million aggregate principal amount of 4.500% EUR-denominated senior notes maturing in 2025, and will be issued by special purpose finance subsidiaries of Teva (the “Issuers”).\nThe Notes will be sold at a price of 100% of the principal amount thereof. The Issuers and Teva expect to enter into registration rights agreements with respect to the Notes. The settlement of the Notes is expected to occur on or about March 14, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nTeva will provide notice of redemption of the 1.40% Senior Notes due 2018 and the 2.875% Senior Notes due 2019 to holders of such notes and redemption of these notes is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Notes will be unsecured senior obligations of the Issuers and will be unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by Teva. The Notes were offered and sold (i) in the U.S. to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and (ii) to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the U.S. pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThe Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or the laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. or to, or for the benefit of, any U.S. persons absent registration under or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Teva\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) is a leading global pharmaceutical company that delivers high-quality, patient-centric healthcare solutions used by millions of patients every day.
