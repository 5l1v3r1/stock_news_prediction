The line is iconic because of the way it couples a vintage design feel with cutting edge camera functions. While other leading brands like Nikon (nikon) and Canon (caj) design some of the most high-tech DSLRs out there, Fujifilm took a step back. For a fraction of the cost and weight, Fujifilm’s X Series delivers quality photos with a sense of nostalgia.\nWhen designing the X-series, Imai wanted to tap into a childhood memory ubiquitous among photographers: discovering their father’s camera.\n“Father used to keep very good camera in his room. He would say, ‘Don’t touch that camera!'” Imai recounts. “That’s the camera I saw when I was a child.”\nImai wanted to capture that wistful longing and translate it into the device’s blueprint. He also wanted to design the camera in a way that appealed to all five senses. The manual dials, the synthetic leather, and the sound the camera makes when taking a photo are all designed in a sensuous way.\nDemand for digital cameras has dropped significantly with the rise of the smartphone. Camera makers have explored different ways to compete, like adding smart-phone capabilities such as being able to upload to social networking sites directly from the device. But since debuting in 2011, sales of the X-Series have increased five fold and Imai says the X-Series played an important tole in raising the profile of the design department inside the company.\nFor more coverage of Brainstorm Design, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T11:15:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
