For example, reports said that J&J and other major producers were fined more than 19 million yuan (currently $3.01 million) for price-fixing in China's eye glass and contact lens market in 2014. In the same year, GlaxoSmithKline was fined a record 3 billion yuan for paying bribes to doctors to use its drugs , according to Reuters.\nOn the possibility that China might react to the U.S. import tariffs by toughening its enforcement actions against American firms like J&J, Gorsky said the company always wants to be proactive.\n\"That calls for making sure that we've got great products that are right for the market, that are following the appropriate marketing practices, according to the local laws and compliance, which we always try to do. And, again, to continue to work with our customers and the government here in China to be successful,\" he said.\nGorsky added that J&J was in the process of building at least three new facilities in China for both manufacturing as well as research and development. \"And I think that kind of collaboration builds an overall better understanding and I think better positions us for the future,\" he said.\nThe CEO explained that he had seen some encouraging developments within the country in areas of regulatory procedures in approving pharmaceuticals, a greater willingness to think about using data from around the world, and reviewing life-saving medications in a more timely way.\n\"We are very encouraged by many of the changes that we're seeing. There's still work to be done, in areas such as [intellectual property] and others, but we're hopeful that we can continue to have a productive and important dialogue going forward,\" he said.\n— CNBC's Nyshka Chandran and Fred Imbert contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T03:09:46.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
