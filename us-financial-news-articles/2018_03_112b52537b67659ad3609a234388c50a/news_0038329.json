Gallagher is a highly regarded law enforcement executive, who served with great distinction for over two decades with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Most recently, he was the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Newark, NJ office, where he managed the activities of over 800 professionals. Gallagher brings with him a broad array of investigative experience spanning the areas of financial fraud, including matters involving the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as cyber-related criminal activities.\n\"Tim's exemplary track record dovetails well with Kroll's commitment to our global clientele. His investigative tenacity and expertise coupled with his sophisticated knowledge of digital threats will enable him to make an immediate impact,\" said Jason Smolanoff, Senior Managing Director and Global Cyber Security Practice Leader for Kroll. \"Most significantly, his demonstrated capacity to lead and to solve complex problems further reinforces the extraordinary team of professionals we have at Kroll.\"\n\"Tim understands the complexities of today's global risk landscape, especially how cyber security challenges amplify those risks,\" said David Fontaine, Chief Executive Officer of Kroll and its parent, Corporate Risk Holdings. \"He will bring a uniquely informed perspective and pragmatic guidance to our clients looking not only to manage active threats, but also to develop and refine enterprise risk management programs to protect their people, assets, and reputation.\"\nIn 2016, Gallagher was elevated to Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Newark Division, the agency's seventh largest field division. In addition to managing the entire office, he administered the multi-agency Joint Terrorism Task Force responsible for identifying and mitigating all terrorist threats throughout the State of New Jersey.\nThe year prior to this appointment, Gallagher served at the FBI's Headquarters in Washington, DC as Deputy Assistant Director of the Criminal Investigative Division, the largest division in the FBI. In this capacity, Gallagher focused on developing and executing effective strategies to mitigate globalized criminal threats with an economic nexus. He regularly collaborated with UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand law enforcement counterparts to combat fraud, money laundering, and cyber threats.\nFrom 2012-2015, Gallagher was the Special Agent in Charge of the Criminal and Cyber Division in the Washington, DC Field Office. During this time, he played leading roles in several crises and noteworthy investigations, including the September 2013 Washington Naval Yard shooting and a global interest rate investigation (LIBOR). Gallagher also led the multijurisdictional, multi-agency investigation that resulted in the subsequent prosecution of foreign-based cyber hackers, whose victims included government officials and high-net-worth individuals. Earlier in his tenure with the FBI, in 2010-2011, Gallagher was Section Chief, Cyber Division at FBI Headquarters, where he directed the transformation of the FBI's Cyber Program to meet ever-changing threats, such as those that arose in this case.\nIn another ground-breaking initiative as SAC in the Washington Field Office, Gallagher conceptualized and established a program to jointly address violations of the FCPA and intellectual property crimes, focusing on proactive outreach to the private sector. His work on this initiative was informed by his role in 2011-2012 as Section Chief, Financial Crimes, where he managed the largest investigative program inside the FBI Criminal Investigative Division focused on complex corporate fraud, health care fraud, bank fraud, and intellectual property rights.\nBefore joining the FBI in 1996, Gallagher held investigative and compliance roles with a number of federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, Office of Inspector General; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of Inspector General; and Department of Labor.\nGallagher earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Economics/Accounting at Saint Peter's University.\nAbout Kroll:\nKroll is the leading global provider of risk solutions.
