Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on climate change in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year.\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to the hearing to describe their views on \"the best science now available\" on global warming and rising sea levels.\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump took office 14 months ago, domestic climate change policy has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and said he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely.\nIn court on Wednesday, Boutrous said Chevron supports a 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded it was \"extremely likely\" humans contribute to warming. However, Boutrous also said earlier IPCC reports were not as certain.\nThe judge asked Boutrous if the other four companies agreed with his presentation, and Boutrous said he was only speaking for Chevron.\nNo attorneys for the other four companies answered questions at the hearing, though all generally acknowledge the reality of climate change.\n\"I'm going to ask them at some point if they agree with everything you said,\" Alsup said.\nAll five companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for warming, which is caused by \"billions\" of parties and \"complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.\" (Reporting by Dan Levine; editing by Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-21T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-21T22:34:35.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
