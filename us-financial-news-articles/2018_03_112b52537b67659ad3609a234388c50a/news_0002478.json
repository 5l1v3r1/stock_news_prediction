Introduced 2018 net sales guidance of $160 million to $165 million.\n“Our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results illustrate the continuing demand for our novel iStent technologies, which offer physicians and patients a viable alternative to daily, lifelong use of topical glaucoma medications or invasive surgeries,” said Thomas Burns, Glaukos president and chief executive officer. “As we move into 2018, we remain focused on strengthening our beachhead position in the combination-cataract market segment while advancing our comprehensive pipeline of next-generation surgical devices and sustained pharmaceutical therapies, which we believe will significantly expand our addressable market opportunity and facilitate our evolution into a hybrid ophthalmic medical device and pharmaceutical company.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales rose 26% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $41.7 million, compared to $33.2 million in the same period in 2016. The growth reflected unit volume increases worldwide, higher average selling prices and expansion of the company’s direct sales operations into new international markets.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately 89%, compared to approximately 85% in the same period in 2016.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 31% to $36.5 million, compared to $27.9 million in the same period in 2016.

The company pioneered Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, or MIGS, to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. Glaukos launched the iStent, its first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and is leveraging its platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of micro-scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. The company believes the iStent, measuring 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide, is the smallest medical device ever approved by the FDA.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.
