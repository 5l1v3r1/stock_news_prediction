She seems equally engaged by the real-life events and politics of the world she inhabits and its visual phenomena, especially those visual phenomena ignored or insufficiently considered by the rest of us. She embodies those wide-ranging concerns in ways that can seem, at first, extremely various. But we soon become aware of insistent constants. We realize that we’re meeting a perceptive, engaged individual with an acute eye, a rigorous sense of organization, and an ability to make us look hard at things we might have otherwise dismissed and consider them as potent metaphors for loss, anger, mourning, obsession and more.\nZoe Leonard: Survey\nWhitney Museum of American Art\nThrough June 10\nMore Art Reviews\n‘Zoe Leonard: Survey’ Review: Diverse, Yet Single-Minded March 3, 2018 ‘Fra Angelico: Heaven on Earth’ Review: Pictures Fit for a Pope February 23, 2018 ‘Leon Golub: Raw Nerve’ Review: Raging at Injustice With a Brush February 19, 2018 “Zoe Leonard: Survey,” at the Whitney Museum, is a tightly focused but comprehensive overview of this protean artist that includes photography from the late 1980s to 2016; two- and three-dimensional installations made between 1992 and the present; and a new, site-specific text installation that visitors must seek out. Unfortunately, the show lacks any of Ms. Leonard’s magical camera-obscura rooms, with their random quotidian occurrences projected, inverted, around the walls. Organized by Bennett Simpson, senior curator, with Rebecca Matalon, curatorial associate, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, where the show originated, the exhibition has been elegantly installed at the Whitney by the museum’s assistant curator, Elisabeth Sherman. The handsome catalog contextualizes everything on view with many additional works and informative essays.\nConfronted by Ms. Leonard’s early images of rushing water, clouds through airplane windows, a surprising take on Niagara Falls, and distant views of the urban landscape (photographed between 1986 and 1989, but often printed later), we grasp her taste for repetition and shifting viewpoints, her quirkiness and individuality. A railroad yard or a chunk of suburbia seen from above becomes an abstract pattern because of the multiplicity of similar elements, further abstracted by the blurring of detail in Ms. Leonard’s gelatin silver prints. A black border surrounding each frame reminds us of the artifice of printing and affirms that Ms. Leonard doesn’t crop her images.\nZoe Leonard’s ‘TV Wheelbarrow’ (2001) Photo: Collection of the New York Public Library Photographs dominate, but the installation is enriched, at intervals, by other works. In the first gallery, there’s a robust, ad hoc table with literally thousands of postcards of Niagara Falls, sorted by image and stacked, along with a row of worn blue suitcases, annually added to, one for each year of Ms. Leonard’s life. As we move through “Survey,” other kinds of repetitions, like a subtle drumbeat, assert themselves. A vast wall papered with more postcards of Niagara Falls, grouped to restate the site’s geography, reiterates the dull blues of the suitcases while revealing the shifts in color and clarity in apparently identical, mass-produced images. We think about accumulation, obsession, visual codes and the reduction of a physical phenomenon to a logo, while remembering that almost unrecognizable aerial view of the falls at the beginning of the show.\nElsewhere, a gallery is devoted to “Strange Fruit” (1992-97), a large scattering of stitched-together fruit skins and banana peels, allowed to shrivel and decay. Made during the AIDS crisis, before effective treatment, when the gay community, with which Ms. Leonard identifies, was both decimated and stigmatized, the work and its blackened, crumpled objects can be read as a memento mori, a comment on the passage of time, and an uningratiating still-life.\nZoe Leonard’s ‘Untitled’ (1989) Photo: Zoe Leonard Other works catalog the weird (eerie female wax anatomical models with their vital organs exposed), the ephemeral (half-glimpsed reflections in ornate mirrors), and the gritty (rude graffiti). Some of Ms. Leonard’s most compellimg series are of the notably ordinary. “The Analogue Portfolio” (1998-2009), 40 dye-transfer prints, documents shop fronts in Ms. Leonard’s Lower East Side neighborhood and abroad. The modest-size typological comparisons remind us of Bernd and Hilla Becker’s dispassionate collections of building types and water towers, while the shop displays and reflections make us think of Eugène Atget’s records of Paris, but Ms. Leonard’s interest in incongruous juxtapositions and wordplay provides a wry, personal subtext. The rich, matte color and square, head-on, tightly cropped views intensify the blunt, rough-hewn quality of the subject matter, making the workaday poetic and poignant.\nDetail of Zoe Leonard ‘The Fae Richards Photo Archive’ (1993-96) Photo: Whitney Museum of American Art, New York Trees—trapped by fences, grown into railings intended to protect them, fused with and distorted by their surroundings—become the tragic protagonists of wordless narratives. Photographed in 1998, they could be read as surrogate victims of the AIDS crisis, here memorialized more subtly than in “Strange Fruit.” Yet, at the same time, the trees’ triumphant survival despite brutal constraints can be read as a sign of hope. Near-abstract, suffocating images of sealed-up windows have no such ambiguity.\nInstallation view of Zoe Leonard’s ‘Strange Fruit’ (1992-97) Photo: Philadelphia Museum of Art At her best, Ms. Leonard conveys her passionate convictions through expressive, visually arresting images. The title’s “survey” could be a verb, connoting active looking, rather than a noun meaning “overview.”\n—Ms. Wilkin is an independent curator and critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T11:32:10.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
