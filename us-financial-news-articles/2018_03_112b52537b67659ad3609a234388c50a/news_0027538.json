President Donald Trump immediately replaced him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel was named CIA director.\nGold futures for April were trading at $1,327, up about a half percent.\n\"Gold loves any turbulence, any uncertainty,\" said Kevin Grady, president of Phoenix Futures and Options.\nGrady said gold was bid higher after the 8:30 a.m. ET release of CPI showed tame inflation, exactly in line with economists' consensus estimate of a 0.2 percent gain. The low reading on inflation is not likely to spur faster Fed rate hikes, and that also brought in buyers.\nThe Tillerson exit was also a plus for gold. \"The news gives you support but I wouldn't say, 'I need to be long gold. Gold is going to explode because Tillerson is out,'\" said Grady. \"It's more uncertainty for the market. More uncertainty in general. I think a lot of these things keep a bid in gold.\"\nGold has tried unsuccessfully to break out. \"The 100-day moving average is right around $1,307, and the 200-day is right around $1,297, so we've been holding right around these lows, and the market keeps selling off,\" he said. \"But it's holding these levels because I think there's so much uncertainty in the market.\"\nGrady said Tillerson's exit was viewed as a negative, but the fact that Trump has said he would talk to North Korea was seen as a positive development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T16:26:46.097+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
