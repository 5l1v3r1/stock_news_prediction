(Nasdaq:CTHR), the original and leading worldwide source of created moissanite, reports financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nSuzanne Miglucci, President and CEO of Charles & Colvard, said, “We believe these fourth quarter results validate our strategic direction and demonstrate our ability to execute. We delivered on our plans for the year and passed a key inflection point for the business with the achievement of profitability in Q4 2017, powered by 42% net sales growth and a 42% gross margin. We believe our omnichannel expansion has been effective in providing broad product availability to a wide range of customers in both traditional outlets, such as Helzberg Diamonds stores, through online marketplaces, such as Amazon.com , and from our own charlesandcolvard.com e-commerce site, which had a 117% increase in fourth quarter net sales.”\n“During 2017, we innovated the Forever One TM product line, expanded our finished jewelry line, evolved our customer service function, and continued to amplify our global marketing efforts,” Ms. Miglucci continued. “We gained exposure to more than 25 million consumers through influencer marketing campaigns and our expanded social media efforts. This fourth quarter represented the first time in Charles & Colvard history that our net sales from our Online Channels segment exceeded sales from our Traditional segment.”\n“We are confident in our path ahead and laser focused on four key strategies in 2018. These include driving organic revenue growth in the U.S. and maintaining attractive margins; expanding our gemstone and jewelry offerings to serve a broad range of customers; targeting the global market opportunity through continued brand building, focused channel expansion, and world-class customer service; and balancing growth-oriented investments to generate sustainable earnings improvement. These strategies should enable us to continue scaling the business, growing near-term revenues with our existing cost infrastructure, but also making prudent investments to ensure long-term success,” Ms. Miglucci concluded.\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nExpanded the Forever One™ moissanite collection to a total of 14 cuts and released Forever One™ melee accent gemstones that enhance the fire and brilliance of jewelry products such as rings, earrings and pendants; Launched a variety of men’s wedding bands, rings and single stud earrings to offer customers a one-stop shop for all fashion and bridal jewelry; Released limited natural green moissanite jewelry as a part of the Love Green, Live Green initiative to raise awareness for global sustainability; Expanded the availability of Forever One™ gemstones and jewelry across the U.S. with expansion into nearly all Helzberg Diamonds retail stores; Introduced Forever One™ moissanite to the Chinese consumer with multiple product listings on Alibaba’s Tmall fulfilled through a partnership with VoyageOne, a leading provider of cross-border e-commerce solutions; Featured its popular Forever One™ moissanite stud earrings on NBC’s Megyn Kelly TODAY show as part of “Megyn’s Golden Goodies” segment; Enhanced the senior sales and marketing team with the additions of Vice Presidents of Marketing, Traditional Sales, and Online Channels and International Sales; and Presented at the Global E-Commerce Leaders Forum, the 10th Annual LD Micro Main Event Conference and the Benchmark Micro Cap Discovery One-On-One Conference.\nFinancial Summary for the Fourth Quarter 2017\nContinuing operations for the quarter, full year and prior periods do not include the results of Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC (dba Lulu Avenue ® ), which are now being reported as a discontinued operation following the sale of certain assets on March 4, 2016 to Yanbal USA, Inc.\nNet sales from continuing operations were $8.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 42% compared with $6.0 million in the year-ago fourth quarter.
