His visit to the U.S. Embassy to meet with American diplomats was scrapped.\nA rigorous schedule that included stops in three African countries on Friday has been made even more strenuous for Mr. Tillerson by events in Washington. Mr. Tillerson was up much of the previous night working the phones when President Donald Trump agreed to a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nMr. Tillerson arrived in Kenya on Friday afternoon for the third stop on his five-country tour of Africa. He had started his day Friday in Ethiopia with the North Korea announcement and flew to Djibouti for a brief visit before continuing on to Nairobi.\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
