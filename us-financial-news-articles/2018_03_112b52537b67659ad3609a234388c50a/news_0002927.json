On the year, it posted an increase of 1.5 percent, in line with the previous two months.\n“Even if you manufacture goods, if someone doesn’t buy them, you have to scale back your production, leading to slowdown in global economic activities,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.\n“I would expect markets entered another period of correction,” he added.\nU.S. Treasury yields fell as the risk of a trade war appeared to push aside considerations of inflation, a major theme that spooked global financial markets earlier this year.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.811 percent, hitting its lowest level in three weeks and further extending the distance from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb 21.\nSome say, on the other hand, markets may be over-reacting.\n“Trump has been repeatedly boasting about rise in share prices. If this is going to lead to a sustained drop in share prices, I bet he is likely to change his stance,” said Nobuyuki Kashihara, head of research at Asset Management One.\nIn the currency market, the dollar’s rebound following the bullish comments on the U.S. economy from new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday lost steam.\nThe euro jumped back to $1.2271, after having hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 on Thursday.\nThe dollar slipped to 106.14 yen, edging back towards its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16.\nThe dollar index is still down 2.1 percent this year, dogged by suspicions that the Trump administration prefers a weaker dollar to mend its bulging trade deficit. Worries that Trump’s big tax cuts and spending plans may boost fiscal deficits to the extent that they undermine confidence in U.S. debt have also dragged on the greenback.\nOil prices were also under pressure, having fallen more than one percent the previous day as Trump’s trade move raised worried about the global economy.\nU.S. crude traded at $61.19 per barrel, up 0.4 percent in Asia on Friday after having fallen to two-week low of $60.18 on Thursday. It is down 3.7 percent so far this week.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T06:44:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
