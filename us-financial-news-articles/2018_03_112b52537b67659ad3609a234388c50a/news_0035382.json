As Senior Director, Communication Expert, Graebe will partner with Dynamic Signal’s sales and customer success teams, offering an additional layer of communication leadership expertise, and counseling clients on the value of modernizing employee communication.\nAn industry expert, Graebe joins Dynamic Signal with an accomplished 16 years working in-house for the communication team at SAS, the leader in business analytics software and multi-year winner of Fortune’s Best Companies to Work For. Starting her career as a communication specialist with SAS, Graebe was instrumental to the company’s award-winning global intranet and enterprise social media channels. Most recently, she held the title of Director of Communications, overseeing traditional and digital employee communication efforts, focused on aligning, connecting and encouraging the company’s 14,000 employees to communicate amongst each other, creating an inclusive and collaborative culture, key to the organization’s long-term success.\n“With two decades of internal communication experience, I’ve had a unique perspective in watching how employee expectations have shifted as technology changes the way we communicate in our everyday lives. I’ve seen how employees are impacted by changes in the workplace over the past two decades,” said Graebe. “During my time with SAS, I also had the benefit of using Dynamic Signal as an employee. The award-winning SAS 140 program, powered by Dynamic Signal, allowed employees like me to feel more connected and empowered, showcasing the opportunities this technology is creating for transforming the way companies communicate with their employees. I’m excited to join Dynamic Signal to work directly with my peers in communication as we collectively strive to elevate employee communication and engagement.”\nAs today’s workforce evolves, Employee Communication and Engagement continues to see significant growth and attention. Companies recognize that traditional methods of communicating with employees are no longer effective, and many are struggling to streamline and measure communication in the workplace. Leading a $5 billion market, Dynamic Signal has seen rapid adoption, currently available to millions of employees across 6 continents in more than 100 countries. With the new addition of Graebe, Dynamic Signal is positioned to offer more resources to partner with clients, deliver expert advice and personalized counsel to support the advancement of their Employee Communication and Engagement efforts.\n“This is a critical time for companies to really take a good look at how they’re driving organizational alignment. The destination model for employee communication is no longer effective. Technology has advanced how we receive information, and it’s no longer enough to put one size fits all information on an intranet and hope employees go and get it. Today’s employees expect a distribution model where companies push relevant information to the channels on which they want to receive it,” said Dynamic Signal CMO, Joelle Kaufman. “With her deep expertise in internal communication, Becky provides both strategic counsel and deep empathy for communication professionals facing these urgent changes. We’re thrilled to have Becky on our team and support our community of communicators who are navigating these important shifts in how we reach, align, and engage today’s modern workforce.”\nGraebe joins on the heels of significant growth, as Dynamic Signal recently announced a 70 percent YoY growth in customers as well as the launch of several new product features including Surveys and Newsletters. Dynamic Signal expects to more than double its headcount in 2018 to meet market demand, continuing to be the leading Employee Communication and Engagement Platform.\nGraebe also serves on the Employee Communications Section board for the Public Relations Society of America, is an active member of Triangle Women in Communications, and volunteers as a journalism instructor with Citizen Schools.\nAbout Dynamic Signal\nDynamic Signal, the Employee Communication and Engagement Platform, connects organizations with their most valued asset – their employees.
