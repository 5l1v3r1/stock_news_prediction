They said an undersecretary at the Department of Defense, Robert Wilkie, will be the acting secretary. \nShulkin had drawn fire for a damning report from the inspector general of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It found that during a trip to London and Denmark he improperly accepted tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament and his chief of staff made false statements so Shulkin’s wife could travel at government expense. \nOne official said the criticism of Shulkin was “making it harder for him to carry out the duties of secretary of the VA, which is something the president has made clear is a big priority for him.” \nJackson, a rear admiral of the U.S. Navy, has been working as a presidential physician since the George W. Bush administration, and has been the lead doctor monitoring Trump’s health since Trump became president. \nJackson gave Trump a clean bill of health early this year after giving the president a physical. He put him on a diet to lose some weight and directed him to get some exercise. Aides said Trump has been eating more fish and fewer cheeseburgers lately. \nA Texas native who has been on active duty since 1995, Jackson served during the U.S.-led war in Iraq as an emergency medicine physician in Taqaddum, Iraq.

That’s how strongly he feels about getting them represented properly,” the official said. \nTrump said he appreciated Shulkin’s work, including passage of the VA Accountability Act.”He has been a great supporter of veterans across the country and I am grateful for his service,” Trump said in a statement. \nU.S. Representative Phil Roe, a Republican who chairs the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, said he hated to see Shulkin go but respected Trump’s decision.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/Files \n“At the end of the day, cabinet secretaries serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. \nWill Fischer, director of government relations for the VoteVets lobby group, said his group hopes Jackson will oppose any attempt to privatise the VA or its health services, a concept that Republicans talk about occasionally. \n“If Dr. Jackson can do that, immediately, he will do a lot to help his chances at confirmation,” Fischer said. \nThe VA oversees healthcare and benefits going to roughly 20 million U.S. military veterans. The Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, provides care at more than 1,200 facilities, including 170 VA Medical Centers, to more than 9 million veterans. \nTrump praised Shulkin as “fantastic” when he chose him to head the VA in January 2017. Trump, who promised improved veterans’ care during his presidential campaign, last year said the department had made “tremendous progress” under Shulkin. \nBut support for him at the White House eroded quickly in recent weeks as Trump grew weary of the drumbeat of negative headlines about him. \nShulkin said after the release of the inspector general’s report that he would comply with its recommendations, including reimbursing the government for his wife’s $4,312 airfare and paying his friend for the Wimbledon tickets. The department announced two days after the report was issued that Shulkin’s chief of staff, Vivieca Wright Simpson, would retire.
