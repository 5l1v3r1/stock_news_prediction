Coke plants must extend their production time to over 48 hours, meaning less dust will be produced during the process.\nFactories in heavily polluted Tangshan have been forced to cut production by as much as 50 percent during China’s 2017/18 winter months as part of a targeted environmental protection campaign.\nThe city, which accounts for about 12 percent of the country’s steel output, said last month it would extend restrictions on production after the end of the winter heating season on March 15. It plans to ask mills to cut utilization rates by 10-15 percent from March 16 to Nov. 14 to improve air quality.\nShanghai’s most traded steel rebar contract was up 0.5 percent at 4,059 yuan ($639.91) a tonne at 0303 GMT, reaching its highest in nearly three months.\nReporting by Tom Daly; editing by Richard Pullin and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T09:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T04:47:08.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
