I have been impressed by his two books, 'Running Lean' and 'Scaling Lean' and what he has accomplished with LeanStack. He has taken a holistic view of the entrepreneur's journey and developed a mix of software and paper tools that help founders to plan and manage market exploration, experiments that attack the riskier hypotheses in their business model, and challenges they will face in scaling up.\"\nAsh Maurya observed, \"I was gratified when Sean starting using LeanStack and asked to join our community of practice for mentors. He is a born entrepreneur who has been advising startups full time for 15 years. Like myself, he reads widely and writes about what he has learned, offering a synthesis that credits the original sources. His focus is on the new product introduction problem, in particular getting not only early adopters but traction.\"\nLeanStack's groundbreaking Customer Forces Canvas builds on Jobs-To-Be-Done and Action Research thinking by Kurt Lewin, Clayton Christensen, and Bob Moesta. \"I am particularly excited by the synthesis of a number of different insights related to adoption and process change that Ash has developed in the Customer Forces Canvas: it's a very powerful lens to apply for mapping out the forces at work promoting and working against an innovation in a firm,\" said Sean Murphy.\nAbout SKMurphy Inc.\nSKMurphy ( https://www.skmurphy.com/ ) is an experienced team with an partner network of experts who help early stage and established technology firms with new product introduction.
