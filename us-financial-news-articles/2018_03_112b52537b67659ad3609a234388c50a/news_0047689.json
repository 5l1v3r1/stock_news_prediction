(NASDAQ:CWBR) (TSXV:COB.U) (“CohBar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce the closing of its first tranche of its previously announced private placement (the “Private Placement”) offering of non-convertible unsecured promissory notes (the “Notes”).\nPursuant to the first tranche of the Private Placement, the Company has issued Notes in the aggregate principal amount of US$2,142,500 and 428,500 warrants (the “Warrants”) to the subscribers of the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum and mature on March 29, 2021. The Warrants are exercisable at a price of US$5.30 per common share until March 29, 2021; provided, however, that the expiry date may be accelerated in the event that some or all of the Notes are repaid prior to March 29, 2019. Certain insiders of the Company participated in the Private Placement and acquired Notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately US$490,000 and 98,000 Warrants.\nThe Company intends to use the proceeds from the Notes primarily to support clinical activities for its lead drug candidate and for general corporate purposes. The second tranche of the Private Placement is anticipated to close in mid-April 2018.\nThe offering described herein is being made pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), solely to “accredited investors” (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and in Canada pursuant to exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws.
