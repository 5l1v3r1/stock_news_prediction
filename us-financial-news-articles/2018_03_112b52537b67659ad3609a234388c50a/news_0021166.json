It lead investigator will be a former auditor-general, Terrence Nombembe.\nThe commission will be able to make recommendations for prosecutions.\nThe commission stems from a 2016 anti-graft report by the Public Protector, a regulatory office with a robust constitutional mandate, that called for an investigation into what is known in South Africa as “state capture.”\nIt focused on allegations that the brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta had influenced the appointment of ministers.\nSouth Africa’s chief prosecutor last month declared Ajay Gupta “fugitive from justice” wanted in connection with a criminal investigation.\nReporting by Ed Stoddard, editing by Larry King\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T17:31:55.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
