We are confident about the ongoing ICC arbitration,” it said in a statement.\nCofco says it overpaid in its acquisition of Rotterdam-based Nidera due to misrepresentations by the former owners.\nIt requested the asset freeze to support a claim of more than $500 million in damages against Cygne. It also claimed $288 million against individual directors of Cygne and Swansea as well as Swansea itself, which is the sole shareholder of Cygne, the court ruling showed.\nThe court justified its decision by arguing it was unlikely Cofco’s claim would amount to more than the $187.5 million which the ICC ordered last year to be put in an escrow account as part of the arbitration.\nCygne said the arbitration case was unsubstantiated as Cofco was arguing former Nidera shareholders should be liable for irregularities in Brazil, even if they had no knowledge of them.\nCofco bought Nidera in two steps, paying $1.3 billion in 2014 for a 51 percent stake, and buying the remainder in 2017 for $448 million.\nCofco International’s chief executive said last week his focus this year would be on integration. Cofco has invested more than $3 billion in acquiring both Nidera and the agriculture arm of Noble Group since 2014.
