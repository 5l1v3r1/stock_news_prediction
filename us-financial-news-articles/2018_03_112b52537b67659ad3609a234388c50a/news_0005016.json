Bones of contention included raising the target for black ownership to 30 percent from 26 percent.\nMantashe is a former General Secretary of the powerful National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and is chairman of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). He is known for his gruff, blunt style and tough negotiating skills.\nThe Chamber of Mines industry body this week described Mantashe as “a man of integrity and dignity, and who brings with him a sound and fundamental knowledge of the industry he will lead and enable.”\nReporting by Nqobile Dludla; Writing by Ed Stoddard; Editing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:06:52.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
