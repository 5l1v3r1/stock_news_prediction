Craig Anderson had 25 saves for the Senators, who snapped an overall five-game losing streak and also a six-game road losing streak.\nReilly Smith, coming off a 20-point February that earned him the NHL’s third star of the month, Colin Miller and William Karlsson each had a goal and an assist, and Ryan Carpenter also scored for Vegas. Marc-Andre Fleury finished with 33 saves.\nVegas managed only three shots in the first period but scored on two of them to take a 2-1 lead. Smith started the scoring just 58 seconds into the game with his 22nd goal of the season, backhanding a pass from Jonathan Marchessault past the glove of Anderson.\nThe lead didn’t last long. Stone tied it, 1-1, at 2:19 converting a pass from Ryan in front of the net past Fleury’s outstretched pad.\nMiller gave the Golden Knights a 2-1 lead just before the end of the period, firing in a long wrist shot from the right point past an Erik Haula screen and under Anderson’s right arm on the power play for his eighth goal of the season.\nRyan tied it early in the second period with a breakaway goal through Fleury’s five-hole, cashing in on a pass from Stone from deep in his own zone as the Golden Knights got caught in a line change.\nDuchene and Pageau followed with goals just four minutes apart to give Ottawa a 4-2 edge but William Karlsson started the third period with his 35th goal of the season, tops in the Western Conference, and Carpenter followed a few minutes later with a shorthanded goal to tie it.\nBurrows then gave Ottawa a 5-4 lead just 56 seconds later, deflecting an Erik Karlsson blast from the right point past Fleury for what proved to be the game-winner.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T14:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:58:02.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
