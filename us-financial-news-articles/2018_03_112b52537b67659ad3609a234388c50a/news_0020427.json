The president has cited the trade deficit with China as a big reason for the measures even though Canada and Mexico are bigger exporters of steel to the United States. Trump has hinted that his administration will take further action against China directly. \nBlock isn't a fan of the way Trump is planning the tariffs. He said the U.S. should work closely with its allies and focus the tariffs on China. \nTrump's tariffs \"could actually end up creating more problems than it solves,\" he said. \"This should at least be a G-7-wide effort to punish China. ... We're actually being painting as the bad guys here\" as the lone wolf versus working with partners. \nBlock is chief investment officer of investment firm Muddy Waters Capital. He is known for his short-selling research, which led to several government fraud investigations and financial restatements.
