In October, J&J announced it had decided to close Animas and exit the insulin pump market. It chose Medtronic as its partner to transition current patients.\nShares of J&J dipped 0.6 percent in morning trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T14:10:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
