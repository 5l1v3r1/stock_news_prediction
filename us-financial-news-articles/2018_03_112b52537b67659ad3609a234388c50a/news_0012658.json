There are also LGBT archives in Toronto and Melbourne.\n“I look forward to the opening of the new museum and the role it will play in shining a light on LGBTQ+ history,” London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement.\nChris Smith, the first openly gay British lawmaker, and Sandy Nairne, the former director of the National Portrait Gallery, are on the advisory board, as is Lisa Power, co-founder of gay-equality organization Stonewall.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
