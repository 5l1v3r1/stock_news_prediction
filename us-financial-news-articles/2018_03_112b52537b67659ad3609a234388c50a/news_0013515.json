The discussions between Prudential Assurance Malaysia Berhad and retirement fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP) are not exclusive, and details of a possible deal could be finalised as early as this month, said the people. Foreign insurers are required to cut their stakes in their local units to 30 percent to abide by a directive announced by Malaysia’s central bank last year, under an initiative to lift domestic participation in the industry. That has prompted a rush from the likes of Prudential, Tokio Marine Holdings, and Zurich Insurance Group in Malaysia to find ways of divesting stakes and submit their plans to the regulator before a June deadline. The wholly-owned Malaysian life insurance unit of Britain’s largest insurer by assets is one of the leading foreign insurers in the Southeast Asian country. KWAP CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad told Reuters that the fund had submitted its offer for the Prudential unit’s stake, but declined to give details. Prudential did not comment on the talks, but said it was committed to its local business. There is no certainty that Prudential’s talk with KWAP will result in a deal, and the former could also weigh a listing on the Malaysian bourse to divest the stake, said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks were not public. The Malaysian regulator’s new rule had stoked some concern among foreign insurers as a small number of large local funds in the country meant they will be competing for the same pool of institutional investors. Foreign ownership of Malaysian insurers was set in 2009 at 70 percent - or more if the buyer could help consolidate and rationalise the industry. But some foreign insurers operating in the country could still be wholly owned by an overseas parent. Prudential’s Malaysian unit, whose net premium earnings rose 3.3 percent to 3.1 billion ringgit ($795 million) in the six-month period ended June 2017, has an embedded value of about 5.5 billion ringgit, one of the people said. That values a 30-percent stake in the unit at 1.7 billion ringgit ($435.79 million). Embedded value is the net asset value of an insurer plus the present value of potential future profits from existing life and health insurance contracts.
