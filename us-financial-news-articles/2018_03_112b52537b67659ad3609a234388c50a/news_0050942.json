It has run its Amazon Prime Now delivery service in the French capital since 2016.\nCasino’s rival Carrefour also announced in January a 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion) investment in digital commerce over the next five years.\n$1 = 0.8019 euros Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Dominique Vidalon\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:05:05.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
