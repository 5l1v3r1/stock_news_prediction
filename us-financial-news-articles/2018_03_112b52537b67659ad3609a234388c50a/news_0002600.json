There are people who have obsessed over that all their life, nothing is left of them. What counts is the work you do for the country.”\nReporting by Marine Pennetier; Writing by Michel Rose; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:28:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
