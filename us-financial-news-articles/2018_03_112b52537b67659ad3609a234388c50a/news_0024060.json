(NASDAQ: SCKT), a leading innovator of data capture and delivery solutions for enhanced productivity, today announced the preliminary results of its \"modified Dutch auction\" self-tender offer for the purchase of up to 1,250,000 shares of its common stock, which expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Friday, March 9, 2018.\nBased on the preliminary count by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the tender offer, a total of approximately 1.4 million shares of Socket Mobile's common stock were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or below a purchase price of $3.90 per share, including approximately 0.2 million shares that were tendered through notice of guaranteed delivery.\nIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer, and based on the preliminary count by the depositary, Socket Mobile expects to accept for purchase 1.25 million shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $3.90 per share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $4.9 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. Due to the oversubscription of the tender offer, Socket Mobile expects to accept for purchase approximately 87.4 percent of the shares properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or below the purchase price of $3.90 per share by each tendering stockholder (other than \"odd lot\" holders whose shares will be purchased on a priority basis).\nThe shares expected to be purchased in the tender offer represent approximately 17.6 percent of Socket Mobile's currently issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Based on these preliminary numbers, Socket Mobile anticipates that following settlement of the tender offer, it will have approximately 5.9 million shares outstanding. The determination of the final number of shares to be purchased, the final price per share and the proration factor is subject to confirmation by the depositary of the proper delivery of the shares validly tendered and not withdrawn.\nThe number of shares to be purchased and the price per share are preliminary. The actual number of shares validly tendered and not withdrawn, the actual number of shares to be purchased and the final price per share will be announced following the completion of the confirmation process. Payment for the shares accepted for purchase, and the return of all other shares tendered and not purchased, will occur promptly thereafter. Payment for shares will be made in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest.\nAbout Socket Mobile, Inc.\nFounded in 1992, Socket Mobile is a leading innovator of data capture and delivery solutions for enhanced productivity in retail point of sale, field service, transportation, manufacturing and other mobile markets.
