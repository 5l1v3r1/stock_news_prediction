The administration of Donald Trump has repeatedly delayed implementing the rule and had signaled that it might never move forward with it.\n\"It's not a surprise. We had some admission by the USDA that the industry had been camping out in their office bending their arms and their ears. It's disappointing. The power of Washington lobbyists wins again,\" said Francis Thicke, who runs an organic dairy and grows crops in southeastern Iowa near Fairfield.\nThe regulation was designed to ensure that organically grown livestock had enough space to lie down, turn around, stand up and fully stretch. It also prohibited removal of chicken beaks and cutting cattle tails and required improved living conditions including fresh air, proper ventilation and direct sunlight.\nDropping the rule \"reverses the nearly two decades of collaboration and feedback from farmers and consumers,\" said Matt Bershadker, CEO of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \"Millions of animals will continue to suffer each year because of the USDA's abdication of its duty to enforce meaningful organic animal welfare standards.\"\nKansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts in a statement echoed some in the livestock industry who said the rule would increase the paperwork burden and drive up the cost of production for farmers and ranchers.\n\"America's organic livestock and poultry producers can now breathe easy that they can maintain the health of their flocks and herds the best way they see fit, and they will not be driven out of business by another government regulation, said Roberts, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association President Kevin Kester said the rule would have \"vilified conventionally raised livestock without recognizing our commitment to raise all cattle humanely.\"\nThe withdrawal becomes effective May 13, the USDA said.\nThe retail market for organic food products was valued at $47 billion in the United States in 2016, and USDA said the number of certified organic operations increased domestically by 7 percent last year.\nThicke said a group of organic farmers in the U.S. have created their own label, the Real Organic Project, and hope to have pilot farms certified this summer with eventual rollout nationally. The group guarantees generous standards for organic animals and not what Thicke considers weak requirements set by the government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-13T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-13T01:50:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
