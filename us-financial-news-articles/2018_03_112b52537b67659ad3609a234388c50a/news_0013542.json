To facilitate that, he has invited state attorneys general who have cases in state courts not before him or who are conducting a multistate investigation to participate in those talks.\nWhile Polster in Wednesday’s order said some litigation will now take place, he directed three special masters appointed to facilitate settlement talks to continue participating in negotiations and scheduled another settlement hearing for May.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T22:56:45.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
