MicroLED is a new display technology that has grabbed the attention of several tech firms. Screens using MicroLED are thinner, brighter, use less power and are more durable than the OLED displays that are increasingly being adopted for a variety of smart devices. The new technology is however unproven and difficult to use, analysts say. “It is not clear whether MicroLED will be better than the OLED displays Apple uses for its smartwatches. At this point, this seems to me that Apple wants to show off - its more of what look what we can do rather than a realistic alternative,” said Dongbu Securities analyst S.R. Kwon. Apple is developing MicroLED screens at a secret plant in California in a project overseen by Lynn Youngs, who is in charge of iPhone and Apple Watch screen technology, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple declined to comment. FILE PHOTO: A visitor uses her iPhone X to take a photo of Apple Park t-shirts at the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, California November 17, 2017.

Shares in Sharp Corp, Japan Display Inc and LG Display Co Ltd ended the day between 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent lower. Other tech giants looking at the technology include Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Apple’s main contract manufacturer. It acquired U.S. MicroLED display startup eLux Inc last year through Sharp Corp and other group units. Sony Corp started selling large display systems using the technology for corporate users last year, and Samsung Electronics Co unveiled a MicroLED TV this January.
