Production at the field fell to 17,350 barrels-per-day (bpd) at maximum capacity in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 18,644 bpd in the third quarter, the spokeswoman said.\nThe suspension of Vincent production will likely tighten the supply of high-density, low-sulfur, or so-called heavy-sweet, crude from Australia, though the impact on the Asia-Pacific market may be limited since it has a small pool of buyers, the traders said.\nAbout one 550,000-barrel cargo a month of Vincent is exported and the usual buyers are in Malaysia, the United States and India.\n“Vincent crude has always been the hardest to sell among all the heavy (crude) grades as there are limited outlets for it as it’s far too heavy,” said a Singapore-based crude oil trader.\n“I don’t see a massive impact but there will be some.”\nThe Ngujima-Yin FPSO is being refitted as part of Woodside and Mitsui’s $1.9 billion Greater Enfield project that will start producing from three fields near Vincent by the middle of 2019.\nGreater Enfield is expected to initially produce more than 40,000 bpd of oil at 100 percent capacity, the Woodside spokeswoman added.\nThis oil will be processed and stored aboard the Ngujima-Yin FPSO.\nReporting by Jessica Jaganathan and Florence Tan; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:17:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
