The execution of our strategy led to both solid growth and increased diversification of revenues. In particular, we grew revenues from our Multisector clients by more than 10% in 2017. By addressing the evolving needs of our clients through investing in expanding the capabilities of our value offer, we are enabling sustainable growth. We are now able to provide a full set of solutions beyond our core offering in the CRM BPO industry, leveraging technologies such as artificial inteligence, automation and analytics to unveil the full potential of digital throughout the customer lifecycle.\"\nMauricio Montilha, Atento´s Chief Financial Officer, said, \"We were pleased to deliver revenue and EBITDA within our guidance for 2017. Our focus on disciplined capital allocation and strict working capital management drove a 48% adjusted EBITDA to cash conversion in the quarter allowing us to pay our first-ever dividend of $25.0 million ($0.3384/share) on November 28, 2017.\"\nMr. Reynal concluded, \"We are convinced that 2018 will be another year of great progress for us. A more favorable macro environment should support revenue growth. We will continue to invest in evolving our value offer to extend our market leadership in the digital age, allowing us to continue to be the reference partner for the CRM BPO needs of our clients.\"\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Consolidated Operating Results\nAll comparisons in this announcement, unless otherwise noted, are year-over-year and in constant-currency (CCY).\nThe positive revenue growth trend during the year continued into the fourth quarter of 2017. Consolidated revenues grew by 5.7%, reflecting good performance in the Americas region and strong expansion by Multisector clients. FY 2017 revenues increased by 5.1%. On a reported basis, total revenue increased 8.2% in Q4 and 9.3% in FY 2017.\nRevenues from Multisector increased 8.6% in Q4 and 10.9% in FY 2017, driven by new service and client wins in all regions. As a percentage of revenues, Multisector reached 61.5% in Q4 and 61.0% in FY 2017, up 150 bps and 350 bps, respectively. Revenues from Telefónica increased by 1.4% in Q4, reflecting good performances in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia. In FY 2017, Telefónica revenues decreased 3.0%. As mentioned in Q3 2017, our businesses in Mexico and Puerto Rico were affected by the natural disasters in September, with negative impacts in Q4 of $8.9 million in revenues. Excluding these one-off impacts, revenues would have grown 8.4% in Q4 2017.\nThe revenue mix from higher value-added solutions was stable in the quarter at 26.4% and increased 120 bps in FY 2017 to 26.5%.\nIn Q4, recurring net income attributable to owners of the parent company reached $15.9 million, with EPS growth of 11.4% to $0.21. In FY 2017, recurring net income totaled $55.2 million, with strong EPS growth of 14.8% to $0.75.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q4 2017 reached $55.1 million and $221.0 million for the full year. Both fourth quarter and FY Adjusted EBITDA margin were 11.5%. as compared to 13.3% and 12.6%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA Margin evolution is explained by softer volume in specific clients combined with strong comparison basis in Q4 2016, especially in Brazil and Spain. As with revenues, FY 2017 Adjusted EBITDA margin was in line with guidance.\nThe natural disasters in Mexico and Puerto Rico impacted Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter by $0.9 million.\nOperating cash flow totaled $57.0 million in Q4 and $162.7 million in FY 2017. Adjusted EBITDA to cash conversion was 47.7% in Q4 and 36.6% in FY 2017, with free cash flow before interest and acquisitions totaling $26.3 million and $81.0 million, respectively.\nOur focus on disciplined capital allocation led us to generate net cash of $23.7 million, even after $29.8 million of investment in acquisitions, allowing the Company to return capital to shareholders with its first-ever dividend payment of $25.0 million on November 28th, 2017.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, the Company had a cash position of $141.8 million and a net debt of $344.5 million. Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 1.6x in Q4, versus 1.5x both in Q3 2017 and Q4 2016.\nAdjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures and are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables\nSegment Reporting\n($ in millions)\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nCCY\ngrowth\nFY 2017\nFY 2016\nCCY\ngrowth\nBrazil Region\nRevenue\n224.5\n214.4\n+2.9%\n944.8\n816.4\n+6.3%\nOperating Income\n(0.2)\n1.3\n-116.4%\n13.7\n3.1\nn.m.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n29.6\n35.9\n-18.9%\n124.7\n121.0\n-4.1%\nMargin\n13.2%\n16.7%\n13.2%\n14.8%\nAmericas Region\nRevenue\n200.6\n172.8\n+14.9%\n758.0\n718.9\n+6.1%\nOperating Income\n3.1\n21.2\n-87.2%\n8.6\n41.3\n-80.7%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n20.6\n19.6\n+4.0%\n83.5\n92.0\n-9.1%\nMargin\n10.3%\n11.3%\n11.0%\n12.8%\nEMEA Region\nRevenue\n56.5\n55.3\n-6.1%\n223.4\n223.9\n-1.9%\nOperating Income/(Loss)\n(1.2)\n(1.7)\n-36.1%\n(13.6)\n(18.1)\n-26.2%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n3.2\n5.1\n-46.1%\n14.8\n16.3\n-13.4%\nMargin\n5.7%\n9.2%\n6.6%\n7.3%\nBrazil Region\nRevenue in Brazil grew solidly throughout the year, with Q4 up 2.9% and FY 2017 up 6.3%. Revenues from Multisector increased by 3.1% in Q4 and 10.5% in FY 2017. We continued to see robust commercial activity compensating for baseline volumes that have been below expectations as Brazil undergoes a gradual economic recovery.\nMultisector as a percentage of revenues increased another 20 basis points to 69.2% in Q4 and 260 bps in FY 2017, to 69.1%. Revenues from Telefónica grew 2.4% in Q4 on the back of higher volumes and decreased 1.9% in FY 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $29.6 million in Q4, with margins of 13.2%, impacted by lower volumes in specific clients combined with a strong comparison basis in Q4 2016. In FY 2017, Adjusted EBITDA reached $ 124.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 13.2%.\nAmericas Region\nAmericas delivered a strong revenue growth in the quarter, increasing 14.9% in Q4 and 6.1% in FY 2017, on the back of significant Multisector growth of 19.5% in Q4 and 12.0% in FY 2017. Revenue growth can be traced to new client wins and volume increases particularly in Argentina, Colombia, Chile and US Nearshore. As a percentage of revenues, Multisector continued to increase, up 230 bps to 59.0% in Q4, and up 300 bps to 58.0% in FY 2017. Telefónica revenues rose by 8.9% in Q4, reflecting positive results in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. In FY 2017, revenues from Telefónica decreased 1.0%.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $20.6 million in Q4, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%, while FY 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was $83.5 million, implying margins of 11.0%.\nEMEA Region\nRevenue in EMEA decreased 6.1% in Q4 and 1.9% in FY 2017 as a result of a drop in Telefónica revenue of 14.9% in Q4 and 5.9% in FY 2017.\nRevenues from Multisector increased 9.6% in Q4 and 5.4% in FY 2017, supported by new contracts and client wins, especially in non-Telefónica telcos. As a percentage of revenue, Multisector increased 580 bps to 41.8% in Q4 and 250 bps to 37.8% in FY 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $3.2 million in Q4 2017, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.7%. The decline is mostly explained by lower volumes and a strong comparison basis in Q4 2016.\nCash Flow and Capital Structure\nOperating cash flow totaled $57.0 million in Q4 and $162.7 million in FY 2017, while free cash flow before interest and acquisitions was $26.3 million and $81.0 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA to cash conversion was 47.7% in Q4 and 36.6% in FY 2017, in line with guidance.\nThe positive cash generation of $23.7 million in FY 2017, even after investing $29.8 million in acquisitions, allowed us to return capital to shareholders, paying our first ever dividend of $25.0 million ($0.3384/share) on November 28, 2017.\nCash capex in 2017 totaled 3.2% of Revenues, lower than the 3.8% in FY 2016, as we initiated 2017 with above-average spare capacity.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had Cash and Cash equivalents of $141.8 million and revolving credit facilities of $104 million, out of which $99 million were undrawn, implying total liquidity of $241 million. Total net debt with third parties was $344.5 million and the Adjusted LTM EBITDA to net debt ratio with third parties was 1.6x compared to 1.5x in both Q3 2017 and Q4 2016.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nWe expect a favorable macro environment combined with stable regulatory frameworks which should support growth in 2018 and should compensate for potential political uncertainties arising from Presidential Elections in Colombia (May), Mexico (July) and Brazil (October).\nFor Fiscal 2018, we are targeting:\nGuidance\nConsolidated Revenue Growth (CCY)\n3% to 6%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin Range (CCY)\n11% to 12%\nNet Interest Expense Range\n$40MM to $45MM\nCash Capex (% of Revenue)\n3.5% to 4.0%\nEffective Tax Rate impacting Rec. Net Income\n35% to 38%\nDiluted Share Count\n~73.9MM shares\nCash Conversion as % of Adj. EBITDA\n35% to 40%\nTopline growth should be driven by revenue expansion from Multisector clients. While baseline volume growth in Brazil has been below expectations given the gradual economic recovery, we have been able to offset this dynamic with solid commercial activity. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins should remain stable in 2018 and we expect no relevant non-recurring adjustments in 2018.\nThe debt refinancing concluded in Q3 2017 should provide for a reduction of $10-15 million in net interest expenses in 2018, already included in the guidance of $40-45 million. Effective tax rate impacting recurring net income should be between 35% to 38%, and cash conversion is expected to be in the range of 35% to 40%.\nShort Term trends\nWe expect Q1 and Q2 2018 revenues to be at the bottom range of the guidance. In terms of profitability, we expected seasonally lower Adjusted EBITDA Margins below guidance in Q1 and Q2.\nThis guidance assumes no change in the current operating environment, capital structure or exchange rates movements on the translation of our financial statements into U.S. dollars except where noted.\nNote: This guidance assumes no change in the current operating environment, capital structure or exchange rates movements on the translation of our financial statements into U.S. dollars except where noted.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 at 10:00 am ET to discuss its financial results.

Non-recurring items can be summarized as demonstrated below:\na)\nAcquisition and integration related costs incurred in 2015 are costs associated with the post-acquisition process in connection with a full strategy review and our SAP IT transformation project. These projects were substantially completed by the end of 2015.\nb)\nRestructuring costs incurred in 2015 and 2016 primarily included several restructuring activities and other personnel costs that were not related to our core result of operations. Restructuring costs incurred for year ended December 31, 2015 are primarily related to headcount restructuring activities in Spain. In addition, we incurred restructuring costs not related to our core results of operations in Argentina and Peru of $4.8 million, $2.5 million in Chile of restructuring expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of a new service delivery model with Telefónica, and certain changes to the executive team, and an additional $0.7 million related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Restructuring costs for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 are compounded of two main concepts: i) investments to lower our variable cost structure, which is mostly labor and ii) investments to drive a more sustainable lower-cost and competitive operating model. Both were direct response to the exceptional and severe adverse macroeconomic conditions in key markets such as Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico, which drove significant declines in volume. The restructuring program carried out in 2017 to adjust the indirect costs structure has been finalized in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nc)\nSite relocation costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 include costs associated with our strategic initiative to relocate call centers from tier 1 cities to tier 2 cities in Brazil to achieve efficiencies through lower rental costs, attrition and absenteeism. Site relocation costs incurred for three months and year ended December 31, 2016 are related to the investments in Brazil, to relocate and consolidate our sites from higher to lower costs locations. This program started in 2014 when 53 percent of our sites were in Tier 2 cities. We have not invested in this program for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 as it was completed in 2016.\nd)\nFinancing fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relate to non-core professional fees incurred during the IPO process, including advisory, auditing and legal expenses.\ne)\nOn November 8, 2016 the CVI nominal value of ARS666.8 million, or $135.6 million, was terminated. As a result, during the fourth quarter we recognized a gain of $41.7 million in \"Other gains\" representing the principle amount of the CVI.\nf)\nAsset impairments and other costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2015 mainly relate to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the Czech Republic (divested in December 2014) of $3.7 million and Spain of $28.8 million, offset by the amendment of the MSA with Telefónica, by which the minimum revenue commitment for Spain was reduced against a $34.5 million penalty fee paid by Telefónica. Other non-recurring items for three months and year ended December 31, 2016 refer mainly to other costs with the sale of Morocco operation related to the accrual of the reserve in amount of $3.1 million as guarantee to the buyer for potential indemnity related to eventual liability assessed from the period before the sale. For 2017 non-recurring items relates mostly to the recognition of the costs incurred or expected to be incurred to recover the operations in Mexico and Puerto Rico affected by recent natural disasters. These estimated costs of $3.2 million are related to third quarter of 2017 and includes costs that were incurred but could not be charged to customers (mainly salaries and benefits) and other extraordinary costs related to the natural disasters. In addition, there were costs incurred on the secondary offer process occurred in November.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Earnings to profit/(loss):\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions)\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2016\n2017\n(unaudited)\nProfit/(loss) from continuing operations\n52.2\n3.4\n(13.6)\n16.7\n(8.9)\nAcquisition and integration related costs (a) (*)\n0.1\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAmortization of acquisition related intangible assets (b)\n27.5\n24.2\n22.4\n6.3\n5.6\nRestructuring costs (c) (*)\n15.8\n33.7\n16.8\n14.7\n6.5\nSite relocation costs (d) (*)\n3.4\n9.3\n-\n2.8\n-\nFinancing fees (e) (*)\n0.3\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAsset impairments and Other (f) (*)\n6.8\n6.9\n7.3\n1.9\n2.5\nDTA adjustment in Spain (g)\n1.5\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNet foreign exchange gain on financial instruments (h)\n(17.5)\n(0.7)\n(0.2)\n(0.1)\n(2.9)\nNet foreign exchange impacts (i)\n4.0\n21.1\n23.4\n5.8\n19.3\nContingent Value Instrument (j)\n-\n(26.2)\n-\n(26.2)\n-\nFinancial non-recurring (k)\n-\n-\n17.7\n-\n-\nDepreciation non-recurring (l)\n-\n-\n2.8\n-\n-\nTax effect (m)\n(16.2)\n(23.5)\n(18.2)\n(8.1)\n(5.2)\nTotal of add-backs\n25.7\n44.8\n72.0\n(2.9)\n25.8\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) (unaudited)\n77.9\n48.2\n58.4\n13.8\n16.9\nAdjusted Earnings per share (in U.S. dollars) (**) (unaudited)\n1.06\n0.65\n0.79\n0.19\n0.23\nAdjusted Earnings attributable to Owners of the parent (non-GAAP)\n(unaudited)\n77.9\n48.1\n55.2\n13.8\n15.9\nAdjusted Earnings per share attributable to Owners of the parent\n(in U.S. dollars) (**) (unaudited)\n1.06\n0.65\n0.75\n0.19\n0.21\n(*)\nWe define non-recurring items as items that are limited in number, clearly identifiable, unusual, are unlikely to be repeated in the near future in the ordinary course of business and that have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations.

As a consequence, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument, related to the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income (equity) as from that date. The gains or losses related to the ineffective portion are recognized in the income statements. For comparability, these adjustments are added back to calculate Adjusted Earnings.\ni)\nSince 2015, our management analyzes the Company financial condition performance excluding non-cash net foreign exchange impacts related to intercompany loans which eliminates the volatility of foreign exchange variances from our operational results with third parties. The net impact to equity is zero since the current translation adjustments of the balance sheet to the subsidiaries with local denominated currencies other than the USD is registered at Equity.\nj)\nOn November 8, 2016 the CVI nominal value of ARS666.8 million, or $135.6 million was terminated. As a result, during the fourth quarter we recognized a gain of $41.7 million in \"Other gains\" representing the principle amount of the CVI.\nk)\nFinancial non-recurring relates to the costs incurred in the debt refinance process occurred in August 2017, which includes: (i) 2020 Senior Secured Notes call premium of $11.1 million and amortization of issuance costs of $4.9 million; (ii) Brazilian debentures due 2019 penalty fee of $0.7 million and remaining balance of the issuance cost of $1.0 million.\nl)\nNon-recurring depreciation relates to the provision for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in Puerto Rico and Mexico, due to the recent natural disasters (See \"Cautionary note regarding forward looking statements\").\nm)\nThe tax effect represents the impact of the taxable adjustments based on tax nominal rate by country.
