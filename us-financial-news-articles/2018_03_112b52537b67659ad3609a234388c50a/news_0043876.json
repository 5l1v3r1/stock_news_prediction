China retaliated, with their own set of levies, drawing up a list of 128 U.S. products that could be possible retaliation targets.\nThe Treasury Department auctioned $30 billion in two-year notes at a high yield of 2.31 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.91. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 44.5 percent. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 14.1 percent.\nThe Treasury is set to sell even more debt this week as the government raises more money to finance a sharp increase in spending.
