TomTom won a spate of contracts to supply digital maps to major carmakers in 2015 and 2016. \nGoddijn has promised more will follow in 2018. \nWhen Dutch tycoon John De Mol bought a 5 percent stake in the firm in 2015, Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad reported that he had urged TomTom to consider tie-ups with Chinese firms Baidu or Tencent. \nDe Mol’s spokeswoman declined to comment at the time. \nThe Dutch shareholders’ union VEB has said TomTom should consider options such as selling off some units, a management buyout, acquisitions or finding a buyer. \nIt has questioned whether the founders and board are sufficiently protecting the interests of minority shareholders.
