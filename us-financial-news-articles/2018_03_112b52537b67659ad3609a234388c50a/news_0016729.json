RSO previously used Adjusted Funds from Operations as a non-GAAP measure of operating performance.\nCore Earnings exclude the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that RSO believes are not indicative of its current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. Core Earnings exclude income (loss) from all non-core assets, such as Commercial Finance, Middle Market Lending, Residential Mortgage Lending, certain legacy CRE loans and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date. (1)\nCore Earnings, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for loan losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (2) (3) (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. Core Earnings may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items.\nAlthough pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement RSO calculates incentive compensation using Core Earnings excluding incentive fees payable to the Manager, beginning with the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 RSO includes incentive fees payable to the Manager in Core Earnings for reporting purposes.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or as a measure of liquidity under GAAP. RSO's methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies used by other companies to calculate similar supplemental performance measures, and, accordingly, its reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar performance measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from GAAP net (loss) income allocable to common shares to Core Earnings allocable to common shares for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the Three\nMonths Ended For the Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP $ (12,131 ) $ (9,520 ) $ 5,677 $ (52,956 ) Adjustment for loss on CRE assets â€” 1,145 â€” 270 Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP, adjusted (12,131 ) (8,375 ) 5,677 (52,686 ) Reconciling items from continuing operations: Non-cash equity compensation expense 321 (518 ) 2,738 3,025 Non-cash provision for CRE loan losses 1,254 2,467 1,502 10,464 Unrealized loss (gain) on core activities 667 (732 ) 2,167 â€” Non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings 780 414 4,058 1,660 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance (4) â€” 1,434 â€” 10,373 Net (income) loss from limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date (1) â€” (440 ) 1,073 (1,025 ) Income tax expense from non-core investments (2)(3) 674 â€” 6,637 â€” Net realized gain on non-core assets (2)(3) (1,387 ) â€” (42,402 ) â€” Net loss (income) from non-core assets (3) 1,010 (8,196 ) (4,691 ) (17,151 ) Reconciling items from discontinued operations and CRE assets: Net interest income on legacy CRE loans held for sale (71 ) (355 ) (3,323 ) (355 ) Realized loss (gain) on liquidation of CRE loans 103 (2,084 ) (12,386 ) (2,084 ) Asset impairment on CRE securities â€” (723 ) â€” 19,930 Fair value adjustments on legacy CRE loans held for sale 1,942 7,719 1,942 7,719 Net (income) loss from other non-CRE investments held for sale (688 ) 113 (974 ) 113 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes 3,284 6,728 14,116 19,260 Core Earnings before realized loss on CRE assets (4,242 ) (2,548 ) (23,866 ) (757 ) Adjustment for realized loss on CRE assets â€” (1,145 ) â€” (270 ) Core Earnings allocable to common shares (5) $ (4,242 ) $ (3,693 ) $ (23,866 ) $ (1,027 ) Weighted average common shares - diluted 30,914 30,618 30,836 30,539 Core Earnings per common share - diluted (5) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.12 ) $ (0.77 ) $ (0.03 ) (1) Initial measurement date is December 31, 2016.\n(2) Income tax expense from non-core investments and net realized gain (loss) on non-core assets are components of net income or loss from non-core assets.\n(3) Non-core assets are investments and securities owned by RSO at the initial measurement date in (i) Commercial Finance, (ii) Middle Market Lending, (iii) Residential Mortgage Lending, (iv) legacy CRE loans designated as held for sale and (v) other non-CRE assets included in assets held for sale.\n(4) Upon making the decision to dispose of the non-core asset classes, RSO re-evaluated its net deferred tax asset, which resulted in a net $10.4 million write down of its valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(5) Core Earnings include non-recurring charges of $8.5 million, or $(0.28) per common share-diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the extinguishment of the 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2018 and 8.00% convertible senior notes due 2020, and $3.8 million, or $(0.12) per common share-diluted, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the redemptions of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.\nRSO has five operating segments: Commercial Real Estate Debt Investments; Commercial Finance; Middle Market Lending; Residential Mortgage Lending; and Corporate & Other. The Commercial Real Estate Debt Investments operating segment includes our activities and operations related to commercial real estate loans and commercial real estate-related securities. The Commercial Finance operating segment includes the activities and operations related to syndicated corporate loans, syndicated corporate loan-related securities and direct financing leases. The Middle Market Lending operating segment includes the activities and operations related to the origination and purchase of middle market corporate loans. The Residential Mortgage Lending operating segment includes the activities and operations related to originating and servicing residential mortgage loans and investments in residential mortgage-backed securities.
