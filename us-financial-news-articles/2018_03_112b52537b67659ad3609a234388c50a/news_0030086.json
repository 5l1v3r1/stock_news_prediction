Rugby Union - England Training - Pennyhill Park, Bagshot, Britain - March 8, 2018 England's James Haskell, Nathan Hughes and team mates during training Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs The forwards both sustained their injuries during last weekend’s 22-16 defeat by France in the Six Nations, leading Don Armand to be called up into the 32-man training squad for Saturday’s match against newly-crowned champions Ireland. “Hughes is expected to be out for 12 weeks while Lawes will require 14 weeks of rehabilitation,” the national governing body said in a statement. England have lost consecutive matches in a single Six Nations campaign for the first time since 2009 and head coach Eddie Jones is expected to make significant changes against a dominant Ireland side at Twickenham to prevent a third defeat. Captain Dylan Hartley is expected to return after sitting out the match against France due to a calf problem as Jones’ team look to prevent Ireland from achieving their third grand slam. Jones will name his team for the final Six Nations game on Thursday.
