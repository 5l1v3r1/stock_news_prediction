Sharing’s caring. And when it comes to people sharing passwords for streaming apps , pay-TV companies are finally starting to care a bit more, according to Bloomberg. Some companies are planning to thwart the password-swapping brigade by limiting the number of simultaneous streams that can run on any one account, while Charter is reportedly encouraging programmers to look at forcing subscribers on its apps to log in more often (great!). Such efforts could help pay-TV providers and programmers get a better view of their total audiences, which might help push up ad prices if more people eventually cave and pay for their own accounts.\nDigital Love The latest Interactive Advertising Bureau ad spend figures are out, which means, with a little bit of extrapolating, we can get a better sense of the duopoly’s dominance. First the figures themselves: In the first half of 2017, digital advertising revenue in the U.S. grew 23% to $40 billion. Mobile advertising made up over half (54%) of that figure, while digital video was the fastest-growing format. The IAB said the “top 10 companies” captured 75% of digital revenues in the period. ( AdExchanger coverage .) Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser estimates that Google and Facebook were responsible for collecting 83% of U.S. digital advertising growth in the second quarter of this year and 73% of all digital advertising in the period. And while that’s still ginormous, there’s some good news for the rest of the sector. Mr. Wieser says the figures suggest digital advertising that did not flow through Google or Facebook grew by 15% in the quarter, more than the 8% growth rate estimated in the first quarter of the year and the 7% growth rate estimated for all of 2016.\n—But!—\nThe digital advertising sector has been growing at a remarkable clip. But we’re going to get to a saturation point eventually, when that double-digit growth begins to level out. Marketers don’t have endless budgets and they’re still going to assign a portion of their spend to traditional media like TV for some time to come. “This helps explain why digital media owners — and Facebook in particular — have become more aggressive in finding ways to capture television advertising budgets in recent periods,” Mr. Wieser writes.\nWhat’s My Age Again? The investigations team at ProPublica has been digging into Facebook again, and they’ve found another potential issue: Facebook allows advertisers to place recruitment ads that are limited to certain age groups . The federal Age Discrimination Employment Act prohibits bias against people aged 40 or older in hiring or employment and ProPublica and the New York Times found examples of dozens of companies buying Facebook ads that aimed to recruit workers within limited age ranges. In a blog post , Facebook said it disagrees with the concerns raised in the article. Individual ads targeted only at young people may have been part of broader campaigns that did also reach people over 40, with different contextual creative for each age group, for example. Facebook says it also recently began requiring businesses running employment ads to certify they comply with the law before it shows their ads. LinkedIn, meanwhile, in response to inquiries from ProPublica, also added a self-certification step.\nJust Like a Rolling Stone Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner is marking the iconic music magazine’s fiftieth year by selling a controlling stake in parent company Wenner Media. The buyer is Penske Media , which owns trade publications including Variety, Deadline and Women’s Wear Daily, and the deal values the company at around $100 million, WSJ’s Jeffrey Trachtenberg reports. Rolling Stone’s brand has waned in recent years amid a decline in the print publishing business, the emergence of new digital culture media brands that appeal to younger audiences and the damage to its reputation caused by a 2014 story about an alleged university fraternity gang rape that was found to contain factual errors. What’s Penske got planned? It’s all about finally accelerating Rolling Stone into the digital age , Recode reports.\nThree Wishes...With Samsung’s Michelle Froah Photo: Samsung This week, as we wind down the year, we are asking leaders across the marketing and advertising industries to share their wishes for what 2018 might bring.
