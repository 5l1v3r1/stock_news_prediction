It said it operated 10,007 terminals at the end of December.\nThis helped boost gaming revenue, which rose 2.5 percent to 409.7 million euros but it also meant higher operating costs.\nTotal operating expenses rose 10.4 percent in the final quarter of 2017 to 53.17 million euros.\nA one-off expense of 22.8 million euros related to a change of the amortisation method for the video lottery licence also weighed on results.\nOPAP has already paid out 0.80 euros a share to shareholders. On Tuesday, it said it will pay a further 0.30 euros a share, bringing the total dividend payout for 2017 to 1.1 euros a share.\nIt had paid 0.72 euros a share on 2016 profit.\nOPAP, which is also upgrading its core gaming platforms, said online sports betting is expected to resume before the summer World Cup.
