Banque Saudi Fransi plunged 3.4 percent after missing forecasts for quarterly profit. Banque Saudi Fransi, the kingdom’s fifth-largest lender by assets, posted a 13.1 percent increase in fourth-quarter net profit on Sunday, but missing average forecasts by three analysts.\n“The session could see pressure on Banque Saudi Fransi results that came way below forecasts, but overall index decline should be marginal,” said Khaled Feda, senior research manager at Alistithmar Capital. “Banking sector was the main driver for market gains year-to-date, so part of the decline is due to profit taking due to some concerns among investors over increasing zakat liabilities as well as IFRS [International Financial Reporting Standards]reclassification that will push banks to take significant provisions that would affect shareholder equity.”\nSaudi Arabia’s 175 listed companies are being required to adopt IFRS from the start of 2017.\nSaudi Arabian Mining Company, the majority owner of the world’s largest fully integrated aluminium facility, extended losses for a second straight day on news about the tariffs. It was down 0.88 percent in morning trade.\n“Investors are waiting to see how international markets react to these US moves on tariffs amd are just cautious,” said Marie Salem, director of Capital Markets at FFA Dubai.\nPresident Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 10-percent tariff on aluminum imports. He will make a final decision by April 11.\nThe Dubai index was down 0.1 percent, but the Abu Dhabi index was flat.\nReporting by Saeed Azhar and Marwa Rashad\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:25:30.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
