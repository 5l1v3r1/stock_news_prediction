Terms of the agreement were not released.\nThe organisation had asked a New York court for the rights to the original Big Book after owner Ken Roberts declared his intention to sell. Roberts bought the manuscript for $992,000 at Sotheby’s in 2007.\nThe original Big Book is a 161-page working draft filled with handwritten edits by the AA’s founders, some by main writer and co-founder William Wilson, better known as Bill W.\nAlcoholics Anonymous said a friend of Wilson’s widow made a gift of the manuscript to the organisation in 1979 but that it was never handed over because of “extreme negligence” of others.\nThe Big Book has sold more than 30 million copies since it was first published in 1939, according to AA’s website. The group counts more than 2.1 million members.\nReporting by Eric Kelsey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T01:44:07.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
