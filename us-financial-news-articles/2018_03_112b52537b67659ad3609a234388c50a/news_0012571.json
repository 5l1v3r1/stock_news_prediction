(\"STVI,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\") (OTCQB: STVI), a leading developer of innovative decentralized technologies that power multimedia social apps and business communication solutions, today announced a planned corporate name change to PeerStream, Inc. As part of this rebranding effort, the Company has introduced an updated corporate identity and will, subject to the receipt of requisite approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, begin trading under the new ticker symbol (OTCQB: PEER) (CUSIP 70555R102), effective at the opening of trading hours on March 12, 2018.\nThe new brand remains true to the Company’s legacy of empowering consumers to meet new people and connect with peers via social video applications. However, the rebranding also reflects a new strategic direction and an evolution of the Company’s business model. The rebranding accompanies a significant investment in the Company’s platform for live multimedia streaming and communications to incorporate decentralization technology. This previously announced initiative, now called PeerStream Protocol (“PSP”), leverages blockchain technology to support a peer-to-peer computing network for media routing. While the Company’s current platform today powers our existing portfolio of applications, going forward it will be enhanced with PSP and made available to third party developers as well.\nIn addition, the Company announced its plan to launch a Business Solutions group to provide blockchain-based licensing, services and support related to multimedia streaming, messaging and communications. PeerStream Business Solutions, launching today, will leverage the Company’s nearly 20 years of technology leadership to support the efforts of a broad range of prospective corporate clients to adopt blockchain technology.\nSTVI’s CEO, Alex Harrington, commented, “We are very excited to announce the corporate rebranding to PeerStream, which we believe accurately captures both our history and our new broader mandate. Importantly, the new identity acknowledges how important decentralized peer computing will be in our future, both in the launch of PSP and our business services offerings. We are firmly embracing blockchain to support our core business mission of multimedia streaming and delivery, while launching a potential new source of revenue in supporting blockchain adoption for the communications needs of future corporate clients.”\nAbout Snap Interactive, Inc. (OTCQB: STVI)\nSnap Interactive, Inc., soon to be renamed PeerStream, Inc., builds innovative decentralized technologies that power multimedia social apps and business communication solutions.
