Beijing aims to bring annual sales to 2 million units by 2020.\nChina has already drawn up more than 100 technological benchmarks relating to electric vehicles but lack of standardisation has been identified as one of the major challenges facing the sector. Some local governments have even set different requirements to restrict firms from other regions from accessing their markets.\nA lack of standardisation has also made it harder to create safe and cost-efficient automated recycling facilities, delegates to Chinaâ€™s parliament said this month. China will have to deal with an estimated 170,000 tonnes of spent electric vehicle batteries this year.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:11:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
