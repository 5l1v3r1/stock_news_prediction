The hosts won the first test at Eden Park in Auckland by an innings and 49 runs. \nEngland made three changes to their side with left-arm spinner Jack Leach given his test debut. The 26-year-old was a late callup on the tour for the injured Mason Crane. \nAll-rounders Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes were dropped, with Vince coming into bat at number three, while Mark Wood, arguably England’s fastest bowler, was also brought in. \nNew Zealand were forced to make one change from the side with Ish Sodhi replacing fellow leg-spinner Todd Astle, who has suffered a side strain. \nWilliamson had little hesitation in asking England to bat, with Southee and Boult giving both Cook and Stoneman a torrid time before the former England captain again failed to get forward to cover a swinging Boult delivery. \nCook has scored just nine runs in three innings and been dismissed by the left-armer Boult each time. \nVince was given out lbw to Colin de Grandhomme on 10, but asked for the decision to be reviewed and the technology showed the ball bouncing just over the stumps. \nThe 26-year-old, however, was unable to make the most of his opportunity when he shuffled across his stumps and was hit by Southee and given out. \nHe again reviewed but this time the ball tracking supported Bruce Oxenford’s decision.
