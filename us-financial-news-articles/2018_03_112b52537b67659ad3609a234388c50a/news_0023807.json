REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst The top U.S. diplomat flew into the Chadian capital, N’Djamena, on the last day of a truncated tour of Africa with stop-offs in Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Nigeria - all frontline partners against Islamic State and al Qaeda off-shoots.\nIt was his first diplomatic visit to the continent where many are still smarting from U.S. President Donald Trump’s reported dismissal of states there as “shithole” countries in January. Trump later denied making the comment.\nTillerson said Chad had made important steps to strengthen control over its security and passports. “These steps I think are going to allow us to begin to normalise the travel relationship with Chad,” he told reporters.\nRelated Coverage Steps underway should allow U.S. to lift Chad travel ban: Tillerson A report on Chad’s progress was being prepared in Washington and would be reviewed by President Trump next month, Tillerson said. “We have to wait for the final report,” he added.\nTillerson, who had met Chadian President Idriss Deby previously while serving as CEO of ExxonMobil, said he was concerned about the presence of Islamic State-allied militants in the Sahel and called Chad an “important partner”.\nTRIP CUT SHORT In September, The Trump White House added Chad - along with North Korea and Venezuela - to a list of countries whose citizens are restricted from travelling to the United States. That drew protests from Chad and others, including France, which works closely with the Chadian military.\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Chad's President Idriss Deby depart after their meeting in N'Djamena, Chad, March 12, 2018.

His entourage said he had been forced to cut short the African tour on Monday to return to deal with urgent work in Washington.\nSlideshow (5 Images) He held talks with President Muhammadu Buhari behind closed doors in the capital, Abuja.\nFollowing their talks, Buhari’s office issued a statement saying the president discussed plans to negotiate for the release of 110 girls abducted from a school in the northeastern town of Dapchi last month rather than use a military option.\nThe girls are suspected of having been abducted by members of Boko Haram.\nTillerson also held a press conference with Nigeria’s foreign affairs minister, during which he said the U.S. was helping Nigeria in the fight against the jihadist group and in the hunt for the missing girls.\n“Supporting, equipping, training and we can advise and provide information - I think that’s the best way we can help the government of Nigeria secure the release of these girls which we hope will be done in a peaceful manner,” he said.\nThe Africa tour coincided with several urgent foreign policy developments, including Thursday’s announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nReporting by pool reporter and Paul Carsten in Abuja; Writing by Maggie Fick and Joe Bavier; Editing by Tim Cocks and Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T12:18:51.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
