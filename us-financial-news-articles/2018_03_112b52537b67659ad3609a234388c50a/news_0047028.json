Hopes that the move signalled an easing of the threat of a global trade war pushed U.S. stock futures up more than 1 percent .\nThe Saudi index slipped as much as 0.5 percent, with financial-sector stocks the main drag on performance. Al Rajhi Bank, which has been one of the main beneficiaries of foreign money in anticipation of Riyadh’s expected entry onto emerging market indexes, was down 2.2 percent.\nThe biggest loser was Wafrah for Industry and Development , which slumped 6.1 percent after posting a full-year net loss of 50.1 million riyals, worse than the previous year.\nThe Dubai stock index lost 0.05 percent, with retailer Marka, the top loser, falling 3.1 percent after announcing a full-year loss of 218.4 million dirhams and lower revenue due to the closure of various non-profitable stores.\nDXB Entertainments was also in negative territory, 0.6 percent down after reporting a 1.12 billion dirham ($305 million) loss for last year.\nThe Abu Dhabi stock index was 0.06 percent down, while the Qatari index lost 0.3 percent.\nOutside the Gulf, the Egyptian index was 0.7 percent higher, with Qalaa Holdings the largest gainer, rising 6.6 percent. The stock has gained around 58 percent over the past month.
