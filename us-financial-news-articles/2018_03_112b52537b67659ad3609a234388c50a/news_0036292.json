Zachary Cruz, 18, told deputies he went to the campus of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to “reflect on the school shooting and soak it in,” according to the arrest report. He was being held in a Broward County jail with a $25 bond, county records showed. Nikolas Cruz, 19, is charged with carrying out the massacre at the high school in Parkland, Florida on Feb. 14. Zachary Cruz was warned by school officials not to enter the school but “surpassed all locked doors and gates and proceeded to ride his skateboard through school grounds” and was arrested at 4:50 pm, the report said. The report said Zachary Cruz had no connections to Broward County at this time. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Zachary Cruz had legal representation.
