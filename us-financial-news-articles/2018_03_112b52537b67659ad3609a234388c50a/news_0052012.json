Sign up here .\nIt was another sea of red on the map of tech stocks Tuesday, as investors fled the sector they loved for so long . I’m not one for counseling panic. But the shellacking technology shares are taking is a good opportunity to separate the good from the bed—and the ugly too.\nWhen sectors take it on the chin, investors don’t discriminate. That’s why shares of Apple , Amazon , and Netflix declined. Other than the usual criticism of Apple (aapl) not being what it used to be, Amazon (amzn) having one great business (AWS) and one giant but thin-margined business (retailing), and Netflix (nflx) being vastly overvalued, nothing has changed.\nCompanies like Twitter (twtr) will see-saw at times like these, through no fault of their own. (Twitter fell victim to a negative analyst report, but it doesn’t take much.) Tesla (tsla) is always susceptible to catching a nasty cold, what with its poor track record for keeping promises, it voracious cash needs , and its sky-high valuation. Add in another tragic crash and a debt downgrade, and poof—down goes its stock. Related, what Nvidia (nvda) gained on the rise of self-driving cars it is losing on the sector’s challenges.\nThen there is Facebook . How bad might things get for the Silicon Valley media company that right about now wishes it weren’t a media company? Its entire business is based on selling its users’ information to advertisers, a clever trick while it lasted. It’s hard to see Facebook (fb) losing all popularity with all users, though, so there’s a business in there somewhere, even a good one. But somewhere between there and now might be a long way down.\nKind of reminds me of what people have been saying about the newspaper business for years.\n***\nMany readers liked my report Tuesday on Cisco’s (csco) big donation to combat homelessness in its home county. One departed Cisco veteran, however, called my column a “clunker” Quote: : “Cisco spends a fortune to reduce its taxes and keeps money parked overseas, waiting for a tax holiday. If the company actually paid its taxes, the local, state and federal benefit would be enormous. Much more significant than a one-time $50-million noblesse oblige gesture. For which I’m sure Cisco happily took a deduction.”\nIn a response, a Cisco spokesman said the company didn’t have enough time to get exact numbers on tax payments but that it doesn’t do social programs for tax-deduction reasons, adding: “We do these programs because we deeply care about our communities.”", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/search?q=define+noblesse+oblige&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS752US752&oq=define+nobless+o&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l4.6106j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8", "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-03-23/tesla-stock-debt-model-3-production-point-to-cash-crunch"], "published": "2018-03-28T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T23:41:20.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
