In the last month the stock price has gone down 20.5 percent.\n\"There's been no shortage of negative news on Tesla over the last several weeks,\" Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet Research, told CNBC Tuesday on \" Power Lunch .\"\nHe cited issues such as executive departures, ongoing model production problems and investor concerns over cash flow as just some of the difficulties plaguing the tech giant.\n\"The crash is probably going to highlight some of the uncertainties around the safety of electric cars, especially as Tesla starts to introduce more and more autonomous features,\" Shah said.\nSafety surrounding self-driving cars has been under increased scrutiny since last week's death of an Arizona pedestrian who was killed by an Uber car in self-driving mode. On Monday, the Arizona governor suspended testing of autonomous cars in the state.\nOn Tuesday, chipmaker Nvidia also said it was suspending tests of self-driving cars worldwide, sending stocks plunging .\nMeanwhile, Waymo , a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, purchased up to 20,000 autonomous Jaguar SUVs in an expansion of its autonomous-drive riding-hailing program . The partnership between Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project, and Jaguar Land Rover is worth more than $1 billion.\nBut Calacanis and Shah said Tesla will get over setbacks created by the crash, even with the increased competition.\n\"Self-driving is, obviously, going to take a little bit of a pause as we adjust and investigate some of these crashes,\" Calacanis said.\nShah added that he thinks Tesla's results next week will show the company is making progress in fixing problems.\n\"Tesla, if you're willing to look out a couple of years on revenues, it's not an expensive stock,\" Shah said.\n\"In the next several months they're going to get over the hump,\" he said. \"And when that happens, they're going to be profitable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-28T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T02:01:12.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
