(Nasdaq:HURC) today reported results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018. Hurco recorded net income of $2,937,000, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to net income of $879,000, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the corresponding period in fiscal 2017.\nMichael Doar, Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"This was another great quarter for Hurco as we continue to achieve new milestones. It is fitting that Hurco is in the best financial position of its history as we kick off our 50-year anniversary. All geographic regions and product lines have made important contributions to our continued growth year-over-year. Our global business model has allowed us to successfully develop new products and technologies that can improve profitability for our customers while providing consistent returns for our shareholders.\"\nSales and service fees for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $68,444,000, an increase of $19,700,000, or 40%, compared to the corresponding prior year period and included a favorable currency impact of $4,445,000, or 9%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following table sets forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the first quarter ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Americas $ 21,030 $ 16,709 $ 4,321 26 % Europe 38,318 25,572 12,746 50 % Asia Pacific 9,096 6,463 2,633 41 % Total $ 68,444 $ 48,744 $ 19,700 40 % Sales in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 26% compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and reflected improved U.S. market conditions and demand from U.S. customers for all product lines (Hurco, Takumi and Milltronics).\nEuropean sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 50%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included a favorable currency impact of 15%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The increase in European sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to increased customer demand for Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.\nAsian Pacific sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 41%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included a favorable currency impact of 8%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The increase in Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increased customer demand of Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in China, and included a notable increase in sales of Hurco machines in Southeast Asia.\nOrders for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were a record $76,907,000, an increase of $15,887,000, or 26%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included a favorable currency impact of $5,038,000, or 8%, when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars.\nThe following table sets forth new orders booked by geographic region for the first quarter ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Americas $ 20,514 $ 20,342 $ 172 1 % Europe 44,226 32,349 11,877 37 % Asia Pacific 12,167 8,329 3,838 46 % Total $ 76,907 $ 61,020 $ 15,887 26 % Orders in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by 1%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to slight increased customer demand for higher-performance Hurco machines.\nEuropean orders for the first quarter increased by 37%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included a favorable currency impact of 13% when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars. The year-over-year increase in orders was driven primarily by increased customer demand for Hurco and Takumi vertical milling machines in Germany, Italy and France.\nAsian Pacific orders for the first quarter increased by 46%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included a favorable currency impact of 11% when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars. The year-over-year increase in orders was driven primarily by increased customer demand for Hurco vertical milling machines in China.\nGross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $20,121,000, or 29% of sales, compared to $12,586,000, or 26% of sales, for the corresponding prior year period. The year-over-year increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflected the increased volume of sales of Hurco machines, particularly in Europe, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $12,966,000, or 19% of sales, compared to $11,167,000, or 23% of sales, in the corresponding period in fiscal 2017, and included an unfavorable currency impact of $697,000 when translating foreign expenses to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\nThe effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 61% compared to 38% in the corresponding prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to a one-time provisional adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) that was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implemented a territorial tax system and imposed a tax on the deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the changes in tax law, a one-time non-cash tax charge of $394,000 related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In addition, a one-time charge of $2,500,000 related to the transition tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign income was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and this amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment date, as provided by recent SEC guidance. The impact of these charges increased the effective tax rate by approximately 39% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of these charges, earnings per diluted share would have been $0.43 higher than the earnings per diluted share we reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $80,236,000 at January 31, 2018, compared to $66,307,000 at October 31, 2017. Working capital was $183,171,000 at January 31, 2018, compared to $175,526,000 at October 31, 2017. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventories.\nHurco Companies, Inc. is an international, industrial technology company that sells its three brands of computer numeric control (CNC) machine tools to the worldwide metal cutting and metal forming industry.
