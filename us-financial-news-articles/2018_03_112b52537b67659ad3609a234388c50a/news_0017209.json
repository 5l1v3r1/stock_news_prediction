December was modestly revised to show a C$3.05 billion deficit from the originally reported C$3.19 billion gap.\nImports fell 4.3 percent as declines were broad-based, including an 11.3 percent drop in industrial machinery and equipment.\nExports were down 2.1 percent, the largest drop since July 2017, as exports of passenger cars and light trucks fell due to unusual plant closures.\nShipments of forestry products and building materials fell 6.6 percent as the United States resumed collecting import duties on Canadian lumber at the end of 2017, the statistics agency said.\nCanada’s trade surplus with the United States narrowed to C$3.13 billion as Canada sent fewer vehicles and aircraft south of the border and imported less machinery and equipment for logging, mining and construction.
