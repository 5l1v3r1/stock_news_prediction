Operating earnings is a non-GAAP measure defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power. In providing its full-year 2018 and first-quarter operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported (GAAP) earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion Energy's management is unable to estimate the aggregate impact, if any, of these items on reported earnings. Accordingly, Dominion Energy is unable to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.\nDominion Energy Midstream Partners\nOn March 15, 2018, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a policy revision indicating that it no longer will allow master limited partnership interstate natural gas and oil pipelines to recover an income tax allowance in cost-of-service rates. Dominion Energy expects that any future impacts to revenues of FERC-regulated interstate gas transmission assets held at Dominion Energy Midstream Partners (NYSE: DM) as a result of this policy revision will be applied prospectively and only after a multi-year rate proceeding process. Further, any potential future application of the revised policy on the partnership's assets is not expected to have a material impact on Dominion Energy's financial performance.\nThomas F. Farrell, II, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:\n\"The reaction of MLP equity capital markets to the FERC policy revision may have a materially negative impact on the amount and price at which DM can raise public equity. Dominion Energy is presently engaged in a review of options for DM and, in the interim, intends to recommend to the DM Board of Directors that the limited partner distribution per unit be increased for the first quarter of 2018 by 5 percent quarter over quarter, consistent with the 22 percent annual distribution growth we have maintained since the initial public offering of DM. DM will utilize existing excess distributable cash flow coverage to support this increase.\"\nAbout Dominion Energy\nDominion Energy is one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy, with a portfolio of approximately 26,000 megawatts of electric generation, 14,800 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline, and 6,600 miles of electric transmission lines.
