It does have an impact on carriers' bottom lines,\" CFRA Research analyst Jim Corridore said.\nWhile the full financial impact of the storms was not yet known, Corridore said accurate weather forecasts helped carriers quickly move planes and crew as well as plan for resuming normal operations.\n\"There is a small silver lining in that it does help load factors and yields,\" he said, noting that passengers from canceled flights often help fill later flights that would have otherwise sat empty.\nU.S. carriers are offering change-fee waivers from flights in the affected regions, including from New York's three major airports, Philadelphia International and Boston Logan International.\nLaGuardia Airport in New York City said on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that airlines had canceled all remaining flights at the facility for the rest of the day.
