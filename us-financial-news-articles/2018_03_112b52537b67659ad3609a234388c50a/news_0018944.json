He scored twice during a four-goal run that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 4-2 lead. That marked the first points Vanek scored since joining the team.\nColorado was coming off of two straight overtime losses heading into the game.\nNathan MacKinnon stretched his point streak to seven games with a third-period assist. He’s now got 14 points during this run for the Avalanche.\nSven Andrighetto of Colorado returned to the lineup after missing 28 straight games with a lower body injury. He had been out since Dec. 31.\nThe Avalanche jumped in front 2-0 in the first period thanks to goals from Tyson Barrie and Carl Soderberg just 12 seconds apart.\nBarrie scored first on a wrist shot at 6:55 of the first period, and then after the Avalanche won the ensuing face-off, Soderberg did the same at 7:07.\nThe Blue Jackets answered quickly when Boone Jenner scored only 42 seconds later to end the quick three-goal barrage that left Colorado with a 2-1 lead.\nThe Avalanche carried that lead into the second period despite finishing the first period with just five shots. However, Jenner helped Columbus tie it, getting an assist on a Vanek goal 79 seconds into the second period.\nThe Blue Jackets took the lead on a Zach Werenski power-play goal before Vanek added another later in the second period for a 4-2 lead after two.\nGabriel Landeskog’s power-play goal cut the lead to 4-3 with 6:34 left in the game before Soderberg tied it with 3:18 remaining on his second goal.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:27:10.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
