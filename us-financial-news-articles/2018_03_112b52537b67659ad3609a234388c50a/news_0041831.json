On September 23, 2016, Cemex disclosed the company's dismissal of two senior executives after an internal probe found that payments worth $20 million relating to a land deal in Colombia had breached company protocols. On March 14, 2018, Cemex revealed that the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating the company concerning the company's payments related to a cement plant in Colombia to determine whether any violations of federal bribery laws occurred. Since news of Cemex's troubles became public, its ADR price has fallen over 10%, closing at $6.67 per share on March 20, 2018.\nCemex Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
