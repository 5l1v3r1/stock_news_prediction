As of Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit’s investment portfolio at fair value was allocated 67 percent in first lien senior secured debt, which includes unitranche investments, 11 percent in the Logan JV, 5 percent in second lien debt, 3 percent in subordinated debt, 2 percent in other income-producing securities and 12 percent in equity securities and warrants. The weighted average yield on new and follow-on investments made in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 8.5 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2017, the weighted average yield of the debt and income-producing securities, including the Logan JV and reflecting the impact of investments on non-accrual, in the investment portfolio at their current cost basis was 10.7 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit had loans on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of $56.3 million and fair value of $21.0 million, or 8.8 percent and 3.4 percent of the portfolio’s amortized cost and fair value, respectively.

The weighted average yield of the debt and other income-producing securities in the investment portfolio, including the Logan JV, at their cost basis was 11.2 percent. As of Dec. 31, 2016, THL Credit had loans on non-accrual status with an aggregate amortized cost of $13.8 million and fair value of $6.9 million, or 2.1 percent and 1.0 percent of the portfolio’s amortized cost and fair value, respectively. As of Dec. 31, 2016, 89 percent of its debt investments bore interest based on floating rates, which may be subject to interest rate floors, such as LIBOR, and 11 percent of its debt investments bore interest at fixed rates.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestment income\nTotal investment income for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 was $18.6 million and $20.0 million, respectively, and consisted of $13.3 million and $14.2 million of interest income on debt securities (which included PIK interest of $ 0.3 million and $0.4 million and prepayment premiums of $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively), $ 3.4 million and $3.4 million of dividend income, $ 1.1 million and $1.5 million of interest income on other income-producing securities, and $ 0.8 million and $0.9 million of other income, including fees from THL Credit’s managed vehicles, respectively.\nThe decrease in investment income compared to the prior period was primarily due to a contraction in the overall investment portfolio since Dec. 31, 2016, which led to lower interest income.\nTotal investment income for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 was $78.8 million and $84.6 million, respectively, and consisted of $56.8 million and $63.0 million of interest income on debt securities (which included PIK interest of $ 1.7 million and $1.8 million and prepayment premiums of $ 0.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively), $ 13.5 million and $11.2 million of dividend income, $ 4.6 million and $6.7 million of interest income on other income-producing securities and $3.9 million and $3.7 million of other income, including fees from THL Credit’s managed vehicles, respectively.\nThe decrease in investment income from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to a contraction in the overall investment portfolio since Dec. 31, 2016, which led to lower interest income. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in dividend income related to the Logan JV.\nExpenses\nExpenses for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 were $9.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, base management fees were $2.6 million and $2.6 million, incentive fees were $0.0 million and $1.8 million, administrator and other expenses were $1.5 million and $1.9 million and fees and expenses related to THL Credit’s borrowings were $5.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. In addition, for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, THL Credit recorded an income tax provision (benefit) related to its consolidated blocker corporations, excise and other taxes of $0.1 million and ($0.03) million, respectively.\nThe decrease in operating expenses was due to a decrease in incentive fees as a result of portfolio performance. This was partially offset by an increase in borrowing expenses, which included $1.2 million related to accelerated deferred financing costs related to the recent amendment to THL Credit’s credit facility.\nExpenses for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016 were $39.1 million and $39.9 million, respectively. For the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, base management fees were $10.4 million and $11.0 million, incentive fees were $2.4 million, net of an $0.8 million incentive fee waiver, and $4.5 million, administrator and other expenses were $7.4 million and $8.1 million and fees and expenses related to THL Credit’s credit facility for the same periods were $18.8 million and $16.2 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, THL Credit recorded an income tax provision related to its consolidated blocker corporations, excise and other taxes of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nThe decrease in operating expenses from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to lower incentive fees due largely to portfolio performance, lower base management fees as a result of portfolio contraction, and lower administrator expenses. This decrease was partially offset by higher costs related to borrowings and the amendment to the credit facility described above.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income totaled $8.7 million and $9.1 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, or $0.27 and $0.28 per share based upon 32,673,590 and 33,084,660 weighted average common shares outstanding, respectively.\nNet investment income was lower due to a decrease in interest income from debt and income-producing securities as a result of contraction of the overall investment portfolio, which was partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees as a result of portfolio performance.\nNet investment income totaled $39.7 million and $44.7 million for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, or $1.21 and $1.35 per share based upon 32,797,233 and 33,197,100 weighted average common shares outstanding, respectively.\nThe decrease in net investment income from 2016 to 2017 is primarily attributable to a decrease in interest on debt and other income-producing investments due to portfolio contraction and additional loans put on non-accrual status. This was offset by higher dividend income related to the Logan JV.\nNet realized gains and losses on investments, net of income tax provision\nFor the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit recognized a net realized gain on portfolio investments of $5.0 million, primarily related to a realized gain from the exit of its equity investments in Thibaut, Inc. For the three months ended Dec. 31, 2016, THL Credit recognized a net realized loss on portfolio investments of $1.0 million, primarily related to a realized loss with the restructuring of THL Credit’s investment in Copperweld Bimetallics LLC, offset by a gain from an investment in Gryphon Partners 3.5, L.P.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit recognized a net realized loss of $17.3 million, primarily related to realized losses recognized in connection with the sale of certain debt investments. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, THL Credit recognized a net realized loss of $38.8 million, primarily related to realized losses recognized in connection with the restructuring of certain debt investments into equity investments.\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit recorded an income tax provision on realized gains of $0.8 million related to the exit of an investment held in a blocker corporation. There was no income tax provision on realized gains recorded for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016.\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments\nFor the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, THL Credit’s investment portfolio had a net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of ($32.2) million and ($0.9) million, respectively. For the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, THL Credit’s investment portfolio had a net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of ($31.6) million and $11.3 million, respectively.\nThe net change in unrealized appreciation on investments was driven primarily by changes in the financial performance of certain portfolio companies.\nBenefit for taxes on unrealized gain on investments\nFor the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, THL Credit recognized an income tax (provision) benefit for taxes on unrealized gains of ($0.1) million and $0.7 million related to consolidated subsidiaries, respectively. For the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, the income tax benefit for taxes on unrealized gains on investments was $2.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.\nThe change in provision for tax on unrealized gains on investments relates primarily to changes to the unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of the investments held in these taxable consolidated subsidiaries, the change in U.S. federal tax rates expected in future years and the exit of certain equity investments held in blocker corporations.\nChange in net assets resulting from operations\nChange in net assets resulting from operations totaled ($18.5) million and $7.9 million, or ($0.56) and $0.24 per share based upon 32,673,590 and 33,084,660 weighted average common shares outstanding, for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet decrease in net assets resulting from operations totaled ($7.9) million and $17.1 million, or ($0.24) and $0.51 per share based upon 32,797,233 and 33,197,100 weighted average common shares outstanding, for the years ended Dec. 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the respective periods is due primarily to net realized and unrealized losses in the portfolio.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, THL Credit had cash of $3.6 million. THL Credit’s liquidity and capital resources are derived from its credit facilities, equity and debt raises and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned.
