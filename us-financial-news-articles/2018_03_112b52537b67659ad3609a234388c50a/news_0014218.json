(NYSE: CVNA), a leading eCommerce platform for buying used cars, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2017. Carvana’s complete fourth quarter 2017 financial results and management commentary can be found by accessing the Company’s shareholder letter at: https://investors.carvana.com/financial-reports/quarterly-results/2017 .\n“2017 was another year of tremendous growth and progress for Carvana. We achieved triple digit growth in retail units sold and revenue, both Q4 and for the full year, while simultaneously growing GPU and demonstrating leverage in the business,” said Ernie Garcia, Carvana co-founder and CEO. “In 2018 we expect to experience our fifth straight year of triple digit top-line growth, open a record number of new markets, and bring more people than ever the new way to buy a car.”\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Summary\nQ4 2017: All financial comparisons stated below are versus Q4 2016, unless otherwise noted.\nRetail units sold totaled 13,517, an increase of 141% Revenue totaled $265.1 million, an increase of 148% Total gross profit was $21.9 million, an increase of 798% Total gross profit per unit was $1,619, an increase of $1,184 Net loss was $47.2 million, an increase of 32% EBITDA margin was (15.5%), an improvement from (30.6%) GAAP basic and diluted net loss per Class A share was $0.45 based on 15.9 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding; absent $1.65 million in accrued charges associated with our convertible preferred stock issuance net loss per Class A share would have been $0.34. Adjusted net loss per Class A share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.36, based on 136.9 million adjusted shares of Class A common stock outstanding assuming the exchange of all outstanding LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock; absent $1.65 million in accrued charges associated with our convertible preferred stock issuance adjusted net loss per Class A share would have been $0.34. We opened 5 new markets, bringing our end-of-quarter total to 44 We achieved the lowest quarterly average days to sale in our history of 72, compared to 97 in Q3\nFY 2017: All financial comparisons stated below are versus 2016, unless otherwise noted.\nRetail units sold totaled 44,252, an increase of 136% Revenue totaled $858.9 million, an increase of 135% Total gross profit was $68.1 million, an increase of 255% Total gross profit per unit was $1,539, an increase of $516 Net loss was $164.3 million, an increase of 76% EBITDA margin was (16.9%), an improvement from (23.2%) GAAP basic and diluted net loss per Class A share was $1.31 based on 15.2 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding. Adjusted net loss per Class A share, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.21, based on 136.9 million adjusted shares of Class A common stock outstanding assuming the exchange of all outstanding LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock. We opened 23 new markets, bringing our end-of-year total to 44 Our average days to sale for the full year 2017 was 91, an increase of 2 days\nRecent Events\nWe completed a few other notable accomplishments in Q4 2017 and already in Q1 2018, including:\nWe raised $100 million through the sale of convertible preferred securities to Dundon Capital Partners in early December. The additional capital adds liquidity and cushion to our balance sheet and provides flexibility to accelerate market openings. We sold and leased back $24.3 million of vending machines in Q4, including $19.2 million sold and leased back under our $75 million Master Sale-Leaseback Agreement, and $5.1 million under a separate transaction. We still have over $55 million available under our MSL agreement, which we intend to utilize over the course of this year, while also securing additional asset financing from other third parties. We have opened 10 markets quarter-to-date, bringing our current total to 54.\nQ1 and 2018 Outlook\nWe anticipate continued triple digit growth in units and revenue for both Q1 and the full year 2018 as we increase penetration in our existing markets, open new markets, and broaden our brand awareness with national advertising and additional vending machines. We have historically estimated used vehicle demand to be seasonally strongest in the first half of the year, correlating closely with customer receipt of federal tax refunds; however, as tax refunds have begun arriving later over the last two years the true strength of that seasonality is shifting to favor Q2 over Q1. We expect to make progress on GPU and EBITDA margin in Q1, although less than we may have experienced throughout our history largely due to the aforementioned seasonal shift. We expect our EBITDA losses to peak in Q1 this year, followed by a significant reduction in Q2.\nOur Q1 guidance is as follows. All financial comparisons stated below are versus Q1 2017, unless otherwise noted.\nRetail unit sales of 17,000 – 18,500, an increase of 104% – 122% Total revenue of $325 million – $355 million, an increase of 104% – 123% Total gross profit per unit of $1,650 – $1,750, an increase from $1,169 EBITDA margin of (15.0%) – (13.0%), an improvement from (21.6%)\nOur FY 2018 guidance is as follows. All financial comparisons stated below are versus FY 2017, unless otherwise noted.\nRetail unit sales of 89,000 – 93,000, an increase of 101% – 110% Revenue of $1.725 billion – $1.825 billion, an increase of 101% – 112% Total gross profit per unit of $1,950 – $2,150, an increase from $1,539 EBITDA margin of (9.0%) – (7.0%), an improvement from (16.9%), reflecting both our decision to accelerate market expansion along with increasing operating leverage on our growth 30 – 40 market openings, an increase from 23 markets in 2017, bringing our end-of-year total to 74 – 84 markets and our total U.S. population coverage to at least 55%\nFor more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this letter, please see the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most directly comparable GAAP-based financial measurements included at the end of this letter. Guidance for EBITDA margin excludes depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. We have not reconciled EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, interest expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. Depreciation and amortization expense, which is a component of the reconciliation between EBITDA and GAAP net loss, is expected to be between 1.2% and 1.4% of total revenues for both Q1 2018 and FY 2018.\nConference Call Details\nCarvana will host a conference call today, March 6, 2018, at 5:30 p.m. EST (2:30 p.m. PST) to discuss financial results.

These measurements should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported GAAP results because they may include or exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measurements, and such measurements may not be comparable to similarly-titled measurements reported by other companies. Rather, these measurements should be considered as an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements included in publicly filed reports in their entirety and not rely solely on any one, single financial measurement or communication.\nReconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most directly comparable GAAP-based financial measurements are included at the end of this press release.\nAbout Carvana Co.\nFounded in 2012 and based in Phoenix, Carvana’s (NYSE: CVNA) mission is to change the way people buy cars.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share\nAdjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net loss and net loss per share, as determined under GAAP. We believe that by assuming the full exchange of all outstanding LLC Units, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share supplement GAAP measures and enable us and our investors to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors that have different organizational and tax structures because the assumption eliminates the effect of any changes in net income attributable to Carvana Co. driven by increases in our ownership of Carvana Group, LLC, which are unrelated to our operating performance.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued)\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nEBITDA and EBITDA Margin\nEBITDA and EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA Margin is EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. We use EBITDA to measure the operating performance of our business and EBITDA Margin to measure our operating performance relative to our total revenues. We believe that EBITDA and EBITDA Margin are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude certain financial and capital structure items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring operations, in part because they may vary widely across time and within our industry independent of the performance of our core operations. We believe that excluding these items enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. EBITDA and EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculations. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and calculation of EBITDA Margin is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Mar 31,\n2016\nJun 30,\n2016\nSep 30,\n2016\nDec 31,\n2016\nMar 31,\n2017\nJun 30,\n2017\nSep 30,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2017\nNet loss $ (17,325 ) $ (18,108 ) $ (21,985 ) $ (35,694 ) $ (38,439 ) $ (38,870 ) $ (39,769 ) $ (47,238 ) Depreciation and amortization expense\n866 958 1,196 1,638 2,061 2,584 3,101 3,822 Interest expense 710 796 725 1,356 2,059 2,507 838 2,255 EBITDA $ (15,749 ) $ (16,354 ) $ (20,064 ) $ (32,700 ) $ (34,319 ) $ (33,779 ) $ (35,830 ) $ (41,161 ) Total revenues $ 72,951 $ 86,526 $ 98,844 $ 106,827 $ 159,073 $ 209,365 $ 225,379 $ 265,053 Net Loss Margin\n(23.7 )% (20.9 )% (22.2 )% (33.4 )% (24.2 )% (18.6 )% (17.6 )% (17.8 )% EBITDA Margin (21.6 )% (18.9 )% (20.3 )% (30.6 )% (21.6 )% (16.1 )% (15.9 )% (15.5 )%\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006482/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nCarvana Co.\nMike Levin\ninvestors@carvana.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nOlson Engage\nKate Carver\ncarvana@olson.com\nSource: Carvana Co.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fcarvana&esheet=51769103&newsitemid=20180306006482&lan=en-US&anchor=Twitter&index=6&md5=f48bda9ec4a91e69a0360d5977809260", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carvana.com&esheet=51769103&newsitemid=20180306006482&lan=en-US&anchor=www.carvana.com&index=3&md5=fa715ff1ef8f15c618e024d7b23e9c76", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.carvana.com%2F&esheet=51769103&newsitemid=20180306006482&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.carvana.com&index=2&md5=e2ae190c83c35634906c06800c4a14b5", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.carvana.com%2Ffinancial-reports%2Fquarterly-results%2F2017&esheet=51769103&newsitemid=20180306006482&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.carvana.com%2Ffinancial-reports%2Fquarterly-results%2F2017&index=1&md5=cb4fe4ec84c5722ba0500728d61a97e6", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006482/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fgocarvana%2F&esheet=51769103&newsitemid=20180306006482&lan=en-US&anchor=Instagram&index=5&md5=5faa452a88d4fd16787059e443de7b7f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCARVANA.BuyCarsOnline&esheet=51769103&newsitemid=20180306006482&lan=en-US&anchor=Facebook&index=4&md5=2c6721cbc181dbb77e70c52c5c6da806", "https://investors.carvana.com/financial-reports/quarterly-results/2017"], "published": "2018-03-07T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T03:13:43.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
