He spent most of his career at Huracan, winning a league title in 1973. He also enjoyed spells at River Plate, Colo Colo in Chile, and Independiente, amongst others. Houseman won 55 caps for Argentina, playing at both the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. “Extraordinary player,” former team mate Osvaldo Ardiles wrote on Twitter. “Unique. All the skill in the world.
