REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo The BoE said on Tuesday its Financial Policy Committee, which oversees risks to the economy from the banking system, had seen arguments for setting the so-called countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) a little above its current 1 percent level. “Risks had increased since the Committee first judged that a 1 percent UK CCyB rate was appropriate, in Q1 2016,” the BoE said in a series of minutes from the FPC’s meeting on March 12. The FPC had to be forward-looking and “waiting for a more marked evolution in domestic risks before acting could result in a need to consider sharper adjustments to the UK CcyB rate, which would likely carry larger economic costs,” the minutes said. A “measured increase” in the first quarter of 2018 could be accommodated by banks without a need to tighten credit conditions and would not have been a shock, they said. But the FPC also listed the arguments for keeping the CCyB at 1 percent for now, including relatively modest growth in lending and said signs of intensifying risk appetite would need to persist to justify a hike in the CCyB. More targeted options could be appropriate and the FPC stressed its preference of raising the CCyB rate only gradually. “At this stage, it might be beneficial to note the probable direction for the UK CCyB rate, given how risk-taking had developed, and to observe the evolution of risks over the coming months in considering whether a rise was warranted,” the minutes said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:53:47.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
