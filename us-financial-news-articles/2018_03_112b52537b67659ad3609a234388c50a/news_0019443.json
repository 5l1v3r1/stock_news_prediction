Keeping its broader policy unchanged, the ECB said it could still extend its 2.55 trillion euro (2.28 trillion pounds) bond purchase scheme beyond September if needed. But it omitted a reference to bigger purchases, a signal that it remains on track to end a three-year-old stimulus scheme before the end of 2018. Speaking hours before U.S. President Donald Trump was due to hold talks about planned new steel and aluminium tariffs, ECB President Mario Draghi cited concerns about “unilateral decisions” producing heightened risks to the global economy. Having revived euro zone growth with lavish stimulus, the ECB has been dialling back support in tiny increments, fearing any big change could unravel its work and force an embarrassing and economically damaging policy reversal. “The net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of 30 billion euros, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim,” the ECB said in a statement after its regular policy meeting. Euro zone inflation remains stubbornly low. “Our mandate is in terms of price stability. Victory cannot be declared yet,” ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference. Dropping the ECB’s so-called easing bias is largely symbolic as few if any expected bigger bond buying: Draghi in his news conference called it a “backward-looking measure”. But the move was still seen as a precursor to a broader revision of the bank’s policy guidance, a move flagged in earlier meetings. “This is, in our view, an important first step towards the exit of unconventional policies, and increases the probability that the asset purchases will be finalised in September,” said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Bank. The euro, which was down 0.3 percent at $1.2378 before the announcement, firmed to the day’s high of $1.2431 before easing back 0.1 percent to $1.2409. Draghi unveiled a modest upgrade of the ECB’s euro zone economic growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 2.3 percent previously, with projections for 2019 and 2020 unchanged at 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.

Draghi nonetheless cited “rising protectionism” as a risk and while judging any direct impact from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium to be limited, said any U.S. move would add more generally to concerns over international relations. “If you put tariffs against (those) who are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are,” he said.

DICHOTOMY The dichotomy facing the ECB is that while growth has blown past expectations, inflation remains weak, having hit a 14-month low in February and staying well short of its target of almost 2 percent, the bank’s sole mandate.
