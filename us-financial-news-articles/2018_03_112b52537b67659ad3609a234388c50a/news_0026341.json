That would value the medical imaging and diagnostics business at 27.5 to 28.5 billion euros, based on price guidance given by the bookrunners. As a result, Siemens, which will sell a 15 percent stake, is in the frame for 4.13-4.28 billion euros in proceeds. The offer period is due to run through Thursday, when a final price is expected to be set. The shares are set to start trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Friday. Siemens announced plans to float Healthineers, the world’s largest maker of medical imaging gear, on the exchange last month in what will be one of Germany’s biggest listings in recent years. “The feedback has not been overwhelming,” said a person at one of several banks that are organising the transaction. Investors have cited a slight deterioration of market conditions and uncertainty over the market launch of “Atellica”, an automated lab diagnostics platform, which Healthineers has said would catch up quickly with established competitors. The machine for high-throughput testing of blood and urine and samples has yet to show mass market viability against rival products by Roche, Abbott or Danaher’s Beckman Coulter. Siemens this month set the price range for the planned IPO, valuing the division at up to 31 billion euros ($38.18 billion), already lower than was expected at the time. $1 = 0.8083 euros Reporting by Alexander Huebner, Ludwig Burger and Arno Schuetze; editing by Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T16:22:50.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
