Turkey considers the YPG an extension of the PKK.\nU.S. support for the YPG in the fight against Islamic State in Syria has strained ties between Ankara and Washington, both members of the NATO military alliance.\nReporting by David Dolan, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-11T16:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T11:32:49.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
