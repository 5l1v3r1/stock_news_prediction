Investors exchange digital currency, such as bitcoin, for a token issued by the firm. Unlike an initial public offering, the token implies no stake in the company. \nSpeaking with CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 conference in Singapore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said he had previously indicated to some entrepreneurs looking to issue digital tokens of their own that they should “save some of those proceeds” because they could potentially be sued if their token lost money. In fact, such incidents are already happening, he added. \n“Entrepreneurs need to be [going in with their] eyes wide open … The winners are going to be the lawyers, because they’re going to help you issue the token and then they’re going to help you defend it,” he said.

Investors and companies in the space are not nearly as protected by the regulatory frameworks that are in place in traditional financial markets. \nAround 46 percent of ICOs launched last year had failed as of February, according to a study by Bitcoin.com . \nThe chief executive of Ripple, the company behind the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also weighed in on a recent move by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that requires platforms offering “trading of digital assets that are securities” to register with the regulator. \n“There’s a lot of goodness going on, you can leverage blockchain and how you leverage digital assets to solve real problems … I think most of the ICOs you’re seeing are not real token use cases. They’re really securities, so I think the SEC should regulate that,” Garlinghouse said.

The company is developing a network to make cross-border payments quicker. \n— CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.
