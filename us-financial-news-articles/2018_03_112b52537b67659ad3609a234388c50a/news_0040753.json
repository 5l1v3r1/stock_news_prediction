After a brief weather-related delay, the opening arguments in the huge DOJ vs. AT&T-Time Warner antitrust case begin Thursday. The outcome of the proceedings will likely spark/freeze a slew of mergers depending on which way it goes. Get up to speed with this column from The Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip, who writes that the suit “ seems conceived in a world before the internet became a gigantic petri dish for video content .”\nZuck’s First Word Zuckerberg speaks! Having come under criticism for staying quiet about Facebook’s unraveling Cambridge Analytica data-sharing crisis, its chief executive embarked on a media tour Wednesday as the social network sought to rebuild user trust in the platform and provide updates on the action it’s taking. In an interview with CNN , Mr. Zuckerberg said “sorry,” and said he’d be “happy to” testify before Congress, “if it’s the right thing to do,” which will add even more theater to the ongoing controversy. As for the next steps Facebook is taking :\n1) The company plans to investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of user information before it changed its rules about the way it shared data with third-party developers. Developers who misuse personal data will be banned.\n2) MARKETERS, PAY ATTENTION TO THIS ONE: Facebook is restricting developers’ data access. From now on, it’ll only give apps a user’s name, profile photo and email address; they have to get approval and sign a contract to ask for more. It’ll remove developers’ access to that data if a user has been inactive for three months.\n3) Facebook’s moving a tool that sat in the privacy settings to the top of the news feed, making it more prominent for users to see and revoke which apps have access to their data. The company will also notify the users whose personal information was collected by the academic who illicitly shared it with Cambridge Analytica.\n—The Neverending Story—\nIt ain’t over yet. A *lot* of app developers had access to a whole host of user data (a must-read from Digiday on that here ) before Facebook implemented new policies in 2015. We may soon find out more about some of those developers and what they did with that data. There are also still questions outstanding about why Facebook didn’t act earlier. Remember the FTC is investigating whether Facebook’s user-data practices violated terms of a 2011 settlement. Notwithstanding any potential fines, all the extra steps to shore up its data will take its toll on Facebook to the sum of “ many millions of dollars ,” Mr. Zuckerberg told Recode. And then there’s the issue of whether lawmakers consider stricter regulations across the entire online ecosystem to prevent similar incidents occurring again in the future. Rival tech companies will be watching very closely indeed.\nCome On Over to My Place The upfronts are such a grind that you really have to feel for ad buyers. One glitzy party after another; so many well-catered, amply Prosecco-d events crammed into several weeks that they all start merging into one. This year, Omnicom Media Group is turning the idea on its head, CMO Today’s Suzanne Vranica reports. The media-buying firm is hosting its own three-day event where it’ll ask TV networks, digital media companies and publishers to pitch its buyers and advertising clients directly. The idea is that the pitches will be tailored to Omnicom’s clients, so it can identify new integrations or ad formats early on. Around 20 companies—including Google, CBS, Condé Nast and Discovery—have signed up to present. It’ll be interesting to see how rival media-buying firms react, especially if they think Omnicom is getting special treatment (although I suspect the party line will be that “we regularly meet with our partners, thank you very much.”) And don’t worry, you’ll be able to catch up with your favorite Omnicom buyers at the traditional upfront events, too, as they still plan to attend.\nTubey, Tubey, Tubey, Tubey “Frustrate and seduce” sounds like the kind of line you’d see on a Tinder profile, but Bloomberg reports it’s actually a YouTube strategy to ramp up the ads some users see when they watch music videos on the platform. The music industry has long complained that YouTube doesn’t pay record labels enough from the ads it runs next to their artists’ videos, and that those payouts are paltry compared with what they get from subscription streaming services. But now Google has a subscription music service of its own in the works, and it plans to nudge certain users into paying for it by luring them with exclusive offerings and annoying them with more ads when they attempt to use YouTube like a free music player. Lyon Cohen, YouTube’s global head of global music, told Bloomberg: “You’re not going to be happy after you are jamming ‘Stairway to Heaven’ and you get an ad right after that.” Speak for yourself, Lyon!\n—Drop Your Weapons—\nAmid the Facebook din this week, YouTube quietly updated its guidelines to ban videos that promote or link to websites selling firearms and accessories, Bloomberg reported. Also prohibited under the new policies, which are set to go into effect in April, are instructional videos that show how to assemble firearms. With the new rules, YouTube is wading into the fraught U.S. gun control debate, which risks angering some content creators and users who may migrate elsewhere. One channel devoted to firearms, InRange TV, has already said that it plans to start uploading videos on PornHub instead. Pivot to PornHub?\nBest of the rest Meredith said it plans to lay off an additional 1,000 staffers at recently acquired Time Inc. over the next 10 months and confirmed it is exploring the possible sale of Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money.

[ Business Insider ]\nMusa Tariq, a former Apple Inc. executive hired last year to be Ford’s first brand chief, is leaving the company after a little more than a year on the job. Ford’s marketing chief, Joy Falotico, will assume Mr. Tariq’s brand responsibilities. [ WSJ ]\nFacebook removed an option to target ads by sexual orientation last month, which has made it harder for some organizations offering services to the LGBT community to reach their audiences. [ BuzzFeed News ]\nStarbucks wants to get more people using its mobile-ordering app. It’ll now be available to all its customers, not just those on its loyalty program.
