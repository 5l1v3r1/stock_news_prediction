To obtain information or aid in the investigation, please visit the Ericsson investigation page on our website at www.glancylaw.com/case/ericsson-telefonaktiebolaget-lm .\nThe investigation concerns whether Ericsson misled investors regarding the viability of certain long-term service contracts that accounted for annual revenues of over $1 billion. The truth was partially revealed on July 18, 2017, when Ericsson reported disappointing results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. During the related earnings call, the Company revealed that it had identified 42 long-term service contracts to date with total annual sales of almost $1 billion that Ericsson would exit, renegotiate, or transform. On this news, Ericsson ADS price fell $1.21 per share, or 16.62%, to close at $6.07 per share on July 18, 2017.\nFollow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/GPM_LLP .\nIf you purchased Ericsson securities, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Lesley Portnoy, Esquire, of GPM, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com , or visit our website at www.glancylaw.com .
