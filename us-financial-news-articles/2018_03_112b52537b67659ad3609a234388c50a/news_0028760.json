The F-150 will get more low-end torque for towing and a mobile generator, and utility vehicles will be able to conserve fuel. \n\"So every time we launch a utility in North America our intention is to have a hybrid,\" he said. \"That's a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or in some cases, both. We've moved past hybrids being a science project.\"\nToyota has been a leader in hybrids ever since it introduced the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle, the Prius, in the late 1990s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:54:13.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
