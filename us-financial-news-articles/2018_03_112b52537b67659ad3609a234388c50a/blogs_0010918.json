Supporters attacked Antonio Argento’s home and burnt a car in his drive on Sunday morning, shortly after a 2-1 defeat by San Miguel, their fourth loss in a row, Argento told Reuters. The result left the club five points adrift at the bottom of the Primera B Metropolitana standings. “Because of this bad run of form we’re going through we’re used to threats on social media, jokes and demands for our resignation,” Argento said.“But this violence is unacceptable.” Police said Argento had filed an official report but noted it was not the first time he has been threatened. Members of the so-called barra brava, Argentina’s often violent organized fan groups, previously smashed windows at his home. Football-related violence has spiraled in Argentina in recent years with threats and physical violence against players and officials now commonplace. Reporting by Ramiro Scandolo.
