Beiersdorf traditionally gives conservative targets that it beats.\nIt highlighted a strong fourth quarter for its consumer business, bucking sector trends, with analysts saying Nivea sales accelerated to an implied 6.9 percent in the period.\nGerman rival Henkel last week reported a strong fourth-quarter performance in its adhesives business, although the producer of Schwarzkopf haircare products saw falling beauty sales and gave a muted outlook for 2018.\nBeiersdorf, which had already reported that it beat its 2017 forecast with a 5.7 percent rise in organic group sales, said its operating profit margin for 2017 rose to 15.4 percent from 15 percent in 2016, slightly below average analyst forecasts.\nEarnings per share of 2.96 euros missed the 3.15 euros forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon, which the company blamed on one-off gains in 2016, negative exchange rate effects and losses from financial investments.\n“Acceleration in Nivea is a bright spot, though we think the miss on Tesa margins and 2018 outlook for the division will disappoint. Negative readacross to Henkel,” Jefferies analysts wrote, rating the stock“hold”.\nRival Unilever, which reported a bigger-than-expected acceleration in fourth-quarter sales growth, helped by the launch of new brands, has forecast underlying sales growth of 3 to 5 percent for 2018.
