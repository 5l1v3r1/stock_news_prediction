Earlier this year, government energy regulators rejected a similar request from the Energy Department. \nFirst Energy FE, -0.65% delivered the new request just hours after the company announced Wednesday evening its plans to close three nuclear-power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania by 2021 if it can’t sell them. FirstEnergy’s fleet of coal and nuclear plants has been tottering on bankruptcy, hit like many of its peers nationwide by aggressive competition from cleaner gas-fired and renewable power generators that have become cheaper to run in the past decade. \nThe request goes to President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, Rick Perry, who has said several times these plants are vital to stable prices and a reliable electric grid. Late last year, he pitched a plan to guarantee profits for these plants, which would keep them open by ensuring they wouldn’t have to compete in electricity markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected that plan, saying it didn’t appear necessary. The utilities say Perry can use emergency powers to enact a similar plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T20:04:16.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
