It has boosted military presence in the area and called on Bogota to do the same.\nThe Colombian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAdditional reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T18:59:32.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
