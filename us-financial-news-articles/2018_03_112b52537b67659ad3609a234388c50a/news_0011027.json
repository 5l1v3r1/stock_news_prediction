The Nuggets went 19-for-35 from beyond the arc, outscoring the Cavaliers 57-27 on 3-pointers.\nBarton collected a team-high eight rebounds and seven assists to complement his 23 points, while Nikola Jokic had a similarly well-rounded game with nine points, seven rebounds and a team-high eight assists.\nWilson Chandler and Jamal Murray added 16 points apiece and Millsap finished with 11 for the Nuggets, who will go for a 3-0 trip Tuesday at Dallas.\nJR Smith backed James with 19 points for the Cavaliers, who fell to 5-4 since reshaping their roster at the trade deadline.\nJames lost for the 15th time in 27 career games against Denver. He has a losing record against just three teams, the others being Houston and San Antonio.\nGeorge Hill (17 points), Larry Nance Jr. (14), Cedi Osman (13), Tristan Thompson (12) and Jordan Clarkson (11) also scored in double figures for the Cavaliers, who never led in the final three quarters.\nPlaying the second night of a back-to-back, the Nuggets stormed out to a 10-point lead in the first quarter and never looked back.\nThey went up by as many as 14 in the second period and 15 in the third, at 99-84, before Hill (two) and Clarkson (one) combined for three 3-pointers in a 13-4 period-closing run that got Cleveland back within 103-97.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-04T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T15:54:56.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
