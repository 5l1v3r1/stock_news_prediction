They also snapped San Jose’s eight-game winning streak a few nights after ending the 10-game winning spree of the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nThe first two periods were almost mirror images. Twice San Jose took a lead and twice St. Louis pulled even.\nThe Sharks had the early edge in play and were rewarded when Evander Kane opened the scoring at 6:26. Kane was the trailer on a rush, took a drop pass, moved to the high slot and unloaded a wrist shot that Allen only got a piece of with his trapper. Kane has netted nine goals and 14 points in 14 games since being traded to the Sharks at the deadline.\nBlues forward Oskar Sundqvist netted his first goal of the season at the 17:43 mark of the opening frame to tie the game. Sundqvist gained the puck at the top of the right circle, fired as he spun and sent a seeing-eye shot that beat screened Sharks goalie Aaron Dell.\nThe visitors again took a lead when captain Joe Pavelski scored on the power play at 7:07 of the second period. Pavelski, at the front of the net, deflected a Brent Burns point shot for his 20th goal of the season.\nHowever, Tarasenko made it a 2-2 game with a power-play goal at 12:03 of the middle frame. Tarasenko unloaded a shot from the left faceoff dot for his 30th goal of the season, a mark he has reached in four consecutive campaigns.\nWith his assist on the goal, Blues captain Alex Pietrangelo recorded his career-high 52nd point of the year.\nDell made 29 saves for the Sharks, who are on a 9-1-1 run and have a solid hold on second place in the Pacific Division.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T19:05:37.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
