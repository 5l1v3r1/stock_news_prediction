Freight Force management, led by Chris Coppersmith, will continue with the business and will join STG as shareholders and senior members of its operations management team.\nHeadquartered in Anaheim, CA, Freight Force operates the nation’s largest network of independent carriers serving freight forwarders and other third party logistics providers.
