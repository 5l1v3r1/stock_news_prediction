Abloh’s first men’s collection for Vuitton will be presented in June, the firm said.\nThe overhaul at Dior and Vuitton coincides with reshuffles elsewhere at LVMH, as billionaire boss Bernard Arnault seeks to breathe new life into some labels and lift others to a new level by expanding product lines.
