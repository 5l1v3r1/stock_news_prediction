I don’t know exactly how long it will take to heal but it means I am hopeful of getting back for Punchestown. Aintree is not going to happen for me though. “The prognosis could have been a lot worse and I just have to treat this as just another setback. I am determined to get back in the saddle for Punchestown and hopefully finish the season on a high.” The Grand National is at Aintree on April 14, with Punchestown on April 24-28. Mullins has 12-1 joint favorite Total Recall among his Grand National contenders. Walsh won the Grand National in 2000 on Papillon and 2005 on Hedgehunter. He also finished second in 2006 and third in 2009.
