Ducey in 2016 welcomed Uber to his state with celebration, saying at the time “We want you to know Arizona does want Uber.” (Reporting by David Schwartz; Writing by Heather Somerville; Editing by Sandra Maler)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T07:11:39.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
