In the first half of the year, we invested in infrastructure and process improvements to support our focus on G6 sales. In the second half of the year, we began to see the benefits of those investments, which included a record number of shipments of both G6 systems and probes in the fourth quarter,” said William M. Moore, President and CEO. “Our focus in 2018 is to drive G6 probe utilization from our existing G6 system installed base while continuing to expand our installed base worldwide, and to introduce new products that improve the quality, reliability, and manufacturing cost of all of our products.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended December 30, 2017 decreased 18% to $10.2 million from $12.5 million during the same period of the prior year. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by the Company’s voluntary recall of its TruFocus LIO Premiere™, a laser accessory used in both its medical and surgical retina product lines. The decrease was partially offset by revenue from record G6 system and probe shipments.\nGross profit for fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.2 million, or 21.2% gross margin, compared to $5.6 million, or 44.4% gross margin, in the same period of the prior year. Gross margin was primarily impacted by expenses related to the LIO recall and pricing pressure on its retina products, which offset the benefit from higher margin G6 revenues.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $7.4 million compared to $6.6 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase is attributable to investments to support the Company’s commercial infrastructure, including increased sales and marketing expenses.\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.2 million, compared to loss from operations of $1.1 million for the same period of the prior year.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for the year ended December 30, 2017 decreased 10% to $41.6 million from $46.2 million in 2016. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower medical and surgical retina product sales, which were impacted primarily by the LIO recall.\nGross profit for the full year 2017 was $15.5 million, or 37.3% gross margin, compared to $20.8 million, or 45.1% gross margin, for the prior year. Gross margin decreased primarily due to expenses related to the Company’s LIO product recall, unfavorable product and geographic mix changes, lower selling price for its retina products, and an increase in manufacturing variances.\nOperating expenses for 2017 were $28.4 million compared to $23.4 million in the prior year. This increase is attributable to investments to support the Company’s commercial infrastructure, including increased sales and marketing expenses.\nLoss from operations for 2017 was $12.9 million, compared to net loss of $2.6 million in the prior year.\nCash and cash equivalents were $21.7 million as of December 30, 2017.\nGuidance for Full Year 2018\nIRIDEX projects 2018 G6 probe shipments of 40,000 to 45,000, which represents growth of approximately 32% year-over-year at the midpoint, and projects shipments of 350 to 400 G6 systems in 2018. Total revenue for the full year is expected to be $37 million to $41 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nIRIDEX’s management team will host a conference call today beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.
