Credit: Block Real Estate Services, LLC\nAcquired by TPG Capital in 2017, Mediware received a notable influx of capital to pursue its expansion strategy, which includes major acquisition targets. Mediware already announced the acquisition of Medicare billing company MEDTranDirect in the first month of 2018 alone, and has no plans of slowing down. As a result, the company recognized it would quickly outgrow its current headquarters. Mediware employs more than 900 people across nine offices, including nearly 100 full-time employees in its Lenexa headquarters. The company is actively recruiting and hiring, so leadership recognized it would quickly outgrow its current space.\n“We are establishing a modern world headquarters for Mediware, and it will be a good home for our fast-growing company for years to come,” said Bill Miller, CEO of Mediware. “We live and work in the Kansas City metropolitan area. By establishing our headquarters here, we are making a tangible commitment to Kansas City as one of the most important hubs for tech innovation and in the world.”\n“We are thrilled to welcome Mediware into CityPlace Corporate Centre III,” said Ken Block, managing partner of Block Real Estate Services. “The company’s aspiration and commitment to the community made them the ideal tenant for this promising new construction project, and we’re thrilled to partner with them as we continue developing the space.”\nAbout Mediware\nMediware is a leading supplier of software for healthcare and human service providers and payers.
