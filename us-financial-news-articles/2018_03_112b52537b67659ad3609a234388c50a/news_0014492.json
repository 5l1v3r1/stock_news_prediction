We believe being named to the Constellation ShortList across so many solution lines this quarter demonstrates our unique ability to help meet the various needs of both IT and business users – by delivering the speed, self-service and agility that front-line business workers demand and the scale and control designed to help meet rigorous corporate data standards.\"\nNotably, Birst, an Infor company, was named to Constellation ShortList for cloud-based business intelligence and analytics platforms for the fourth consecutive time. Birst's networked approach to BI and analytics is designed to enable a single view of applicable data, eliminating data silos. Decentralized teams and individual users can augment the corporate data model with their own local data, without compromising data governance. Consistency comes from a unified semantic layer, which maintains common definitions and key metrics, no matter where users sit. The Birst platform can also make it possible for enterprises to create their own analytics products or monetize their data. The platform can pre-integrate data management, visual language and analysis in one place and provides applicable utilities designed to help companies embed that information into applicable business applications.\n\"Boardrooms and their executive suites must be cognizant of the business extinction events and the exponential technologies that will transform their industries,\" said R \"Ray\" Wang, chairman and founder at Constellation Research. \"Each Constellation ShortList, researched and curated by our analysts, is designed to help guides early adopters in identifying the right technologies to support new business models and improve engagement.
