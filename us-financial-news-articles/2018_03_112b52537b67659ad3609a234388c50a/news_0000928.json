We are appreciative of all the support and partnership provided to us by Harte Hanks over the last three years and plan to continue to work closely with them to support our current and future joint clients.\"\n3Q Digital, which encompasses nine offices across the country and $700M annual spend under management, takes its place as the largest independent agency in digital marketing, a position it held before acquisition in 2015. The agency's unique approach to partnership, which integrates strategy and growth services into a full suite of marketing channels, has helped grow hundreds of clients including Pinterest, Blurb, UNTUCKit, Stitch Fix, and SurveyMonkey.\nThe re-acquisition allows 3Q Digital flexibility to expand the services and capabilities that have proven uniquely effective for growth-oriented clients.\n\"The 3Q Digital team has exceeded our expectations of partnership by helping build and execute our marketing strategy,\" Blurb's Director of Acquisition Marketing, Julio Loredo, said. \"Each member of the team is closely aligned with our new goals, which has changed the direction of Blurb. The transformation of our program has us excited about 2018 and beyond.\"\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/3q-digital-announces-purchase-from-harte-hanks-inc-300606258.html\nSOURCE 3Q Digital", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/3q-digital-announces-purchase-from-harte-hanks-inc-300606258.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T02:30:50.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
