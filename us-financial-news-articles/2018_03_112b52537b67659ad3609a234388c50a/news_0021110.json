(NASDAQ:RNET), a global technology company that provides customized communications services, applications and cybersecurity solutions, today reported results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nQuarterly revenue was $56.8 million representing an increase of $6.0 million compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $4.1 million compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue increase compared to the prior quarter reflects a $3.7 million increase in Systems Integration revenue, a $1.5 million increase in Managed Services revenue and a $0.8 million increase in Apps & IoT. The increase compared to the prior year quarter reflects a $4.4 million increase in Apps & IoT and a $3.8 million increase in Systems Integration revenue partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in Managed Services revenue. Revenue increased due to our strategy of growth into the application layer and internet-of-things space coupled with the acquisitions of DTS and ESS.\nGAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders was $5.7 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4.2 million, or $0.23 per share, in the prior quarter and net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3.8 million, or $0.21 per share, in the prior year quarter.\nQuarterly Adjusted EBITDA was $8.5 million compared to $7.8 million in the prior quarter and $9.4 million in the prior year quarter. The increase compared to the prior quarter was due primarily to increased revenue. The decrease compared to the prior year quarter was due primarily to increased operating expenses partially offset by increased revenue. Operating expenses have increased due to our investing in our growth strategy including investing in Apps & IoT and our sales and marketing efforts.\nCapital expenditures were $4.0 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior quarter and $3.7 million in the prior year quarter. Unlevered Free Cash Flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, was $4.6 million compared to $2.0 million in the prior quarter and $5.7 million in the prior year quarter.\nIn the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $0.5 million increase in fair value of an earn-out, $1.2 million in executive departure costs and $0.6 million in acquisition costs. In the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded $0.8 million in acquisition costs and $0.8 million in restructuring charges. In the quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $0.6 million of restructuring charges. The restructuring charges, acquisition costs and change in fair value of the earn-out are added back to net loss in our non-GAAP measures below. In the third quarter of 2017, after the acquisition of ESS, the Company reorganized its business and reportable segments into Managed Services, Apps & IoT and Systems Integration. All historical segment financial data has been recast to conform to the current presentation.\nSteven E. Pickett, chief executive officer and president, commented, \"The RigNet team delivered revenue growth for the third sequential quarter along with two sequential quarters of growth in both Adjusted EBITDA and Unlevered Free Cash Flow. Additionally, compared to the prior year quarter, site count increased in every category that we track with an aggregate increase of 250 sites. The Intelie acquisition, that was announced earlier this quarter, will deliver real time machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that will take our clients to a new level by allowing timely prediction models based on live data delivered over our highly reliable network and secured by our unique cybersecurity capabilities from the Cyphre acquisition. Our clients will now be “always connected, always secure and always learning”. The Intelie acquisition further delivers on our stated strategy of moving up the stack in order to deliver a more robust and highly differentiated managed communications service to our customers.”\nA conference call for investors will be held at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) on Wednesday, March 7, 2018, to discuss RigNet’s 2017 fourth quarter and full year results.
