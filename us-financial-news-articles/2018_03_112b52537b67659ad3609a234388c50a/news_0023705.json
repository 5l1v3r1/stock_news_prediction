He also collected a team-high 12 rebounds.\nGolden State was playing without Stephen Curry, out with an ankle injury, for the second straight game.\nZaza Pachulia chipped in with 16 points and 11 rebounds off the bench for the Warriors, who won the season series 2-1 over the Timberwolves despite the loss.\nThompson finished with 21 points, while Draymond Green had 10 points, eight rebounds and a team-high seven assists.\nThe loss was the Warriors’ eighth in 15 games against the Northwest Division this season. They are 44-8 against the rest of the league.\nAfter the teams played to an 84-all tie through three quarters, Tyus Jones gave Minnesota the lead for good with a jumper in the second minute of the final period.\nThe Timberwolves went on to lead by as many as seven before the Warriors tightened the defensive screws, limiting Minnesota to 1-for-7 shooting over a 3 1/2-minute stretch that allowed them to rally within 104-103 on Durant’s 3-pointer with 2:08 to go.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T13:05:43.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
