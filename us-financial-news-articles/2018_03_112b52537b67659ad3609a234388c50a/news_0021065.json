Investors tempted to buy Spotify stock when it goes public later this month could end up sympathizing. The popular music-streaming app has revived the recorded music industry but done little to disrupt its balance of power.\nThis is most obvious in the company’s gross margin—the gap between its revenues and variable costs. These costs consist mainly of the royalties it pays to the “big three” rights holders, Universal Music, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music, as well as Merlin, a consortium of independent labels.\nLast year the gross margin improved as Spotify signed new licensing deals. It hit 24.5% in the fourth quarter, up from 17.5% in the comparable period of 2016, according to the company prospectus published last week . But improving it to a level more typical of the tech industry will be a slow grind.\nLicensing deals are negotiated every couple of years, so investors will have to wait for the next chance to strike a new bargain. Growing bigger should help Spotify cut incrementally better deals, but won’t resolve the basic problem that ownership of must-have content is concentrated in so few hands. The big three plus Merlin accounted for 87% of songs streamed on Spotify last year.\nVideo-streaming giant Netflix —whose longtime Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy is now in the same role at Spotify—ran into something like this problem in 2011, notes Wesley Lebeau, a fund manager for CPR Asset Management. Faced with escalating content costs, it bet big on exclusive productions, starting with “House of Cards.” The gamble paid off so well that production houses are now scrambling to consolidate their bargaining power; hence the battle between Disney and Comcast for bits of 21st Century Fox . Netflix had a 34% gross margin last year.\nBut music is different: Apart from the concentration of rights ownership, new albums don’t have the same marketing pull as a new TV series. Spotify’s prospectus argues that “personalization, not exclusivity, is key to our continued success.” Competing with the record labels to get a better deal just doesn’t seem a viable option.\nSpotify could boost gross margins by increasing prices. But unlike Netflix, which raised the cost of its key U.S. streaming package before Christmas, Spotify’s monthly subscriptions fell to €5.32 ($6.55) last year, from €6.84 in 2015.\nThis is partly because Spotify, in a bid to compete with rival Apple Music, rolled out “family plans” that give six household members access for only 50% more than the price of an individual subscription. But it could also reflect the different relationship consumers have with music, which they otherwise listen to free on the radio or Alphabet’s YouTube. Netflix is much cheaper than a cable package; Spotify benefits from no such direct comparison.\nPrivate share transactions in February valued Spotify’s equity at $19.7 billion, roughly 19 times last year’s gross profits. The equivalent multiple for Netflix is 32 times. If investors want Spotify to be the Netflix for music, with a valuation to match, it needs to demonstrate more pricing power, both with consumers and the music industry.\nFor all the growth on show in its prospectus, Spotify still looks like a company that will only ever make as much money as the big record labels let it.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-06T15:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T19:48:57.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
