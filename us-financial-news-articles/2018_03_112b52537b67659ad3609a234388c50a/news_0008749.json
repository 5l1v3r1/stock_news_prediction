Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour talks during a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry at Tahrir Palace in Cairo, Egypt February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Amr Nabil/Pool Khartoum has not explained why it recalled Abdel Mahmoud Abdel Halim early in January. But disputes over the ownership of the Halayeb Triangle border area and Egyptian suspicion of a Sudan-Turkey naval agreement have strained ties. “Relations between our people and our countries are historic and maintaining them is a responsibility. Setting them on the right path is a duty,” Ghandour told Reuters on Saturday. A committee including the foreign ministers and heads of intelligence from both countries met in Cairo last month in an attempt to cool tensions. Sudan has accused Cairo of political meddling and banned imports of Egyptian agricultural products last year.
