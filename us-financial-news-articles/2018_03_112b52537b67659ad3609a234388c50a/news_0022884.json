It’s a fatalistic society, so (if) it changes leader or not change leader, the system and the culture always stay the same.”\nFirst designed for the National Gallery of Prague, Ai’s “Law of the Journey” is made from the rubber used by vessels carrying refugees across the Mediterranean Sea.\nInstalled on Cockatoo Island, a former shipbuilding site, it will serve as the centerpiece of the Sydney Biennale, running from Friday to June 11.\nAi said the location was appropriate because of Australia’s controversial policy of detaining unauthorized boat arrivals in camps in the Pacific island nation of Nauru and Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island.\nChinese artist Ai Weiwei stands in front of his artwork consisting of a 60-metre rubber raft installation titled 'Law of the Journey' which includes around 300 figures representing refugees, during a media call for the Biennale of Sydney located in the industrial precinct of Cockatoo Island in Australia, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/David Gray “Australia’s refugee record is quite poor, internationally,” he added.\n“There’s no excuse for any kind of policy (that) should not consider protecting basic human rights.”\nSlideshow (3 Images) The artist, who helped design the stadium of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games but was arrested in 2011 following criticism of the ruling Chinese Comumunist Party, said he was not concerned the changes could bring a regime with “no end”.\n“People’s lives (are) getting better,” he said.\n“You see so many youngsters study outside and I think that the Western idea to respect very basic human values has become more and more important for a society to maintain the competition.”\nAi is set to speak on Thursday at the Australian launch of his asylum-seeker documentary, “Human Flow”, at the Sydney Opera House.\nAi, who has lived in Berlin since 2015, said he wanted the film to make people see refugees in a different light, as they were victims of man-made problems.\n(This story has been corrected to fix wording in Quote: s in paragraphs 4,5,12,13)\nReporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T09:03:17.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
