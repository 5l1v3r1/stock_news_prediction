The homebuilding assets acquired include more than 1,300 homesites and more than 150 homes under construction. The acquisition furthers Stanley Martin's plans for expansion and establishes the company as a strong competitor in the Southeast United States homebuilding market.\nStanley Martin Companies enjoyed a tremendously successful 2017 with over 1,000 homes sold in the Metro Washington, D.C., Richmond, Charlottesville and Raleigh markets. Stanley Martin's mortgage subsidiary, First Heritage Mortgage, originated more than $1 billion of home mortgages in the same period. First Heritage will also expand to both Atlanta and Charleston.\n\"The Atlanta housing market is one of the strongest in the U.S. and will be important to our anticipated growth,\" said Stanley Martin President Steven Alloy. \"This transaction blends two fundamentally similar companies. Both strive to provide new homes in sought-after locations that accentuate the surrounding areas with walkability, outdoor living spaces, sought-after community amenities, high-quality construction standards and exceptional customer service.\"\nAtlanta-based FrontDoor Communities has been building in Atlanta and Charleston for 6 years and finished 2017 with 165 home closings and revenues of $97 million. Members of FrontDoor Communities' executive team, including FrontDoor Communities CEO Terry Russell and FrontDoor Communities President and Chief Operating Officer Mike Langella, will join Stanley Martin and continue running the Atlanta and Charleston operations. FrontDoor will begin operating as Stanley Martin Homes in both Atlanta and Charleston.\n\"Joining Stanley Martin will enable our continued growth and expansion in Atlanta and Charleston and support our commitment to both quality and customer satisfaction,\" said Russell. \"I have known the people at Stanley Martin for many years and have a strong appreciation for the company's proud history and reputation for quality as well as the dedicated professionals in their organization. Our team looks forward to joining a homebuilder that shares the same beliefs regarding the delivery of superior product quality and outstanding service to our customers.\"\nAbout Stanley Martin Companies\nHeadquartered in Reston, Virginia, Stanley Martin Homes builds new condominiums, townhomes and single-family homes in Metro Washington D.C., Charlottesville, Richmond and Raleigh.
