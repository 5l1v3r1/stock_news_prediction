Delegates and officials say “centralized, unified leadership” under Xi will allow continuity in decision-making to better steer China’s modernization. Others saw the change as setting China on a risky path. The revision “disrupts the key feature that the Chinese Communist Party, unlike most other communist parties, had been able to achieve: leadership succession,” said Daniel Leese, a professor at Germany’s University of Freiburg. “The risk of compiling all power in one hand will become visible most clearly in periods of crisis,” said Leese, who has studied the Mao personality cult.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-11T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-11T16:07:36.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
