The maximum fine under Saskatchewan’s environmental rules is C$1 million ($778,938), with the federal laws allowing for fines ranging from C$15,000 to C$1 million.\nA spokesman for Husky said the company would need to review the charges before responding to the specifics, but said the company takes fully responsibility for the incident.\n“We deeply regret this happened and we are sorry for the impact it had. We have worked hard every day since to make things right and we have learned from it,” said Mel Duvall, spokesman for the Calgary-based energy producer.\nHusky is expected to appear in a Saskatchewan court on Thursday.\n($1 = 1.2838 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; editing by G Crosse and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T11:38:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
