(Nasdaq:APLS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a platform of novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and business highlights.\n“In 2017 we made significant progress across our clinical programs and successfully completed our initial public offering. This momentum has continued into 2018, with the recently announced 18-month data from the Phase 2 FILLY trial in patients with GA reinforcing the statistically significant effect seen at 12 months and supporting our plans to move to Phase 3 in the second half of this year,” said Cedric Francois, MD, PhD, founder and chief executive officer of Apellis. “We plan to advance APL-2 in multiple indications throughout the upcoming year, including initiating Phase 3 trials in GA and PNH, Phase 2 proof-of-concept data readouts in AIHA and CDN, and data readouts in our Phase 1b eculizumab add-on and monotherapy expansion studies in PNH. We believe that APL-2 and our core focus of targeting the complement pathway centrally at the level of C3 has the potential to help patients with unmet needs in these indications, and in a broad variety of other complement-mediated conditions.”\nBusiness Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:\nAPL-2 in Geographic Atrophy\nIn December 2017, Apellis announced that it had finalized the Phase 3 trial design evaluating APL-2 for the treatment of patients with geographic atrophy associated with AMD (GA), following discussions with the FDA. The Phase 3 trial of APL-2 in GA remains on track to begin in the second half of 2018. In August 2017, Apellis announced that APL-2 met its primary endpoint of reducing the rate of lesion growth (measured as the change in the square root of the GA lesion area) compared to sham after 12 months of treatment in the Phase 2 FILLY trial in patients with GA, showing a statistically significant effect and what the Company believes to be a clinically meaningful effect. Apellis recently reported 18-month data on its Phase 2 FILLY trial of APL-2 in patients with GA.\nAPL-2 in PNH\nThe Phase 3 trial of APL-2 in PNH remains on track to begin in the second half of 2018 and APL-2 Phase 1b eculizumab add-on and monotherapy expansion trial updates are anticipated in the first half of 2018. In December 2017, Apellis presented an update on its Phase 1b PHAROAH trial evaluating treatment with APL-2 as add-on therapy with eculizumab in patients with PNH who have low hemoglobin levels, at the 12th Annual Scientific Assembly of the International PNH Interest Group (IPIG). In June 2017, Apellis provided a clinical update on its two Phase 1b clinical trials with APL-2 in the treatment of patients with PNH, showing rapid and durable improvements in lactate dehydrogenase and hemoglobin levels in patients, both as monotherapy and as add-on therapy with eculizumab. In March 2017, Apellis announced that the European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug designation for APL-2 in PNH.\nAPL-2 In Other Indications\nThe Phase 2 POC monotherapy data for APL-2 in AIHA remains on track for the first half of 2018. The Phase 2 POC monotherapy data for APL-2 in four types of complement-dependent nephropathies, including IgA nephropathy, C3 glomerulonephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis, are expected in the second half of 2018.\nOther\nIn November 2017, Apellis completed an initial public offering of 11.7 million shares of common stock at $14.00 per share, raising net proceeds of $150.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. Apellis expanded its management team in key functions during 2017. In March 2017, Steven Axon was appointed to the role of Chief Business Officer. Mr. Axon was previously Senior Vice President of Business Development at EMD Serono. In September 2017, Dr. Federico Grossi was promoted to the role of Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs. In October 2017, Timothy Sullivan was appointed to the role of Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Sullivan was previously an observer on Apellis’ board of directors for nearly three years and a Partner at venture capital firm, AJU IB investment, where he led the firm’s life science company investments. In November 2017, Apellis initiated a Phase 1 study with APL-9, a new product candidate, administered intravenously. Apellis will provide further updates on APL-9 in 2018.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results :\nAs of December 31, 2017, Apellis had $175.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $24.9 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the receipt of $150.0 million of net proceeds from Apellis’ initial public offering, which closed in November 2017, in addition to $19.7 million of net proceeds from a Series E preferred stock financing and $27.0 million in debt financing, partially offset by operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business.\nApellis reported a net loss of $18.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $6.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, Apellis reported a net loss of $51.0 million, compared to a net loss of $27.1 million for the full year of 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $13.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year of 2017, research and development expenses were $40.3 million, compared to $23.0 million for the full year of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of $8.2 million in manufacturing expenses, $3.7 million in clinical trial costs, $2.9 million in employee-related costs primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel, $2.7 million related to research and development supporting activities, and $1.5 million in device development expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in preclinical study expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year of 2017, general and administrative expenses were $10.5 million, compared to $4.3 million for the full year of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs of $3.8 million, an increase in professional and consulting fees of $1.5 million, and an increase in office, travel and related costs of $0.9 million.\nAbout Apellis\nApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment of a broad range of life-threatening or debilitating autoimmune diseases based upon complement immunotherapy through the inhibition of the complement system at the level of C3.
