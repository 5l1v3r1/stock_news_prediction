We can’t wait around for other levels of government to do something about it or the private sector,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. “We have to act now.”\nAtlanta officials worked alongside federal law enforcement and technicians from private security firms on Thursday to investigate the cause of the attack that encrypted data on computers.\nAtlanta City Council President Felicia Moore said she was waiting to hear more about how the hackers breached city networks, the scope of the attack and when city services would be fully operational.\n“Everybody in the public wants to know. I want to know, too,” Moore said at a news conference. “But I do think that we need to give them an opportunity to get the information.”\nAtlanta on Thursday reactivated a website that allows residents to make requests for trash pickup, report traffic signal outages and ask for other public works-related services.\nMunicipal court services remained offline on Thursday and City Hall employees told Reuters their work computers were still unusable a week after the hack was detected.
