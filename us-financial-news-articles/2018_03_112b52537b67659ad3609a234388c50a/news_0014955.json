Whether you are the CEO of the company or a maid,” said 42-year-old entrepreneur Suman Chhabria Addepalli in Mumbai.\nFrom film sets, parliaments to businesses, revelations of sexual abuse have sent shockwaves around the world. Even the aid sector was hit by reports that some staff at charity Oxfam paid for sex with prostitutes in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.\nA survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in February found more than 120 staff from about 20 leading global charities were fired or lost their jobs in 2017 over sexual misconduct.\n“I think it’s a tipping point for long-term change for women. It’s time that our voices are heard,” said New York-based senior executive Fabiana Mello.\nNOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY But not all women feel they are able to speak out against abuse, said Jemima Olchawski from the Fawcett Society, a women’s rights group in Britain.\n“It’s always incumbent on us to watch out for the gaps - who’s not part of this conversation? Whose voice isn’t being heard?” she said.\nIn parts of Africa, Latin America and Asia, the #MeToo campaign has struggled to gain momentum.\nBrazilian shopkeeper Talita Celia e Silva, 29, said many women remain too fearful to speak out against their abuser.\n“We do not know how far (the movement) will go ... I think there are a lot of women who still suffer and are afraid to talk,” said Silva from Rio de Janeiro.\nMumbai consultant Archana Aravind Patney, 43, believes conversations about #MeToo and sexual harassment have died down in India, where the fatal gang rape of woman on a bus in 2012 sparked protests and global attention to violence against women.\n“I hardly see people talking about it. Maybe people think this was a short-term, celebrity kind of a campaign, but not something that can impact them,” Patney said.\nNairobi student Faith, 22, said sexual harassment and the #MeToo movement is not taken seriously in Kenya and some men “think it’s some sort of joke”.\n“I think it’s a long-term thing in the West, but here in Kenya, it’s more of a social media buzz,” said Faith, who did not want to give her surname for privacy.\nAnother Kenyan student Brian, 21, who did not want his surname used, said limited internet access meant that people in poorer rural communities would not be able to fully participate in the online movement.\nThe global campaign has also failed to make a mark in Thailand as there is little discussion of women’s rights and sexual abuse, said Jadet Chaowilai, director of rights group Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation.\n“There is a very deep-rooted patriarchy, and women don’t feel comfortable talking about harassment or abuse - even with their families,” he said.\nThere are few convictions for abuse and rape, despite more victims coming forward rising in recent years, he said.\n“If they do try to register a complaint with the police, very often they will be blamed, their behavior criticized: ‘Why were you out late? What were you wearing? Why did you talk to that man?’,” Chaowilai said.\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Additional reporting by Cormac O'Brien in London, Rina Chandran in Bangkok, Nita Bhalla in Nairobi, Sebastien Malo in New York, Karla Mendes in Rio de Janeiro, Roli Srivastava in Mumbai, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts, land and property rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, women's rights, climate change and resilience.
