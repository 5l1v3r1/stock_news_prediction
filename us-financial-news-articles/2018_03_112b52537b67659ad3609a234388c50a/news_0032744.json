Akari's lead drug candidate Coversin is a C5 complement inhibitor currently being evaluated in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). In addition to its C5 inhibitory activity, Coversin independently and specifically inhibits leukotriene B4 (LTB4) activity. Akari intends to evaluate Coversin in two conditions, the skin and eye diseases bullous pemphigoid and atopic keratoconjunctivitis, where the dual action of Coversin on both C5 and LTB4 may be beneficial. Akari is also developing other tick derived proteins, including long acting versions.\nFor more information\nInvestor Contact:\nPeter Vozzo\nWestwicke Partners\n(443) 213-0505\npeter.vozzo@westwicke.com\nMedia Contact:\nMary-Jane Elliott / Sukaina Virji / Nicholas Brown\nConsilium Strategic Communications\n+44 (0)20 3709 5700\nAkari@consilium-comms.com\nSource:Akari Therapeutics Plc", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8d978f50-07a9-40a3-be69-45f51ccd94d9", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=K7NfNs2SUeOos5i7afY_zyPvC8i-uFwT4GQXnJiPS-QXT0NGZUzgvJKfDnYb241WSnajDtudE7_Ez6gF4BFMBw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZOQn_VedOd9coa3B3d40OldF7AGL3-RlpsSnB56ccBoAIDY-0rgjjem5Oe2UGO7V8IueHA40JmV3QrmDf6UaQTkeyeLO9g9e_aT7kgZWtd0="], "published": "2018-03-16T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T18:06:50.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
