Batsmen Cameron Bancroft has been charged by the International Cricket Council and Smith told reporters that it was a deliberate plan from the “leadership group” of the side, but added he would not step down as captain. “The leadership group knew about it, we spoke about it at lunch,” Smith told a news conference. “I am not proud of what has happened. It’s not in the spirit of the game, my integrity and the integrity of the team has been damaged and rightfully so. It’s not on and it won’t happen again, I can promise you.” (Reporting By Nick Said Editing by Toby Davis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-24T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T23:51:07.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
