The new terminal is scheduled to open for service in September 2020.\nAOT, a beneficiary of the Thai tourism boom, has seen its shares surge 68 percent in the past year on expectations of higher revenue sharing in the new concession and expansion, analysts said.\nIts concession revenue in the three-month period to December 31, 2017, was 3.9 billion baht ($124.80 million), up 19 percent from a year ago.\nThe Thai government holds a 70 percent stake in AOT.\n$1 = 31.2500 baht Reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:52:01.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
