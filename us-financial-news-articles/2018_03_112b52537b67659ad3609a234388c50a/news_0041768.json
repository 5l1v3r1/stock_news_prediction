Left armer Boult bowled England captain Joe Root (nought), all-rounder Ben Stokes (nought) and Chris Woakes (five) and had Alastair Cook (five) and Dawid Malan (two) caught behind. His fellow new ball partner Tim Southee had opener Mark Stoneman caught behind by wicketkeeper BJ Watling (11), then took a return catch from Jonny Bairstow (nought) and then bowled Moeen Ali (nought). New Zealand captain Kane Williamson had won the toss and had no hesitation in choosing to bowl first with the pink ball.
