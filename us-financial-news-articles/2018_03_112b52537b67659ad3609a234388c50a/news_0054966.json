REUTERS/Beawiharta \nIn a rare move, the Competition Commission of Singapore (CCS) has commenced an investigation into the deal and proposed interim measures that will require Uber and Grab to maintain their pre-transaction independent pricing, the watchdog said in a statement on Friday. \nThe proposal also requires Uber and Grab not to take any action that might lead to the integration of their businesses in Singapore, a move likely to pose a major hurdle to the U.S. company’s attempt to improve profitability by exiting the loss-making Southeast Asian market. \nIt is the first time the commission has issued interim measures on any business in the country. \nUber and Grab announced the deal on Monday, marking the U.S. company’s second retreat from an Asian market. \nUnder the deal, Uber will take a 27.5 percent stake in Grab, which is valued at around $6 billion, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will join the Singapore-based company’s board. \nCCS proposals also require both Grab and Uber not to obtain from each other any confidential information including pricing, customers and drivers. \nThe two firms will be given an opportunity to make written representations to the CCS upon receipt of the proposed interim measures, it said. \nSingapore has a voluntary merger notification regime, and CCS has yet to receive the notification from Uber and Grab as of Friday, although the companies have indicated their intention to file a formal merger notification, CCS said. \nGrab and Uber were not immediately available for comment. \nThe deal is the industry’s first big consolidation in Southeast Asia, home to about 640 million people, and is widely expected to give Uber more firepower to focus on other markets including India, as it prepares for an IPO in 2019. \nUber lost $4.5 billion last year and is facing fierce competition at home in the United States and across Asia, as well as a regulatory crackdown in Europe. The firm has invested $700 million in its Southeast Asian operations.
