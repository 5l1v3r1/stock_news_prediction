Moreover, Operating Income reached P$12,112 million (+P$4,269 million or +54.4% vs. FY16).\nConsolidated Operating Revenues\nMobile Services\nAs of December 31, 2017, mobile clients amounted to 21.4 million.\nThird Parties Revenues amounted to P$44,726 million (+17.0% vs. FY16), of which the services revenues represented P$37,174 million (+22.2% vs. FY16). The commercial strategy was focused on the innovation, which promotes the consumption of mobile internet services through an updated offer of plans suitable for all market segments.\nPersonal in Argentina\nAs of December 31, 2017, Personal reached 19.0 million subscribers in Argentina, where postpaid clients represented 35% of the subscriber base.\nIn FY17, Third Parties Revenues reached P$41,797 million (+P$6,197 million or +17.4% vs. FY16) while Service Revenues (excluding equipment sales) amounted to P$34,289 million (+22.2% vs. FY16), with 49.7% corresponding to mobile internet revenues (vs. 38.6% as in FY16), as Mobile Internet Revenues amounted to P$17,048 million (+57.4% vs. FY16). Revenues from Outbound Mobile Services reached P$29,980 million (+20.6% vs. FY16), mainly due to price increases in postpaid client segments and, to a lesser extent, due to the increases in the amount of online recharges of prepaid subscribers. Meanwhile, Revenues from Inbound Mobile Services amounted to P$2,710 million (+58.4% vs. FY16), increase that was mainly generated by price increases in CPP and TLRD. In addition, equipment sales decreased by 1.2% vs. FY16, reaching P$7,446 million, equivalent to 17.8% of total revenues.\nThe average monthly revenue per user ('ARPU') amounted to $142.3 during FY17 (+26.8% vs. FY16).\nCommercial Initiatives\nFollowing the changes in customer consumption and working towards proposals focused on higher availability of data, Personal developed 'Gigas compartidos', the first offer of plans in the Argentine market which allows the sharing of data included in the plan between different mobile lines. Likewise, the proposal of free Whatsapp usage for customers who recharge credit continued, becoming a benchmark for the industry.\nAt the same time, the promotion of the update of our clients' devices with discounts and special financing continued, with a strong focus on e-commerce marketing. In this framework, Personal participated in the Cyber Monday 2017 where customers could access to 4G devices with discounts of up to 50% and 18 installments without interest.\nAs part of the actions associated with the brand positioning within the youth segment, Personal and Huawei presented the 12 th edition of 'Personal Fest 2017', where over 50,000 people enjoyed during two days music and outdoor entertainment, while more than 1.2 million followed it via streaming.\nPersonal in Paraguay ('Núcleo')\nAs of December 31, 2017, Núcleo's subscriber base reached around 2.5 million clients. Prepaid and postpaid customers represented 83% and 17%, respectively.\nNúcleo generated revenues from Third Parties equivalent to P$2,991 million during FY17 (+13.2% vs. FY16). Internet revenues amounted to P$1.294 million (+32.3% vs. FY16) representing 44.9% of FY17 service revenues (vs. 41.1% in FY16).\nFixed Services (Voice, Internet and Data)\nDuring FY17, Revenues generated by Fixed Services reached P$19.797 million, +32.7% vs. FY16; with Voice revenues increasing by +41.5% vs. FY16, mainly due to price increases in monthly fees. Meanwhile, Internet revenues grew by +28.7% vs. FY16 and Data Revenues were up by +22.5%.\nVoice\nTotal Voice revenues reached P$8,505 million in FY17 (+41.5% vs. FY16). This increase was mainly explained by monthly fee price increases that came into effect for both corporate and residential fixed line customers, and additionally due to the bundled offer of packs that include voice and internet services ('Arnet + Voz'), that aim to achieve higher levels of customer loyalty and churn reduction.\nAs a result, the average monthly revenue billed per user ('ARBU') reached P$152.3 in FY17, +55.5% vs. FY16.\nInternet\nAs of December 31, 2017, Telecom Argentina reached more than 1.7 million ADSL accesses. These connections represented 46.0% of Telecom's fixed lines in service. Additionally, ADSL ARPU reached P$359.6 per month in FY17, +32.7% when compared to FY16, while the average monthly churn rate for the period reached 1.4% in FY17 vs. 1.7% in FY16. Clients with service of 15Mb or higher currently represent 20% of the total customer base as of FY17\nData\nData revenues (services mainly offered to Corporate customers, SMEs, Government and to other operators) amounted to P$3,577 million (+P$658 million or +22.5% vs. FY16), generated in a context that evidence the strong position of Telecom as an integrated ICT provider. This increase was mainly driven by FX rate variations that affected those contracts that were adjusted by the $/U$S exchange rate and due to the increase in the number of clients.\nTelecom continues to evolve its portfolio of security services with the PenTest service, a tool that seeks to assess the security level of a company's computer systems, identifying vulnerabilities in its network infrastructure in the front of growing companies' concerns to safeguard critical information for their businesses.\nMoreover, as part of its connectivity strategy for corporate clients, it was developed 'Integra 4G', a solution that provides Internet access using the resources of the 4G/LTE Personal mobile network, that can be used in a transitory mode (access that allows a temporary connection to Internet to be used in cases of extended provision times) as well as back up (allows providing an Internet access to support the main service).\nConsolidated Operating Costs\nConsolidated Operating Costs totaled P$53,207 million in FY17, an increase of P$7,727 million, or +17.0% vs. FY16 (including 'Disposals and impairment of PP&E' that resulted in a loss of P$316 million in FY17 vs. a loss of P$383 million in FY16). Continuing with the trend observed during the lasts quarters, this overall increase is below inflation levels and moreover Revenue growth, which allowed a significant increase in the Company's EBITDA and to improve its margin. This was a result of a higher level of efficiency in the cost structure. Higher costs are mainly associated to the effect of higher revenues, a highly competitive environment in the mobile and Internet businesses, the impact of higher direct and indirect labor costs generated by the operations in Argentina, the increase in fees for services related to price adjustments in supplier contracts, increases in taxes and in provisions. These increases were partially offset by lower VAS (Value Added Services) costs, commissions, and bad debt expenses, among others.\nThe cost breakdown is as follows:\n- Employee benefit expenses and severance payments totaled P$12,718 million (+29.8% vs. FY16), mainly impacted by increases in salaries to unionized and non‐unionized employees together with the associated social security contributions. In addition, severance indemnities and termination benefits experienced a rise of +P$423 million or +81% vs. FY16. Finally, total employees at the end of FY17 amounted to 15,396.\n- Interconnection costs and other telecommunication charges (including TLRD, Roaming, Interconnection, international settlement charges and lease of circuits) amounted to P$3,148 million, +23.3% vs. FY16. This increase resulted mainly from higher costs related to TLRD due to price increases, partially offset by lower roaming costs.\n- Fees for services, maintenance, materials and supplies amounted to P$6,600 million (+31.8% vs. FY16), mainly due to greater expenses in fixed telephony and broadband connections and to higher costs in software maintenance in the fixed segment and systems' licenses in the mobile segment. There were also increases in costs associated with fees for services, mainly related to call centers and higher costs recognized to suppliers in both mobile and fixed segments.\n- Taxes and fees with regulatory authorities reached P$6,107 million (+19.2% vs. FY16), impacted mainly due to the increase in fixed and mobile services revenues, and therefore the increase in turnover tax, as well as higher bank debit and credit taxes related to collection flows and payments to suppliers, partially offset by lower fees with the regulatory authorities.\n- Commissions (Commissions paid to agents, prepaid card commissions and others) totaled P$3,631 million (-5.7% vs. FY16). The decrease in commissions (before SAC capitalization, P$4,617 million in FY17 vs. P$5,252 million in FY16) is mainly due to a reduction in commissions paid to commercial channels, thanks to a more efficient new agent compensation model, and a reduction in collection commissions, CPP and other fees. Agent commissions capitalized as SAC amounted to P$986 million (-29.7% vs. FY16), being this reduction related to a lower level of additions.\n- Cost of handsets sold totaled P$6,684 million (+8.0% vs. FY16), this increase was mainly due to greater equipment sales in the fixed segment as a consequence of the implementation of certain projects, and in the mobile segment due to higher costs per device partially offset by a reduction in the quantity of handsets sold, given the modification in strategy where the effort was centered more in the change of devices in order to achieve higher mobile plans upselling and less on capture operations. Deferred costs as SAC amounted to P$80 million (-38.5% vs. FY16). Lower deferred costs were related to the referred lower quantities of equipment sold during FY17.\n- Advertising amounted to P$1,218 million (+39.4% vs. FY16), due to new advertising campaigns launched by the Company during 2017, and in particular due to higher advertisement in media.\n- Depreciation and Amortization reached P$6,928 million (+11.8% vs. FY16). PP&E depreciation amounted to P$5,039 million (+15.6% vs. FY16) resulting from the incorporation of assets related to the investment plan that the Company has been executing; the amortization of SAC and service connection costs that totaled P$1,524 million (+3.4% vs. FY16); the amortization of 3G/4G licenses that amounted to P$325 million (-3.8% vs. FY16), due to the extension in the duration of the licenses, and the amortization of other intangible assets that reached P$40 million (+42.9% vs. FY16).\n- Other Costs totaled P$6,173 million (+4.9% vs. FY16), of which Provisions expenses reached P$590 million (+215.5% vs. FY16), increasing mostly due to higher labor claims followed by civil and commercial claims during FY17, as well as other operating costs that totaled P$3,280 million, growing by 26.6% vs. FY16 mainly due to the effect of price increases in transactions with suppliers in Argentina and the increase in prices of property and site leases, principally due to additions and contract renegotiations. These increases were partially offset by a decrease on VAS costs that totaled P$874 million (-41.7% vs. FY16), due to a redesign in the offer of these services.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nNet Financial Results totaled a loss of P$486 million, which represented an improvement of P$1,758 million vs. FY16. This was mainly explained by lower losses from net interests of P$529 million in FY17 (+P$954 million vs. FY16), due to lower cost from financial liabilities; and in addition, due to greater gains on mutual funds and other investments, which reached P$1.100 million (+P$752 million vs. FY16), driven by higher yields and invested amounts.\nConsolidated Net Financial Debt\nAs of December 31, 2017, Net Financial Debt Position (Cash, Cash Equivalents plus Financial Investments and Financial NDF minus Loans) totaled P$3,260 million, an improvement of P$2,632 million when compared to the Net Financial Debt as of December 31, 2016, this latter due to a better Company's cash flow generation related to the increase in EBITDA and a greater efficiency in working capital management.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring FY17, the Company invested P$11,143 million (-2.1% vs. FY16). Of this amount, P$5,407 million were allocated to Fixed Services and P$5,736 million to Mobile services, focusing on projects that maximize the network capacity and on the development of products and services that contribute to address the customers needs that today demand for connectivity and data availability. In relative terms, Capex reached 17.1% of consolidated revenues.\nIn terms of infrastructure, during 2017 the Company continued enhancing the evolution of services with the deployment of the Personal 4G/LTE network, together with the technological reconversion of 2G/3G networks, and the deployment of fiber optics to increase home broadband connection. The deployment of 4G reaches 1,173 locations with coverage of 85% of the population of Argentina (94% of the population of capital cities). Also, the deployment of 4G+ services continued to advance throughout the country, thanks to the solution of 4G Carrier Aggregation (use of two simultaneous frequency bands). This benefits our customers with a better service experience and speeds that reach 100 Mbps.\nIn this context, the first 4G site in 2.6Ghz spectrum band was inaugurated, giving coverage to the Hilton Hotel area of Puerto Madero. The deployment of this infrastructure allows the increase of simultaneous traffic capacity of the network, allowing to provide greater connection capacity, besides improving the quality of the mobile data service.\nRelevant Matters\nMerger by absorption of Sofora Telecomunicaciones S.A., Nortel Inversora S.A. and Telecom Personal S.A. into Telecom Argentina S.A.\nOn December 1, 2017 at 12:00am, Telecom Argentina absorbed the operations of Nortel Inversora S.A.

Cablevisión´s Adjusted EBITDA Margin (2) for FY17 was 37.0%, compared to 35.8% in FY16. Income for the period for FY17 totaled P$5,895 million, up 43.5% compared with FY16 (P$4,107 million).\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues minus cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization) and selling and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization). We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of our performance. It is commonly used to analyze and compare media companies on the basis of operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Nonetheless, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indication of our financial performance, an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may compute Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner; therefore, Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as we report it.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA over Revenues.\nOperating Results\nRevenues reached P$40,952 million in FY17, an increase of 34.0% compared with FY16. The increase is mostly attributable to the growth in broadband subscribers, speeds upgrades to our current customer base and the up selling of value added services with price adjustments.\nCost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) totaled P$15,489 million in FY17, up 30.9% from P$11,834 million in FY16, due to higher programming costs and higher payroll and social security charges and other personnel expenses, among others.\nSelling and Administration Expenses (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) reached P$10,308 million in FY17, increasing 32.0% vs. FY16 (P$7,806 million). The increase is mainly explained by higher costs due to inflation and higher fees for services, taxes, duties and contributions and salaries.\nAdjusted EBITDA reached P$15,155 million in FY17, growing 38.6% from P$10,931 million reported for FY16, driven by higher sales in Cable TV and Internet access segment.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses increased 54.0% to P$3.987 million in FY17, compared to P$2.588 in FY16.\nNet Financial Results totaled a loss of P$2,612 million in FY17, increasing from a loss of P$2,374 million in FY16. The increase is mainly explained by lower other financial results, net (which reached -P$370 million in FY17, from +P$222 million in FY16) due to lower income from interests and FX results on cash and cash equivalents.\nEquity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates were P$168 million in FY17, compared with P$131 million in FY16.\nOther Income (expenses) totaled a gain of P$29 million in FY17, compared to a loss of P$11 in FY16.\nIncome tax reached P$2,859 million in FY17, compared with P$2,095 million in FY16.\nIncome for the period totaled P$5,895 million in FY17, showing an increase of 43.5% vs. FY16 (P$4,107 million). The increase was mainly due to higher EBITDA in the Cable TV and Internet Access segments.\nDuring FY17, the Company invested P$11,681 million, which represented an increase of 28.7% from P$9,076 million reported in FY16. These Capital Expenditures are mainly comprised by subscriber growth, network upgrades and digitalization.\nClients\nAs of December 31, 2017, total consolidated Cable TV subscribers reached 3,503 thousand, from 3,528 thousand registered in the same period of 2016.

On the other hand, Net Debt decreased from P$6,936 in FY16 to P$6,451 million in FY17. This represents an increase of 13.5% in Total Debt and a decline of 7.0% in Net Debt. The decrease in Net Debt is mostly explained by an increase in cash and equivalents due to a higher operating cash flow generation.\nDebt Coverage Ratio (1) as of December 31th, 2017 was 0.43x in the case of Net Debt and of 0.72x in terms of Total Financial Debt.\n(1) Debt Coverage Ratio is defined as Total Financial Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA (calculated in Ps. for the last twelve months).
