They do propaganda.\"\n\"If you were to speak about an arms race, then an arms race began exactly at the time and moment the U.S. opted out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ,\" he said.\n'Easily surpasses ... a missile defense system' The United States withdrew from that arms-control pact in 2002 under President George W. Bush. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was originally signed in 1972.\nOther observers are skeptical about Russia's supposed new arsenal, because Moscow has not shown proof of successful tests.\nOn whether Russia had actually conducted a successful missile test, Putin refused to answer directly but said that \"every single weapons system that I have discussed today easily surpasses and avoids a missile defense system.\"\nBut some weapons systems \"have to be fine-tuned and worked on,\" he said. \"Others are already available to the troops and battle-ready.\"\nNBC News' Megyn Kelly will have more reporting from Russia in the coming days.\nFor more on Putin and Russia's new nuclear capabilities, see NBC News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T04:41:38.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
