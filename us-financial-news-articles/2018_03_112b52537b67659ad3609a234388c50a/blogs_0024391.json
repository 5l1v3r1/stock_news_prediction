As the Washington Post reports, several school districts have threatened severe disciplinary punishment for students who join the protest, which could impact something high schoolers care about deeply — going to college. \nIn response, many of the best colleges and universities in the country have come out in support of civically-engaged high schoolers. Among them — Harvard, MIT and Yale.

Here at @Yale , we are proud to support all students for participating in peaceful walkouts for gun control or other causes, and we will not rescind admissions decisions for students who do so regardless of any school’s disciplinary policy.

Living a life of active and engaged citizenship is something that Harvard encourages, she explains. \n\"The mission of Harvard College is to provide a deeply transformative liberal arts and sciences education that will prepare our students for a life of citizenship and leadership. Fundamental to our mission is our belief that students have the right to protest peacefully about issues of concern to them,\" writes Dane. \"Students who are disciplined for engaging responsibly in exercising their rights and freedoms would not have their chances of admission compromised or their admissions revoked.\" \nLike this story?
