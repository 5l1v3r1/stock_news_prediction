Trump tweet: Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! \nTillerson, in a press conference at the State Department , said he would relinquish his duties to a temporary successor by the end of the day. \nA statement from Tillerson's department said he \"did not speak to the President and is unaware of the reason\" for his removal.
