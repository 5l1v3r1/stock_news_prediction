REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Special police forces in full combat gear pushed back the protesters lining up at the main north-to-south road, angry after the police used force to disperse another group in the northern town of Tuzla in the early hours of Saturday.\nSince Wednesday, Bosniak and Croat war veterans have been blocking the main junctions connecting cities in Bosnia’s autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, including the capital Sarajevo, demanding benefits for unemployed former soldiers and a unified register of all veterans.\nThe protesters, who spent several nights outdoors in freezing temperatures blocking traffic, want government to cut funding for about 1,600 veterans’ associations.\nThey say they do not trust the associations to hand out benefits equitably and they want the government to make payments directly to individuals.\nGovernment officials say they cannot give in to their demands because of budget restraints. They have invited the veterans’ representatives to come and talk about their requests but the protesters refused.\nDuring the dawn police action in Tuzla, eight protesters were briefly detained and two slightly injured.\nBut new groups of protesters were popping up in different parts of the country on Saturday, including at several places in central Bosnia and in the south, at a border crossing with Croatia.\nThe regional government has been coping with the problem of veterans’ payments for years, after ruling parties had pushed through parliament a generous law on benefits as a pre-election sweetener which was later withdrawn.\nNobody knows how many former soldiers are eligible for benefits, after many people falsely declared themselves to be veterans. That is why protesters insist on a unified register.\nReporting by Dado Ruvic, writing by Daria Sito-Sucic; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-03T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T20:34:19.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
