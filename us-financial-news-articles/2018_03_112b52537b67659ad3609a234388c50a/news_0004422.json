This is unbelievable.”\nLasitskene also had to hear the IAAF anthem rather than the Russian one after a familiarly comfortable win, clearing 2.01 metres, eight centimeters higher than U.S. defending champion, Vashti Cunningham, and bronze winner, Italian Alessia Trost.\nSlideshow (4 Images) The 25-year-old victor made her win sound as easy as it looked.“It is very hard for me to jump without any strong opponents,” she said.“If there was a girl pushing me, I am sure it could have been even higher today.”\nDibaba won her third straight world indoor 3,000 metres crown - and her fourth indoor title in total — with an imperious performance in a high quality race.\nBursting away over the final third, the world record holder prevailed in 8 minutes 45.05 seconds, holding off Dutch silver medallist Sifan Hassan (8:45.68) and British hope, the Scottish veterinary student Laura Muir, who took bronze in 8:45.78.\nNow, Dibaba has her eyes set on also winning the 1500 metres this weekend after a disappointing 2017 campaign.“2018 is my time,” she said.\nReporting by Ian Chadband; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T01:04:31.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
