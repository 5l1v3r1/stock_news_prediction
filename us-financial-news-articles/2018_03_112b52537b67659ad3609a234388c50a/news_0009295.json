On Wednesday, it posted its lowest close since Feb. 14.\nTurnover was 1.3 billion rupees ($8.39 million) on Monday, more than this year’s daily average of 967.9 million rupees.\n“It was a very slow day,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings, referring to inactive local investors.\nLocal investors continued to be on the sidelines as they were still worried about political uncertainty, he added.\nForeign investors bought a net 45.9 million rupees worth of shares, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 5.97 billion rupees worth of equities so far this year.\nShares of Melstacorp Ltd fell 5.3 percent, Carson Cumberbatch Plc declined 6.1 percent and Bukit Darah Plc dropped 7.6 percent.\nSri Lankan shares hit a more than three-month high last month after two key parties in the ruling coalition decided to remain in the ruling coalition, allaying fears of a government collapse.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena reshuffled his cabinet last week, appointing his prime minister as the law and order minister, after the governing coalition suffered a series of defeats in local elections earlier this month.\nHowever, the changes failed to boost the market as the cabinet reshuffle was not enough to address the election defeats, analysts said.
