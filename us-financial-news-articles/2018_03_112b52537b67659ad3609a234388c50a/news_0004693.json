REUTERS/Rajesh Kumar Singh The tie-up announced Thursday will also allow Harley to work with Brisbane, California-based Alta Motors to develop new electric vehicles. The companies did not disclose any financial details of the investment.\nThe deal aligns with Harley’s strategy to woo the next generation of Harley riders as its devoted Baby Boomer audience grows too old to ride.\nAlta and Harley also hope to attract riders drawn to the ease of riding electric motorcycles that have no gears or clutch, the companies said.\nThe downtrend in Harley-Davidson’s recent sales has caused Wall Street to speculate whether the Milwaukee company would seek a buyout, but Chief Executive Matt Levatich has said his company was not exploring any such deal.\nHarley plans to invest $25 million to $50 million annually over the next several years to develop electric motorcycle technology. It is already planning to launch its own electric motorcycle next year.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:58:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
