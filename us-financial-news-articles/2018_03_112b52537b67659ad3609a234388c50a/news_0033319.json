Soccer Football - Serie A - Juventus vs Atalanta - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - March 14, 2018 Juventus’ Gianluigi Buffon REUTERS/Massimo Pinca The 40-year-old, who has made 175 appearances, had confirmed his international retirement immediately after the 0-0 draw with Sweden in November which condemned Italy to watching the World Cup from the sidelines. But he subsequently said he would accept a call-up from interim coach Luigi Di Biagio and was duly named in the squad for the matches away to England on March 23 and against Argentina in Manchester four days later. Veteran defender Giorgio Chiellini kept his place while AC Milan forward Patrick Cutrone and Fiorentina forward Federico Chiesa were included for the first time. However, maverick striker Mario Balotelli, who has not played for Italy since the 2014 World Cup, was again overlooked despite scoring 22 goals for Nice this season in all competitions.
