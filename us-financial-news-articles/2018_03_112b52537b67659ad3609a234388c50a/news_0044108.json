She has reassigned or let go some 400 scientists in its drug-development unit, and another 100 science jobs are still on the line, according to people familiar with the matter. She is also shutting down more than two dozen clinical drug trials, as she narrows the focus of Glaxo’s drug-discovery portfolio.\nOutsiders and recruiters say it is hard to recall another turnaround effort in the industry with the same scale and speed. It “has never been done in any major pharmaceutical company that I am aware of,’’ one industry veteran said.\nA Glaxo predecessor company introduced the first commercial treatment for HIV in the late 1980s, but more recently the company has lagged behind others in research productivity—the art of squeezing profit out of drug discoveries. Glaxo’s so-called annualized economic return to R&D spending—which measures profits generated as a return on earlier R&D investment, in excess of the cost of capital—was just 3% from 2007 to 2016, according to an analysis by SSR Health. That put it at No. 13 among the 22 largest U.S.-listed pharmaceutical companies ranked by R&D spending.\n“We need to get out of our own way,” Ms. Walmsley said in a recent interview. “Bring more agility, courage, accountability, passion and pace.”\nSome insiders see the restructuring as a breath of fresh air. Others say the depth of the executive and scientific cull has sparked chaos, and they blame Ms. Walmsley for being too focused on short-term shareholder returns.\n“Some people find it challenging; others embrace it,” said Phil Thomson, Glaxo’s president of global affairs.\nLagging Behind Glaxo has underperformed at profiting from drug discoveries.

After plowing billions of dollars into new businesses aimed at cushioning companies from the boom-and-bust nature of developing new drugs, companies like Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also are refocusing on high-margin prescription drugs.\nMs. Walmsley’s predecessor, Andrew Witty, spent most of his nine-year tenure developing slower-but-steadier consumer health-care products. Ms. Walmsley, who had come to Glaxo from French cosmetics giant L’Oréal SA, ran that business for more than five years.\nMs. Walmsley recently walked away from a chance for Glaxo to double down on that business. Late last week, Glaxo said it wouldn’t bid for the consumer health-care business that Pfizer has said it is considering selling. \nGlaxo stock has underperformed its peers, declining by 14% over the past five years, compared with a rise of 54% over the same period for the S&P Global 1200 Health Care Index. Ms. Walmsley hasn’t been able yet to reverse that. Since she took over in April, Glaxo shares have fallen 21% while the S&P Global 1200 Health Care Index gained 6%.\nLast April, days after taking the reins at Glaxo, Ms. Walmsley summoned the company’s top 200 research and development executives to two of its global R&D offices, in Ware, England, and Upper Providence, Pa., according to people who attended the meetings. Management cued up a video featuring half a dozen analysts and investors discussing Glaxo’s lackluster R&D.\n”It was a hard-hitting video,” Mr. Thomson said. “We wanted to show them how the outside world sees us.”\nIn July, Ms. Walmsley announced she would slash the company’s drug pipeline and direct 80% of its R&D budget—which came in at about $6.3 billion in 2017—to just a handful of specialties, including respiratory illnesses, HIV, oncology and conditions related to inflammation due to an abnormal immune-system response.\nShe said she would target annual cost savings of about $1.4 billion by 2020. Glaxo said it planned to close at least nine manufacturing sites.\nMs. Walmsley has made big changes at the top, too. In September, she replaced Abbas Hussain, an eight-year Glaxo veteran who was head of pharmaceuticals and had been a contender for the top job, with a hire from rival AstraZeneca PLC, Luke Miels. Mr. Hussain joined a private-equity firm in October.\nShe also poached Hal Barron from Alphabet Inc.’s Google. The tech giant had hired him to help run its drug-research business , plucking him from Swiss-based Roche Holding AG , where he had built a record of bringing blockbuster drugs to market. Dr. Barron succeeded Glaxo’s former president for R&D, Patrick Vallance, who is moving in April to a senior advisory post in the U.K. government.\nMs. Walmsley has promised to drive change by creating new incentives for executives and scientists. “They are going to be very numbers- and output-oriented, and for the first time we’ll be including sales, innovation sales, profit and cash flow,” she told reporters in a conference call earlier this year.\nInside Glaxo, many of the changes—particularly the decisions to close down so many clinical trials—have been traumatic.\nTake Retosiban, an experimental treatment that helps prevent premature births. A group of 30 scientists working on the program in the U.S. learned their trial would be halted in the spring during a monthly conference call with their boss in the U.K., according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe new drug had shown promise in late-stage clinical trials. Glaxo has said further trials required to get Retosiban to market would be too long and costly. The drug didn’t belong to one of the focus areas identified by the new management.\n“This was a difficult process,” said a senior R&D executive who helped decide which drug trials to drop. “It’s like having to choose between your children.”\n—Peter Loftus contributed to this article. \nWrite to Noemie Bisserbe at noemie.bisserbe@wsj.com and Joann S.
