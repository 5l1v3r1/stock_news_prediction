We're going to tell club members that it's time to buy in the $240s. I think it's a great bet on the volatility that we're all seeing. They are ready for it.\"\nAlibaba Group : \"Alibaba and Baidu and Baozun are the three Chinese stocks I think have the greatest future that trade here. Tencent doesn't. And I bless buying any of those [three].\"\nBerkshire Hathaway : \"Just buy Berkshire Hathaway. Just buy it. Now, the reason why GE was up was rumors that Berkshire is taking a stake in GE. We do not know if this is true, so I cannot comment and say buy GE or sell Berkshire on that news because there's no way of knowing if it's true or not, even though many people took action today.\"\nQualcomm : \"Qualcomm is a hold. They do need to close this NXPI deal , need to see approval by the Chinese. Surprised they don't have it yet. And then they'll be diversified and be more in the automobile.\"\nCisco Systems : \"To me, when you get the dividend and when you look at what [CEO] Chuck Robbins has done â€“ it's up 11 percent this year, it's up from $30 in August of 2017. From $30 to $42 doesn't seem all that bad to me. I like Cisco. I would be a buyer here. I wish my charitable trust had bought some today. I think it's a good stock.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Goldman Sachs' stock is a great play on this volatility 21 Hours Ago | 03:26 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Goldman Sachs.\n ", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://vine.co/u/984542302087651328", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer"], "published": "2018-03-28T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T06:49:50.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
