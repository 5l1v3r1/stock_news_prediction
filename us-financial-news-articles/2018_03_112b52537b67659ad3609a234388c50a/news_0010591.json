Sasaki brings over 20 years of experience in developing start-ups and high-growth companies across online industries.\nClarus Commerce Appoints Derek Sasaki as New CTO to Lead Technology Efforts\nWith Clarus Commerce’s rapid expansion and continued focus on building Premium Loyalty programs for retailers, Sasaki will be uniquely positioned to lead the company’s technology innovation, positioning it for accelerated growth.\nSasaki most recently served as EVP, Technology at Verde Energy, a leading retail energy supply company. He brought the organization from inception to over 250,000 customers in eight states before it was acquired by Spark Energy in 2017.\nIn addition to 7 years at Verde, Sasaki served as SVP, Technology at dLife, an online resource platform for diabetes patients, their caregivers, and healthcare providers, where he led the in-house and remote technology teams, for over 3 years.\n“I am very excited to be working with Derek again, as he brings the perfect mix of strategic vision and roll-your-sleeves-up mentality that has defined Clarus’ phenomenal growth to this point,” said Clarus Commerce CEO Tom Caporaso, who previously worked with Sasaki at dLife.\n“In many ways, we are extensions of our clients’ internal marketing and technology departments. At the end of the day, our clients' customers interact directly with the Premium Loyalty programs that we power and manage, so they view us as a partner and not a vendor. They will be entrusting Derek and his team with building and enhancing these programs, so it's a critical role. I know our clients will be thrilled to work with him.”\nAn engaged entrepreneur in the technology and e-commerce industries himself, Sasaki helped create the backyard chicken hobby industry with My Pet Chicken. His company sells livestock and supplies online, as well as free educational content for those wanting to get into the hobby.\n“I’m thrilled to return to my roots in the e-commerce space.”, Sasaki said. “As online retail continues to grow, companies are looking for new and better ways to help improve customer engagement and lifetime value. Clarus is at the forefront of this with an end-to-end Premium Loyalty platform. It enables retailers to increase customer retention and value without having to manage their own loyalty program. I’m looking forward to helping the team enhance the program, add new features, and expand the reach of loyalty programs that work. We’re leading a loyalty revolution and I’m excited to be onboard.”\nFor more information, please contact Clarus Commerce at 860-358-9198; email Clarus at busdev@claruscommerce.com ; or visit the Clarus Commerce website at www.claruscommerce.com .\nAbout Clarus Commerce\nAt Clarus Commerce, we partner with mid-to-large sized brands to smartly develop, quickly implement, and reliably manage Premium Loyalty programs that increase audience engagement, improve metrics and provide strategic data that is key to improving retention.
