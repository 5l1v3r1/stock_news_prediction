Mohammed Saleh Ahmad (C), 31, buys a soap in the old city of Mosul, Iraq, March 19, 2018. Mohammed Saleh Ahmad, his wife, parents and five children fled their home in March 2017 when US-led coalition forces began their advance on western Mosul, the final stretch to rout Islamic State militants who had overrun the city in 2014. The family lived in Hamam al-Alil refugee camp and returned home to Mosul in February 2018. REUTERS/Khalid Al-Mousily SEARCH \"MOSUL RETURN\" FOR THIS STORY.

The militants had overrun Mosul in 2014 and placed people like Mohammed under their draconian rule. \nCarrying whatever he could, he fled his home in the city, along with his wife and five children. His parents and siblings were not far behind. A child of Mohammed Saleh Ahmad and Iman Abdullah Saleh sits on the floor at home in Mosul, Iraq, March 21, 2018.

But when they got the opportunity, they jumped at the chance. \nA few days after deciding to leave, neighbours and relatives came to help them load their belongings onto the small truck that would start the next chapter of their lives. \nMohammed’s father and mother were going, too. Mirroring the heavy mood as they said goodbye, his father, Saleh, brought out an MP3 player and played old Iraqi folk songs, amid tearful goodbyes and promises to their come back and visit soon. \nIn Mosul, they were greeted by Mohammed’s older brother, Ahmed, who had persuaded them to move back by finding them a modest two-room house to rent.

His parents, who moved in with Mohammed’s family, celebrated their return over tea. \nThough rudimentary, their new house was a step up from life in the camps, with a separate kitchen and makeshift bathroom, and the Ahmed family quickly settled into a new routine. \nBefore finding a job working at his uncle’s construction company, Mohammed busied himself by going to the market, getting a haircut and taking his children to a recently reopened amusement park. And he took Iman to buy some new clothes. \n“New clothes for our new life,” he said, as the couple wondered through the market picking out dresses. \nIn the time that the Ahmed family was away from Mosul, the nine-month campaign to rout the militants culminated in a brutal battle in the heart of its Old City, the centuries-old historic district that is Mosul’s beating heart. \nThough Islamic State was defeated, the western half of the city, where Mohammed grew up, was largely flattened. Seeing it for the first time, Mohammed was shocked by the what it’s become. \n“I hardly recognise anything anymore,” Mohammed said as he walked around with his older brother Ahmed.
