He said JBS was running an internal investigation as part of collaboration efforts with Brazilian and U.S. authorities. \nJBS reported an unexpected fourth-quarter net loss late on Wednesday due to currency and hedging effects, as well as weakness at its Brazil beef unit, but overall operational performance remained strong, boosting optimism about the potential U.S. listing. \nAnalysts at JPMorgan highlighted strong cash flow and the increasingly profitable U.S. beef division in a note to clients suggesting shares could recover from recent underperformance. \nJBS shares rose as much as 5.2 percent in Sao Paulo trading to 9.36 reais. \nStrong cash flow helped the company lower its ratio of net debt to EBITDA to 3.38, the lowest in the industry, according to management. \n\"We did it faster and better than planned,\" said Chief Operating Officer Gilberto Tomazoni, regarding the deleveraging efforts. He said the company will continue reducing net debt through cash generation until reaching a target ratio of 2 times EBITDA by 2019. \nJBS said global demand for animal protein will grow steadily through 2030, and its beef and leather operations in South America are the only units that are not performing well. \n\"We outperformed our competitors in each of the segments in each of the markets where we operate,\" said Andre Nogueira, chief executive of the U.S. business. \"From the viewpoint of our JBS USA unit, 2018 will be even better than 2017,\" he added.
