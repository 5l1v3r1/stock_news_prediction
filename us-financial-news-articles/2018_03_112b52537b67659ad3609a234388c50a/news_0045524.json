For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $2.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, up from $1.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was attributable to an increase in realized investment gains of $5.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Premiums for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 10.6% to $40.3 million compared to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of premium growth in the Medicare supplement line of business in the life and health operation.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, as compared to $2.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total premiums earned during 2017 increased 6.4% to $163.3 million from $153.5 million in 2016. Premiums in the property and casualty operation decreased slightly in 2017 as compared to 2016; but were offset by a 10.0% premium increase in the life and health operations in the comparable years. Benefits and losses increased 13.9% in 2017 as compared with 2016; while commissions and underwriting expenses decreased 3.0% over the comparable prior year period. Realized investment gains were $9.2 million in 2017 as compared to $2.6 million in 2016.\nCommenting on the results, Hilton H. Howell, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated, “We are delighted to close out another profitable year and are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported a significant realized gain due to the conclusion of one of the Company’s real estate partnerships. While the life and health operation experienced some growing pains over the last year, we have completed a number of strategic pricing adjustments for our Medicare supplement product and expect loss experience trends to normalize. Our property and casualty operation continues to perform exceedingly well and reported an improvement in net income over the prior year. In recognition of our enthusiasm for 2018, our Board of Directors recently approved our 7th consecutive annual dividend of $0.02 per share to shareholders of record on April 13, 2018, payable on or about April 23, 2018.”\nAtlantic American is an insurance holding company involved through its subsidiary companies in specialty markets of the life, health, and property and casualty insurance industries.
