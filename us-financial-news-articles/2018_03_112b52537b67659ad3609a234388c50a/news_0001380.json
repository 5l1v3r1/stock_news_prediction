Consumer associations and politicians had called for these to be made possible during the Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) diesel emissions scandal.\n“That basically gives many diesel car owners the possibility to better advance their interests in future along with consumer protection groups,” Maas told the Funke group of newspapers a day after a court ruled that cities could implement diesel bans.\nThe conservatives and SPD want to form a coalition but the SPD’s members still have the chance to veto that. The results of the SPD postal ballot are due to be announced on Sunday.\nReporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Paul Carrel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:14:55.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
