Some make do with a visit, while others settle in for good. As restaurateur Nellie Tischler, who moved back to town after spells in San Francisco and southern India, put it: “You smell the piñon wood fires in the winter, your green chile is fresh, you drive on dirt roads and you see the stars at night.”\nIn recent years, Santa Fe’s percolating contemporary art scene has attracted a younger crowd, thanks largely to Meow Wolf, an art collective that birthed the House of Eternal Return. Attention HBO fans: This 20,000-square-foot otherworldly space is rigged up in a building owned by Santa Fe resident George R.R. Martin, whose novels inspired the “Game of Thrones” TV series. \nA newly diverse menu of restaurants also argues in Santa Fe’s favor. “Santa Fe didn’t use to be hip,” said Navajo artist Tony Abeyta. “There wasn’t a lot to do like there is now.” Before setting out to sample those diversions, keep in mind that Santa Fe is 7,200 feet above sea level, so take it easy on touchdown—more water than tequila is advised, at least for the first few days. \n— Margot Dougherty \nAn Insider’s Guide to Santa Fe, N.M.
