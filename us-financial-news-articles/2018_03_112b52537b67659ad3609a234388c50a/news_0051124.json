Seguin carried the puck into the crease before passing to Radulov, who beat Flyers goaltender Petr Mrazek.\nThe eight-game losing streak was the Stars’ longest since moving to Dallas in 1993. It also was the second-longest skid in franchise history.\nDallas is five points behind the Los Angeles Kings for the second wild card into the Western Conference playoffs with five games to play.\nRadek Faksa got Dallas on the scoreboard first at the 10:50 mark of the first period when he backhanded a carom off the end boards past the sliding Mrazek. Antoine Roussel and Dan Hamhuis assisted on the goal.\nPhiladelphia’s Travis Konecny answered with 3:09 to play in the first period with a goal on a wrist shot from the top of the circle that beat Dallas netminder Kari Lehtonen and tied the game at 1. Shayne Gostisbehere and Claude Giroux garnered assists on the play.\nThe Flyers then jumped in front 2:09 into the second period as Ivan Provorov whipped a shot over the blocker of Lehtonen after passes from Wayne Simmonds and Gostisbehere.\nBrett Ritchie knotted the score at 2 by deflecting a rebounded shot by Radulov past Mrazek for a power-play goal with 9:49 left in the second period. Seguin also got an assist on the tally.\nDespite an 14-6 edge in shots for Philadelphia in the third period, neither team scored and the game headed into overtime.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T15:32:12.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
