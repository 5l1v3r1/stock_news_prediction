According to The Indy Star , the delivery giant initially cited “projected operational needs” as the motive behind scrapping the distribution center. \nIn a later statement, FedEx said it’s “constantly evaluating the capacity needs of its network. Automation and technological enhancements we have made to our network over the last decade have enabled us to continue to increase the utilization of our existing capacity while serving the growing needs of our customers.” \nFedEx reportedly plans to continue to move ahead with a $1.5 billion expansion of its existing operations at the Indianapolis airport, an investment that was announced after the GOP tax bill passed in December .
