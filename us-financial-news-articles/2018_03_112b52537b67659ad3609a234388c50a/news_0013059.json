It has also encouraged discussions of broader bilateral investment in the energy sector.\n“The Saudi-Russian dialogue has probably accelerated the project, even though we started discussion some four years ago,” Sibur Chief Executive Dmitry Konov told reporters.\nThe two companies signed a cooperation memorandum last year when Saudi King Salman visited Russia but so far have not disclosed project details.\nKonov said Sibur possessed synthetic rubber technology it was looking to export amid low feedstock availability in Russia and low demand growth at home.\nGood feedstock availability in Saudi Arabia and growing Asian markets could make the project attractive, Konov said.\nHe said the venture would likely involve other companies as it would require technologies which Sibur or Aramco do not possess.
