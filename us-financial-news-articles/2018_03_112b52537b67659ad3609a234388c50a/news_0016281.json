That's when Levkovich began warning investors that the historic rally was in trouble due to wage growth trends.\nYet the markets didn't become spooked by the threat until Feb. 2 , when monthly wage growth figures were released.\nDue to the vulnerability, Levkovich came into 2018 with an S&P 500 Index year-end target of 2,800 — about a 5 to 6 percent gain. It's considered a conservative estimate based on forecasts from his Wall Street peers.\n\"Twenty-eight-hundred doesn't seem that exciting, particularly where we are right now,\" he added.\nLevkovich also said rising raw material prices will further feed inflation.\n\"That will ultimately work its way through the economy through price increases. Companies want to do it. And in some cases, not every company, but in many cases, companies will be successful in putting through those price increases,\" he said.\nDespite the growing inflation risks, Levkovich isn't avoiding stocks. He believes a strategy focusing on cyclicals and value stocks will give investors upside as market dynamics change.\n\"It tends to lead you to things like financials , energy , industrials and materials , and away from health care , technology , consumer staples , telecom and things like that,\" Levkovich said.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
