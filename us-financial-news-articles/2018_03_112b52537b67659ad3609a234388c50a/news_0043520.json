The company previously told Reuters that it had never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica nor ever entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica.\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie at a news conference in central London. REUTERS/Toby Melville Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ.\nThe Canadian federal agency charged with protecting privacy rights of individuals said on Tuesday that it has contacted its counterpart in British Columbia to discuss the provincial office’s review of AggregateIQ.\nSlideshow (3 Images) ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING With the scandal around Facebook widening, Britain’s cross-party media committee had invited Zuckerberg to parliament to explain how personal data had ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political consultancy which was working on the Trump campaign.\nThe company said he had asked one of his deputies to attend the hearing in London, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject.\n“These issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position,” wrote Rebecca Stimson, head of public policy, Facebook UK.\n“As such Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence in person to the committee.”\nRelated Coverage Facebook CEO plans to testify before U.S. Congress: source UK's May says she hopes Facebook boss understands data leak concerns Damian Collins, the head of Britain’s media committee, asked the company to rethink. “Given the extraordinary evidence that we’ve heard so far today... it is absolutely astonishing that Mark Zuckerberg is not prepared to submit himself to questioning,” he said.\nWylie was also quizzed on the use of data in the 2016 Brexit referendum, which has become a hot topic in Britain.\nWhistleblowers have has said the main campaign for leaving the EU broke the law on spending limits by spending money with another Brexit campaign group that it was closely affiliated with, a claim denied by senior Brexit campaigners.\nVote Leave denies any wrongdoing.\nAdditional reporting by Eric Auchard; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T12:15:11.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
