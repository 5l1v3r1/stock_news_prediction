The wind made things challenging but I hit the ball solidly all day,” said Conners, who will play in the last group out on the final day for the second time this month.\nHe led after three rounds at the Valspar Championship two weeks ago before fading with a closing 77 to plunge to equal 16th.\nConners hopes the experience will help.\n“I know it’s important to stay relaxed, slow things down a little bit, make good decisions and just trust my game,” he said.\n“I’ve got a lot of confidence right now and been playing well for quite a while.”\n(This version of the story corrects margin of lead to two strokes)\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T00:54:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
