Sampo has 21.3 percent and is likely to represent a far higher relative proportion of votes at the meeting since many smaller shareholders choose not to attend.\nReporting by Anna Ringstrom; editing by Niklas Pollard\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T20:01:48.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
