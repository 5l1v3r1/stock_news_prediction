(NASDAQ: APTI) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $125 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2023 (the \"notes\") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\"). Apptio also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $18.75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes.\nThe notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of Apptio, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Apptio's Class A common stock (\"common stock\"), or a combination thereof, at Apptio's election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. The notes will also be redeemable at the option of Apptio after a specified date if certain conditions are met.\nIn connection with the pricing of the notes, Apptio expects to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the \"hedge counterparties\"). The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Apptio intends to enter into additional capped call transactions with the hedge counterparties.\nApptio expects that in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the capped call transactions, the hedge counterparties will purchase shares of the Class A common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. These activities could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Apptio's Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Apptio expects that the hedge counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock and/or by purchasing or selling shares of the Class A common stock or other securities of Apptio in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period relating to a conversion of the notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.\nApptio expects to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described above and for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.\nThe notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Act. Neither the notes nor the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, nor will be, registered under the Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\nThis announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
