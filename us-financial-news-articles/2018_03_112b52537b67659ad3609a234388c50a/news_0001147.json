She said a probation period would be needed for the changes but did not indicate a timeframe.\nRATIONALE The Russian state and state-owned companies had about 5.9 trillion rubles ($105 billion) in Russian bank accounts at the start of this year, more than one-fifth of the total funds by the legal entities which the banks hold, Nabiullina has said.\n“It is obvious that the state should minimize the risk of losing its funds,” Nabiullina said this week. “Measuring by the size of the capital and by the state’s stake gives advantages to the large banks ... and does not always give a full protection.”\nIn a written reply to Reuters questions, Trofimova said that given the variety of the state tools, the access to them secured by a bank’s ratings could differ depending on the conditions.\nAlexei Moiseev, a deputy finance minister, said this week that the government has proposed a minimum A- rating for banks to access the full range of state funds.\nIt is not yet clear if ratings from the both agencies -- ACRA and Expert RA -- would be needed to access all or some of the state funds.\nAdditional reporting by Darya Korsunskaya and Tatiana Voronova; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:16:44.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
