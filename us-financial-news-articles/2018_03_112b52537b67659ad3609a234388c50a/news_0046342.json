Now you have to use +383 code. Please inform your associates and friends,” Kosovo Telecom said in an SMS message to its clients.\nThe landlocked Balkan country, which declared independence in 2008, has been using the codes of Serbia, Monaco (+377) and Slovenia (+386). Mobile operators will also change codes in the coming months.\nThe country of 1.8 million people is recognised by 116 nations but is not a United Nations member because of objections from Serbia, some European Union states and UN Security Council members Russia and China.\nWhile Serbia does not formally recognise the independence of its former province, it has agreed to hold talks to normalise relations and smooth Belgrade’s path towards EU membership.\nReporting by Fatos Bytyci; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-24T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T17:48:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
