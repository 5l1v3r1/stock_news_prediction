DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request seeking numbers of those who will be affected.\nTrump previously included three other African countries — Chad, Somalia and Libya — among several whose citizens were blocked from entering the United States.\nAfrican politicians and diplomats blasted Trump in January after he was reported to have used vulgar language to describe African countries and Haiti, with some calling him a racist. Trump later denied making the remark.\nIn early January, the administration announced that around 200,000 Salvadorans would lose their Temporary Protected Status in September, 2019. Some 59,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans who are in the program would also lose their status next year, while TPS for some 57,000 Hondurans expires July 5, 2018.\nReporting by Eric Walsh; Editing by Eric Beech and Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-28T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-28T00:12:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
