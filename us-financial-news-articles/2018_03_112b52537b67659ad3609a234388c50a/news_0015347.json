GE Transportation is expanding trials at Southern California’s ports on a new technology initiative aimed at getting goods to move faster and more predictably through ports, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes. The idea is to collect information on inbound cargo and share it more widely across freight networks so terminal operators and trucking, logistics and railroad companies can get equipment ready to push goods more quickly through distribution channels. GE has been testing the program at the Port of Los Angeles, and will soon start trial runs at neighboring Long Beach. The trials are coming in an area of growing interest in supply chains: Maersk Line recently said it expects to integrate more distribution services with its ocean transport, and several East Coast ports are trumpeting investments in nearby rail yards to improve the handling of export and import cargo.\nMore money is flowing to companies that help retailers stave off the behemoth of digital commerce. Private-equity firms GTCR LLC and Sycamore Partners will pay $1.1 billion to buy technology platform CommerceHub Inc., WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, taking private a business that connects some of the world’s biggest retailers to brand suppliers and then gets goods to online customers . The strategy helps retailers including Walmart Inc. and Best Buy Co. build up the products they offer to consumers online without bulking up inventory at their own distribution centers. The company uses a tactic called drop-shipping to speed goods along, and it produced $111 million in revenue last year. The business is part of a burgeoning field of technology and logistics providers helping retailers bolt on services to compete with Amazon.com Inc., the dominant operator that even CommerceHub says sets the standard for “customer experience and assortment.”\nTarget Corp.’s costs are rising but so is the retailer’s confidence as it tackles digital sales. Target’s same-store sales rose 3.6% in its most recent quarter, and its profit jumped 35% to $1.1 billion, the WSJ’s Khadeeja Safdar reports, but the bigger gain was a 29% improvement in online sales that Target says was boosted by ongoing gains in January . The company missed its profit target and gross margins narrowed, largely from what the retailer called “pressure from digital fulfillment costs.” The costs are a result of bigger investment in the future, including the $550 million acquisition of same-day delivery startup Shipt, as well as the remodeling of stores to better handle the pickup of online orders. Target’s sales growth may have been the result of a broader rebound in the retail market, but the expansion online suggests the company is in a growing lineup of retailers adjusting to the changing fundamentals in sales and distribution driven by web commerce.\nINFRASTRUCTURE The Port of Long Beach. Photo: Bloomberg News Highway and port backers probably never thought infrastructure started in the laundry room , but that may be where investors are heading. With big projects involving roads and trains stations in short supply, many investors are finding ways to put their money to work by stretching the definition of infrastructure to other deals they hope will offer steady returns. The WSJ’s Ryan Dezember and Miriam Gottfried report that increasingly means fund managers are looking at targets like airport luggage trolleys, coin-operated laundry machines and college-town apartment buildings that may lack industrial scale but won’t tie up money for years. Private infrastructure funds have grown to a record combined $150 billion, yet experts say the returns on investments have fallen sharply since the financial crisis. That’s left more money managers to follow the guidance Blackstone Group LP recently gave in describing its $40 billion infrastructure fund: “There is no generally accepted definition of infrastructure.”\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Trade wars aren’t so bad. ’\n—President Donald Trump, at a Tuesday press conference.\nNumber of the Day 4.1 Cents-per-gallon increase in average U.S.-wide diesel prices in the first week of March from a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration.\nIN OTHER NEWS A Maersk Line container vessel caught fire in the Arabian Sea and four crew members were missing .
