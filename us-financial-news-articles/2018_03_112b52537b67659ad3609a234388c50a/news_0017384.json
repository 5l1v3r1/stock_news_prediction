His attitude towards ProSieben’s media-for-equity model was that “it smacks of desperation”.\n“They are recognising value of equity significantly higher than what it is worth. If they were a private equity firm, what is their strategy, what are their synergies?” he told Reuters.\nMore broadly, broadcast media faces an onslaught from platform giants like Amazon and Netflix with their video-on-demand offering of original TV content and Hollywood hits attracting millions of viewers.\nNetflix, whose shares have risen 64 percent so far this year, has added more than the equivalent of ProSieben’s entire equity market value in the last two trading days alone.\nProSieben’s shares were down 5.2 percent at 28.47 euros as of 1330 GMT, valuing the company at about $8 billion.\n$1 = 0.8065 euros Reporting by Douglas Busvine Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T22:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:34:16.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
