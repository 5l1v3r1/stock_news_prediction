The bank said paying the fine would hit its core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, by 0.45 percentage points.\nTwo former Barclays executives, Paul Menefee and John Carroll, who worked on the RMBS deals paid a combined $2 million in exchange for claims against them being dismissed, the Justice Department said.\n\"Solely to put this matter behind him, Mr. Menefee has agreed to a settlement in which he has not admitted any wrongdoing, lawyers representing Menefee said.\nA lawyer representing Carroll said that his client denied any wrongdoing and had settled to put the case behind him.\nBarclays, unlike rival banks facing similar claims by the Justice Department, was sued in December 2016 after resisting a penalty proposed in initial settlement negotiations.\nThe Barclays settlement is one of the lower payouts made by banks facing such claims, with Credit Suisse agreeing in December 2016 to pay out a combined $5.3 billion in settlements and consumer relief, while Deutsche Bank settled for $7.2 billion in January last year.\nThe actions against the banks over mortgage securities stem from a 2012 initiative by U.S. President Barack Obama to pursue the misconduct that helped lead to the financial crisis.\nBarclays' settlement could encourage its rival Royal Bank of Scotland, which has been frustrated by a lack of progress in settling its own case that is blocking the bank from resuming dividend payments.
