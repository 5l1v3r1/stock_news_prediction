Italians decide when it comes to Italy ... markets have nothing to fear,” said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant League which emerged as the main party in a rightist alliance that got the biggest bloc of votes.\nUNCERTAINTY Boosted by Italy’s fastest growth in seven years and expectations of a tighter monetary policy, Italy’s banking index hit a near two-year high in February after state rescues last year removed the threat of a systemic crisis.\nThe outgoing centre-left government also passed measures to help lenders shed problem debts and encouraged mergers which are seen as necessary to beef up profits.\nItalian lenders hold 300 billion euros in soured debts after a deep recession, and their shares are seen as cheap as they trade below the value of their assets.\nAfter Monday’s drop, the banking index is still 6.5 percent higher year-to-date but it is seen as vulnerable to a worsened economic outlook.\n“The prospect of a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty risks weighing on the ongoing recovery,” said Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics.\nMid-sized Italian banks with domestically focused operations and high bad loan burdens were worst hit. BPER Banca lost 6.4 percent, Banco BPM 5.3 percent and UBI Banca 4 percent.\nHeavyweights Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit lost only around 2 percent.\nThe 5-Star Movement that won the most votes of any party has promised to compensate further small savers left out of pocket by a string of banking crises, and wants to split lenders’ commercial and investment banking businesses.\n“Although the season of bank bailouts is virtually over, Italy should not let its guard down,” Lazard’s Managing Director Massimo Pappone said. “Key issues are at stake: bank lending ... and the handling of so-called unlikely-to-pay loans (to borrowers in trouble but not yet insolvent), which can be a lever to support the economy.”\nAnother notable Italian loser, with shares dropping 6 percent, was broadcaster Mediaset, which is controlled by the Berlusconi family and is mired in a legal spat with French media group Vivendi over a derailed pay-TV deal.\nBerlusconi’s party’s poor results in the election are seen weakening Mediaset’s bargaining power.\n$1 = 0.8118 euros Additional reporting by Giulio Piovaccari and Andrea Mandala, editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T22:30:33.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
