Orlando was beaten 94-80 at Utah on Monday.\nThe Lakers led 106-97 with 2:18 to play before the Magic scored the game’s next 10 points, including Gordon’s go-ahead hoop with just five seconds left.\nLos Angeles missed five consecutive shots, including four 3-pointers, before going to Lopez for the final shot.\nKuzma (10 rebounds to complement his 20 points) and Julius Randle (12 points, team-high 11 rebounds) recorded double-doubles for the Lakers, who were drubbed 127-105 on their visit to Orlando in January.\nThe Lakers were outscored 54-12 on 3-pointers that night. In the rematch, the difference was just 36-33.\nLonzo Ball, who missed the first meeting, had four of the Lakers’ 11 3-pointers on a 16-point night.\nVucevic was the fourth player in the game to record a double-double with 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Magic, who lost for the fifth time in a row on the road.\nEvan Fournier totaled 11 points, while D.J. Augustin dished off a team-high eight assists to go with nine points.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:22:44.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
