REUTERS/Radovan Stoklasa The murder of Jan Kuciak has rattled Prime Minister Robert Fico’s three-party government and led to public anger about corruption in Slovakia, which is a member of the European Union.\nFico was quick to reject any shake-up, saying it would undermine the result of elections in 2016. President Andrej Kiska lacks formal powers to trigger the fall of the government but his comments could add to public pressure on it.\nOn Friday, thousands of people marched in the capital Bratislava and other cities for Kuciak, 27, who had been looking into suspected mafia links among Italian businessmen in eastern Slovakia before he was found shot dead with his fiancee Martina Kusnirova last weekend.\nOne of the men named in Kuciak’s last report had past links to people who subsequently worked for Fico’s office. The report was published posthumously and probed potential abuse of EU subsidies and other fraud..\nKiska said in a live televised address that Slovakia faced a“crisis of trust”.\n“I will start talks with political leaders on how they imagine the future ... and how to renew the trust of people in their own state,” he said.\nHe then advocated“an extensive and essential” remake of the government or a snap election.\nFico said any government changes must be agreed by coalition partners.\n“The constitution sees no role for president in this process,” he said.“Our goal is the investigation of this brutal act. We won’t dance on the graves of two young people, unlike opposition, media and, now, the president.”\nThe leader of junior government member Slovak National Party, Andrej Danko, said afterward he was ready for dialogue.\nJunior coalition Most-Hid (Bridge) party gave the interior minister until March 12 to resign or it may consider withdrawing its support for the government.\nIf Fico resigns, the government also falls. Kiska would then task the outgoing prime minister to rule until a new government is formed. Early elections can be triggered with the support of three fifths of lawmakers.\nThe government can also ask for a confidence vote in parliament, where a simple majority among present lawmakers would suffice.\nThirty lawmakers can also trigger a no-confidence motion, for which an absolute majority — at least 76 votes in the 150-seat parliament — are needed.\nSlovak police detained seven people on Thursday in its investigation, releasing partial names that matched subjects who Kuciak referred to in his final article. Those detained were released over the weekend.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Writing by Jason Hovet and Robert Muller; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-04T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-04T21:03:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
