Three other people on the bus were injured but the rest escaped unharmed, police said. \n“The driver said he saw fire breaking out from the middle of the bus, which then spread quickly,” Kritkanok Dan-udom, the chief of Maetor district police station, told Reuters. \nPictures in Thai media showed the burnt-out shell of the bus. \nThailand’s roads have been ranked as the deadliest in the world after Libya’s, according to the World Health Organization’s most recent study. \nThailand is estimated to have more than 3 million migrant workers, many of whom come from much poorer neighbour Myanmar. Work permit rules were tightened last year.
