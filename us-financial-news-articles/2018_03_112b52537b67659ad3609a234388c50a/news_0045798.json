He did refer to himself as a psychopath. He did not show any remorse, in fact questioning himself for why he didn’t feel any remorse for what he did,” U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul told a news conference in Austin when asked about Conditt’s motive.\n“It’s hard to imagine someone whose mind is so sick that they could commit bombings like this and feel absolutely no remorse,” he said.\nMcCaul said there did not appear to be anything in Conditt’s confession “that was sort of racially motivated, but I know that is still part of the ongoing investigation.”\nTexas blast suspect Mark Anthony Conditt is seen in this undated handout photo released by Austin Community College in Austin, Texas, U.S. March 21, 2018. Austin Community College/Handout via REUTERS The first several bombing victims, including the two who died, were either African-American or Hispanic.\nFederal investigators have been hunting clues about what drove Conditt, who was unemployed and lived with roommates in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville. They also want to know whether he had help building or planting the bombs.\nThree of the devices were left as parcels outside victims’ homes, while another was placed on a sidewalk and attached to a trip-wire mechanism. Two more were shipped as FedEx parcels, which helped investigators unmask the bomber’s identity.\nThe second and third bombs went off while the Texas state capital was hosting its annual South by Southwest music, movies and tech festival, which draws about half a million people.\nConditt died after detonating a explosive device early on Wednesday as police ran toward his vehicle in an Austin suburb.\nReporting by Daniel Wallis in New York\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T08:24:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
