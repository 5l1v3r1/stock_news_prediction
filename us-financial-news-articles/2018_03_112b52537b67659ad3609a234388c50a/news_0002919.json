Jane will make her debut on a limited-edition bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label this month in celebration of Women’s History Month.\n“Important conversations about gender continue to be at the forefront of culture and we strongly believe there is no better time than now to introduce our Jane Walker icon and contribute to pioneering organizations that share our mission,” Stephanie Jacoby, vice president of Johnnie Walker, said in a statement. “We are proud to toast the many achievements of women and everyone on the journey towards progress in gender equality.”\nOne dollar of every bottle of the Jane Walker iteration of the whisky will be given to “organizations championing women’s causes” with a total donation of $250,000. That number includes $150,000 that will be given to the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Statue Fund and its Monumental Women campaign.\nJane Walker Black Label is available starting today wherever the whisky is sold. A 750ml bottle of the blended whisky has a manufacturer’s suggested price of $34.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T00:17:47.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
