Seagal is the brand ambassador for Bitcoiin 2nd Generation , or Bitcoiin2Gen. Yes, that’s “Bitcoiin” with two “i”s, an apparent attempt to create investor confusion between the Seagal-fronted project and the pioneering cryptocurrency Bitcoin, with which the new entrant has no affiliation. Moreover, according to CoinDesk, “Bitcoiin” has some features of a pyramid scheme .\nFrom Team Seagal\nSteven has just become the worldwide ambassador for the Bitcoiin 2nd Generation crypto currency.

ICOs attracted huge interest in 2017 as the cryptocurrency market boomed, but a recent survey found that half of those projects have already collapsed . Many have turned out to be blatant frauds . Seagal is one of several celebrities to endorse cryptocurrencies in recent months, but such behavior could be subject to prosecution in some circumstances.\nCongratulations @bitcoiin2gen for reaching 3/4 of their soft cap midway through the #ICO . Less than 30 days til the close. Don't miss out. #Ad pic.twitter.com/3Uo9xYhAUB\n— Steven Seagal (@sseagalofficial) February 28, 2018\nSeagal’s interest in cryptocurrency has a tangential but fascinating geopolitical angle. Seagal is a well-known supporter of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin, and was granted Russian citizenship in 2014. A recent report from TIME found that Putin’s government had provided support for the development of the Venezuelan Petro, another cryptocurrency project that investors should probably steer clear of .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T19:40:54.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
