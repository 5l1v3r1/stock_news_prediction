Fox declined to comment.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has attacked AT&T Inc’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc deal, spoke to Murdoch in December and congratulated him on the deal, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\nShe said in December that Trump “thinks that, to use one of the president’s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs.”\nLast month, a federal judge denied AT&T&rsquo;s request to see White House communications that might shed light on whether Trump pressured the Department of Justice to try to block the wireless carrier’s purchase of Time Warner. Trump has frequently attacked Time Warner’s CNN news channel.\nProtect Democracy, which describes itself as a non-partisan group seeking to prevent American society from “descending into a more autocratic form of government,” in November filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department seeking similar communications in the AT&T-Time Warner deal. That lawsuit is pending.\nProtect Democracy said in a statement the lawsuit is \"part of our larger mission to counter the president’s attempt to undermine two key pillars of our democratic system – fair and independent law enforcement, and freedom of the press, most critically, freedom to dissent against the government.\" bit.ly/2I4vDUs\nLast week, Comcast Corp’s proposed buying Sky Plc for $31 billion, raising the specter of a potential bidding war between Fox and Disney. Disney had agreed to buy a number of Fox assets, including Fox’s stake in Sky, in December.
