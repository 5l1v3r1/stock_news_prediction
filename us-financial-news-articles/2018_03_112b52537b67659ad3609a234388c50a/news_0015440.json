For the three months ended December 31, 2017, Wheeler signed 11 new leases totaling approximately 41,906 square feet with a weighted-average rate of $8.89 per square foot. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company executed 112 lease renewals totaling 570,461 square feet at a weighted-average increase of $0.29 per square foot, representing an increase of 3.10% over prior rates. In December 2016, at the time of the Village of Martinsville acquisition, a decrease in rent was anticipated for the 23,523 square foot space occupied by Office Max. The renewal occurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 at a premium to the Company's underwritten rental rate at the time of acquisition. If adjusted to exclude the Office Max renewal the weighted-average increase on renewals for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 would total $0.36 per square foot, representing an increase of 3.91% over prior rates.

Wheeler’s portfolio contains well-located, potentially dominant retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets that generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. For additional information about the Company, please visit: www.whlr.us .\nA copy of Wheeler’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the Company’s consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion & analysis of financial condition and results of operations, will be available upon filing via the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website ( www.sec.gov ) or through Wheeler’s website at www.whlr.us .\nDEFINITIONS\nFFO, AFFO, Pro Forma AFFO, Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wheeler considers FFO, AFFO, Pro Forma AFFO, Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate and gains and losses from property dispositions, the Company believes that it provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income.\nManagement believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company’s real estate assets. These items include, but are not limited to, nonrecurring expenses, legal settlements, legal and professional fees, and acquisition costs. Management uses AFFO, which is a non- GAAP financial measure, to exclude such items. Management believes that reporting AFFO and Pro Forma AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. Management also believes that Property NOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA represent important supplemental measures for securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, as they are often used in calculating net asset value, leverage and other financial metrics used by these parties in the evaluation of REITs.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain “forward-looking” statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
