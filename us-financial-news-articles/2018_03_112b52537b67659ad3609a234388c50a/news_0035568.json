Benchmark 10-year note yields increased to 2.876 percent, after earlier rising to 2.888 percent, the highest since March 12.\nIf Powell adopts a more balanced or dovish tone than expected, however, bond prices may be setting up for a rally.\n\"It seems like the market is positioned for some hawkishness at this meeting, said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. \"If he strikes a more even tone or tries to maintain a more even keel, there is a chance that the market could actually react dovishly to this meeting.\"\nA flood of Treasury supply, meanwhile, which has been concentrated in short-dated bills, has also weighed on the market.\nBigger picture, I think people have been holding back from investing in the market, especially the front end, with very large supply coming through bills, Mulholland said.\nThe U.S. government needs to issue more debt to pay for a widening deficit, higher budget spending and to make up for reduced bond purchases by the Fed.
