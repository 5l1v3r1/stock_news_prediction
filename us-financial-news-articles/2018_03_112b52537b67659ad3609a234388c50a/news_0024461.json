U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell 68 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $61.36 per barrel.\nHedge funds and money managers pared their bullish wagers on U.S. crude oil, with long positions falling last week for the first time in three weeks. Gross short positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange 3067651MSHT climbed to their highest in nearly a month.\nThat has undercut some of the enthusiasm for oil, as investors weigh increased U.S. supply against the likelihood that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers will maintain supply cuts that have been in effect for more than a year.\n“The market continues to flip back and forth on the idea that increased global demand and a production cut is going to support prices ... but U.S. production, and North American production levels in general, is going to negate a lot of the impact of that,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy.\nEnergy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday that energy companies last week cut oil rigs for the first time in almost two months.

The dollar tends to have an inverse relationship with oil prices, as a weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.\nAdditional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Jason Neely and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T08:14:17.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
