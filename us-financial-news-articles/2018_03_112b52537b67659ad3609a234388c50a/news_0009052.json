Plotkin, M.D. has indicated his intention to step down from the Board of Directors (“Board”) effective from the 2018 Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 31, 2018.\n“I am delighted that HEPLISAV-B has been launched and recommended by the ACIP,” Dr. Plotkin said. “When I originally joined the Dynavax Board many years ago it was because I knew that new adjuvants were needed to enhance the efficacy of vaccines. Now that licensure has been achieved, and in view of my desire to reduce my travel and wider commitments, I have made the decision to resign from the Board. I remain excited by the scientific potential and direction of Dynavax and am delighted to retain a close relationship with the company’s Chief Scientific Officer Bob Coffman as a Scientific Advisor.”\nChairman of the Board, Arnold Oronsky said, “Stanley has been an important member of the Dynavax Board since 2005. His scientific expertise and vision have been crucial elements in our successful R&D programs and ultimately in the approval of our unique hepatitis B vaccine, HEPLISAV-B. I am very grateful to Stanley for his significant contribution to our company.”\nCEO, Eddie Gray said, “The Executive Team at Dynavax will miss Stanley’s clarity and incisive contribution to the Board, and we are delighted his scientific insight and knowledge will remain available to us.”\nAbout Dynavax\nDynavax is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging the power of the body's innate and adaptive immune responses through toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation.
