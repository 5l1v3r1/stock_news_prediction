Governments control a store of sensitive information, not limited to birth records, social security numbers, property transfers, and criminal activity. A leak would be the stuff of nightmares. Blockchain tech, meanwhile, is made to be an immutable, secure, and speedy way to transfer data.\nSome governments are already giving it a try. The government of Sierra Leone , for instance, ran a blockchain-based election earlier this month, presumably lowering the possibility of election rigging. The U.S. state of Illinois, meanwhile, is looking into ways of using blockchain. \n“Blockchain's market reception fits the pattern of a new, not fully understood technology,” authors of the Congressional report opined.\n“It is critical for future U.S. economic success to ensure a regulatory setting in which innovators, entrepreneurs, and businesses of any shape and size can experiment with new technology, are free to compete, and adopt the best methods of supply,” they wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T22:36:33.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
