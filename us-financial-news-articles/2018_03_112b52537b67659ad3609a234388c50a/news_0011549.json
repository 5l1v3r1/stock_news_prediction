With unemployment falling to the lowest level in 18 years, rising wages look set to push up inflation above 2 percent for the first time since 2013 next year, the CPB said.\nThat would put inflation in the Netherlands considerably above the average for the whole euro zone, as the European Central Bank (ECB) currently expects prices to rise by 1.5 percent in the currency block next year.\nThe low interest rates used by the ECB to get inflation towards its 2 percent target, continue to stimulate the Dutch economy as they fuel an ongoing boom on the housing market.\nGrowth is also helped by increases in government spending, while the export dependent country continues to profit from the economic recovery of its trading partners.\nReporting by Bart Meijer Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T15:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T10:50:26.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
