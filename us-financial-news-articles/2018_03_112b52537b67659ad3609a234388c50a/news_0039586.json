Chickpea prices have fallen 38 percent in the past six months to a three-year low in the world’s biggest producer and consumer of the pulse, also known as chana. On Thursday, chickpea futures provisionally closed at 3,673 rupees ($56.42) per 100 kg, compared with the government-fixed support price of 4,400 rupees.
