Bournemouth had got a deserved lead in the 35th minute when striker Josh King was fouled by Marc Albrighton and got up to slot home the penalty. Leicester threw everything at them towards the end of the match and finally equalised when Mahrez took a free kick almost 30 metres out. The point kept Leicester in eighth place with Bournemouth staying 11th.
