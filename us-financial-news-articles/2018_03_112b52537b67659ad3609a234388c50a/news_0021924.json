But ultimately, increased costs could make it unprofitable to build vehicles in the United States and production will shift elsewhere.\nJohn Bozzella, who heads Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ), Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) and others, said the group is pushing to convince policymakers that the U.S. tariffs do not make sense.\nAutomakers export 2 million vehicles annually from the United States, including 250,000 vehicles annually to the Europe, Bozzella said.\n“That’s like a whole plant’s worth of annual production that is at risk of becoming uncompetitive,” if Europe retaliates, he said Friday, adding that automakers could lose U.S. sales from higher prices as well as exports. “You have a lose-lose scenario for the auto industry.”\nAnn Wilson, senior vice president for government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, told Reuters she expects hundreds of auto suppliers to seek exemptions from the tariffs, but companies must first wait to see the rules for applying.\nThe group that represents 1,000 auto suppliers called the tariffs “dangerous” and has pressed the administration to exclude more products before the tariffs take effect.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CNBC Friday the Commerce Department would be “publishing regulations very quickly” on how the exemption review process will work.\nCongress plans to hold hearings on the issue and some Republicans plan to introduce legislation to nullify the tariffs. Some business groups are mulling court challenges, but experts say any challenge could be difficult because Trump is invoking a 1962 law that gives him sweeping authority to impose tariffs for national security reasons.\nOne issue to be addressed is whether the shipment of steel from Canada or Mexico that originated in another country will be expressly prohibited. Automakers say the tariffs will not apply to finished products that use foreign steel.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Joseph White and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-10T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T07:25:46.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
