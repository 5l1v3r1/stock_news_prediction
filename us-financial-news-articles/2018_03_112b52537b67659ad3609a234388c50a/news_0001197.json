However, Italy has a decades-long history of finding a way out of apparently intractable political stalemate and financial markets appear little concerned by the prospect of a confused result.\n5-Star party leader Luigi Di Maio speaks during the finally rally ahead of the March 4 elections in downtown Rome, Italy, March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, a PD heavyweight, warned on Friday that Italy’s recovery could be derailed by the outcome of the vote and cautioned against the rise of populists.\n“The most serious risk would be success for populist parties,” he told newspaper Corriere della Sera.“New elections would show a certain fragility and instability, but it would be worse to go down the path of populism.”\nDespite the polls’ predictions of a poor showing, Gentiloni’s party may benefit from economic figures released on Friday which confirmed that the euro zone’s third-biggest economy is on the upswing, and a successful Industry Ministry bid to save 500 factory jobs.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The center-right bloc has agreed that whichever of its parties wins the most seats will pick the prime minister. In another aside picked up by the microphone on Thursday, Meloni told Salvini that the League would beat Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!).\nBerlusconi 81, has served as Italy’s prime minister four times but is barred from holding public office until 2019 because of a 2013 tax fraud conviction.\nHe said on Thursday that European Parliament President Antonio Tajani would be his choice to head any future government, a moderate figure who would reassure EU capitals alarmed by anti-European rhetoric from Berlusconi’s allies.\n“I know it’s a shame to take Antonio Tajani away from Europe, but it’s in the best interest of Italy,” Berlusconi said.\nParty leaders are holding a frenetic round of television and radio interviews on Friday. The 5-Star’s rally in Rome is one of only a few major events organized for its election campaign, which has mainly been played out on social media.\nCampaigning is banned on Saturday. Voting runs from 7.00 a.m to 11.00 p.m. (0600-2200 GMT) on Sunday with exit polls released when balloting ends.\nHowever, the possibility of deadlock and the complex calculations required by a hybrid proportional/first-past-the-post electoral law mean it may be many hours before a precise count of parliamentary seats is available.\nAdditional reporting by Crispian Balmer; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-02T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T15:47:01.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
