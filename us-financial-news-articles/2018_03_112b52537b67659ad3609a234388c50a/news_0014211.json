He also extended his points streak to nine games. He has 13 goals and six assists during the streak.\nLaine also recorded his 14th multi-point game this season and eighth during this streak.\nHe also joined Ilya Kovalchuk as the second player in franchise history to get three straight multi-goal games. Kovalchuk did it in 2006 when the team was known as the Atlanta Thrashers.\nIt was the 12th career game with at least two goals for the 19-year-old and fifth this season. It also helped the Jets win for the seventh time in their last nine games and pushed them to 10-3-1 when Laine registers a multi-point game.\nSteve Mason made 31 saves in his first appearance since Jan. 9 after being sidelined with a concussion. It was his first shutout for Winnipeg, 34th career and first since March 15 when he blanked Pittsburgh while playing for Philadelphia.\nMason made nine saves in the first period, 10 in the second and 12 in the third.\nMason’s best stop occurred with about four minutes left in the second when he denied Mats Zuccarello on a tap-in attempt by getting the stick on the puck and pulling it back off the goal line with his blocker.\nHenrik Lundqvist made 31 saves in his first home appearance since turning 36 on Thursday as the Rangers saw their three-game winning streak end. New York also dropped its fourth straight home game and was shut out for the fourth time this season.\nLaine made it 1-0 with 56 seconds left in the opening period when Dustin Byfuglien forced a Rangers turnover deep in the offensive zone. Byfuglien fed it to Paul Stastny, who moved through the circle easily and dished to Laine, who had plenty of time to fire a slap shot from the right circle under Lundqvist’s legs.\nLaine made it 2-0 with 8:59 left in the second by capitalizing on ample space again. He gained possession near the neutral zone, breezed by Ryan Spooner, moved to the low slot, and lifted a wrist shot over Lundqvist’s glove.\nLaine then capped his big night by scoring into an empty net off a faceoff with 34 seconds left.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T11:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-07T19:28:31.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
