Mr. Brennan is the first independent director named to the board since Rockefeller Capital Management’s recent launch. The financial services firm offers wealth management, asset management, and strategic advisory to ultra- and high-net-worth individuals as well as institutional clients.\n“Jack Brennan is one of the industry’s most accomplished and respected leaders,” said Gregory J. Fleming, President and CEO. “He was an integral part of Vanguard’s overwhelming success during his twenty-seven years there, and Jack embodies the integrity and expertise of Rockefeller Capital Management. We are fortunate to have him on our board.”\nMr. Brennan was the chief executive officer of Vanguard from 1996 to 2008, and chairman of the board from 1998 to 2009. He was named Vanguard’s president in 1989 and joined the firm in 1982. Mr. Brennan has been a member of many other corporate, non-profit and regulatory boards, including General Electric, where he is currently the lead director; the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), where he served 15 years, including a period as its Chairman; and the University of Notre Dame, where he chairs the board of trustees.\nNow, Mr. Brennan adds to his board duties Rockefeller Capital Management, a firm that recently launched following the acquisition of Rockefeller & Co. The firm is owned by a trust representing the broader Rockefeller family, the firm’s management, and an investment fund of Viking Global Investors LP (“Viking”).\n“I believe that Greg’s vision and the first-class team he is assembling, paired with the extraordinary legacy of the Rockefellers, will make Rockefeller Capital Management a major force in wealth management, asset management and strategic advisory,” said Mr. Brennan. “I look forward to helping oversee the firm’s evolution as it adds capabilities, accelerates growth and carves out a unique position in the industry.”\nOn the board, Mr. Brennan joins David Rockefeller, Jr. and Peter M. O’Neill of the Rockefeller family, Reuben Jeffery III of the former Rockefeller & Co., Brian Kaufmann of Viking, and Mr. Fleming. Additional independent directors are expected to be added in the future.\nAbout Rockefeller Capital Management\nRockefeller Capital Management is a leading independent financial services firm offering wealth management, asset management and strategic advisory, serving ultra- and high-net-worth individuals as well as institutions that include foundations, endowments and corporations.
