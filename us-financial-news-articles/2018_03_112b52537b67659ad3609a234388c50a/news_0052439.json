(“ Namaste ” or the “ Company ”) (CSE:N) (FRANKFURT:M5BQ) (OTCMKTS:NXTTF) is pleased to announce that following the company’s Annual General Meeting of shareholders (“ AGM ”), which was held at the law offices of Gowling WLG (Canada) LLP on Tuesday, March 27, 2018, the Company has appointed Branden Spikes, Laurens Feenstra and Donald William Nickless (the “ Board Appointees ”) for positions on Namaste’s 2018 board of directors. The Board Appointees mark a pivotal milestone for Namaste in solidifying the board and supporting the Company’s future growth within the cannabis industry. The Nominees and proposed board members have served in critical roles at Google, SpaceX and Seagram’s International, and bring an intangible amount of value in helping advance the Company’s technology through innovation.\nNamaste has been very selective in the appointment in these directors, as it looks to expand on its already impressive list of products and services. Each appointee brings an incredible amount of expertise in their respective discipline, and Namaste believes their experience will help further differentiate Namaste within the cannabis market, as an innovator in the space. Having individuals of this pedigree join Namaste at this point in the business cycle provides immediate legitimacy to the company and will help expedite Namaste's plans to continue on the path of revolutionizing the cannabis industry.\nThe Nominees' bios and experience are outlined below:\nLaurens Feenstra – Laurens Feenstra is currently Product Manager at Waymo, formerly known as Google's self-driving car project. Prior to Waymo, he worked on some of Google’s most well-known products such as Search, Chromebooks, and Android. As a strategy consultant at McKinsey & Company, he has helped large media, banking and government clients become data analytics-driven companies. Mr. Feenstra holds degrees in Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence from University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and was a visiting researcher on \"Intelligent Tutoring Systems\" at Carnegie Mellon University. When not working on the latest technology, he organizes small electronic music festivals and runs a Burning Man camp.\nBranden Spikes – Branden Spikes, considered as “Elon Musk’s most trusted lieutenant” by Venture Beat, worked side by side with Musk for over 15 years and helped pioneer ground breaking technologies at SpaceX, Tesla, and PayPal. He was the CIO of SpaceX for ten years and was instrumental in setting up the information systems at Tesla Motors during its formative years after having served as Director of IT at PayPal. Spikes then founded Spikes Security in 2012, with a mission to solve the most pressing cybersecurity challenge, browser malware and served as its CEO until it merged with Aurionpro in 2017. Mr. Spikes is an investor, advisor and a technology evangelist.\nDonald William Nickless – Mr. Nickless graduated from Macdonald College of McGill University with a BSc in Agriculture. Mr. Nickless then worked for thirty plus years working for the Seagram Company Limited, beginning as a front-line supervisor in manufacturing, progressing through various Department Head positions to the manager of the Company’s largest Canadian plant. Subsequent, Mr. Nickless held various positions that culminated in the appointment to Executive Vice President of Manufacturing, Seagram Americas with responsibility for Manufacturing Operations in the US, Canada, and South America. Mr. Nickless is now retired and living in Vermont as a “Gentleman Farmer”.\nIn connection with these nominations, Peter Simeon and Philip van den Berg have stepped down from the Company’s board of directors.\nWe would also like to thank Peter Simeon and Philip van den Berg for serving on the Board. Peter will continue to serve as legal counsel and corporate secretary to the Company and Philip will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer.\nManagement Commentary\nSean Dollinger, President and CEO of Namaste comments, “I've always believed that successful companies are the direct by-product of building exceptional teams. The appointment of Branden Spikes, Laurens Feenstra and Donald William are a testament to that belief, and I am extremely excited to have them join our team. These Nominees further strengthen our corporate structure as we continue to build the foundation of our company, as we look to create a unique identity in the cannabis space through innovation. To date, Namaste has demonstrated its commitment to innovation through the adoption and implementation of many one-of-a-kind initiatives, and we fully intend on taking that philosophy to the next level with the addition of these highly experienced and well respected individuals. As the cannabis market continues to evolve at a rapid pace, we are of the opinion that Namaste must continue to come up with inventive ways to appeal to cannabis patients on a global scale. We believe collectively that these individuals will help facilitate future growth opportunities and help set Namaste apart from others looking to capitalize on this exciting industry.”\nAbout Namaste Technologies Inc.\nNamaste is the largest online retailer for medical cannabis delivery systems globally.
