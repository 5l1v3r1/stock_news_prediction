These are now seen as vulnerable in a trade war with China, the world’s second-largest economy.\nPrices for copper are down 9% this year and now stand at their lowest level since late 2017, and iron ore has fallen nearly 10% in March. The Australian dollar is down more than 5% against its U.S. counterpart from its highs of the year, while the Japanese yen, a popular destination during periods of economic uncertainty, extended a rally that has placed it among the world’s best-performing currencies this year.\nThe impacts have intensified in recent sessions as investors grappled with the ramifications of U.S. tariffs targeting China and other trading partners. Many are worried that trade restrictions could slow growth in China and hit demand for everything from commodities to technology.\nMeanwhile, concerns over retaliatory measures from Beijing have weighed on the stocks of U.S. manufacturers. Shares of General Motors fell Friday to their lowest level since last summer, while United States Steel lost 15% and heavy-machinery maker Caterpillar lost 7.8% on the week.\nThe latest U.S. measures came Thursday, when President Donald Trump said the U.S. plans to levy tariffs on as much as $60 billion of imports from China and impose restrictions on technology transfers and acquisitions by Beijing. China hit back on Friday; the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced that $3 billion in U.S. goods would be subject to higher tariffs and said it is preparing more actions.\nThose moves followed U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports announced earlier this month, as well as rising U.S. interest rates .\nWidening trade conflicts “have been a risk since Trump came to power, and now we see a bite behind the bark” of the president’s rhetoric, said Jorge Mariscal, emerging-markets chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management.\nRelated\nDollar Slumps Over Trade Concerns Trade Conflict Hits Farm Commodities China Fires Warning Shot at U.S. Over Tariffs Trade Moves Redraw Political Fault Lines EU, Six Nations Granted a Tariff Reprieve American Allies Urge Trade Peace Stocks Slide as Trump Kicks Off Trade War U.S. to Apply Tariffs on Chinese Imports How Century Aluminum Won a Lonely Fight for Tariffs Although he still believes global growth will continue at a healthy pace, Mr. Mariscal purchased U.S. Treasury bonds for his portfolio last month to counterbalance a possible drop in the prices of stocks and other assets. Prices for U.S. government bonds, viewed as a comparatively safe asset, tend to rise during periods of market turbulence.\nCopper prices on Friday broke below $3 a pound for the first time since December. The metal is widely used in construction and manufacturing, and is viewed by some investors as a barometer for global growth.\nThe dollar fell below ¥105 against the haven yen, its lowest level since late 2016 against the Japanese currency.\n“When you have any bouts of risk aversion globally, the yen is usually the No. 1 benefactor,” said Paresh Upadhyaya, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management.\nMr. Upadhyaya believes the yen will continue rising against the U.S. dollar. He is also betting that the Australian dollar will keep falling, as trade worries hurt Chinese demand for Australia’s iron-ore exports.\nThe yen is up nearly 7.6% against the dollar this year.\nAnalysts said there are signs the slump in commodities could deepen. In China, the most actively traded iron-ore contract closed down 6.4% on Friday, according to data from Thomson Reuters . The Baltic Dry Index, which tracks freight rates for ships carrying raw materials, is down 17.9% this year.\nThat decline suggests that escalating trade tensions could emerge as the driving force for commodities prices, making themselves felt through a slowdown in growth in China and elsewhere, said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, in a note to investors.\nSome cracks in China’s growth were already forming even before trade concerns heated up in recent weeks. The official manufacturing purchasing managers index, a gauge of China’s factory activity, dropped to its lowest level in 19 months in February. A slowdown in trade could hit those faultlines and eventually weigh on China’s growth, analysts said.\nA trade skirmish between the U.S. and China would also work its way through global supply chains, disrupting activity in economies that export high-tech components to China so they can be assembled into products like smartphones, analysts said.\n“There will be collateral damage for other Asian countries, not just China,” said Ben Sy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Hong Kong.\nHe said he is advising clients to trim their holdings of currencies of Asian countries that would be vulnerable to a trade shock, such as the new Taiwan dollar and Korean won, rather than make bets on the tightly controlled Chinese yuan. The dollar is up more than 1% against the Korean won since Monday.\nA trade war “is a lose-lose game for all,” he said.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-23T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-24T02:38:20.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
