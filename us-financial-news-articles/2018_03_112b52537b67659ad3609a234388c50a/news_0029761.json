Adam Wedwick, former Senior Manager of Competitive Intelligence at McAfee, has also joined Sedulo Group's Business Services Group as Senior Technical Research Manager.\nBringing over 25 years of combined cybertechnology experience, their expertise will expand and solidify Sedulo's position as an intelligence leader in this space.\n\"Alysse is not only an industry expert in competitive intelligence, but also a technical master with the keen ability to teardown competitor products,\" said Heath Gross, Founder and CEO of Sedulo Group. \"Her success in building and reinventing CI teams is second to none. With Adam's background in cyber and technology security, the two bring invaluable knowledge and will be incredible assets to our thriving Business Services division. We are extremely pleased to welcome them to the team.\"\nNockels holds a BS in Telecommunication Systems, and has earned a Master of Science in Information Technology. Bringing over a decade of experience in competitive intelligence and technical competitive analysis, she has been recognized as a thought leader in the CI community and keynotes at competitive intelligence conferences around the globe. Alysse has held a range of leadership positions in the technology industry, including Director of Competitive Intelligence at Intel, Price to Win Practitioner at Lockheed Martin, and Chair of the Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP) Board of Directors.\n\"While working on the client side throughout the past decade, I became increasingly fascinated with consultants who had the opportunity to work with a variety of companies and on highly complex projects,\" said Nockels. \"That's not to say that the research I was doing wasn't challenging, but it only focused on the needs of a single company. At Sedulo, I now have the opportunity to guide a multitude of companies through their own competitive pressures. Leveraging my years of experience in cybersecurity, high tech, and aerospace, I can provide them with a clearer understanding of their competitive landscape, generate strategic recommendations on where to take their companies, and even help them establish their own CI functions.\"\nWedwick spent more than 10 years building out the technical capabilities for the competitive intelligence teams at McAfee and Intel where he served as the Senior Manager of Competitive Intelligence.
