After successive defeats to Scotland and France the defending champions face the potential prospect of their worst championship finish for 35 years should they suffer a first home Six Nations loss since 2012 and Jones wielded the axe on Thursday in attempt to ensure that does not happen. Halfbacks George Ford and Danny Care are both dropped, along with prop Dan Cole, lock Joe Launchbury and hooker Jamie George. Dylan Hartley is back to captain the side after recovering from a calf strain as one of seven personnel changes to the starting line-up. Jones has brought in Richard Wigglesworth at scrumhalf and moved Owen Farrell to flyhalf, with Ben Te’o and recalled Jonathan Joseph in the centres. There is also a new-look back row, with James Haskell starting at openside flanker, Sam Simmonds at number eight and Chris Robshaw moved back to blindside. Simmonds and Robshaw replace injured duo Nathan Hughes and Courtney Lawes. Prop Kyle Sinckler is rewarded with a starting berth after an impressive cameo in his previous outing, while George Kruis starts in the second row. Exeter’s Dom Armand, the stand-out back rower in the Premiership this season but ignored by Jones since making his sole international appearance off the bench in Argentina last year, is among the replacements. Explaining the most radical surgery he has applied for a tournament encounter, Jones said: “We felt we needed to make some changes, we need to get on the front foot. I think Ireland are worthy champions of a fantastic competition but it’s a big game for us. “Te’o and JJ (Jonathan Joseph) have a big job to do. The Ireland backline has been functioning well with Sexton the ring master. Defensively they have got to be solid, provide some good line speed and then in attack either create quick ball or play off the back of quick ball. “At halfback Danny (Care) plays off the back of quick ball, where as we think Wigglesworth can create some for us.” England’s glaring problem in the last two games has been at the breakdown, where Jones hopes the abrasive Haskell and mobile Simmonds will arrive a touch more quickly than the men they are replacing. “We’ve done some good work on it (the breakdown),” he said. “It’ part of our game that we need to improve and we’re working hard on the detail.” UNSAVOURY COMMENTS Jones again apologised for the unsavoury comments he made about Ireland and Wales last year. The Australian, speaking at a sponsor’s event in July, talked about how disappointed he was by his team’s Six Nations loss to the “scummy Irish” and described Wales as a “shit little place”. He rejected on Thursday, however, the suggestion that Joe Schmidt’s team would pay the comments much attention. “I think going for a grand slam is motivation enough,” he said. If they do lose on Saturday, making it three successive Six Nations defeats for the first time since 2006, they could finish outright fifth in the standings, their worst performance since 1983. Conversely, victory over Ireland, depending on results elsewhere on “Super Saturday” could see England finish second. “We are still a good team, two losses doesn’t mean we are not,” said Hartley. “It’s all part of our journey , all growth for the team - every setback, every disappointment - and I think to end the tournament on a good result for us will be reward for a lot of work that has gone into this campaign.” Ireland, seeking their third grand slam following clean sweeps in 1948 and 2009, top the standings on 19 points. Wales, who host France on Saturday, are second on 11 with England and France on 10. Scotland, who finish off in Rome, have eight points with Italy yet to register even a bonus point.
