The local share price index futures rose 0.05 percent or 3 points to 5,992, a 4.1-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.6 percent on Monday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index was largely flat in early trade, after having touched record highs in the previous session.
