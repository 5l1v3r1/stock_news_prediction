Analysts, on average, expect 2.6 billion euros.\nThe company expects its margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to drop to 4 to 5 percent this year from 6.5 percent in 2017. This is also below the 5.5 percent average analyst poll.\nAsked about the relationship with major shareholder Acciona, which holds a stake of just below 30 percent in Nordex, Blanco said that the Spanish group was a very important customer and a constructive partner.\nSources have told Reuters previously that Acciona could at some point choose to buy the remaining stake in Nordex, which is currently worth 536 million euros, once a three-year lock-up period expires later this year.\nBlanco said that the group would study opportunities that could add value, including mergers and takeovers, but added he did not see any at the moment.
