(NASDAQ: IDSA), (the “Company” or “ISA”), a company that buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable commodities, and buys used autos in order to sell used auto parts, today announced the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nISA reported a 50.5% revenue increase and a $2.1 million improvement in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Further, the Company reported positive Adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which marks a substantial improvement compared to the Adjusted EBITDA loss of $402 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. This improvement in operating performance was due in part to the successful start-up of the Company’s shredder as well as improvements in pricing and volumes in the scrap metal commodity markets from 2016 to 2017. The start-up of the Company’s shredder led to favorable sales mix and improved margins, but was partially offset by costs incurred related to the shredder start-up. (See Non-GAAP Measures below.)\nThe Company reported a net loss of $306 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $240 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Further, the Company reported positive Adjusted EBITDA of $471 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the positive Adjusted EBITDA of $411 thousand during the three months ended December 31, 2016. This improvement in operating performance was primarily due to improvements in pricing and volumes in the scrap metal commodity markets from 2016 to 2017.

In accordance with SEC rules, the Company has provided, in the supplemental information below, a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. To provide additional information regarding the Company’s results, the Company has disclosed in this press release Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, non-cash share-based compensation expense, interest expense, including loan fee amortization, gain (loss) on sale of assets, other income (expense), net, and income tax provision. The Company has included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental financial measure in this press release as it is a key measure used by management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate the core operating performance of the Company, to prepare budgets and operating plans, and because management believes such measure provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results. Adjusted EBITDA is also used in certain covenants contained in the Company’s credit agreement. However, use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytic tool has its limitations and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial results as reported under GAAP, including net income (loss), gross profit, cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents the reconciliation between net loss and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (306 ) $ (240 ) $ (1,131 ) $ (3,230 ) Depreciation and amortization 522 582 2,191 2,297 Share-based compensation expense 26 24 116 357 Interest expense, including loan fee amortization 223 207 848 509 Gain (loss) on sale of assets 1 - (27 ) - Gain on insurance proceeds - (399 ) - (399 ) Other (income) expense, net 2 234 16 (16 ) Income tax provision 3 3 12 80 Total net adjustments 777 651 3,156 2,828 Adjusted EBITDA $ 471 $ 411 $ 2,025 $ (402 ) About ISA\nHeadquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Industrial Services of America, Inc., is a publicly traded company that buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable commodities, and buys used autos in order to sell used auto parts.
