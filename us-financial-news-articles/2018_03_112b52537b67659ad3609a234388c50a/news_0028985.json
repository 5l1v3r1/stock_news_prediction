Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include that the company may be delayed in its planned clinical trial initiations, the enrollment in and conduct of its clinical trials, obtaining data from clinical trials, planned regulatory submissions, and regulatory approvals in each case for a variety of reasons including the difficulty and uncertainty of pharmaceutical product development, unexpected adverse events or regulatory discussions or actions, including with respect to special protocol assessment agreements defining trial endpoints and the inherent uncertainty associated with the regulatory approval process. The company may also be unable to expand ADCETRIS’ labeled indications due to unexpected or delayed data from its ongoing phase 3 trials or regulatory action, including the risks that the company’s supplemental BLA submissions may not be accepted for filing by, or ultimately approved by, the FDA in a timely manner or at all or with the requested label, and may be unable to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, its product candidates. Seattle Genetics may also not be able to integrate the acquired Cascadian Therapeutics business successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected. More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Seattle Genetics disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005347/en/\nSeattle Genetics, Inc.\nInvestors:\nPeggy Pinkston, 425-527-4160\nppinkston@seagen.com\nor\nMedia:\nTricia Larson, 425-527-4180\ntlarson@seagen.com\nSource: Seattle Genetics, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seattlegenetics.com&esheet=51773662&newsitemid=20180315005347&lan=en-US&anchor=www.seattlegenetics.com&index=1&md5=eb35263313c0b329448eb2c550b331aa", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005347/en/"], "published": "2018-03-15T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T18:25:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
