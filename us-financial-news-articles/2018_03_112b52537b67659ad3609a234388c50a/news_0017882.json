REUTERS/David W Cerny Zeman, the last prominent politician from the country’s post-communist transition days in the 1990s, won re-election in January with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and courtship of eastern powers like China and Russia.\nThe 73-year-old trained economist and former center-left prime minister promised he would unite society when taking office five years ago.\nInstead he has proved a polarizing force, belittling his opponents and sniping at intellectual elites and the media.\nHe was one of the few European politicians to back Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nHe has also shifted further right on issues like immigration amid a refugee crisis in Europe. The Czechs have joined others in central Europe in refusing to take in refugees.\nIn January, Zeman defeated pro-European Union academic Jiri Drahos in a vote reflecting concerns over security despite a period of fast economic growth and rising wages.\nThe result also helped Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who had backed Zeman.\nBabis was the runaway winner in October parliamentary elections, but he is still searching for support for a government after his minority cabinet lost a confidence vote in January.\nZeman has promised Babis time for a second attempt and could exert some influence over his former party the Social Democrats, who have started talks with Babis’s ANO party.\nPolitical analyst Stanislav Balik said that with Zeman not able to run again for after his two terms, he may be even more forceful with his views. Balik said missing inauguration invitations for some officials who opposed him in the past was evidence.\n“The inauguration already shows that he does not seek any reconciliation, that he keeps alive his petty quarrels,” he said. “He just does what he thinks is right and also what his inner circle pushes him to do.”\nZeman has upset many with his courtship of eastern powers like China and Russia. He has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called to end EU sanctions imposed on Moscow over its annexation of Crimea.\nLike Trump, Zeman advocates moving his country’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, although that decision lies with the government.\nHis stance toward Brussels has also been lukewarm. He calls himself a federalist and supports membership in the EU but he also favours holding an in-or-out referendum on membership like the one that led to Britain’s impending exit from the bloc.\nReporting by Robert Muller; Editing by Hugh Lawson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-08T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:25:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
