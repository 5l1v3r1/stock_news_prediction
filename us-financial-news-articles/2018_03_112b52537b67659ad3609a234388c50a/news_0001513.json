(NYSE: BKS) today reported sales and earnings for its fiscal 2018 third quarter ended January 27, 2018. Additionally, the Company outlined elements of its strategic turnaround plan.\nTotal sales for the third quarter were $1.2 billion, declining 5.3% as compared to the prior year. Comparable store sales decreased 5.8% for the quarter, primarily due to lower traffic. Comparable store sales trends did improve in January, declining 3.5%.\n“While we were disappointed with our holiday sales, comparable store sales trends did improve in January,” said Demos Parneros, Chief Executive Officer of Barnes & Noble, Inc. “We have initiated a strategic turnaround plan that is centered on growing the business and enhancing shareholder value. In the short term we are focused on stabilizing sales, improving productivity and reducing expenses. Achievement of our longer-term goals requires a significant multi-year transformation. We expect our plan to provide consistent improvement beginning in fiscal 2019 and beyond.”\nBarnes & Noble announced that its long-term strategic plan is focused on the following four key elements: 1) strengthening the core business by enhancing the customer value proposition; 2) improving profitability through an aggressive expense management program, which will be used to fund growth initiatives; 3) accelerating execution through simplification; and 4) innovating for the future, which will position the company for long-term growth.\nBeginning in February, Barnes & Noble implemented a companywide expense reduction plan. This plan includes a new store labor model that provides greater flexibility and better customer service by eliminating tasks and allowing booksellers to focus more on customers. The Company estimates that these actions will result in annual cost savings of approximately $40 million.\nThe consolidated third quarter net loss was $63.5 million, or $0.87 per share, as compared to prior year net earnings of $70.3 million, or $0.96 per share.\nThird quarter results include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $133.6 million, and a severance charge of $10.7 million associated with the Company’s transition to a new labor model.\nExcluding non-recurring charges, third quarter EBITDA would have been $137.7 million.\nThird quarter taxes include a $35.0 million non-cash valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by a benefit of $26.4 million due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax legislation.\nThe Company ended the third quarter with $60 million of borrowings under its $750 million credit facility.\nOutlook\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company expects comparable store sales to decline in the mid-single digits and consolidated EBITDA to be in a range of $140 million to $160 million, excluding unusual or non-recurring items.\nConference Call\nA conference call with Barnes & Noble, Inc.’s senior management will be webcast beginning at 10:00 A.M. ET on Thursday, March 1, 2018, and is accessible at investors.barnesandnobleinc.com .\nBarnes & Noble, Inc. will report fiscal 2018 year end results on or about June 21, 2018.\nAbout Barnes & Noble, Inc.\nBarnes & Noble, Inc.
