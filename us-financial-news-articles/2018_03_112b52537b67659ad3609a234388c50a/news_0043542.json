He had previously called for changing the Second Amendment to permit gun control.\nStevens says the decision in that case, District of Columbia v. Heller, \"has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power.\" Stevens retired from the court in 2010, after more than 35 years.\nWATCH: Who makes the AR-15 rifle? show chapters Who makes the AR-15 rifle? 7:01 PM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 02:19", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-27T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-27T16:53:02.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
