The size of the fraud has now gone (up)...and the same is likely to go even higher,” the CBI said in the court filing.\nPNB did not respond to requests on Tuesday seeking comment on the risk of its exposure rising further.\nThe bank initially reported to authorities on Jan. 29 that the jewellery groups had defrauded it of 2.8 billion rupees, or about $44 million. On Feb. 14 it said the fraud sum had reached $1.77 billion after a detailed investigation.\nIt raised the amount further to nearly $2 billion last week, saying it had discovered some $200 million more in fraudulent letters of credit, another form of credit guarantee, issued to Choksi’s Gitanjali group.
