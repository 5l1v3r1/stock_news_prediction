However, with the ability to process increased levels of stockpiled flotation tails in 2018, management expects that gold production for 2018 will exceed that of 2017 and be up to 40,000 ounces\nPost year End Highlights\nAdditional US$3 million loan with Sprott to take total loan to US$8 million Announcement of equity financing raising US$15 million through an investment by Greenstone Resources, a new long-term supportive shareholder.\nOperational Highlights\nThe acquisition of Chapleau Resources Ltd and its wholly owned 376,000 ounce Coringa gold deposit. Total gold production for 2017 of 37,004 ounces. Commencement of an initial 8,000 metre surface drill programme at Palito in December 2017. Completion of new estimation of Mineral Reserves and Resources for the Palito Mining Complex. Total Mineral Reserves estimated at 181,000 with total Mineral Resources of 538,000 ounces. Mine production totalling 168,876 tonnes at 8.92 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") of gold. 172,565 tonnes processed through the plant for the combined mining operations, with an average grade of 7.11 g/t of gold. 9,864 metres of horizontal mine development completed in the year. Successful test work to evaluate the benefits or ore-sorting to improve process plant efficiency. Palito development and production continues to focus on the four main sectors of Senna, Pipocas, G3 and Mogno, whilst in the Sao Chico orebody, the main ramp has now reached level 10mRL, approximately 245 vertical metres below surface.\nMike Hodgson, CEO of Serabi commented,\nI am very pleased to report another solid year for Serabi and with the future growth that the Company now anticipates over the coming years from the development of the Coringa gold project and resource growth and resultant production from the Palito Mining Complex the outlook is very exciting.\nSmall producers like Serabi, need to exercise strong control over their cost base and maximise the efficiencies of their assets to protect themselves from the economic factors that are beyond their control. To this end it is pleasing to see that production costs have slightly reduced year-on-year by 2.7% more than offsetting the effects of inflation and exchange rate movements. We continue to look at ways to improve efficiency and make our assets work harder and better, looking to improve gold production whilst keeping costs at least static.\nGold production in 2017 was down compared with the preceding year with a consequential impact on revenue and gross profit. However, the equipment commissioning issue that gave rise to a slight fall in production in the second quarter of 2017 is now well behind us, we have delivered two subsequent quarters of solid gold production and we expect gold production for 2018 to return to around or even slightly above that of 2016. I hope that the favourable gold price and exchange rate that we have enjoyed during the first quarter of 2018, can continue and we will be able to enjoy a successful year.\nThe benefit of the reduced levels of debt that the Company held during 2017 are reflected in a significantly lower level of finance costs and whilst administration expenses rose year on year, these do reflect one off costs associated with the work undertaken on the acquisition of Chapleau Resources at the end of the year as well as the NI 43-101 technical report including the new resource and reserve estimation that was released in December 2017.\nFollowing the end of the year we have taken steps to improve the financial strength of the Company. The US$15 million share subscription by Greenstone Resources, a private equity fund dedicated to supporting mining operations, announced in March 2018, provides the Company with the necessary capital to advance its ambition to become a 100,000 ounce producer in the relatively near term. This growth through a combination of a successful development of the Coringa project and internal growth at Palito and Sao Chico which can generate further new production can be significantly advanced with this new injection of capital, supplemented by the cash flow that we can generate from our existing operations.\nChairman's Statement\nSerabi's core business is high grade gold production, and I am pleased to say that 2017 was another solid year from an operational perspective. Whilst production was marginally lower than 2016, a total of over 37,000 ounces in 2017 was more than satisfying. With both the Palito and Sao Chico orebodies in production at planned levels, and some gold production upside as we step up the treatment of gold bearing flotation tails generated during the first year of production in 2014, we expect 2018 to be slightly better and return approximately 40,000 ounces of gold production. Another highlight of the year was, of course, our acquisition of the neighbouring Coringa gold project. Coringa has always been an obvious acquisition for us. It is very much a Palito look-a-like requiring the same approach, project development, mining and processing we employ at Palito, so Serabi's management and team is well placed to bring this project into production in the next 24 months. We have also commenced a surface drill programme that is focussing on evaluation of the existing discoveries in and around both the Palito and Sao Chico orebodies. Therefore, through the combination of organic growth and the development of Coringa, we very much hope we will be increasing our current gold production levels of 40,000 ounces per annum and see a significant step change in the Group's evolution.\nWith the announcement at the end of March of a subscription for new shares by Greenstone Resources II LP, raising US$15 million, Serabi is also now well-funded and able to progress its plans. Greenstone is a well respected, specialist private equity mining fund and I am delighted to welcome them as a long-term strategic investor in the Company and look forward to working closely with them to unlock the full potential of Serabi's gold projects and pursue other growth opportunities.\nOver the past three years there has been very stable production from the Palito complex, and whilst we feel the potential from both orebodies far exceeds current production levels, the Group has remained focused on maximising cash generation and building up the working capital of the business. This allowed us to act quickly, when the opportunity unexpectedly arose, to acquire the Coringa deposit in December 2017 and the Group was able to meet the first instalment payment without needing to secure additional funding at that time. Nevertheless, it is not lost on the Board that fortunes of small producers like Serabi are very closely linked to the gold price and also, in our case, the Brazilian Real/ US Dollar exchange rate. Ultimately, more production with stronger margins bring the improved economies associated with scale, and this is the logic behind the acquisition of Coringa. It reinforces the Group as very much a Brazilian focused producer and developer, and the synergies are clear, with an established experienced management and operational team in Brazil, we believe the Group is well placed to repeat the successful 2013/14 development and commissioning of Palito, at Coringa.\n2017 saw some improvements in metal prices and general confidence in the sector, and in Brazil, we enjoyed exchange rates working in our favour a little more, particularly towards the end of the year. Brazil remains something of an enigma for investors, with juniors struggling to deliver, and for a country with such resource wealth, the country has been strangely light on attracting exploration investment from both junior and major mining companies. This, we feel, gives us great competitive advantage. With many years of operational experience, we are well placed to take advantage of others that find the going more challenging. We have built sound relationships with the various governing agencies and stakeholders, giving us further advantage. However, things seem to be changing for the better, as we have seen a number of companies increasing their involvement in the country over the past 12 months, some with considerable rumoured success. This renewed appetite is resulting in larger mining groups, looking to the junior sector for joint venture opportunities on projects to support their own growth. This cycle has always been the engine that drives the mining sector. It brings renewed investor interest and support for the sector to boost growth and new developments. We are seeing renewed interest from larger mining groups in the land holdings of the smaller companies in the country and keen to look at ways to work together that could accelerate evaluation of some of our tenements This can only bode well for the region and country as a whole.\nNevertheless the Serabi Board will continues to be prudent in its own strategy for growth as we seek to maximise the value that we can achieve from each dollar invested. We remain a small producer for now and will insist that management continues to follow its proven formula and systematic approach to exploration activity. We feel we have excellent potential in our tenements, at Palito, Sao Chico and Coringa, so anything outside these areas has to be substantially better to be included in our growth strategy. Growth will always need to be balanced with the concurrent need to continue to improve the Group's working capital position and improve its resilience to short term market movements that can negatively impact on cash flow and margin.\nAs well as the acquisition of the Coringa gold project, we commenced a surface drill programme at Palito in late 2017. Our exploration programme and organic growth, has effectively been on-hold since 2011 as we focussed on the start-ups at both Palito and Sao Chico, and this has consumed our free cash flow as well as human resources. We are delighted these mine site discoveries, made in 2011/2012, are finally being tested. Just as with the initial acquisition payment for Coringa, the Group has been able to finance the initial drill from internal cash flow. The Palito resource comprises over 26 veins clustered together covering a strike length of up to one kilometre. However, we have now traced some of the veins over four kilometres so the potential to grow the resource is compelling.\nIt is a similar story at Sao Chico, a far more immature deposit than Palito in terms of geological understanding, but the orebody being mine lies within a strong regional shear zone that hosts numerous historical artisanal mines over a five kilometre strike length. In addition, recent geophysics work, undertaken in 2016, suggests the presence of additional sub-parallel structures.\nManagement continue to actively assess other opportunities in Brazil and the Group's track record of moving exploration projects into production makes Serabi an attractive partner for companies with less operational experience. We acquired Coringa during the year, as an asset level deal that we feel represents great value. The Group has tried to acquire this asset on other occasions in the past recognising both the potential of the project and its synergies. The previous operators put a huge amount of effort and investment into the project and we feel our patience has been rewarded by acquiring it at a very attractive price. Furthermore, we believe we have acquired an asset which has high potential and which can be a more significant gold producer than currently forecast. The acquisition of Coringa along with our existing growth opportunities starts us on the path of expansion and we will continue to pursue opportunities that will bring strong, long term returns to our existing shareholders.\nThe next 12 months will bring different, new challenges to the Company. Whilst we need to maintain production levels, we need to expand the team to absorb and advance Coringa through permitting and into construction. The exploration team also need to meet the expectations we have for our internal growth. Overall, I feel the Company has enjoyed a very successful 2017, which will form a strong platform for further success in 2018.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors I would like to extend my appreciation to the employees and management of Serabi for a job well done during the past year. Their hard work and determination to succeed means your Company is well positioned to reap the benefits of the higher gold price environment we expect during 2018 and beyond. Finally, thank you to our shareholders, large and small, for your patience during the last few years. I continue to believe the future is extremely bright for Serabi\nMel Williams - Chairman\nSerabi's Directors Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 together the Chairman's Statement and the Management Discussion and Analysis, are available from the Company's website - www.serabigold.com and will be posted on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nThis announcement is inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation 596/2014.\nEnquiries:\nSerabi Gold plc Michael Hodgson Tel: +44 (0)20 7246 6830 Chief Executive Mobile: +44 (0)7799 473621 Clive Line Tel: +44 (0)20 7246 6830 Finance Director Mobile: +44 (0)7710 151692 Email: contact@serabigold.com Website: www.serabigold.com Beaumont Cornish Limited\nNominated Adviser and Financial Adviser Roland Cornish Tel: +44 (0)20 7628 3396 Michael Cornish Tel: +44 (0)20 7628 3396 Peel Hunt LLP\nUK Broker Ross Allister Tel: +44 (0)20 7418 8900 James Bavister Tel: +44 (0)20 7418 8900 Blytheweigh\nPublic Relations Tim Blythe Tel: +44 (0)20 7138 3204 Camilla Horsfall Tel: +44 (0)20 7138 3224 Copies of this announcement are available from the Company's website at www.serabigold.com .\nNeither the Toronto Stock Exchange, nor any other securities regulatory authority, has approved or disapproved of the contents of this announcement.\nThe following information, comprising, the Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, Group Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity, and Group Cash Flow, is extracted from these financial statements.\nThe Company will, in compliance with Canadian regulatory requirements, post its Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended 31 December 2017 and its Annual Information Form on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .

A copy of the statutory accounts for 2016 has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2017 will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The full audited financial statements for the years end 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 comply with IFRS.\n2. Auditor's Opinion\nThe auditor has issued an unqualified opinion in respect of the financial statements for both 2016 and 2017 which do not contain any statements under the Companies Act 2006, Section 498(2) or Section 498(3).\n3. Basis of Preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") in force at the reporting date and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") as adopted for use within the European Union and with IFRS and their interpretations issued by the IASB. The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nAt the date of authorisation of the financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU):\nlFRS 9 Financial Instruments\nlFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts\nIFRS 16 Leases\nThe only standard that is anticipated to be significant or relevant to the Group is IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\". The new standard will replace existing accounting standards. It is applicable to financial assets and liabilities and will introduce changes to existing accounting concerning classification, measurement and impairment (introducing an expected loss method).\nIFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' is not expected to have a material impact on the Group at this stage of the Group's operations. IFRS 16 will require the recognition of an asset and liability with respect to the material operating lease commitments that the group have. Management are currently considering the impact that this will have on the financial statements.\nThe revenue contracts held by the Group usually contain a single performance criteria that is satisfied at a point in time. The Group will adopt the above standards at the time stipulated by that standard. The Group does not at this time anticipate voluntary early adoption of any of the standards.\nGoing concern and availability of finance\nOn 23 March 2018 the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with Greenstone resources II LP (\"Greenstone\"), Greenstone has conditionally agreed to subscribe (\"the Subscription\") for 297,759,419 New Ordinary Shares (\"the Subscription Shares\") at a price of 3.6 pence per share (the \"Subscription Price\"). The New Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Subscription will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares. Application will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the Subscription Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\") and listed for trading on the TSX. Completion of the Subscription and Admission is expected to take place at 8:00 a.m. on or around 12 April 2018.\nThe Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected needs. The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its on-going operational requirements, to repay its secured loan facilities and to fund planned exploration and development activity on its other gold properties. However additional funding will be required to bring the newly acquired Coringa gold project into production including the final acquisition payment. The secured loan facility is repayable by 30 June 2020 and at 31 December 2017, the amount outstanding under this facility was US$4.48 million (2016: US$1.37 million).\nThe Directors consider that the Group's operations are performing at the levels that they anticipate but the Group remains a small-scale gold producer. Any unplanned interruption or reduction in gold production, unforeseen reductions in the gold price or appreciation of the Brazilian currency, could adversely affect the level of free cash flow that the Group can generate on a monthly basis. Nonetheless with the proceeds to be received from the Subscription, the Directors consider that they will nonetheless be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nOn this basis, the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.\n4.

The New Loan may be repaid, at the Company's request and with the agreement of Sprott (the \"Extension Option\") in equal monthly instalments commencing 30 September 2018 with a final payment due 22 months later on 30 June 2020.
