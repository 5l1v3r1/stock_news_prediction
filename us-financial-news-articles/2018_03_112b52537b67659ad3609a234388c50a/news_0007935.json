PNOC wants to spearhead the LNG facility and has also been in talks with potential partners.\nConstruction, which includes a 5 million tonne-per-annum LNG storage facility, will take about 30 months to complete, said Cusi, who said then he wanted to issue the project permit within the year.\nA similar project by Australia-listed Energy World Corp, built on Pagbilao island in Quezon province and capable of receiving 3 million tonnes of LNG a year, is now almost complete. It expects to phase in a 650-megawatt (MW) gas-fired power plant near the LNG terminal by the end of 2018 using imported LNG.\nPulido believes both the Batangas and Pagbilao LNG facilities can be viable.\n“We feel the Energy World hub will not adequately supply the industry that we’re targeting,” he said, adding the government is envisioning the use of LNG for both power and industrial sectors.\nImported LNG received via the Batangas facility is expected to fuel five nearby power plants that can produced up to 3,211 MW and currently run on Malampaya gas. Four of those plants are owned by First Gen.\nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Additional reporting by Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr. and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:48:54.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
