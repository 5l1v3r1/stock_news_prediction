Positive top line results disclosed in February 2018 showed the primary endpoint was achieved, with a 10-week ongoing pregnancy rate of 35.6% for nolasiban treated patients vs. 28.5% for placebo treated patients, a 25% relative increase (p= 0.031). In the embryo transfer (ET) D5 subgroup, the relative increase was 32% and the absolute increase was 11.2% in favor of nolasiban (nolasiban 45.9% and placebo 34.7%, p = 0.034). In addition, nolasiban treatment was safe and well tolerated with no difference in rates of discontinuation from treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE's) nor the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE's) as compared to placebo.\nU.S. patient recruitment was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the EDELWEISS Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109, ObsEva's oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the treatment of endometriosis. Enrollment in the trial of approximately 330 patients combined in Europe and the U.S. is now complete, and the patient treatment and follow-up portion of the trial is ongoing.\nPatient enrollment continued in the PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids, with a target enrollment of approximately 1,000 women in total (US and Europe).\nThe PROLONG Phase 2a clinical trial of OBE022, ObsEva's oral prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor antagonist for the treatment of pre-term labor in pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, was initiated in December, 2017.\nUpcoming Milestones\nObsEva expects to achieve the following clinical and regulatory milestones during 2018:\n12 week results from the Phase 2b EDELWEISS clinical trial of OBE2109 for the treatment of endometriosis, in mid-2018. End-of-phase 2 meeting with regulatory authorities to discuss the design of the phase 3 program for that indication is expected by the end of 2018.\nCompletion of patient recruitment in the Phase 3 PRIMROSE 1 and 2 trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids by the end of 2018.\nResults of live birth rates and 28-day neonatal safety from the Phase 3 IMPLANT2 clinical trial of nolasiban in IVF in the fourth quarter of 2018. Post consultation with regulatory authorities, initiation of US Phase 3 clinical development program is expected by the end of 2018.\nInitial efficacy results from the Phase 2a PROLONG clinical trial of OBE022 in pre-term labor in late 2018.\nFourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Financial Results\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.1 million, or ($0.48) per basic and diluted share, vs. $11.1 million or ($0.51) per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses were $13.9 million and general and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, vs. $8.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, the net loss was $66.9 million, or ($2.25) per basic and diluted share, vs. $30.2 million, or ($1.40) per basic and diluted share for the year 2016. The net loss in these periods was largely driven by research and development expense, which totaled $54.9 million in 2017, vs. $23.7 million in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, ObsEva had cash and cash equivalents of $110.8 million, which includes net proceeds of approximately $56.3 million raised in the private equity financing that was announced on October 10, 2017. Notably, our 2017 net loss included non-cash expense of $8.9 million for share based compensation, vs. $2.2 million in 2016.\nConference Call Information\nObsEva will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to provide a business update and discuss third quarter 2017 financial results.
