De Telegraaf newspaper quoted eyewitnesses as saying that the man had been pacing about in an agitated state before tying something to a railing and then jumping off. Website Nu.nl cited a parliamentary usher saying that the man had tried to hang himself. His condition was not known. A public video feed of the speakers’ podium showed the shocked reaction of lawmakers after a loud thump before the session was postponed. Photos on social media showed the man receiving first aid on a lawmaker’s desk and later being carried out of parliament on a stretcher.
