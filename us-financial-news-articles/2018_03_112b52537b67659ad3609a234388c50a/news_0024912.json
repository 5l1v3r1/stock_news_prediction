(NVIV) today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRichard Toselli, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of InVivo, commented, “InVivo is charting a new and exciting path forward based on collaboration with the FDA that has continued through 2017 and into this year. We were pleased to announce last week that we received the agency’s approval of our supplemental Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to initiate a second pivotal study of the company’s Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ in patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI). We believe this second trial, based on a randomized, controlled protocol comparing implantation of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold to the standard of care of spinal stabilization, will provide critical data and support to enhance the clinical findings we already have generated in our previous single arm pivotal study.”\nDr. Toselli added, “Looking forward, we are actively exploring the financing options that will support the approved pivotal study and will provide updates accordingly. We estimate that from study initiation, enrollment will take place over approximately 18 months, with the full study completing in two years.”\nFinancial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $26,745,000, or $0.81 per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $23,438,000, or $0.76 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were a non-cash loss of $2,267,000 and a non-cash gain of $593,000, respectively, reflecting the impact of the August 2017 warrant exchange on the derivative warrant liability and changes in the fair market value of the derivative warrant liability. Excluding the impact of the derivative warrant liability, adjusted net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $24,478,000, or $0.74 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $24,031,000, or $0.78 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company ended the year with $12,910,000 of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of the items noted. A reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures is included with the tables contained in this release. The Company believes a presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors, enabling them to better understand the Company’s operations, on a period-to-period comparable basis, with financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items.\nAbout InVivo Therapeutics\nInVivo Therapeutics Holdings Corp. is a research and clinical-stage biomaterials and biotechnology company with a focus on treatment of spinal cord injuries.
