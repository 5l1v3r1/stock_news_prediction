He has no plan to sell because he believes Twitter faces less regulatory risk than Facebook or Snap.\n\"The average guy or gal uses it as a news feed,\" Dollarhide said. \"I don't know what personal information I've ever shared on Twitter.\"\nNew European Union privacy rules that go into effect in May will require letting European users opt out of highly targeted online ads, or face fines of up to 4.0 percent of annual revenues.\nSan Francisco-based Baker Avenue Asset Management chief investment strategist King Lip said Facebook and other social media companies face more regulatory risk from European governments than in the United States.\nCredit reporting agency Equifax's massive breach of consumers' sensitive financial data disclosed last September led to government probes but no major regulatory or legal changes.\n\"Equifax's breach was far more egregious than the Facebook issue, and there hasn't been any significant legislation,\" Lip said. \"I think there's going to be a lot of chatter about privacy issues surrounding Facebook, but I don't think any significant legislation is going to be passed.\" (Reporting by Noel Randewich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-20T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-20T20:56:45.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
