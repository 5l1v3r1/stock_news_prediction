The surest way to demonstrate its commitment in this case would be to apply voluntarily for clearance,” Frank Field, chair of the parliamentary work and pensions committee, said in a statement.\nThe pensions regulator currently only has powers to force an acquiring company to strengthen support for a takeover target’s pensions scheme if the bidder asks for clearance.\n“We have been concerned that the increased leverage involved in the proposed takeover by Melrose is likely to have a detrimental impact on covenant,” Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the regulator, said in a letter published by the committee, adding the regulator had “strongly encouraged Melrose to make a clearance application”.\nReporting by Carolyn Cohn; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T10:49:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
