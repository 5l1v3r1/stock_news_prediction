Florida sits three points behind the New Jersey Devils for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. Florida, with a game in hand on New Jersey, has six games left in the season.\nAfter a scoreless first period, Pageau broke the deadlock 84 seconds into the second. Reimer failed to cover a puck when he had the chance, and in the resulting scramble Pageau tucked it into the cage.\nFlorida’s Aaron Ekblad responded with his 16th goal of the season at the 5:19 mark of the middle frame to draw even. He gained the puck just inside the blue line and worked his way to the slot before firing a shot past Anderson. Ekblad’s tally is a career high and ties him with Jason Garrison for most in a season by a Panthers defenseman.\nJust 91 seconds later, Evgenii Dadonov potted his 26th goal of the campaign to put the Panthers ahead 2-1. He took advantage of the Senators’ defenders backing too deep into the zone and fired from the slot, putting it off the post and in the net to run his goal-scoring streak to three straight games and giving him 22 points (10-12-22) over his last 18 games.\nHowever Ottawa’s Magnus Paajarvi scored just 16 seconds into the third period to pull the hosts even. Paajarvi deflected Zack Smith’s point shot, a goal on which Erik Karlsson collected his 50th assist of the season, a mark he’s reached five times.\nAnderson made 24 saves in the win, while Reimer took the loss despite a 27-save effort.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:22:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
