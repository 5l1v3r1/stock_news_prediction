The 30-stock average also got a boost as shares of Boeing slashed earlier losses, trading just above the flatline percent higher as of 1:15 p.m. ET. The stock had fallen as much as 2.2 percent earlier in the session.\n\"Boeing got hit three days in a row earlier in the week because people felt that was a way the Chinese and others could reach in,\" said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley.\"\n\"You're going to get that kind of ebb and flow,\" Cashin said. \"I would continue to keep my eye on Boeing. I think it's going to be the critical factor in the Dow.\"\nThe S&P 500 fell marginally, with materials and energy stocks weighing down a 0.4 percent gain in industrials.\nThe White House is thinking about implementing tariffs on at least $30 billion of Chinese imports as part of a package of anti-China measures, the Wall Street Journal reported. Reuters also reported Tuesday that President Donald Trump may impose tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods.\nInvestors worry that other countries could retaliate by implementing their own tariffs on U.S.-made goods and sparking a trade war. This would hurt companies who do business overseas, especially large multinationals like Boeing.\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. \"There are two specific reasons these fears are hitting stocks,\" said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. \"First, the Trump administration is specifically targeting intellectual property theft by the Chinese government, a practice that most independent analysts admit is rampant. … By targeting IP, the administration can cast a very wide net as far as what products it can slap tariffs on.\"\n\"Second, the law by which the Trump administration is conducting the investigation, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, gives the president widespread and virtually unchallenged authority to take retaliatory trade actions,\" Essaye said.\nThe moves Thursday come after Wall Street saw a choppy trading day on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing almost 250 points down. Shares of Boeing contributed the most to the losses, as concerns that a trade war could occur between the U.S. and China came to the surface.\nStocks tried to rebound after news broke that Larry Kudlow would become the next National Economic Council directors, replacing Gary Cohn, but failed to erase their losses.\nLast week, Trump signed two declarations which would implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports — both of which are expected to take effect in the coming weeks.\nIn economic news, weekly jobless claims dropped by 4,000 to 226,000, in line with expectations.\nIn corporate news, Williams-Sonoma reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the previous quarter. The company's stock rose 2.5 percent on the back of the news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T12:09:55.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
