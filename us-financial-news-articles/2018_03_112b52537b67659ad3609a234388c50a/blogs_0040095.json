Much of Wall Street thinks the Facebook scandal is overblown.\nShares of Facebook have fallen more than 10% this week after reports emerged that political data analytics company Cambridge Analytica accessed the data of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission . Facebook has known about the situation since 2015 but didn't publicly acknowledge it until The New York Times and the Guardian's Observer reported it on Saturday.\nFollowing those reports, it took another few days for CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg to speak publicly about the situation, prompting yet more criticism for their handling of the crisis.\nBoth have since made statements and public appearances to address the data leak. Most recently, Sandberg appeared on CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to reiterate her commitment to protecting users.\n\"We know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company, for the service we provide,\" Sandberg said. \"We are going to do everything we can.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T22:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-23T00:00:54.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
