(NYSE:NLS) today announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional $15 million share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization under existing programs to $30 million. The Company has completed approximately $3.0 million in total share repurchases under the $15 million program announced in May 2017. The balance of $12.0 million under that program may be repurchased from time to time through April 25, 2019. Shares may be repurchased under the new $15 million program from time to time through February 21, 2020. Repurchases under the Company’s programs may be made in open market transactions at prevailing prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the programs will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of Nautilus' common stock, general market and economic conditions, assessment of alternate uses of cash and applicable legal requirements. The Company previously completed $25 million of repurchases under share repurchase programs announced in November 2014 and May 2016.\nBruce Cazenave, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Nautilus is committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders by utilizing our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to enhance value in multiple ways.

We also recognize that the Company’s operating cash flow provides the flexibility to enhance shareholder value by opportunistically repurchasing shares when market conditions are favorable.”\nShare repurchases will be funded from existing cash balances and repurchased shares will be retired and returned to unissued authorized shares. The share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of its common stock and the program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAbout Nautilus, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Vancouver, Washington, Nautilus, Inc.
