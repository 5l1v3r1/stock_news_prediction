(NASDAQ:SUPN) (the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system diseases, announced today the pricing of its private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”) to be sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The Company has granted the initial purchasers of the Notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $52.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The offering is expected to close on March 19, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will be the Company’s unsecured obligations, effectively subordinated in right of payment to any secured senior indebtedness of the Company and structurally subordinated to all future indebtedness of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Notes will pay interest semi-annually in cash on April 1 and October 1 of each year at a rate of 0.625% per year, commencing October 1, 2018. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted.\nThe Company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be approximately $340.2 million (or approximately $391.3 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. The Company expects to use the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, companies, products and technologies and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including without limitation, capital expenditures and research and development activities for potentially acquired or in-licensed product candidates, after applying approximately $23.7 million (or approximately $27.2 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional Notes) of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties, as described below (after such cost is partially offset by the proceeds to the Company from the separate sale of the warrants described below).\nThe holders of the Notes will have the ability to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of their Notes for cash in the event of a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes). In such case, the repurchase price would be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nPrior to October 1, 2022, the Notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day preceding the maturity date of the Notes. The Notes will be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 16.8545 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $59.33 per share, which represents a conversion premium of approximately 37.5% to the last reported sale price of $43.15 per share of the Company’s common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market on March 14, 2018. In addition, following certain corporate transactions that may occur prior to the maturity date, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time. Upon any conversion, the Company’s conversion obligation will be settled in cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company has entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the Notes or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “Hedge Counterparties”). The convertible note hedge transactions cover the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that will initially underlie the Notes, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Company also entered into separate privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Hedge Counterparties relating to the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The strike price of the warrant transactions will initially be approximately $80.91 per share, which represents an 87.5% premium to the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market on March 14, 2018. In addition, if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company expects to sell additional warrants to the Hedge Counterparties and use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the additional Notes and from the sale of the additional warrants to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions with the Hedge Counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or reduce the amount of any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted Notes upon conversion of the Notes. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect with respect to the Company’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on any expiration date of the warrants.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions, concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes, the Hedge Counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, and shortly after the pricing of the Notes, may purchase the Company’s common stock in secondary market transactions. These activities could have the effect of increasing, or reducing the size of a decline in, the market price of the Company’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly following, the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Hedge Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or by purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company, including the Notes, in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions following the pricing of the Notes from time to time (and are likely to do so during any “observation period” (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) related to a conversion of Notes). Any of these hedging activities could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Notes.\nThe offer and sale of the Notes and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion thereof, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, and the Notes and such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.\nAbout Supernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSupernus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.
