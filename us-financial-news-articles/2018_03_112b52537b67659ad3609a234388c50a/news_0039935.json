Ltd., announced that the Samsung RS85A ultrasound system has received FDA 510(k) clearance and will be unveiled at the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) in New York City today. The RS85A is the latest expansion of Samsung’s revolutionary ultrasound portfolio.\nThis press release features multimedia.

It features an array of improvements, including:\nMV-Flow™: Allows for visualization of slow-flow micro vascularized structures, which can be difficult to assess with conventional power Doppler ultrasound. It also provides clinicians an additional way to check lesions for indications of cancer or inflammation. S-Shearwave Imaging™: Provides new indicators for clinical diagnosis by quantifying the elasticity of tissue or lesions via shearwave elastography, which may help increase the accuracy of diagnosis for breast and liver diseases. CEUS+™: Diagnoses and characterizes lesions in the liver using a contrast agent in adult and pediatric populations. S-Fusion™: Enables simultaneous localization of a lesion using real-time ultrasound in conjunction with other volumetric imaging modalities such as an MRI or a CT, while expanding its capabilities to the prostate gland for precise, targeted biopsy guidance.\nThe RS85A was also developed to help decrease user-fatigue and repetitive motions with an enhanced monitor arm and increased range of motion and tilt. These improvements allow the user to position the monitor for optimal viewing and control. Additionally, multi-step actions have been combined into a single step to help reduce keystrokes and repetitive user interface interactions.\n“Samsung has built innovative and cutting-edge diagnostic ultrasound products for more than 30 years,” said David Legg, Vice President of Sales at Samsung NeuroLogica. “We are so confident that our RS85A ultrasound system will perform reliably and be the system that you can depend on for years to come, that we are proud to offer a 5-year warranty standard, at no additional cost.”\nIn addition to the introduction of the RS85A at AIUM 2018, Samsung will showcase additional products in their comprehensive ultrasound portfolio, including the WS80A with Elite, our premium women’s health ultrasound system, the HS60, HS40 and the HM70A with Plus.\nVisit Samsung at booth #1100 at AIUM’s 2018 Annual Meeting, and learn more by following Samsung NeuroLogica on Facebook , Twitter and LinkedIn .\nAbout Samsung NeuroLogica\nSamsung NeuroLogica, the healthcare subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., develops, manufactures and markets innovative imaging technologies, and is committed to delivering fast, easy and accurate diagnostic solutions to healthcare providers.
