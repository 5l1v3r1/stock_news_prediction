World shares have risen around 50 percent since early-2016.\nJitters grew further after Sunday’s Italian election, where voters delivered a hung parliament, flocking to anti-immigrant and eurosceptic parties in record numbers, potentially endangering stability and wider European integration.\n“There is nothing in the global set-up that’s positive for equities at the moment especially as (share) prices are still out of whack with latest developments,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.\nWall Street, where the Dow Jones index fell 3 percent last week, was set to open weaker, futures indicated\nWhile Italian stocks remained 1 percent lower at six-month lows, broader European markets reversed opening losses to rise 0.5 percent.\nThat left MSCI’s all-country equity index marginally in the red, though emerging equities fell 0.7 percent , near three-week lows.\nAhmed said developments in Italy represented a“a medium-to-small shock” with implications for asset prices, while the risk of trade wars was a far bigger issue.\n“Markets are not priced for trade wars and now you are also seeing a negative reaction to the U.S. moves from Europe and Canada,” he said.\n“The major vulnerability is in emerging markets,” he added, referring to the developing world’s reliance on trade.\nMost emerging currencies weakened around 0.3-0.5 percent to the dollar . Export-reliant Asian bourses such as Hong Kong and Seoul closed 1-2 percent lower\nOVERSHADOWING GERMANY The growth concerns pushed investors towards Bunds, with 10-year German yields falling to nearly six-week lows . Gold likewise benefited from the turbulence, rising to one-week lows.\nYields on 10-year Italian government bonds jumped 10 basis points at the open, reversing some of the gains they had enjoyed in the run-up to the election but they later clawed back some losses to trade 6.5 bps higher.\nYields on other lower-rated European bonds from Spain and Portugal also were up on the day .\nInvestors noted Italy had overshadowed positive news from Germany where Social Democrats on Sunday decisively backed forming a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, ending a five-month stalemate.\nAlso, unlike past crises as in 2012, Europe’s robustly growing economy was seen mitigating some political risks.\n“Investors still believe that politics appear less likely to upset the apple cart than only a year ago and Eurozone growth could be hitting three percent this year,” said John Taylor, fixed income portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in London.\nThe euro which earlier in the day fell 0.7 percent to six-month lows versus the yen, erased some losses to stand 0.2 percent lower by 1200 GMT while against the dollar too, it rose to trade flat.\nThe dollar meanwhile rose slightly off one-week lows against a basket of currencies and stayed a touch off November 2016 lows plumbed versus the yen immediately after Trump’s trade threats last week.\nDollar traders might hold fire, however, until this Friday’s U.S. jobs data, the very dataset which triggered a selloff at the end of January by stoking expectations of faster rate rises by the Federal Reserve.\nReporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney; Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe in London; Editing by Toby Chopra\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-05T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T23:16:14.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
