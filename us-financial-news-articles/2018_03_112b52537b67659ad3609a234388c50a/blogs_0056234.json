And then how do we connect to that next generation of consumer? You heard a little bit of it with that mixtape, but we've got 2.5 million Twitter followers where we really get to talk about our differences and how we stand apart from the competition.\"\nAs McDonald's bolsters its technological wares, introducing digital kiosks in its stores and mobile ordering, Wendy's will also make the leap forward in terms of tech, Penegor said.\nAnd with the fast-food restaurant space facing competition, oversupply and rising labor costs, the CEO told Cramer that boosting investments in tech will help his chain mitigate those pressures.\n\"The restaurants with scale are growing because when you have scale, you can invest in technology,\" Penegor said, citing a few examples including in-store kiosks and back-room automation.\n\"You can do things with industrial engineers to figure out, how do you optimize your labor guide along the way to really mitigate some of those inflationary impacts?\" he said. \"Those are important things to help differentiate, because what we know is you can't pass along to the consumer the wage inflation because the gap between food at home and food away from home just gets too wide. So you've got to find efficiencies to offset those pressures.\"\nWatch Todd Penegor's full interview here: show chapters Wendy's just released a hip-hop mixtape—here's what the CEO had to say 19 Hours Ago | 08:16 Questions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
