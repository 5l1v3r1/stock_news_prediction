It was up 0.3 percent at 89.60 pence on the day.\nSterling remained on the back foot against the dollar as well, after a draft EU text outlined a much more limited cooperation with Britain after its departure from the European Union than London had called for.\nElsewhere, the Canadian dollar was on the back foot, with the currency down 0.4 percent against the greenback before a policy meeting later in the session where the central bank was likely to hold interest rates.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-07T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T17:33:29.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
