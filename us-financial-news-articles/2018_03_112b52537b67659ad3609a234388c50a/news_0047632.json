REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert, Jonathan Ernst/Files \nParkland student David Hogg, 17, tweeted a list of a dozen companies that advertise on “The Ingraham Angle” and urged his supporters to demand that they cancel their ads. \nHogg is a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Parkland suburb of Fort Lauderdale. Since then, he and other classmates have become the faces of a new youth-led movement calling for tighter restrictions on firearms. \nHogg took aim at Ingraham’s advertisers after she taunted him on Twitter on Wednesday, accusing him of whining about being rejected by four colleges to which he had applied. \nOn Thursday, Ingraham tweeted an apology “in the spirit of Holy Week,” saying she was sorry for any hurt or upset she had caused Hogg or any of the “brave victims” of Parkland. \n“For the record, I believe my show was the first to feature David ... immediately after that horrific shooting and even noted how ‘poised’ he was given the tragedy,” Ingraham tweeted, adding that Hogg was welcome back for another interview. \nBut her apology did not stop at least three companies from parting ways with her show. U.S. celebrity chef Rachael Ray’s pet food line Nutrish, travel website TripAdvisor ( TRIP.O ) and online home furnishings seller Wayfair Inc ( W.N ) all said they were canceling their advertisements. \nWayfair said it supports open dialogue and debate, but “the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values,” it said in a statement. \nReplying to Hogg’s boycott call, Nutrish tweeted: “We are in the process of removing our ads from Laura Ingraham’s program.” \nA representative for the pet food line did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. \nCNBC cited a TripAdvisor spokesman as saying the company does not condone “inappropriate comments” made by Ingraham that in its view “cross the line of decency.” \nTripAdvisor representatives did not immediately reply to a request for comment. \nIngraham’s show runs on Fox News, part of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc ( FOXA.O ). \n(This version of the story corrects spelling of Rachael Ray’s first name in paragraph 7) Reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Leslie Adler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T23:13:17.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
