Concerns that worsening trade relations between China and the United States could spill across into other countries have fuelled worries about a slowdown in China, which is already seeing inventories build, said analyst Helen Lau at broker Argonaut in Hong Kong. \"Overall the inventory after China's new year did not come down as much as the industry expected,\" she said. \"China's economic slowdown and the escalating trade war concerns... All of this is pointing towards headwinds for commodity demand.\" FUNDAMENTALS * LME: London Metal Exchange copper was up 0.4 percent at $6699 a tonne by 0253 GMT, having stabilised in the previous session.
