Columbia Sussex is one of the nation’s largest franchisers of Marriott hotels, and is rebranding the InterContinental to Renaissance Dallas Addison. Renovations are already underway.\nCentrally located in the heart of the Dallas Metroplex, the full-service property anchors the area’s bustling dining and entertainment scene with dozens of restaurants, bars and shops within walking distance, plus hundreds more located just a short drive away—making the updated hotel a perfect home base for a stay in Dallas.\nThe property features 528 guestrooms and suites and more than 100,000 square feet of total meeting space, plus a fitness center, outdoor pool and on-site spa services. The restaurant and bar are also getting a rebrand, and together will be known as the Noell JCT Restaurant & Lounge. The new name pays homage to Addison’s past—the town was originally called Noell Junction, after Sydney Smith Noell, an integral figure in Addison’s establishment and growth during the early 1900s.\nColumbia Sussex tapped award-winning design firm DiLeonardo to handle the redesign and to ensure that the property is up to Marriott’s exacting standards. They were charged with rejuvenating the ballrooms, meeting spaces and pre-function areas of the InterContinental Dallas in preparation of its transition. The design team drew inspiration from the journeys travelers take in and out of Addison to enjoy the local culture, including theater, fine art, music and cuisine. This blend of movement, interaction and activity reflects the historic industries of oil and cattle that have shaped the growth of Addison today. Taking inspiration from these elements, the designers infused this theme into the furniture, lighting, fabric and finishes, incorporating industrial materials such as metals, wood and leather. Unique and interactive art pieces are found throughout the hotel, giving guests fun—and highly Instagrammable—moments to remember.\n“We are excited to officially unveil the Renaissance Dallas Addison to locals and visitors alike, and trust that our ambition won’t go unnoticed as we aim to provide guests with the best possible service and experience,” said Francie Syron, Director of Sales & Marketing. “The revamped hotel embraces what makes the city unique while staying true to the Renaissance brand’s commitment to stylish, thought-provoking spaces and unexpected experiences for business and leisure travelers.”\nThe Renaissance Dallas Addison is located at 15201 Dallas Pkwy in Addison, TX.
