Cigna shares slipped 7.6 percent.\nThe deal boosted the S&P healthcare index, up 0.55 percent. Real estate also rose 0.62 percent.\nKroger fell more than 10 percent after the supermarket chain issued a disappointing full-year profit forecast.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters turned 9.8 percent lower after trading up premarket on strong results.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,381 to 1,322. On the Nasdaq, 1,380 issues fell and 1,328 advanced.
