Remember that a 1 hour error in our guessed reentry time corresponds to an 27000 km (17000 mile) error in the reentry position. And currently our estimate has a 2 week uncertainty\nMcDowell explains that an error of 1 hour in predicting the time of the station's reentry results in a 17,000 mile difference in where the station falls above the Earth. Current estimates have a two week uncertainty in the reentry timing — a range of 336 hours.\nTiangong-1 does not fly north of 42.7° N latitude or south of 42.7° S latitude on its current trajectory. For New Zealand, McDowell estimates that the chance the station does not come down over the island chain is 99.9 percent, based off of the amount of time Tiangong-1 spends over various parts of the Earth.\nThe Aerospace scientists believe China's first space station will re-enter the atmosphere either in the last week of March or the first week of April. The European Space Agency has a wider window and says the module will come down between March 24 and April 19.\nThe report added that the chance of being struck by Tiangong-1 debris is about 1 million times smaller than the odds of winning the U.S. Powerball jackpot.\nIt added that only one person has ever been recorded as being hit by a piece of space debris and she was not injured.\n– CNBC's Michael Sheetz contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T13:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T13:42:24.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
