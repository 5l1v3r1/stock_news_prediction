Japan’s Nikkei jumped 2 percent, while South Korea rose 0.8 percent.\nAustralia’s main index climbed 0.9 percent and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added another 0.23 percent.\nInflationary worries faded on Friday after U.S. data showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, but annual growth in average hourly earnings slowed to 2.6 percent after a spike in January.\nThe pullback in wages tempered speculation the Federal Reserve would project four rate hikes - or dot plots - at its policy meeting next week, instead of the current three.\n“The release threaded the stock needle perfectly, exhibiting strong overall net job adds alongside an increase in the participation rate and tepid wages suggesting labour demand is being met by new entrants into the workforce,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note.\n“In reality though the market is probably reading too much into a single jobs report,” they cautioned. “A fourth dot on March 21 may have been averted but the labour market is increasingly demonstrating evidence of tightness and this will inevitably translate into upside wage pressure.”\nFor now, Wall Street was happy to take the data at face value and the Dow jumped 1.77 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.74 percent and the Nasdaq 1.79 percent.\nOn the week, the S&P rose 3.5 percent, the Dow 3.25 percent and Nasdaq 4.2 percent.\nThe jobs news likewise lifted riskier currencies, including the Mexican peso and Canadian and Australian dollars, while weighing on the safe-haven yen.\nThose cross currents left the U.S. dollar a shade higher against a basket of currencies at 90.107. The euro was last up a fraction at $1.2310, sandwiched between support at $1.2270 and resistance at $1.2296.\nThe dollar edged ahead on the yen to 106.88, having bounced 0.5 percent on Friday.\nInvestors also trimmed holdings of yen last week on news U.S. President Donald Trump was prepared to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions in the region.\nU.S. officials on Sunday defended Trump’s decision, saying the move was not just for show and not a gift to Pyongyang.\nThe mix of brisk U.S. economic growth and restrained inflation was a positive one for most commodities, with industrial metals and oil performing well.\nSpot gold was steady on Monday at $1,323.14 an ounce.\nBrent crude futures rose 16 cents to $65.65 a barrel, after surging almost 3 percent on Friday. U.S. crude futures rose 11 cents to $62.15 a barrel.\nEditing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T02:41:28.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
