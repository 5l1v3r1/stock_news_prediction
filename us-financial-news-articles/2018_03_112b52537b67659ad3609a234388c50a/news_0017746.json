He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media.\nChina, meanwhile, maintained its high pace of natural gas imports. February's 6.94 million tonnes was steady on a daily basis with January's 7.7 million tonnes, which marked the second highest level on record on a monthly basis.\nImports of both piped gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG)have hovered around record highs in winter months as residents in northern regions switch to the fuel for heating as part of Beijing's drive to clean up the environment.\nThe massive government push to heat millions of homes and power thousands of factories with natural gas in northern China led to demand for the fuel outpacing supply, while delivery infrastructure struggled to manage the higher consumption.\nWang Wen, gas analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, expects LNG imports to ease after the winter heating season ends in mid-March, but purchases could buck the usual seasonal trend.\n\"Let's wait and see if the government is going to push wider the gasification campaign, or if there will be pent-up industrial demand emerging,\" said Wang.\nState-run energy giants such as PetroChina and CNOOC may also start stockpiling LNG in summer months to fill the storage tanks drawn down in peak winter season, she added.\n(tonne 7.3 barrels for crude oil)\n(Reporting by Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu; editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T16:40:01.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
