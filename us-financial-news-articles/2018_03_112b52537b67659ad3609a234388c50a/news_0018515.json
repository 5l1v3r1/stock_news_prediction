(TSX:MRD), a real estate development and asset management company with operations across western Canada and in the United States, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The economic environment improved in many of Melcor's primary markets throughout the year, resulting in revenue growth of 6.4% to $257.95 million in 2017 compared to $242.46 million in 2016. Funds from operations (FFO) per share was up 38% to $1.77 in 2017 compared to $1.28 in 2016. FFO adjusts for all non-cash earnings items and management believes it better reflects true operating performance.\nNet income was up 12% to $38.53 million or $1.15 per share (basic) in 2017, compared to $34.43 million or $1.04 per share (basic) in 2016.\nDarin Rayburn, Melcor’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the year: \"On behalf of the Melcor team and our Board of Directors, I'm pleased to report to you leading into a milestone year. In 2018, we have the honour of celebrating both our 95 th year as a company and our 50 th being publicly traded. Our Company's continued success over this extended period of time is no small feat. It requires resilience to change with the times, to react to market cycles and to continually re-imagine how our business can grow and prosper.\nWith the dividend declared today, we are now in our 30th consecutive year of dividend payments. Since becoming a public company in 1968, we have paid dividends in all but three years. Protecting and growing our shareholders investments and sharing profits through dividends remains a priority. Dividends in 2017 grew 8% over 2016.\nThroughout 2017, we continued to execute on our conservative growth strategy and achieved stable results in both the fourth quarter and for the year. Residential sales returned to normalized levels and we balanced the offerings available in our communities to meet consumer needs for varied products and multiple price points. We continued to develop commercial assets to enable steady growth in our income-producing properties. In spite of challenges faced in the real estate acquisition and disposition market, the Melcor REIT took advantage of its unique acquisition pipeline in early 2018 with the vend-in of $80.88 million worth of commercial properties. We now manage 3.92 million square feet of income property with stable overall occupancy of 92%.\nThroughout the downturn of the past few years, we have worked towards advancing the planning and approvals of several new communities and commercial projects. In 2017, we broke ground on 2 new neighbourhood shopping centres and began servicing 2 new communities. We have additional commercial projects and communities in the works for the coming years, subject to market demand.\nWith appropriate levels of serviced land inventory and project approvals, stable occupancy on a diverse asset base and low debt, we are well positioned for the future.”\nThe Board today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018. The dividend is an eligible dividend for Canadian tax purposes.\nSelected Highlights\n($000s except as noted) 2017 2016 Change Revenue 257,950 242,461 6.4 % Gross margin (%) * 45.1 % 44.7% 0.9 % Fair value adjustment on investment properties (8,828 ) 15,795 (155.9 )% Net income 38,525 34,433 11.9 % Net margin (%) * 14.9 % 14.2% 4.9 % Funds from operations * 59,021 42,564 38.7 % Shareholders' equity 1,008,590 994,721 1.4 % Total assets 1,990,983 1,891,988 5.2 % Per Share Data Basic earnings 1.15 1.04 10.6 % Diluted earnings 1.15 1.04 10.6 % Funds from operations * 1.77 1.28 38.3 % Book value * 30.21 29.83 1.3 % The economic environment improved in many of our markets in 2017, contributing to strong results. We also continued to advance several strategies to position Melcor for future growth and success.\nCommunity Development ramped up to meet demand following several years of softer markets. Single-family lot sales increased 47% and development of new single-family lots was up by 162% (including the purchase of 294 lots in the US) over 2016. Our strategy of diversifying residential product types to respond to demand in price-sensitive markets has proven successful, with smaller, more cost efficient product types leading sales. Promotions were in place throughout 2017 in certain communities to continue moving inventory; however, most promotions have been withdrawn going into 2018 due to normalized demand.\nInvestment Properties maintained stable occupancy rates and healthy renewals in spite of market challenges. Investment Properties manages 3.92 million sf of commercial property and 609 residential units, down slightly from last year as we sold some properties to monetize the value created and re-invest capital.\nRevenue from our income-producing portfolio (including REIT properties) remained steady over 2016 while the Community Development division saw an increase of 3%. Diversity in the Community Development division's product types (from multi-family to estate) contributed to steady activity in under-served asset classes.\nThroughout the year, we maintained our conservative and disciplined approach to investment and development activities and the management of our assets and liabilities.\nProperty Development completed and transferred 4 buildings (38,199 sf) in 2017 with a further 125,300 sf under development and nearing completion. Revenue from the Property Development division is eliminated on consolidation. Total revenue was down over 2016 as 58% less GLA was completed and transferred in the year. Transfers to Investment Properties will positively impact results in future years as we continue to grow our income-producing assets for long-term holding or for sale to the REIT. We continued to progress commercial land through the development, approvals and lease-up process and have an additional 5 buildings in 4 developments expected to be completed and transferred to Investment Properties in 2018.\nWe completed the following dispositions during the year, resulting in a 1% reduction of GLA in our portfolio of managed properties:\na parking lot in Edmonton, Alberta for $2.99 million (net of transaction costs), a residential building in the US for $0.17 million (net of transaction costs), and the REIT disposed of an industrial property in Lethbridge, Alberta for $7.76 million (net of transaction costs).\nWe continued to invest in land inventory and increased our land holdings by 771.44 acres in strategic growth corridors. The acquired land is primarily allocated to residential development and includes 515.78 acres acquired in the US. We continue to move land use approvals through the municipal approval process to increase our supply of shovel ready assets so that we are ready to capitalize on improved demand.\nOccupancy in our income-producing properties owned by Melcor and the REIT remained steady at 92%.\nSubsequent to the year end, the REIT purchased five commercial properties (172,629 sf of owned GLA) from Melcor for $80.88 million. This was the fourth sale completed to the REIT and represents a key part of our value chain. Through the REIT, we are able to monetize the value we create as we move land from raw inventory to completed commercial project. As majority owner of the REIT, we receive monthly distributions from the REIT. Growing the asset management side of our business helps to stabilize our overall revenue throughout the year.\nReturn to Shareholders\nMelcor continues to distribute profit to our shareholders. During 2017, the Company paid annual dividends of $0.52 per share, representing growth of 8%.\nMelcor declared a $0.13 per share dividend on March 7, 2018 payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018. The dividend is an eligible dividend for Canadian tax purposes.\nMelcor has been paying dividends since 1969.\nOutlook\nMelcor owns a high quality portfolio of assets, including raw land, developed land inventory (residential lots and acres for multi-family and commercial development), income-producing properties and championship golf courses. Alberta, our largest market, has undergone dramatic changes throughout the past few years, primarily related to lower oil prices. We continue to execute on our strategic plan and achieved solid results in 2017. We are intentionally diversifying across asset class and geography, and continue to invest in the US with both raw land acquisitions and the launch of an 1,100-acre community with expansion capacity. This diversification will serve to ease reliance on the Alberta economy.\nMarket demand varies by asset class and region and we expect this to continue in 2018. On the residential side, we expect starter homes and lower priced options including duplexes, townhomes and new product types such as zero lot lines to continue to lead the market. On the commercial side, retail activity remains steady and we expect that trend to continue. Our US assets continue to deliver positive returns in economies that are growing and that are counter cyclical to our resource dependence in Alberta.\nOur business model has adapted to changing times for 94 years. We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to diversify our asset base both geographically and by product type. We will maintain our disciplined, conservative approach to operations to ensure that we remain profitable while achieving our fundamental goals of protecting shareholder investment and sharing corporate profit with our shareholders.\nWith appropriate levels of serviced land inventory, high occupancy rates and capacity on our operating facility, we remain are positioned for the future.\nMD&A and Financial Statements\nInformation included in this press release is a summary of results.
