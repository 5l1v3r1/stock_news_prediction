There are 34 [potential] parties which is a lot and it shows us that people are interested in taking part in politics and that they want a general election,” Jarungvith Phumma, acting secretary-general of the Election Commission, told reporters on Friday.\nThailand currently has 69 registered, political parties.\nMembers of Phuar Chart Thai party wait to summit their documents to register their political party at the Election Commission Office in Bangkok, Thailand, March 2, 2018.
