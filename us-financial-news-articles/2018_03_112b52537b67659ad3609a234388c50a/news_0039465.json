About 35 of 140 drivers serving Brooklyn and lower Manhattan and 12 of 105 drivers in the Bronx have quit since the pay structure changes in August . \nHer $31 million in total compensation is about 650 times the salary of a typical worker . PepsiCo drivers, whose union membership dropped from 17% to 6% after a quarter-century of decertification efforts by the company , saw pay in New York drop from about $90,000 to $60,000 after the salary structure changes. \nPepsiCo’s growth in the last quarter of 2017 was stronger than expected. Though revenue increased by about 2% last year for Frito-Lay North America , the company’s snacks items, like Cheetos and Doritos, are “bolstering its performance at a challenging time for much of its beverage business, specifically its carbonated drinks,” according to Fortune . \nThe Frito-Lay snack business’ organic sales were up 5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the company is looking to place it’s Simply products in Whole Foods as it grows its natural offerings to cater to consumers looking for healthier options. \nPepsiCo expects 2018 revenue growth to be similar to last year, when organic revenues rose 2.3% .
