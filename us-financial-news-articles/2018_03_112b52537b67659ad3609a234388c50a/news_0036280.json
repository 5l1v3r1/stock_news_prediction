The Value Fund is led by Co-Portfolio Managers Matthew Fine, CFA and Michael Fineman, CFA, CFP®. Mr. Fine previously served as Lead Portfolio Manager of the International Value Fund.\nThe successful completion of the merger represents another step by Third Avenue to streamline its lineup of funds and strengthen its focus on deep-value investing. To the benefit of all shareholders, the merger further enhances the combined Fund’s investment team and scale, while reducing the total expense ratio and contributing momentum from the International Fund’s strong performance. For the three years ending March 16, 2018, during which it was managed by Mr. Fine, TAVIX returned 10.5% annualized, outpacing its benchmark the MSCI AC World ex-US Index, which returned 8.0% over the same period.*\nMr. Fine said, “We are excited to complete the merger of our Value and International Value Funds and gratified by shareholders’ support. We’re confident that the combined team, working within the reinvigorated deep-value investment culture of our firm, can deliver superior long-term returns for our shareholders from both funds.”\nThird Avenue’s Value Fund was launched in 1990 under the leadership of Martin J. Whitman. The high conviction strategy seeks to invest in undervalued securities across industries, regions and market capitalizations. Using fundamental analysis, the portfolio team seeks to identify stocks trading below their intrinsic value that compound asset values at double digit rates.\nThird Avenue is now comprised of three equity funds: the Lipper award winning[i] Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund (TAREX/TVRVX); the Third Avenue Small-Cap Value Fund (TASCX/TVSVX); as well as the flagship Third Avenue Value Fund (TAVFX/TVFVX).\nAbout Third Avenue Management\nThird Avenue Management LLC is a New York-based investment advisory firm founded in 1986 by legendary investor Martin J.
