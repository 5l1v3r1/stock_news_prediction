The United Nations children’s agency UNICEF said last year 27 million children were out of school in conflict zones.\n“We want safe schools, we want safe homes, we want safe countries, we want a safe world,” said Satyarthi, who shared the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize with Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai for his work with children.\nJordan’s Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein told the summit, which focused on child refugees and migrants affected by war and natural disasters, that education was “key”, especially for “children on the move”.\n“Education can be expensive, but never remotely as close to what is being spent on weapons ... They (children) are today’s hope for a better future,” he told the two-day summit.\nKerry Kennedy, president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, a non-profit group, described the number of Syrian refugees not in school in the Middle East as “shocking” as the war enters its eighth year.\nKennedy cited a report being released on Tuesday by the KidsRights Foundation, an international children’s rights group, which found 40 percent of school-aged Syrian children living in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq cannot access education.\nReporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
