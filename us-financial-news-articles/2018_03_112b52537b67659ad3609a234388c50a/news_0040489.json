(NASDAQ:PRPO), in an 8-K issued today announced an agreement with investors in certain 2017 underwritten and registered direct offerings, to convert their preferred shares and exercise a substantial portion of their warrants.\nThe benefit to common stockholders of the restructuring is the elimination of the preferred class and the bulk of warrants along with accompanying preemptive rights including ratchets, which restricted access to capital.\nPreferred capital raises\nIn August 2017 Precipio completed its first post-merger capital raise of $6 million of preferred shares, with a follow on raise of $2.75 million of the same preferred shares in November 2017. As disclosed, these preferred shares had a full anti-dilution ratchet price protection, as well as 100% warrant coverage.\nEach subsequent raise conducted by Precipio triggered the repricing of those shares and warrants, resulting in further dilution to shareholders.\nRestructuring Opportunity\nOn Tuesday, March 20 th , Precipio issued an announcement that led to a substantial one-day closing share price appreciation from $0.49 to $0.90 (an increase of approximately 87%), as well as significant volume exceeding 26 million shares.\nThis created conditions favorable for Precipio and investors to enter into an agreement to discharge the preferred shares and exercise corresponding warrants which will leave the company with a cleaner cap table, unlocking access to lower cost capital due to the absence of a conversion or exercise price ratchet adjustment.\n“The news release of an exciting product followed by today’s transaction eliminates a significant overhang resulting from financings in 2017, and allows us greater financial flexibility in commercializing our industry-leading pathology and diagnostics products and services,” comments CEO Ilan Danieli. “A streamlined balance sheet is critical to growing the company and creating shareholder value to our common stockholders; this agreement could not have come at a better time.”\nAbout Precipio\nPrecipio has built a platform designed to eradicate the problem of misdiagnosis by harnessing the intellect, expertise and technology developed within academic institutions and delivering quality diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide.
