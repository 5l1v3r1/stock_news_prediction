REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Across Manhattan, 840 co-ops and condos were sold in January, a 20.1 percent decline from a year earlier, when 1,051 apartment sales were recorded, CityRealty said.\nData from the New York City Department of Finance showed 995 units were sold in December, a 15.6 percent decline, the firm noted.\nSales prices fell 15.5 percent to an average $1.86 million in January from an average $2.2 million a year earlier, while the average price in December fell 14.3 percent, from $2.17 million.\n“I’m a little startled, it’s quite a blip,” Gabby Warshawer, director of research at CityRealty, said of the drop.\nData for January showed the lowest number of units sold since February 2012, when 799 sales were recorded at an average price of $1.50 million. Volume peaked in July 2013, when 1,721 units were sold.\nOne reason for the price decline was a lack of new condo buildings entering the market, where prices in the luxury range well north of $2 million have skewed the overall market, Warshawer said.\nApartment sales priced above $10 million have doubled since 2013, when the post-crisis recovery was fully in swing, CityRealty said in a year-end 2017 report. [nL1N1OB1JP}\nThe average price of a condo was $2.8 million in January, compared with $1.3 million for co-ops, using data that excludes sales in upper Manhattan because of the area’s low activity. Only 61 units were sold that month in upper Manhattan.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-05T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-05T21:23:48.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
