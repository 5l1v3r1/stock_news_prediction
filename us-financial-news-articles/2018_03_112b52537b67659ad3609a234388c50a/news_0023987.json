(“BREIT”) announced today that it acquired the Canyon Industrial Portfolio, a 22-million square foot portfolio of industrial assets, for approximately $1.8 billion.\nThe Canyon Industrial Portfolio is comprised of 146 last-mile infill warehouses and distribution buildings with major concentrations in Chicago, Dallas, Baltimore/Washington D.C., Los Angeles/Inland Empire and South/Central Florida. The assets are of high physical quality and in attractive locations, and the portfolio features a strong, creditworthy tenant mix, including Amazon, FedEx, DHL, Coca-Cola, Fiat Chrysler and the U.S. Government.\n\"The Canyon transaction exemplifies BREIT's focus on real estate asset classes and geographic markets with attractive fundamentals. BREIT’s portfolio, with its emphasis on stable, income-producing warehouse and apartment assets, is well positioned to benefit from continued tailwinds in these sectors,\" said A.J. Agarwal, President of BREIT, and Head of U.S. Core+ Real Estate, Blackstone.\nWith the closing of this acquisition, BREIT’s portfolio totals $7 billion in gross asset value across 272 assets primarily concentrated in 33-million square feet of industrial assets and 17,200 multifamily apartments, with modest exposure to select-service hotels and grocery-anchored shopping centers.\nAbout BREIT\nBlackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. is a perpetual-life, monthly NAV REIT that seeks to invest in stabilized income-generating U.S. commercial real estate across the key property types, including multifamily, industrial, retail and hotel assets, and to a lesser extent in real estate-related securities.
