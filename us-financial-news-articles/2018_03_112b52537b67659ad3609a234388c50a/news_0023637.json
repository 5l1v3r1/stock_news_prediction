Black Panther should climb past the $1 billion mark this weekend, having reached $940 million in global grosses during the week, including $22.7 million in its opening-day haul in China on Friday. That gave Black Panther the best opening day gross in China for a Marvel movie since 2016’s Captain America: Civil War , which took in over $30 million on its first day in Chinese theaters on its way to grossing a whopping $180 million in that country overall. \nBlack Panther would also be the first Marvel movie to reach $1 billion since Civil War cleared $1.15 billion two years ago, and the fifth so far from Disney’s Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie is already the second highest-grossing Marvel film domestically, with its $520 million haul in North America trailing only 2012’s The Avengers , at $623 million domestically ($1.5 billion worldwide), according to Box Office Mojo. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nBlack Panther only needs roughly $60 million worldwide at this weekend’s box office to reach $1 billion after pulling in roughly $122 million globally last weekend. Barring a larger-than-expected drop-off , the film should coast past that milestone. \nHowever, Black Panther could still lose its box-office crown this weekend to newcomer (and fellow Disney film) A Wrinkle in Time . Director Ava DuVernay ‘s adaptation of the popular young-adult novel of the same name has been highly-anticipated since Disney made her the first-ever black woman to direct a movie with a budget over $100 million. Disney has been promoting the film heavily for months, though its recent mixed reviews from critics could dampen A Wrinkle in Time ‘s opening weekend box-office performance. Variety reports that the film is forecasted to gross roughly $35 million domestically this weekend, which may not quite be enough to stop Black Panther from a fourth weekend of dominance.
