The 54-year old has been called a “dictator” by various members of the European community since coming to power in 2010; he served a previous term between 1998 and 2002. He’s running for a third consecutive term with an election coming in April. \nThe accusation of “dictator”-like behavior has followed Orban’s increasingly restrictive attitude towards the press and changes to the country’s judicial system that some have said are damaging Hungary’s independence. \nWhen Luxembourg’s Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn called Orban a “dictator” for passing laws that could obstruct organizations helping asylum seekers from operating in Hungary, Szijjarto hit back by calling his counterpart an “idiot” who wanted to “flood Hungary with migrants.” He defended Orban, saying he was “protecting Hungary’s security.” \nAside from immigration, Hungary has clashed with the EU over sovereignty and the idea of a “stronger EU.” Szijjarto said that while Budapest was interested in having a stronger EU, it was not at any cost. \n“We have a debate with Brussels about how we get to a phenomenon of having a stronger EU. In Brussels, there is the approach of something like a ‘United States of Europe’ that should be established, but our approach is totally different. \n“It’s a more (pro) sovereign approach, saying that the EU can only be strong if the member states are strong. We are not alone on our side and if you look at the position of many central and eastern European countries, you will see many similarities.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T20:11:25.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
