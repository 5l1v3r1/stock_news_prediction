The FTC, which requested a temporary restraining order and asset freezes pending trial, said three “chain referral schemes” were marketed as bona-fide money-making opportunities via YouTube, social media, and conference calls. In reality they failed to deliver any returns or allow consumers to recoup their investments, the agency said. They were called Bitcoin Funding Team, My7Network and Jetcoin, according to the FTC.
