The bill is aimed at \"keeping customers at licensed stores and helping ensure the regulated market survives and thrives,\" he said.\nThe marijuana market in California, which lays claim to the world's sixth-largest economy, is valued by most experts at several billion dollars annually and is expected to generate at least $1 billion a year in tax revenue.\nCalifornia pot farmers and other cannabis workers have complained at local government meetings in recent months that new regulations, licensing rules, fees and taxes have stifled their businesses and made it harder to offer products at affordable rates.\nLackey and Bonta's legislation, which would suspend a $148-per-pound marijuana cultivation tax and cut an excise tax on cannabis sales to 11 percent from 15 percent, is aimed at lowering costs for cannabis operations as they get up to code. Both provisions would expire in June 2021.\n\"We need to give legal businesses some temporary tax relief so they do not continue to be undercut,\" Lackey said.\nThe bill is awaiting a referral to a California State Assembly policy committee before it can make it to the assembly floor for a vote. It would then be moved to the state's senate.\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Daniel Bases and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-16T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-16T01:07:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
