REUTERS/Tilman Blasshofer The regional STOXX 600 benchmark fell 0.7 percent to its lowest level since February 2017, having earlier gained as much as 0.6 percent following reports the United States and China had quietly started negotiations to improve U.S. access to Chinese markets.\n“Exemptions on steel/aluminium tariffs have already been granted for other important trade partners, which suggests the U.S. president is using this approach more for negotiating leverage rather than any real intention to start a global trade war”, said Accendo Markets head of research Mike van Dulken. He noted that China’s response so far was “measured” and “nuanced”.\nEuropean equity markets however slipped into negative territory as the euro gained further strength. Traders said sentiment was also dented by growing diplomatic tensions between Western countries and Russia.\n“Despite a bright opening in the U.S. with Wall Street seeing early gains of over 1.5 percent, increased geopolitical tensions with Russia ensured that volatility was alive and kicking,” said Fiona Cincotta, Senior Market Analyst at City Index.\nThe United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain that they have blamed on Moscow.\nA sales trader at a European brokerage however said he did not see how these tensions could have any big impact on global economic growth.\nStocks exposed to Russia were mixed. Raiffeisen ( RBIV.VI ) rose 2.5 percent, helped by a price target upgrade at Deutsche Bank, while Renault ( RENA.PA ) gained 0.3 percent, Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ) slipped 0.5 percent, and Buzzi Unicem ( BZU.MI ) dropped 3.2 percent.\nAmong other European benchmarks, Spain's IBEX .IBEX dipped only 0.1 percent, after the country's second ratings upgrade of the year led to a further outperformance of its bond market over euro zone peers.\nItaly's FTSE MIB .FTMIB underperformed, down 1.2 percent, as speculation grows the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and anti-migrant League might explore an alliance to form a government.\nThe political uncertainty triggered a rise in Italian bond yields.\nItalian banks, widely used as proxies to trade political risk in the country, fell 1.7 percent.\nElsewhere, Fresnillo ( FRES.L ) rose 4.6 percent to lead gainers on the STOXX after an upgrade to “buy” from Goldman Sachs, which also added the miner to its “conviction list”.\nOther top gainers were Zurich Insurance ( ZURN.S ) and Indivior ( INDV.L ), both up more than 3 percent.\nSmurfit Kappa ( SKG.I ) fell 3.4 percent after it rejected a revised takeover offer from International Paper.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni; Additional reporting by Julien Ponthus; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-27T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T19:43:04.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
