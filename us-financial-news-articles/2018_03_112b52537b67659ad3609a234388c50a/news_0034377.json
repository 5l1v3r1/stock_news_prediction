Tech companies have healthy cash flow on their balance sheets because they’re under-leveraged. \n“For all of it, the valuation is not excessive,” he said during a presentation at the conference, though he added that U.S. tech stocks are more “overbought” than their global peers. \nHe added that he is, however, worried about data protection laws that could limit the competitive advantage of tech companies, as well as taxes imposed on digital services. \nBut advances in tech don’t benefit only companies in the sector — it’s good news for the stock market in general, because it leads to more productive use of capital and resources, he said.
