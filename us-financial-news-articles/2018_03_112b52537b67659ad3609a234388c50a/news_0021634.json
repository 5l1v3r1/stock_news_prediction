(“Gran Tierra”) (NYSE American:GTE) (NYSE MKT:GTE) (TSX:GTE), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia today announces that it has received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (“ TSX ”) to implement its previously announced normal course issuer bid (the “ Bid ”) through the facilities of the TSX. Pursuant to the Bid, Gran Tierra is able to purchase for cancellation up to 5% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “ Shares ”) for a one year period at prevailing market prices. The brokerage firm conducting the Bid on behalf of Gran Tierra is Eight Capital.\nUnder the Bid, Gran Tierra may repurchase for cancellation up to 19,269,732 Shares.

These purchases will be made in accordance with applicable regulations over a maximum period of one year beginning on March 12, 2018 and ending on March 11, 2019.

The consideration that Gran Tierra will pay for any Shares acquired by it under the Bid will be paid in cash at the market price of such Shares at the time of acquisition.\nManagement of Gran Tierra believes that the Shares, at times, have been trading in a price range which does not adequately reflect their value in relation to Gran Tierra’s current operations, growth prospects and financial position.
