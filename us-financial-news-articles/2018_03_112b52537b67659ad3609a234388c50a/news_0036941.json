And the privacy violations there are significant,” Sen. Jeff Flake, R., Ariz., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an appearance on CNN. “So, the question is, who knew it?

Damian Collins, the U.K. lawmaker who chairs a parliamentary committee on media and culture, said he intended to ask Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the group, or send a senior executive to do so, as part of its inquiry into how social-media manipulation affected Britain’s referendum decision to exit from the European Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-18T21:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T01:47:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
