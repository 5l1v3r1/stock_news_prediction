If anything, these markets are indicating a surfeit of dollars with currency swaps in yen and euros at five-year highs.\nThis is due to increased regulations forcing global banks to keep more reserves and because banks anticipated the increased issuance of U.S. Treasury bills and secured dollars early.\n3/ Corporates\nInstead of seeking dollars in U.S. money markets to fund their international operations, European corporates could issue more dollar-denominated debt at home.\nWith Libor, a reference rate for $200 trillion worth of dollar-denominated financial products, at its highest since 2008, analysts say a pick-up in dollar-denominated bond issuance by European corporates, especially banks, may follow.\nThis week has seen HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, and Germany’s NRW Bank issue dollar-denominated debt.\nA surge in outstanding U.S. Treasury bills to a record $2.3 trillion has also put upward pressure on short-dated U.S. bond yields - something analysts say is crowding out money market funding and forcing issuers of commercial paper to offer higher spreads amid generally rising rates.\nThis impacts the Libor fixing as commercial paper rates are taken into consideration by the panel of banks for Libor Quote: s.\n“If the Libor/OIS spread stays as it is, we will see quite a big move higher in the dollar index and then dollar borrowing for foreign investors becomes more expensive,” Mike Riddell, a fund manager with Allianz Global Investors, said.\n4/ Central banks\nOne concern is that higher U.S. borrowing costs, if they persist, could tighten financial conditions and potentially reduce how aggressively the Federal Reserve raises rates.\nThe same could be true for the euro area as tighter U.S. financial conditions spill over into Europe, possibly delaying the European Central Bank’s timeline to exit stimulus. A firm euro has already contributed to tightening euro zone financial conditions faster than the ECB would like.\n“The longer it goes on, the more pronounced the effects are going to be,” said Charlie Diebel, head of rates at Aviva Investors. “It complicates the efforts of policymakers because in Europe we still have QE (quantitative easing), but we have some sort of tightening coming at the same time.”\nIndeed, Commerzbank says the sharp rise in dollar Libor rates could be seen as one additional rate hike since the Fed’s December meeting.\n5/ U.S. dollar\nCitibank says the dollar-Libor/OIS spread has in recent years proved a good leading indicator for the dollar index, which measures the greenback’s performance against other major currencies. Wider spreads tend to lead to a stronger dollar, with a three-month timelag.\n“We are still forecasting dollar weakness on fundamental grounds – together with almost everyone else,” the bank said. “But if dollar liquidity tightening does lead to a stronger dollar, all of these processes have the ability in principle to run in reverse.”\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee and Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Sujata Rao and Abhinav Ramnarayan; graphics by Ritvik Carvalho and Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-26T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-26T04:43:12.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
