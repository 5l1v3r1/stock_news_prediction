Another activist investor, Marcato Capital, has also pushed the company to sell itself.\nLast month, Rent-A-Center said it would nominate an independent director to its board recommended by Engaged.\nRent-A-Center has been exploring strategic options since October last year. Its top management, including its chief executive, chairman and chief operating officer have all stepped down since then.\nThe companyâ€™s shares rose 8.5 percent to $8.30 in after-hours trading. Rent-A-Center was valued at about $409 million as of Wednesday.\nThe job cuts, along with other cost-cutting measures, are expected to save the company $28 million annually.\nRent-A-Center, which has seen eight straight quarters of falling sales, had about 18,300 employees, according to its latest annual report.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-08T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-08T00:54:36.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
