Dannel Malloy’s choice to lead the state Supreme Court, Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday asked their GOP colleagues to reconsider their vote.\nState Sen. Martin Looney, the top-ranking Democrat in the chamber, called on at least one of the 19 lawmakers that voted against confirming Justice Andrew McDonald as chief justice of the state’s highest court to have a change of heart. That would effectively cancel the entire vote under Connecticut Senate rules.\nEighteen Republicans and one Democratic senator voted no on elevating Justice McDonald, who has served on the state Supreme Court since 2013, to the top spot.\n“The commentary that we have seen both before and since that vote yesterday from the legal community, from the scholarly community, from all those that care about Connecticut’s judicial system, indicate that was a grave, grave mistake,” Mr. Looney said at news conference. Justice McDonald’s rejection “is dangerous to the traditions we have had in Connecticut of a strongly independent judiciary,” he said.\nGOP leaders called Justice McDonald a judicial activist and objected to his nomination because they say his personal views influence his decisions as a judge. Mr. Looney said Justice McDonald is qualified for the position and was unduly denied confirmation.\n“The State Senate already voted on this issue,” said State Sen. Len Fasano, the chamber’s top-ranking Republican. “Both Republicans and Democrats voted against the governor’s nominee. The vote is done. I look forward to learning who Gov. Malloy will nominate next.”\nThe GOP’s actions undermine years of precedent in which nominees were judged based on their qualifications, not their perceived political views, Mr. Malloy said in a written statement.\n“Senate Democrats should be commended for their efforts to reconsider this backwards and harmful decision by their Republican colleagues,” Mr. Malloy said.\nDemocratic leaders said they would send a letter and call those that voted against Justice McDonald in hopes of persuading them to reconsider. Mr. Looney acknowledged these efforts would likely be unsuccessful.\n“It’s critical that we do this because of the extraordinary harm done to the judiciary yesterday,” Mr. Looney said.\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T00:05:18.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
