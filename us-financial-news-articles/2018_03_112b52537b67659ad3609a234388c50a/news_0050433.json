It was the biggest audience for “60 Minutes” since a Nov. 16, 2008 post-election interview with Barack and Michelle Obama.\nShah, asked whether Trump believed Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was threatened, said, “No, he does not.”\n“There’s nothing to corroborate her claim,” the spokesman said.\nHe said Trump had “consistently denied these allegations” of a sexual relationship with Daniels.\nThe TV appearance by Daniels, who is suing Trump over the matter, also prompted a denial from the president’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, that the attorney was involved in the alleged threat against Daniels, in a “cease-and-desist” letter sent shortly after the interview aired.\nA copy of the letter, sent to Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, by Cohen’s attorney, Brent Blakely, was seen by Reuters on Monday.\n“Mr. Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,” the letter said.\nDaniels had implied Cohen was behind the threat of harm if she did not “leave Trump alone,” which she said was made by a stranger in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011.\nThe letter also demanded “that you immediately retract and apologize to Mr. Cohen through the national media for your defamatory statements on ‘60 Minutes,’ and make clear that you have no facts or evidence whatsoever to support your allegations that my client had anything whatsoever to do with this alleged thug.”\nDaniels sued Trump on March 6, saying he never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an “intimate” relationship between them in 2006.\nDaniels attorney Avenatti said on NBC on Monday morning that the man who threatened his client while she was with her infant daughter was not Cohen but that “it had to be someone that is related to Mr. Trump or Mr. Cohen.”\nThe “60 Minutes” segment followed an interview aired last week on CNN with former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who described a 10-month-long affair with Trump starting in 2006.\nTrump would have been married to his wife, Melania, during both alleged relationships.\nIn addition to repeatedly denying that Trump had sex with Daniels, the White House has said he denies having an affair with McDougal.\nCohen said he paid Daniels $130,000 of his own money during the 2016 presidential campaign, but has not explained why or if Trump was aware of the payment.\nIn filings with the Justice Department and Federal Election Commission, watchdog groups have said the payment amount may have exceeded campaign-contribution limits and violated U.S. law.
