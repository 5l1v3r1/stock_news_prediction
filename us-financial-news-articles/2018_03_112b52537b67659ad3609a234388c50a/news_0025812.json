International parties should call (719) 457-0820 and enter conference code 9186776.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense, litigation-related costs, amortization of intangible assets acquired, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes and related tax effects. Coupa believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance and regularly reviews these measures as it evaluates its business.\nCoupa believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors and other users of its financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of operations. Coupa believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry, as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nCoupa uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of its overall assessment of its performance, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its board of directors concerning its financial performance. The definitions of its non-GAAP measures may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, Coupa’s non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCoupa compensates for these limitations by providing investors and other users of its financial information a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP financial measures. Coupa encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view its non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures attached to this release.\nWith respect to Coupa’s guidance as provided under “Business Outlook” above, Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP loss from operations to GAAP loss from operations or non-GAAP net loss per share to GAAP net loss per share because certain items excluded from non-GAAP operating loss and net loss, such as charges related to share-based compensation expense, litigation-related costs, amortization of intangible assets acquired, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes, and related tax effects, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these excluded items may be significant.\nWe also use key metrics such as cumulative spend under management, which represents the aggregate amount of money that has been transacted through our core Coupa platform for all of our customers collectively since we launched our platform. We calculate this metric by aggregating the actual transaction data, such as invoices, purchase orders and expenses, from customers on our core Coupa platform. While we do not believe this metric is directly correlated to our financial results, we believe the adoption of our core platform, as evidenced by growth in cumulative spend under management, drives additional value to our customers, which will enhance our ability to acquire new customers and to increase renewals and upsells to existing customers.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis release includes . All statements other than statements of historical facts, including the statements of management and statements in “Business Outlook\" are . These are based on Coupa’s current expectations and projections about future events and trends that Coupa believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, strategy, short- and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs.\nThese are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially, including: Coupa has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict its future operating results; if Coupa is unable to attract new customers, the growth of its revenues will be adversely affected; because its platform is sold to large enterprises with complex operating environments, Coupa encounters long and unpredictable sales cycles; risks and liabilities related to breach of its security measures or unauthorized access to customer data; the markets in which Coupa participates are intensely competitive; Coupa’s business depends substantially on its customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional subscriptions; if Coupa fails to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, its business may suffer; and if Coupa fails to manage its recent rapid growth effectively, Coupa may be unable to execute its business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nThese and other risks and uncertainties that could affect Coupa’s future results are included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Coupa’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on December 7, 2017, which is available at investors.coupa.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Further information on potential risks that could affect actual results will be included in other periodic filings Coupa makes with the SEC.\nThe in this release reflect Coupa’s expectations as of March 12, 2018. Coupa undertakes no obligation to update publicly any for any reason after the date of this release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in its expectations.\nAbout Coupa Software\nCoupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) is the cloud platform for business spend.
