If passed by the House of Representatives and Senate by a Friday midnight deadline, it would avert the shutdown of many federal agencies and programs beginning this weekend, when existing funds expire. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House indicated Trump would support the measure, ending a prolonged debate over spending priorities for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1. The Republican-controlled Congress will need Democratic support to pass a bill that many Republican conservatives are likely to balk at because of its cost. Representative Mark Walker, who heads a large group of House conservative Republicans, complained that the bill will add to budget deficits. “It is imperative that we curb Washington’s out-of-control spending addiction that has not been slowed under Republican rule,” Walker said. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer touted the measure. “From opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first,” he said in a statement. Trump at one point wanted $25 billion included in the bill to fully fund construction of his proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall, but negotiations with Democrats to make that happen fell apart early this week, according to congressional aides.

Republicans said that money will help with more than 90 miles of “physical barrier construction” along the southern U.S. border “for replacement (of existing barriers), bollards, and levee improvements.” Democrats said the money would not be used for any new concrete wall.

It would also include new money for infrastructure, combating Russian election hacking [nL1N1R31BT] and some modest gun legislation following a series of mass shootings at American schools, churches and other public spaces.
