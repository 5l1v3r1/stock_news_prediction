The benchmark has posted a decline of 4.3 percent for the month, its biggest since January 2016 and its third straight monthly loss. \nAustralian and New Zealand markets are closed on Friday and Monday for public holidays. \nA fall in iron ore prices led to weakness in material stocks, especially miners, with the Australian metals and mining index declining 1.2 percent to its lowest in more than three months. \nGlobal miner BHP slipped 1.6 percent, while its rival Rio Tinto Ltd slid 0.9 percent, both closing at their lowest in three months. \nConsumer staples were also under pressure, with Australian-listed shares of dairy firm a2 Milk Company Ltd leading the losses, touching a five-week closing low, down nearly 5 percent. \nNestle, the world's biggest packaged food maker, launched a brand of infant formula that uses the protein made popular by a2 Milk Company, The New Zealand Herald reported.
