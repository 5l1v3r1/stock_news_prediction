We will intensify consultations with our partners.”\nThe law has been in the works for years and is seen as key to attracting more investment but no draft or details have been presented yet.\nIn the latest bidding round in 2014, Algeria awarded only four of 31 blocks on offer after a disappointing auction in 2011 as foreign firms balked at the terms.\nAlgeria was already preparing to exploit shale gas to boost output after failed attempts in the past years due to protests by residents of affected areas over fears of pollution.\n“Evaluation studies on shale gas potential are going on. This will take 5 to 10 years,” he said, without providing further details.\nArezki Hocini, the head of the National Agency for the Valorization of Hydrocarbon Resources (Almaty), said Algeria had already started discussions with oil majors including BP and Anadarko to help evaluate and exploit shale gas.\n“We hope these discussions will lead to talks over possible contracts,” he told reporters, without providing details.\nWhile seeking to attract foreign investors state-run oil and gas company Sonatrach is also trying to expand abroad, mainly in the Middle East, Guitouni said.\n“Egypt is interested in working with us,” he said, without elaborating.\nSonatrach earlier this year signed an agreement with Iraqi companies to form joint ventures for gas projects.\nSonatrach had already started operations in Peru and neighbouring Libya, Niger and Mali.\nAlgeria has been talking for years about opening up the energy sector but some in the political elite have resisted this.\nEditing by Ulf Laessing and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T19:08:42.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
