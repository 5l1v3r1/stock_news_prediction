Maintenance therapy immediately follows initial treatment to keep patients cancer-free if they go into remission.\nThe company said on Tuesday the drug was also approved for shorter 30-minute infusions, reducing previous infusion time in half.\n“Cutting the number of infusions in half with the four-week dosing schedule provides meaningful benefit to patients and reduces the burden at infusion centers,” said Phipps.\nThe analyst added that Bristol-Myers is testing Opdivo in nine late-stage adjuvant trials and as maintenance therapy in small-cell lung cancer.\nOther PD-1 inhibitors include drugs from rivals such as Merck & Co and Roche.\nThe FDA decision makes Opdivo the only PD-1 inhibitor to offer every four-week dosing, according to the company.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T20:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T14:47:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
