This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the prospectus, which can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor or visiting www.griffincapital.com . The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.\nGriffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund Risk Considerations\nAs of February 28, 2018 the Fund's annualized return since inception for Class A shares was 6.80%. The Fund's inception date was 6/30/14. The total gross expense ratio is 2.30% for Class A, 3.05% for Class C, 2.04% for Class I, 2.46% for Class L, and 2.73% for Class M. Performance data Quote: d represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and investment returns and principal value of the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data Quote: d. The maximum sales charge is 5.75% for Class A shares and 4.25% for Class L shares. Class C shareholders may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge equal to 1.00% of the original purchase price of Class C shares redeemed during the first 365 days after their purchase. The Fund has contractually agreed to waive its fees to the extent that they exceed 1.91% for Class A, 2.66% for Class C, 1.66% for Class I, 2.16% for Class L, and 2.41% for Class M until February 1, 2019. Without the waiver the expenses would have been higher. The Fund return does not reflect the deduction of all fees and if the fund return reflected the deduction of such fees, the performance would be lower. Visit www.griffincapital.com for current performance.\nDistribution Policy Risk\nThe Fund's distribution policy is to make quarterly distributions to shareholders. Distribution includes a return of capital (i.e., from your original investment) and not a return of profit. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Fund is net profit. Shareholders should note that return of capital will reduce the tax basis of their shares and potentially increase the taxable gain, if any, upon disposition of their shares. Sources of distributions to shareholders for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Pursuant to Section 852 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxability of distributions will be reported on Form 1099-DIV.\nThe Fund distribution rate is the amount, expressed as a percentage, a Fund investor would receive in distributions if the most recent Fund distribution stayed consistent going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent Fund distribution yield. The percentage represents a single distribution from the Fund and does not represent the total return of the Fund. A copy of the Fund’s distribution statement pursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 is available at: https://www.griffincapital.com/griffin-institutional-access-real-estate-fund/forms-and-literature .\nThe Fund will not invest in real estate directly, but, because the Fund will concentrate its investments in securities of REITs and other real estate industry issuers, its portfolio will be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market and may experience more volatility and be exposed to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio. The value of companies engaged in the real estate industry is affected by: (i) changes in general economic and market conditions; (ii) changes in the value of real estate properties; (iii) risks related to local economic conditions, overbuilding and increased competition; (iv) increases in property taxes and operating expenses; (v) changes in zoning laws; (vi) casualty and condemnation losses; (vii) variations in rental income, neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants; (viii) the availability of financing and (ix) changes in interest rates and leverage.\nInvestors in the Fund should understand that the NAV of the Fund will fluctuate, which may result in a loss of the principal amount invested. The Fund provides liquidity to shareholders quarterly between 5% and 25% of its outstanding shares at net asset value.\nGriffin Institutional Access Real Estate Fund is distributed by ALPS Distributors, Inc.
