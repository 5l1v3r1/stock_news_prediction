The Fed is widely expected to raise rates at its two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday, with the focus mainly on Chairman Jerome Powell's commentary the next day, which may provide hints on the number of rate increases for the rest of the year. Most investors have already adjusted their positions into fixed income assets, said Rachelle Cruz, the head of research at AP Securities in the Philippines. Broader Asian shares outside Japan firmed 0.4 percent. Singapore shares inched 0.2 percent higher, led by financials. United Overseas Bank Ltd contributed the most to the benchmark, rising 1.2 percent. Indonesian shares gained 0.6 percent, helped by consumer staples and materials, and was on track to break a six-session losing streak. The index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks also firmed 0.6 percent. Malaysian shares gained 0.3 percent, as financials and consumer staples rose. DiGi.Com Bhd gained as much as 2.4 percent. Vietnam shares rose 0.8 percent and were on track for an eighth straight winning session on strength in real estate stocks and financials. Philippine shares were the region's only losers, retreating 1 percent. Financials and industrials weighed the most on the benchmark, which fell below the 8,000 mark to the lowest since early September. BDO Unibank Inc fell as much as 4.4 percent, the steepest intraday percentage drop since September 2016. The Philippine central bank's reticence to raise rates puts the country at a significant disadvantage if the peso weakens after a potential rate raise by the Fed, analysts say. \"Companies suffering in terms of margins would be consumer companies as a lot of their products are imported from other countries,\" said AP Securities' Cruz.
