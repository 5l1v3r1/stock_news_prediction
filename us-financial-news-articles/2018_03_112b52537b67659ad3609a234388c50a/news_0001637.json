The CNBV did not provide details about the sanctioned trades besides listing the date of Dec. 28, 2011 in the limited information on its website. Alfa investor relations manager Juan Martin declined to comment. Leal Chapa, who joined Alfa in 2009, did not respond to a message sent via Linkedin on Thursday.
