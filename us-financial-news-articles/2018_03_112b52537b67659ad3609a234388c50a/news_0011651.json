It made up 7 percent of William Hill’s total revenue and nearly 6 percent of adjusted operating profit in 2017.\nThe company said in January it was reviewing options for the Australia business after the unit’s profits came under pressure following a ban on credit betting and the likely introduction of a point of consumption tax in some states.\nHowever, the retreat from Australia could raise further questions about the future of William Hill, which has missed out on a round of consolidation in its home British market.\nThe company said in November it was in “very preliminary discussions” with CrownBet, which is partly owned by Canada’s Stars Group Inc ( TSGI.TO ), about a possible combination with its Australian business.\nProceeds from the sale will be partly used to pay down debt, William Hill said.\nReporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-06T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-06T10:49:41.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
