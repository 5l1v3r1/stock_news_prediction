That was below the 40.4 percent who do not support Abe. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe waits for Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena in Tokyo, Japan March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Pool Abe and his finance minister, Taro Aso, 77, have been under fire since the finance ministry admitted on March 12 that it had altered records relating to a discount sale of state-owned land to school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which had ties to Abe’s wife, Akie.
