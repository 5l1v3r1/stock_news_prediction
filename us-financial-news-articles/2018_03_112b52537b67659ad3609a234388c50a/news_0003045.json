She says she loves playing with an opponent who can give her a really tough time.

They are being trained by Pakistan’s former international chess master Shahzad Mirza, a keen promoter of the game in schools across the country, better known for its love of cricket.\nMost of the girls can outshine men in national tournaments, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“These girls have won the top five positions so many times, I’ve lost count,” he said with pride.\nAll girls chess team of SMB Fatima Jinnah Government Girls School, in Karachi, Pakistan.
