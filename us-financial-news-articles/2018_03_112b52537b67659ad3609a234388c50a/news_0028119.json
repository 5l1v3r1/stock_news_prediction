Selnick most recently served as Chief Financial Officer and on the Board of Directors of Electric Lightwave, a private equity sponsored telecom infrastructure business, prior to its acquisition for $1.4B in 2017.\n\"We are thrilled Jesse is joining Sight Sciences, as this is the perfect time in our corporate evolution to add someone with his strategic, financial and operational background. Jesse has a long and proven track record of operating and advising rapidly growing technology businesses to achieve scale and maximize value,\" said Paul Badawi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sight Sciences. \"Importantly, Jesse has been involved in our company's early development as a founding investor and is very familiar with our business.
