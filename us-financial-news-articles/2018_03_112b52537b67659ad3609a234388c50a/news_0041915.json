The Portfolio comprises a mix of narrowbody and twin-aisle aircraft leased to 30 lessees based in 19 countries. As at 9 February 2018, the Portfolio had an average weighted age of 12 years. Avolon will act as servicer with respect to the Portfolio and any additional aircraft acquired by the Issuers.\nDómhnal Slattery, CEO Avolon commented: \"The disposal of 41 aircraft from the Avolon fleet, facilitated by the launch of the Sapphire vehicle, opens another channel for Avolon to bring third party investment into the mid-life aircraft space whilst increasing our managed fleet, and expanding our footprint as a servicer in the ABS market.”\nWells Fargo acted as Sole Structuring Agent, Sole E Note Placement Agent and Joint Bookrunner. BNP Paribas and Crédit Agricole also acted as Joint Bookrunners for the transaction. BNP Paribas was the Liquidity Facility provider to the Issuers.\nClifford Chance advised Avolon and the Issuers, and Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP acted as counsel to the Joint Lead Structuring Agents.\nThe Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act“), and were offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under the Securities Act except pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act or in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
