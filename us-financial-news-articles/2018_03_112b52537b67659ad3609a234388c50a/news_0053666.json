The stock later pared its loses and was down 4.2 percent in afternoon trading.\nShares of automaker Tesla slumped 8.1 percent, extending recent losses, following a credit downgrade and news that officials are investigating a fatal crash and fire in California.\nCountering those losses were gains for defensive sectors such as consumer staples, real estate, and telecom .\nThe U.S. economy slowed less than previously expected in the final months of 2017 as consumer spending saw its biggest quarterly gain in three years. GDP expanded at an 2.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2017, ahead of the previously reported 2.5 percent, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.\nRobust economic data could open the door to more aggressive interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year.\n“I think there is general consensus that the economy is doing good and that number proves it, but it’s always difficult to know what’s already in the stock market versus what people are anticipating,” said Tuz. “I get the sense that people are nervous right now.”\nStocks had shot up earlier in the week as comments from officials in United States and China implied the world’s two largest economies would renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances, averting a dreaded trade war.\nChina is due to announce a list of tariffs on U.S. exports to China in a tit-for-tat retaliation against the expected tariff proposals from the U.S. on Chinese imports.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
