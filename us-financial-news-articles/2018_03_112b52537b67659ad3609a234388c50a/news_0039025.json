We have a small team that is looking at it. The core blockchain technology is not something that is super-scalable in terms of the sheer number of transactions it can run,\" he told an audience at the Advertising Week Europe conference in London, as part of a question-and-answer session on Wednesday. \nRamaswamy added that the \"frictionless\" nature of the technology has applications in money transfer. \"The promise of blockchain of course is twofold: one is friction-free value transfer, you can think of it as money transfer working at scale with no friction and that can have an amazing effect on society, because it's hard to move money. It always costs 2ish percent in most Western countries to move money,\" he said. show chapters 7:59 AM ET Tue, 20 March 2018 | 04:52 \n\"I think there is a lot of promise in things like that. Blockchain as a recording technology also has promise. It is super early for us to say whether they are going to become products just yet. We are actively looking at it. We don't have really any product announcements to make on this front.\" \nGoogle's parent company Alphabet is one of the most active investors in blockchain companies, according to a report published by CB Insights in October. It has investments in the Blockchain company itself, as well as in Ripple, a company that is working on money transfers using blockchain technology. \nRamaswamy's comments come as advertising agency Truth announced it had run a programmatic media campaign enabled by blockchain, working with The Guardian newspaper, demand-side platform Avocet and ad tech company Sonobi.

Fraud in digital advertising has been in the spotlight recently, because of the possibility that campaigns are seen or clicked on by bots rather than humans , and for being placed next to inappropriate content. \nSouthgate said that advertisers would be able to see within 24 hours whether their ads had been placed correctly, rather than having to wait for media audits that can take months. He added that the agency's technology was at an early stage. \nBlockchain is a new foundational technology that allows businesses to simplify processes such as auditing. Cryptocurrency bitcoin is an application that is built on blockchain technology, similar to how email was the breakthrough application that was built on the internet. \nAdditional reporting by Arjun Kharpal.
