She said \"everyone knows\" about the country's unfair trade practices.\nBut fears of trade wars quickly sent market watchers into a panic after last week's news, sparking sell-offs.\nLaVorgna argued that the recent volatility in the market is more likely a fear of the Fed and the possibility of four or more rate hikes this year.\nStill, Swonk said, \"retaliation is real.\"\n\"The politics are one thing; the economics are another,\" Swonk said.\nThe possibility of a trade war, she said, creates uncertainty and undermines the incentive for corporations to invest, which was the original intent of the new tax policy.\nSwonk said many of her commercial real estate clients have expressed concern over the tariffs. Caps on investments from Chinese investors would have dramatic \"ripple effects\" in regional economies such as San Francisco , Atlanta and New York. Other sectors that could be affected include consumer goods, retail and higher education, she said.\n\"I don't think we're going to see China stand idly by and deal with this,\" Swonk said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-15T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-15T23:31:32.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
