Earlier this year, it rolled out a \"Style My Hair\" application developed with ModiFace allowing people to see how they would look with different coloured dyes.\nModiFace's technology also extends to services such as skin diagnosis.\nL'Oreal now spends 38 percent of its media budget on digital campaigns. It has also launched programmes to collaborate with start-ups in cities such as Paris, London and San Francisco.
