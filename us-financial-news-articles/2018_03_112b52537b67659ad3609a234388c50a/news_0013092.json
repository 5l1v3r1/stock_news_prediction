His election triggered a crash in the peso currency that helped fuel inflation.\nAfter a series of interest rate hikes to contain price rises, Banco de Mexico raised the key rate by another 25 basis points to 7.50 percent on Feb. 8, the highest since February 2009.\nThe unadjusted index was 82.0 during the month, down from 84.2 percent in January.
