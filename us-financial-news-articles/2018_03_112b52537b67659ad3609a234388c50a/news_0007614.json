But although the total numbers of the super-rich in the two government bodies was down, their combined wealth at 4.12 trillion yuan was nearly 18 percent higher than the total wealth of rich lawmakers last year.\nThe strong property market boosted the wealth of a number of representatives, including Xu Jiayin, chairman of developer China Evergrande Group, whose net worth leapt 242 percent to 260 billion yuan.\nThose making their first appearance as lawmakers include leaders of some of China’s big internet firms such as Netease Chief Executive William Ding, JD.com Chairman Richard Liu, and security software company Qihoo’s CEO, Zhou Hongyi.\nThe NPC and CPPCC start their annual sessions in Beijing next week. While all Chinese over the age of 18 are technically allowed to vote for delegates and stand for election to the NPC, most delegates are hand-picked by local-level officials.\n$1 = 6.3520 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-02T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-02T19:46:34.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
