He was only saved by a stab-proof vest,” the spokesman said, adding that the two men ended up grappling on the ground.\n“The soldier defended himself well and was then able to reach for his service weapon and fire shots,” he added.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Neil Fullick\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-12T07:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-12T08:54:43.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
