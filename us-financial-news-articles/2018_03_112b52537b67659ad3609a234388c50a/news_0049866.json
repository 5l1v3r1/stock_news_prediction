(NASDAQ: OBAS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues from fixed income real estate totaled $4.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to revenues of $4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss attributable to Optibase Ltd shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $518,000 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share compared to net loss of $1.6 million or $0.31 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues totaled $16.6 million, compared with $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss attributable to Optibase Ltd. Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.1 million or $0.22 per share, compared to a net income of $195,000 or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWeighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were approximately 5.2 million and 5.1 million basic and diluted shares, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.3 million, and shareholders' equity of $77.1 million, compared with $16 million, and $74.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.\nAmir Philips, Chief Executive Officer of Optibase commented on the fourth quarter results: \"We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance maintaining stability, mostly in our fixed income real estate rent and operating income. Our yearly results are showing a net loss that is attributed mainly to equity share in losses of associates related to the investment in 300 River Holdings, LLC, which beneficially owns the rights to a 23-story Class A office building located at 300 South Riverside Plaza in Chicago, IL. While our NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 increase to $13.5 million and by 2.7% over the same period in 2016, our recurring FFO decreased to $4 million and by 13.4% over the same period in 2016. The decrease in recurring FFO is primarily due to equity share in losses of associates related to the investment in 300 River Holdings, LLC. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our NOI increase to $3.4 million and our Recurring FFO increased to $1.9 million.\" Mr. Philips concluded: \"We will continue our work to maintain our basic parameters as we progress through 2018.\"\nACCOUNTING AND OTHER DISCLOSURES\nNon-GAAP Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income, which, to calculate NOI, is adjusted to add back real estate depreciation, and amortization, general and administrative expenses and other operation expenses less gain on sale of operating properties. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe that NOI (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense item that are incurred at the property level.\nWe consider the NOI to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, to understand the core property operations prior to depreciation and amortization expenses and general and administrative costs. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, we consider the NOI to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets.\nThe metric NOI should only be considered as supplemental to the metric operating income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. NOI should also not be used as a supplement to, or substitute for, cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States).\nNon-GAAP Funds from operation, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income, which, to calculate FFO, is adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated associates. We make certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Non-GAAP recurring FFO or recurring FFO, to account for items we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, including transaction costs associated with acquisitions. We use FFO internally as a performance measure and we believe FFO (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) is a useful, supplemental measure of our operating performance as it's a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry. We also believe that Recurring FFO is a useful, supplemental measure of our core operating performance. The company believes that financial analysts, investors and shareholders are better served by the presentation of operating results generated from its FFO and Recurring FFO measures.\nWe consider the FFO and Recurring FFO to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, in analyzing our operating performance.\nThe metric's FFO and Recurring FFO should only be considered as supplemental to the metric net income as a measure of our performance. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, (ii) is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions, (iii) is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and (iv) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP (Unaudited) Supplemental Financial Data\nA reconciliation of operating income to NOI is as follows:\nYear ended\nThree months ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n$\n$\n$\n$\nAudited\nAudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nGAAP Operating income\n6,623\n6,320\n1,667\n1,272\nAdjustments:\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n4,209\n4,244\n995\n1,045\nGeneral and administrative\n2,698\n2,615\n738\n870\nNon-GAAP Net Operating Income NOI\n13,530\n13,179\n3,400\n3,187\nA reconciliation of net income to FFO and Recurring FFO is as follows:\nYear ended\nThree months ended\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\nDecember 31\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n$\n$\n$\n$\nAudited\nAudited\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nGAAP Net income (loss) attributable to Optibase LTD\n(1,123)\n195\n(518)\n(1,572)\nAdjustments :\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n4,209\n4,244\n995\n1,045\nProrata share of real estate depreciation and\namortization from unconsolidated associates\n2,022\n1,282\n1,705 (*)\n110\nNon-controlling interests share in the above\nadjustments\n(1,141)\n(1,142)\n(280)\n(281)\nNon-GAAP Fund From Operation (FFO))\n3,967\n4,579\n1,902\n(698)\nNon-GAAP Recurring Fund From Operation\n(Recurring FFO)\n3,967\n4,579\n1,902\n(698)\nAmounts in thousands\n(*) include adjustment related to previous quarters in 2017\nAbout Optibase\nOptibase invests in the fixed-income real estate field and currently holds properties and beneficial interest in real-estate assets and projects in Switzerland, Germany and in Texas, Philadelphia, PA and Miami, FL, Chicago, IL, USA and is currently looking for additional real estate investment opportunities.
