The mills in Ibred and Novlyanka are located near major customers in the Russian food and beverage industry, ADM said.\nThe deal helps Chicago-based ADM expand its sweetener and starches operations as a global oversupply of food commodities is making it tough for agricultural merchants to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing and selling corn, soy and wheat.\nMergers, acquisitions and partnerships are seen as potential remedies for the glut if they open up new markets or help merchants operate more efficiently.\nOn Monday, ADM said it agreed to form a soybean joint venture in Egypt with rival Cargill Inc [CARG.UL].\nIn January, a source said ADM had approached rival Bunge Ltd ( BG.N ) about a takeover. The companies have declined to comment on the matter.\nADM, Bunge, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co together are known as the “ABCDs” and dominate the grain industry.\nReporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T16:22:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
