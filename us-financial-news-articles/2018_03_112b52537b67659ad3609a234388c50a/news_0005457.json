One of the detained people was the driver of a truck which had transported a double-floor container that concealed 528 numbered packages to a warehouse.\n“The state police is determined to strike with the power of the law at every criminal activity to build a calmer and safer Albania,” they said in a statement.\n($1 = 0.8183 euros)\nReporting By Benet Koleka, Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:35:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
