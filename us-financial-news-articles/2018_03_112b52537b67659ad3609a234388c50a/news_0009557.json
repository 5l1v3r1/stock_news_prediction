His subsequent short jumper and another layup gave Chicago its first advantage of the game.\nKris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen bombed in late 3-pointers as the Bulls, who had lost 13 of their previous 15 games, were able to pull away.\nPortis continued a recent scoring flurry with a team-high 22 points for the Bulls, who completed a season-series sweep of the Mavericks. Chicago had won 127-124 at Dallas in January.\nThe 23-year-old reserve has scored in double figures in 11 straight games, a stretch that includes a 38-point explosion against Philadelphia.\nDunn had 18 points and a game-high seven assists, and Zach LaVine added 16 points for the Bulls while both Markkanen (17 points, game-high 12 rebounds) and David Nwaba (10 points, 11 rebounds) recorded double-doubles.\nThe Bulls outshot the Mavericks 47.2 percent to 41.7.\nHarrison Barnes had a game-high 26 points and Dennis Smith Jr. had 25 for the Mavericks, who were playing on the road for the only time bridging two- and four-game homestands.\nDirk Nowitzki bombed in five 3-pointers to account for almost all his 18 points. The Mavericks connected on 13 of their 29 3-point attempts.\nDwight Powell grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds for Dallas.\nBarnes and Smith had four points apiece in the Mavericks’ 10-0, game-opening burst.\nThe Mavericks went on to lead by as many as 11 in the first quarter and by 14 in both the second and third periods before the Bulls rallied.\nChicago outscored Dallas 30-15 over the final 12 minutes.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-03T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-03T17:24:02.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
