The offer was reported earlier by The Washington Post.\nTrump on Tuesday inspected eight wall prototypes constructed in the desert south of San Diego as he fights to overcome opposition from Democrats and skepticism from some Republican lawmakers over the cost of a barrier that was a central promise of his presidential campaign.\nHouse and Senate negotiators are trying to wrap up work on a $1.2 trillion spending bill in order to get it passed by March 23 in order to avert another government shutdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-14T16:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-14T22:23:21.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
