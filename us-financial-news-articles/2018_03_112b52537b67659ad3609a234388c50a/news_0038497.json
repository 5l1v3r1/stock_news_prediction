They’re expected to run until the end of June, though some will conclude earlier as inventories sell out. \nThe mass liquidation event will join the ongoing going-out-of-business sales at 182 stores that began last month. Those locations should be shuttered for good by mid-April \nJoseph Malfitano Partnersan, advisor for the beleaguered retailer who works with liquidation specialist Malfitano, said the sell-off would be “probably the largest retail liquidation in the country’s history.” \nOver four dozen toy manufacturers have objected to the liquidation, saying they are owed some $450 million by Toys ‘R’ Us. \nIronically, the liquidation of Toys ‘R’ Us won’t mean the brand will disappear completely from the U.S. (much like there are s till Blockbuster Video stores scattered here and there ). The company hopes to keep 200 stores open here as part of a deal to sell its Canadian operations.
