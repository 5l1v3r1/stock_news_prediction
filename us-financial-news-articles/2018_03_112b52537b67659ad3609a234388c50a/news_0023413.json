The Department of Justice said the complex money laundering scheme was intended to enrich top-level officials of the fund, including some close to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.\nMoney was diverted from the fund to buy properties in New York and California, a $35 million jet, art by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, and a $260 million yacht.\nProceeds also went to fund movies by Red Granite Pictures, which was co-founded by the stepson of Razak.\nThe funds financed the Martin Scorsese-directed \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" which starred Leonardo DiCaprio in a film about the excesses of a crooked stock trader. The settlement also included forfeiture claims to the rights of \"Dumb and Dumber To\" and \"Daddy's Home.\"\nThe film production company said in a statement that it was happy to put the matter behind it so it could focus on filmmaking.\nThe 1MDB case is the largest single action the Justice Department has taken under efforts to recover foreign bribery proceeds and embezzled funds and several other lawsuits are pending. Other countries including Singapore and Switzerland are conducting probes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-10T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-10T05:52:06.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
