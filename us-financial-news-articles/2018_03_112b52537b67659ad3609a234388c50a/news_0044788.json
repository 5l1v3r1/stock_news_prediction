It gathered responses from 2,237 people and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

(Graphic: Poll data - tmsnrt.rs/2pFHBfN )\nFacebook shares tumbled 14 percent last week, while the hashtag #DeleteFacebook gained traction online and the company’s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, faced demands that he appear before U.S. lawmakers to testify in a hearing.\nZuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said last week that shoring up trust was their priority. “We know this is an issue of trust. We know this is a critical moment for our company,” Sandberg told CNBC on Thursday.\nIt is too early to say if distrust will cause people to step back from Facebook, eMarketer analyst Debra Williamson said. Customers of banks or other industries do not necessarily quit after losing faith, she said.\n“It’s psychologically harder to let go of a platform like Facebook that’s become pretty well ingrained into people’s lives,” she said.\nOne reason that Facebook and other internet companies collect personal information from users is to deliver advertisements for products and services to people who are most likely to want them.\nFILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed Facebook Like symbol is displayed inverted in front of a U.S. flag in this illustration taken, March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Facebook, with more than 2 billion monthly active users, made almost all its $40.6 billion in revenue last year from advertising.\nThe poll found that many people take a dim view of those “targeted” advertisements.\nSome 63 percent said they would like to see “less targeted advertising” in the future, while 9 percent said they wanted more. When asked to compare them with traditional forms of advertising, 41 percent said targeted ads are “worse” while 21 percent said they are “better.”\n“I think they make a lot of assumptions that are not true,” poll respondent Maria Curran, 56, who lives near Manchester, New Hampshire, said in a follow-up interview.\n“It’s like if I show an interest in healthy eating, all of a sudden all of the ads are about weight control and exercise and how to lose weight. I just get inundated,” she said.\nCurran said she knows online retailer Amazon.com also collects her information for targeted marketing, but that it is less annoying because it is a shopping site, not a place for personal conversations.\nAnother poll respondent, Kamaal Greene, 26, said he likes targeted ads better than traditional ones because they provide a service, steering him to products he wants.\n“A while ago I was looking for a special kind of glove for my job,” said Greene, a firefighter from Detroit.\n“I put it in my Amazon cart and forgot about it. Then, later, the ad popped up on ... Facebook, and I was like ‘oh shoot.’ It reminded me and I clicked on it and bought it.”\nA plurality of adults said they would like the government to take a bigger role in overseeing the industry’s handling of user information. According to the poll, 46 percent of adults said they want more government regulation, while 17 percent said they want less. Another 20 percent said they wanted no change, and the remaining 18 percent said they did not know.\nReporting by Chris Kahn in New York and David Ingram in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-25T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-25T15:33:52.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
