Local forces, backed by the UAE member of the Saudi-led coalition drove them out in a series of military operations over the past two years.\nBut militants still operate in remote areas in southeastern Yemen, including in Abyan, Shabwa and al-Bayda.\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which includes the UAE, is fighting in Yemen against Iran-aligned Houthis, who seized large parts of the country in a series of operations that began in late 2014, culminating in forcing the internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee into exile in Saudi Arabia.\nReporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-29T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-29T14:59:20.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
