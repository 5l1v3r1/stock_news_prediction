But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg's secret police.\" \nThe investigative team, headed by Sonya Ahuja — confirmed by her LinkedIn profile — had records of screenshots the employee had taken and links he had visited or even just hovered over. \nThe investigators also indicated they had records of chats between the employee and a journalist. \n\"When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency.
