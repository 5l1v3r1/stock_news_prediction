(NYSE American: BTN), a holding company with diverse business activities focused on serving the cinema, retail, financial, advertising and government markets, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNet revenues were $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $19.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Loss from operations was ($1.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with income from operations of $0.8 million in the same period of the prior year. Net loss from continuing operations was ($1.0) million, or ($0.07) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with net income from continuing operations of $0.4 million, or $0.03 per share, in the same period of the prior year.\nKyle Cerminara, Chairman and CEO of Ballantyne Strong, Inc., commented, “In 2017, we made necessary investments in our systems and internal controls that temporarily increased our general and administrative expenses. We also invested in creating two new businesses, StrongVest and Strong Digital Media, that we believe are pivotal to the future of the company. We launched our first ETF, the CWA Income ETF (BATS: CWAI) and we are approaching the one year anniversary of the fund. In early 2018, we entered the New York City taxi top advertising business through Strong Digital Media and we expect this business to begin generating significant revenue over the next few months. We are continuing to refine our holding company structure and we expect to optimize this structure further in 2018.”\nSegment Organization\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we reorganized our corporate reporting structure and moved the operations of Strong Technical Services, Inc. from the Digital Media segment to the Cinema segment. All prior periods have been recast in our segment reporting to reflect the current segment organization.\nQ4 2017 Financial Summary\nCinema revenues were $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $12.9 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was driven by decreased sales of projectors, lamps and screen support systems, partially offset by increases in projection system installations and sales of screens and digital parts.\nDigital Media revenues were $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $7.2 million in the same period of the prior year. This decrease was driven by decreased non-recurring digital signage equipment and installation sales, partially offset by increased recurring digital signage as a service (“DSaaS”) and digital signage maintenance sales.\nConsolidated gross profit was $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $5.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin was 24.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 27.0% in the same quarter of the prior year, as lower revenues resulted in less favorable absorption of fixed operating costs in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $4.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a contract termination charge of $0.4 million, as well as increases in compensation and benefit expenses of $0.3 million, consulting expenses of $0.2 million and bad debt expense of $0.1 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenues were $72.6 million, compared with $76.3 million for 2016. Gross profit amounted to $18.9 million, or 26.1% of net revenues, compared to gross profit of $21.2 million, or 27.7% of net revenues in the prior year. Net loss from continuing operations was ($3.6) million, or ($0.25) per share, for 2017, compared to net income from continuing operations of $0.9 million, or $0.06 per share, for the prior year.\nBalance Sheet\nExcluding assets held for sale, Ballantyne’s cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2017 was $4.9 million, compared to $7.6 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash was driven by operating losses and cash utilized for the purchase of equity investments and for capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of $2.5 million of short and long term debt. Equity method investments had a book value of $18.1 million and a market value of $15.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAbout Ballantyne Strong, Inc.
