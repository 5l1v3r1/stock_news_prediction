Last month the BoE said it would probably have to raise interest rates slightly more than it had previously planned, thanks largely to strong global growth.\nA separate report on Monday from Hadrian’s Wall Capital, a special debt adviser company, showed a further 25 basis-point rise in rates to 0.75 percent would hurt smaller companies most because they lack access to fixed-rate credit.
