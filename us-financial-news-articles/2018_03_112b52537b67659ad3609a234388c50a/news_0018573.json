It's simple and only places phone calls. The Light Phone didn't offer enough features, and now I'm back on my smartphone again. show chapters 1 Hour Ago | 02:16 \nI recently returned to work after maternity leave. I found that my hectic schedule was leaving me very little time with my daughter. To make matters worse, the short amount of time I did have with her was constantly interrupted by a symphony of pings, buzzes and tones from my two phones telling me my attention was needed elsewhere. \nIt was time to unplug. \nI purchased a Light Phone, a minimalistic, credit card-sized cell phone designed to remove all distraction from your life. It doesn't have texting, apps, GPS or a camera â€” it only makes phone calls. Then I turned off my smartphones to see if I could get by for a week with something more simple. \nSo how did it go? \nNot well. \nIt turned out that, for me, living without the many conveniences a smartphone has to offer was nearly impossible. It was an incredibly stressful week. I had trouble getting in touch with anyone without texting, I missed some important work emails, I got lost while driving to an appointment and I was late to a meeting because I couldn't find a taxi. I never realized how heavily I rely on apps like Google Maps, Lyft and Uber. Plus, I really missed having a camera in the palm of my hand. \nIt was quite nice on the weekend, however. My husband and I took a ski trip to Lake Tahoe and I loved just enjoying the mountains without a slew of texts distracting me all day. I borrowed my husband's phone whenever I wanted to take a photo. This could be a good vacation phone for those that really want to get away from it all. \nAnother thing I loved were the evenings with my daughter. I plan to keep my phones on silent and tucked away when I get home each evening until she is in bed. I don't want her to grow up seeing me with a phone in my hand at all times. \nI definitely did not miss having social media in the palm of my hand while using the Light Phone. I noticed, on a crowded bus one morning, that I was the only one not staring down at my phone. It made me think that just a decade ago everyone was looking around instead of down, and as a result I have decided to delete Facebook and Twitter off of my phone. \nLight is coming out with a new phone that includes some of the things I missed most, like texting, my contact list and an alarm clock. That is a phone I may actually consider. \nFor now, I'm going back to my smartphones.
