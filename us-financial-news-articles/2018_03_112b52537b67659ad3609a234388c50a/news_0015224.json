Tuesday‚Äôs announcement also set off a huge reaction on Twitter, where Cohn‚Äôs fans and critics chimed in to praise his 14-month tenure or to attack his service.\nCohn, a former Goldman Sachs president who served as Trump‚Äôs Director of the White House National Economic Council, announced the departure just days after reportedly failing to change Trump‚Äôs mind about imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In terms of policy victories, Cohn played a major role in the recent tax overhaul.\nHere‚Äôs what the Twittersphere had to say:\nCohn‚Äôs former boss, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein\nGary Cohn deserves credit for serving his country in a first class way.
