Cigna shares slipped 11.2 percent.\nKroger fell more than 10 percent after the supermarket chain issued a disappointing full-year profit forecast.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters turned 8 percent lower after trading up premarket on concerns over falling margins.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,502 to 1,318. On the Nasdaq, 1,467 issues fell and 1,365 advanced.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-09T02:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-09T14:20:16.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
