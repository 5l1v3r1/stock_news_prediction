MSFT, -2.06% and General Motors Co. GM, -1.95% executive who was under consideration earlier this month to serve as the next director of the National Economic Council, will be a second deputy to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Trump last week named CNBC commentator Lawrence Kudlow to lead the NEC, which is the White House’s top economic-advisory post. He will succeed the departing Gary Cohn. \n“Chris is widely respected across the administration and is highly qualified to oversee and coordinate our policy process,” Kelly said in a statement. “We look forward to having him in this new role.” Kelly’s other deputy is Joe Hagin, who oversees White House operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-19T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-19T18:14:56.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
