The nation spent 17.8 percent of its GDP on health care in 2016. Meanwhile, the average spending of 11 high-income countries assessed in a new report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association — Canada, Germany, Australia, the U.K,. Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark and the U.S. — was only 11.5 percent. \nPer capita, the U.S. spent $9,403. That's nearly double what the others spent.\nThis finding offers a new explanation as to why America's spending is so excessive. A ccording to the researchers at the Harvard Chan School, what sets the U.S. apart may be inflated prices across the board.\nIn the U.S., they point out, drugs are more expensive. Doctors get paid more. Hospital services and diagnostic tests cost more. And a lot more money goes to planning, regulating and managing medical services at the administrative level. \nIn other areas, despite conventional wisdom, there seems to be less discrepancy between the U.S. and other countries than commonly thought.\nThe report challenges popular beliefs about why health care spending is so high Experts have previously suggested high utilization rates could explain high spending in the U.S. But looking at hospital discharge rates for various procedures, such as knee and hip replacements and different types of heart surgeries, the researchers found that use of care services in the U.S. is not so different compared to other countries.\nIn fact, compared to the average of all the nations, Americans appear to go to the doctor less often and spend fewer days in the hospital after being admitted.\n\nThink tanks such as the", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-22T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-22T17:37:28.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
