This represents a premium of 72.6 percent, compared to 30-50 percent - a typical takeover premium according to a banker on the deal.\nShares were up slightly above 200 pence in morning trade indicating that traders think there will likely be another bidder who will offer more for the firm.\nThe Laird directors, advised by Rothschild ( ROTH.PA ), JPMorgan Cazenove ( JPM.N ) and Numis ( NUM.L ), consider the terms of the deal to be “fair and reasonable”, the company said in a statement.\nHigh asset prices in private transactions are increasingly pushing buyout funds to target publicly listed companies.\nLetters of intent representing 5.89 percent of issued share capital of Laird, which makes wireless communication equipment and technology for automated systems, have been received.\nLaird on Thursday reported an annual operating profit of 76.9 million pounds, up from 61.9 million.\nThe company completed a 185 million pound rights issue in April 2017 that reduced borrowings and altered its capital structure to enable investment.\n“In my first year as CEO, we’ve simplified structures, enhanced the quality of the leadership and focused on improving the efficiency and profitability of all Laird’s operations. These actions have delivered much improved results, and have built strong foundations for the future,” Chief Executive Tony Quinlan said.\nVolatility in foreign exchange rates, however, presents a significant headwind for sterling profits in 2018, the company said.\nAdvent has invested in more than 330 buyout transactions in 40 countries. It had 35 billion euros in assets under management as of Sept. 30 2017.\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva and Paul Sandle; editing by Jason Neely and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-01T12:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T15:45:40.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
