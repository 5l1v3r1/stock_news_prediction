One of the sources said the only option for Monte dei Paschi might be to engineer a three-way merger with two healthier domestic peers.\nMonte dei Paschi and the Treasury declined to comment. Last week, the bank issued a statement to quell speculation it may need fresh capital and said its turnaround plan was on track.\nREASSURANCE NEEDED The sources said Monte dei Paschi’s CEO Marco Morelli is seeking to reassure investors concerned with the decline of the share price and slow progress on the restructuring plan agreed with the EU Commission.\nThe bank’s newly-appointed chief financial officer, Andrea Rovellini, will also join the investor meetings, which have been organised by Barclays.\nShares in Monte dei Paschi have lost around 40 percent of their value since they resumed trading on the Milan bourse five months ago at a price of 4.1 euros.\n“There is no reason to buy the stock: no signs of turnaround yet, possible further loan losses and the absence of a buyer which - by now this is clear - is needed,” said Luca Fer, founder of BxItaly & BxWorld Hedge Funds which became a shareholder of the bank following a debt-to-equity conversion which was part of the bailout.\nMonte dei Paschi posted a 2017 loss of 3.5 billion euros hit by 5.3 billion euros in writedowns of bad debts and falling revenues.\n“They’ve got to communicate and they’ve got to have a credible plan,” an investor who owns shares in the bank said.\nThe bank will offload by mid-2018 24 billion euros in bad debts with the help of a state-sponsored, privately-financed banking rescue fund.\nIt plans another 2.6 billion euros in bad loan sales this year but even if it succeeds it would still hold 18 billion euros in soured debts, or around 15 percent of its total lending - three times the European average.\nIt aims to trim that ratio to 14 percent in 2019 at a time when the European Central Bank is pressing Italian lenders to cut their proportion of bad loans to below 10 percent of total loans.\nThe investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bank would have to raise one or two billion euros to cut the ratio to 10 percent.\n“The market needs to be realistic because this is not an economy that is firing at full growth potential even if things are better than they were,” he said. “What makes it worse this time around is the political environment in Italy.”\n$1 = 0.8137 euros Additional reporting by Valentina Za in Milan and Giuseppe Fonte in Rome; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-30T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-03-30T13:10:27.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
