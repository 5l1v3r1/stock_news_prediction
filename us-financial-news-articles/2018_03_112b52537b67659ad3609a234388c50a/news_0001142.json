The decision, however, runs counter to a supreme court ruling in December.\nThe constitutional court is the highest authority on constitutional matters and stands apart from a separate three-tier system, topped by the supreme court, the highest authority in non-constitutional matters.\nMCC purchased the mine from Russia in 2016. The judge on Wednesday said the government then in power had no right to allow the sale without parliamentary discussion and permission.\nMCC has said it will challenge the government’s attempts to reclaim the stake.\nA spokesman for MCC said in an email to Reuters that it did not consider that the case before the consitutional court affected its “legitimate interest” in the Erdenet mine.\nReporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav and Terrence Edwards in Ulaanbaatar and Barbara Lewis in London Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-03-01T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-01T21:33:05.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
