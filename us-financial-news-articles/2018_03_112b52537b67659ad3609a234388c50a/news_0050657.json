Oil producers in Iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases, which includes crude and oil by-products.\nIraq has invited foreign companies to bid for contracts to explore and develop petroleum reserves in 11 new blocks as the OPEC nation seeks to boost its output capacity.
