Mar 29, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; Sloane Stephens of the United States hits a forehand against Victoria Azarenka of Belarus (not pictured) in a women's singles semi-final of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park. Stephens won 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports \nThree-times champion Azarenka, playing as a wildcard in her second event after an eight-month absence because of a custody dispute involving her son, showed glimpses of the form that took her to the top of the rankings but ultimately ran out of gas against her 13th-seeded opponent. \nStephens, who also beat Azarenka in the second round at Indian Wells this month, took control of the match early in the second set and never looked back as she raced through the decider with ease. \n“I just knew I had to keep fighting. In the first set I was down but I battled back so I knew if I did that in the second, I’d be right in there,” the 25-year-old American said in an on-court interview.
