AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Additional Cash Flows Information\nFor the Three and Twelve-Month Periods Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(Unaudited)\nWe calculate EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) termination fees, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets, (iii) write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities, (iv) any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, (v) merger and acquisition transaction costs, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) gain from extinguishment of liability, and (viii) gain on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net earnings as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a Company’s ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Net income $ 69,427 $ 31,232 $ 170,184 $ 101,516 Adjusted for: Interest expense, net (including amortization of deferred financing costs) 12,860 15,688 53,154 66,418 Income tax provision (29,669 ) 2,450 (1,411 ) 31,837 Adjustment to investment in unconsolidated company: — — — our proportionate share in interest, tax and depreciation and amortization (265 ) (265 ) Depreciation and amortization 31,652 25,868 108,693 99,141 EBITDA $ 84,005 $ 75,238 $ 330,355 $ 298,912 Mark-to-market on derivatives instruments (700 ) (478 ) (1,500 ) 319 Stock-based compensation 1,556 1,774 8,760 5,157 Gain on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment — — — (686 ) Loss from extinguishment of liability — — 1,950 5,780 Settlement expenses — — — 11,000 Merger and acquisition transaction cost 760 100 2,460 335 Write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities 1,796 303 1,796 3,017 Adjusted EBITDA $ 87,417 $ 76,937 $ 343,821 $ 323,834\nOrmat Technologies Contact:\nSmadar Lavi\nVP Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations\n775-356-9029 (ext. 65726)\nslavi@ormat.com\nInvestor Relations Agency Contact:\nRob Fink\nHayden - IR\n646-415-8972\nrob@haydenir.com\nSource:Ormat Technologies, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f79ca51e-cd19-47a0-a929-f3e475467c73"], "published": "2018-03-16T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-03-17T00:32:38.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
