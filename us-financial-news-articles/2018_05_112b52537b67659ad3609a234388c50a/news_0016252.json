REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n“You can see why the Fox assets are so important and Sky is rolled in with that.”\nSky is a British-based European pay-TV group that offers services in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.\nIt agreed to be sold to its founder and 39-percent owner Fox in December 2016 but regulators and politicians have repeatedly intervened over concerns that the newspaper-owning Murdoch will have too much influence in Britain.\nWith Fox focused on getting approval, Comcast made its own shock bid for Sky in February, promising an easier approval process and a higher offer. It made its bid formal last month, and on Monday it notified the European Commission and will get an initial verdict on June 15.\nOn Tuesday it said it had agreed legally binding guarantees with Sky to fund its award-winning news output and to create a board to oversee its independence.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n“The Sky News Binding Commitments will constitute legally binding commitments on Comcast and Sky which will be enforceable by the Sky News Board,” Comcast said in a statement.\nMurdoch’s Fox has set out its own undertakings to protect the funding and independence of Sky News and is waiting to hear from Britain’s media secretary on whether Fox should be allowed to buy Sky. The government will give its verdict on that offer on June 13.
