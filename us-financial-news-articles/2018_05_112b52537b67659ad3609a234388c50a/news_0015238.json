He blamed a complex new voting law and gaps in his party’s performance.\nBut with 21 MPs, down from 33 in the last parliament, he emerged as the Sunni Muslim leader with the biggest bloc in the 128-seat house, making him the frontrunner to form the next government.\nInitial indications showed the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces, a Christian party, emerging as a big winner, nearly doubling its lawmakers to at least 15 from eight.\nLebanon’s prime minister must be a Sunni under its sectarian power-sharing system. The new government, like the outgoing one, is expected to include all the main parties. Talks over cabinet posts are expected to take time.\n“Hariri is going to be further weakened in any kind of government going forward,” Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute said. “His ability to substantially tame or restrain Hezbollah ... in Lebanon is going to be very limited.”\n“It will lead to more criticism of U.S. military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces” in Washington, he added. HARIRI RECEIVES A “SLAP”\nHezbollah, along with allied groups and individuals, secured at least 67 seats, according to a Reuters calculation based on preliminary results for nearly all the seats obtained from politicians and campaigns and reported in Lebanese media. Related Coverage Hezbollah's Nasrallah says Lebanon results are 'victory' for the resistance\nSeats in the Lebanese parliament are divided according to a strict sectarian quota. The number of Hezbollah lawmakers was the same or little changed at around 13, but candidates supported by the group or allied to it made significant gains.\nHezbollah-backed Sunnis did well in Beirut, Tripoli and Sidon, strongholds of Hariri’s Future Movement, the preliminary results showed. The pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper declared the election a “slap” for Hariri on its front page.\nHezbollah-backed winners include Jamil al-Sayyed, a retired Shi’ite general and former Lebanese intelligence chief who is a close friend of Syria’s Assad.\nSayyed was one of the most powerful men in Lebanon in the 15 years of Syrian domination that followed the 1975-90 civil war.\nAt least five other figures who held office then returned to parliament for the first time since Syrian forces quit Lebanon after the 2005 assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, Saad’s father.\nFaisal Karami, son of the late pro-Syrian prime minister Omar Karami, won a seat for the first time.\nIranian media appeared to gloat at Hariri’s setback. The hardline Tasnim news agency ran a report headlined: “Lebanese election result puts an end to Hariri’s monopoly among Sunnis.”\nHezbollah’s big allies include the Shi’ite Amal Movement led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement of President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally since 2006 who has said its arsenal is needed to defend Lebanon.\nWhile Hezbollah and its allies do not always see eye to eye, their support for its arsenal is vital to the group in Lebanon, where its weapons have been a major point of friction for years.\nHezbollah lost ground in Baalbek-Hermel constituency, one of its strongholds. Two of 10 seats there were won by its foes, one by the Lebanese Forces and the other by Future. It also failed to take a Shi’ite seat in the coastal town of Byblos.\nHezbollah and its allies are not on course to win the two-thirds majority that would be required to pass big decisions such as changing the constitution.

REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\nTurnout was 49.2 percent, down from 54 percent the last time legislative elections were held nine years ago.\nIndependent candidates running against the political establishment may have won a seat in Beirut.\nAn anti-Hezbollah coalition led by Hariri and backed by Saudi Arabia won a majority in parliament in 2009. But that “March 14” alliance disintegrated and Riyadh has switched its attention to confronting Iran in other parts of the region, notably Yemen. FIXING ‘THE PATH’\nSamir Geagea, the Lebanese Forces leader, said the results showed there was still a “popular ground” that backs “March 14” and would “give us strength... to fix the path much more than we were able to in past years”.\nGeagea is Hezbollah’s most prominent Lebanese Christian opponent. He led the Lebanese Forces militia in the last years of the civil war, during which he was an adversary of Aoun.\nHariri has urged the quick formation of a government after the election so it can press ahead with reforms needed to reduce state debt levels, among the highest in the world.\nHe said the international community should look at the election result “in a very positive way”.\nDonors want to see reforms before they release some of the $11 billion of aid and soft loans pledged in April.\nLebanon has been a big recipient of foreign aid to help it cope with hosting one million refugees from neighboring Syria.\nNasrallah called for the quick formation of a new government and said it should be done in a spirit of cooperation, putting aside differences.\nLebanon should have held a parliamentary election in 2013 but MPs instead voted to extend their own term because leaders could not agree on a new parliamentary election law.\nThe question of Hezbollah’s weapons has slipped down the political agenda in Lebanon in recent years. Hariri, who led years of political conflict with the group, says it is an issue to be resolved regionally through dialogue.
