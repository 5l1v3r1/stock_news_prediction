Picture taken May 10, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood The comments - in which Sharif implied he was removed from office by the Supreme Court last year for trying to end military support for anti-India militants - led to uproar in Pakistan, where criticising the military is increasingly considered a “red line” that cannot be crossed.\nThe National Security Council (NSC), in a special meeting on Monday called by the military, rejected Sharif’s comments in an interview with Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper as “incorrect and misleading”, the prime minister’s office said in a statement.\n“The participants unanimously rejected the allegations and condemned the fallacious assertions,” the office said, referring to military and civilian leaders.\n“(NSC) observed that it was very unfortunate that the opinion arising out of either misconceptions or grievances was being presented in disregard of concrete facts and realities.”\nThe statement was a rare rebuke of Sharif by a government run by his own party, highlighting political tension in the run-up to a general election expected in July.\nSharif’s criticism of the military has caused divisions within his party, analysts say, with some members unhappy about his confrontational approach.\nOpposition leader Imran Khan demanded that Sharif be put on trial. “He hurt the national interest of Pakistan by violating his oath as an ex-prime minister and should be proceeded against for treason,” Khan said at a news conference.\nThe Supreme Court disqualified three-time prime minister Sharif from office in July last year over unreported sources of monthly income of less than $3,000 from a United Arab Emirates company, a salary he denied ever receiving.\nThe military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half its history, denies any interference in civilian politics.\nIndia blamed the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) for the 2008 attack on the city of Mumbai. Ten gunmen spent three days spraying bullets and throwing grenades around landmarks.\nIndia said the gunmen were Pakistani and had arrived on the Mumbai waterfront by rubber boat after crossing the Arabian sea from the Pakistani city of Karachi in a trawler.\nIndia blamed Pakistan for failing to act against those behind the raids. Pakistan admitted the attacks were planned on its soil but denied any official involvement, and did not confirm the gunmen had set sail from Karachi.\nSome Western powers and India have accused the military of supporting Islamist groups for use as tools in achieving foreign policy objectives, but the military denies that.\n‘EXPLAIN IT’ Sharif, in the Dawn interview, obliquely criticized the military by denouncing “parallel governments”. He said there should only be one constitutional government.\nThe United States also blames LeT for the Mumbai attacks and has offered $10 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Hafiz Saeed, who heads Muslim charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), which Washington says is a front for LeT.\nEfforts by Pakistan to put on trial those India says are responsible for the Mumbai attack have stalled, while Saeed operates largely freely in Pakistan.\nSharif, asked about his ouster, brought up issues of security and foreign policy - which the military controls.\n“Militant organizations are active. Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai? Explain it to me. Why can’t we complete the trial?,” Sharif said, according to Dawn.\n“We have isolated ourselves. Despite giving sacrifices, our narrative is not being accepted,” Sharif said.\nSharif on Monday morning told reporters that he stood by his comments, according to Daily Pakistan and Geo TV. But after the NSC meeting, Prime Minister Abbasi said he had met Sharif and the former leader told him he was “misQuote: d”.\nWriting by Asif Shahzad; Editing by Drazen Jorgic and Robert Birsel\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
