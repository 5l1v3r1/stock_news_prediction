The number of aircraft in the agreements is tiny compared with Boeing's total order book, however. Boeing ended the first quarter of this year with a production backlog of more than 5,800 airplanes, including more than 4,600 orders for 737s.\nBoeing said it had not included the Iranian deals in its order book, so its backlog remains unchanged.\n\"Following today's announcement, we will consult with the U.S. Government on next steps,\" Boeing said in a statement.\nShares of Boeing were down 0.5 percent in afternoon trading.\nBoeing announced the largest of these deals in December 2016: 80 jets for Iran Air â€“ including 50 of the 737 MAX 8 model. In April 2017, Iran Aseman Airlines signed an agreement to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes, with an option to buy 30 more.\nTrump said Tuesday he would restore sanctions on Iran. The 2015 pact lifted those sanctions , after Iran agreed to limits on its nuclear program.\nBoeing has said that it continues \"to follow the U.S. government's lead\" on selling planes to Iranian companies.\nIn December 2016, when it announced the Iran Air deal, Boeing said such an order would support 100,000 U.S. jobs. That same month, Boeing's rival Airbus announced a deal to sell 100 planes to Iran Air. Airbus listed more than 100 planes for Iran Air and Iran Aseman Airlines in its order book through the end of April.\nIf the aircraft agreements are scrapped outright, it won't likely have a big impact on Boeing because of the company's large backlog of jets, particularly for narrowbody 737 aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group.\n\"Would have been nice to get but far from a major impact,\" Aboulafia said.\nThe company's current 777 production rate \"is not dependent on the Iranian orders,\" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on an earnings call last month. The 2016 Iran Air agreement with Boeing included 15 widebody 777-9 and 15 777-300ER models. Boeing had more than 400 orders for its widebody 777 at the end of March.\nWATCH: Boeing deal would be Iran's biggest with a Western company since 1979 Islamic revolution. show chapters Iran seals $17 billion Boeing deal 10:26 PM ET Sun, 11 Dec 2016 | 00:47\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T21:28:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
