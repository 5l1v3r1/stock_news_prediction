Unlock the physical world event you'd like to attend.\nYour profile is then shared with other people going to that event, and you will be able to see who's attending and browse their profiles.\nYou can start a private conversation if you find someone of interest.\nFacebook says the conversations will be text only as a \"safety measure,\" and dating chats will remain separate from Facebook messaging and WhatsApp.\n\"It mirrors the way people actually date, which is usually at events and institutions that they're connected to,\" said Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, during his keynote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T01:20:00.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
