He has been unable to play for the club since and three months without competitive action is not the best preparation for the World Cup.\nWith his athletic frame, superb technique and good vision, Sigurdsson adds that extra bit of zest to the counter-attacks that Iceland depend on.\nHe honed his skills at Reading, Swansea and Tottenham Hotspur before joining Everton, and also had a spell with 1899 Hoffenheim in Germany.\nWith chances likely to be at a premium in Russia and striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson also suffering a knee injury, what Iceland need most from Sigurdsson is his nose for goal.\nHe has netted 18 goals in 55 games for Iceland who, despite winning their group, scored only 16 goals in their 10 World Cup qualifiers, with Sigurdsson nabbing four of them.\nWith his dead ball skills also indispensable, the entire island nation will be hoping he is fit to captain the team when they open their campaign against Argentina on June 16.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:50:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
