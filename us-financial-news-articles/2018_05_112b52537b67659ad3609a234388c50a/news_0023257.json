I’m looking forward already to start the next tournament. There is no pressure. I feel like it’s an opportunity to play my best tennis.\n“Maybe I didn’t play my best game, but maybe she didn’t let me play my best game. She was really good today.” (Reporting by Martyn Herman, Editing by Toby Davis and Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:21:08.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
