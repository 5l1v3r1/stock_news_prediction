Analysts, on average, expected an adjusted profit of $1.67 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nQuarterly sales of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs dropped to $1.05 billion from $2.58 billion a year earlier, falling short of the $1.19 billion average analyst forecast. Sales of other antiviral and HIV drugs rose slightly to $3.33 billion from $3.27 billion.\nThe results are \"quite a bit below expectations, however, it is very clear that a lot of the shortfall is due to inventory drawdown, consistent with first-quarter patterns,\" said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. \"The stock is probably going to bounce back.\"\nSales of Gilead's drugs to cure hepatitis C have been on a downward trend for some time due to increased competition from other companies, including AbbVie.\n\"Hepatitis C is definitely weaker, but that should not be a complete shock,\" Yee said.\nSales of Yescarta, the cancer cell therapy acquired with Gilead's $12 billion purchase last year of Kite Pharma, totaled $40 million for the quarter, beating analysts' expectations of $23 million.\nFor full-year 2018, the biotechnology company said it still expects net product sales of $20 billion to $21 billion and a 2018 tax rate of 21 percent to 23 percent.\nShares of Gilead, which rose half a percent to close at $72.56 in regular trading on the Nasdaq, were down 5.3 percent at $68.70 after hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T14:30:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
