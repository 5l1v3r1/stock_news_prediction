Selling on other maturities also increased from their previous operations.\nTrading was extremely thin, with none of major benchmark issues, including 10-, and 20-year JGBs, traded in the morning.\nThe 10-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.045 percent, while the 20-year JGB yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.525 percent.\nThe five-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to minus 0.105 percent. The 30-year yield rose 1 basis point to 0.745 percent.\nLiquidity in futures trading has been dwindling, too, over the past several days.\nTen-year JGB futures fell 0.03 point to 150.80, with a trading volume of 11,817 lots, the lowest since the last Christmas day.
