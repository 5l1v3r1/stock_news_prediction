About a quarter of deaths from heart disease, stroke and lung cancer can be attributed to air pollution, the WHO says.\nPeople collect recyclable materials as smoke billows from a burning garbage dump site in New Delhi, India, May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Globally, outdoor air pollution has remained high and largely unchanged in the past six years, while household air pollution has got worse in many poorer countries, as people continue to cook with solid fuel or kerosene, instead of cleaner fuels such as gas and electricity.\n“The transition to clean fuels and technology in the home, clean household energy, is too slow. It’s been three decades and we still have three billion people primarily relying on (polluting) fuels and technologies, and that’s for cooking alone,” said WHO technical officer Heather Adair-Rohani.\nWHO’s global assessment is based on satellite data and modeling overlaid on the database of cities, which is self-selecting because it is based on voluntary reporting, with numbers that have been hugely revised since the previous report.\nThe most polluted city in 2016’s report, Zabol in Iran, has had its pollution level cut fourfold in the latest version of the database, and now appears to be cleaner than Australia’s capital Canberra.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “The data we are presenting today is I think the most accurate you can expect at the moment,” Neira said.\n(For a graphic on 'Map showing air pollution in various towns and cities' click tmsnrt.rs/2JHi39m )\nReporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://tmsnrt.rs/2JHi39m"], "published": "2018-05-02T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T01:20:54.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
