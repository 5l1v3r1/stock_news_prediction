(NYSE: DIN), the parent company of Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar ® and IHOP ® restaurants, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\n\"We are leveraging the benefit of our asset-lite business model to invest in the growth of our brands and build on recent momentum. Both Applebee's and IHOP achieved positive same-restaurant sales for the first quarter and outperformed their respective categories. This marks the second consecutive quarter of sales improvement for each brand. We are very pleased with the results and encouraged that the first-quarter trends for both brands continued through April,\" said Steve Joyce, Chief Executive Officer of Dine Brands Global, Inc.\nMr. Joyce continued, \"Looking ahead, we are acting on several strategic initiatives, such as enhancing our data and analytics capabilities, to drive sustainable positive sales performance and create significant value for our shareholders and franchisees. Supported by a performance-based culture and the addition of significant leadership talent, we have established clear goals for our brands, which will drive long-term success.\"\nFirst Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nGAAP net income available to common stockholders increased approximately 8% to $16.5 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.92 for the first quarter of 2018. This compares to net income available to common stockholders of $15.3 million (as adjusted for the adoption of new accounting revenue guidance titled Accounting Standards Codification 606 \"Revenues from Contracts with Customers\"), or earnings per diluted share of $0.86, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in net income was primarily due to a decline in general and administrative expenses and a reduction in our effective corporate tax rate following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax legislation in December 2017. These items were substantially offset by lower segment profit primarily due to an increase of $13.5 million in franchisor contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $19.8 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.11, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This compares to adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $22.8 million (as adjusted for the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606), or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.28, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in adjusted net income was mainly due to lower gross profit resulting from an increase of $13.5 million in franchisor contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund, partially offset by our lower federal tax rate and positive same-restaurant sales for both brands. (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.) General and administrative expenses declined to approximately $41.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $50.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs due to non-recurring executive separation costs in the first quarter of 2017. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $16.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to approximately $19.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily due to slightly lower net income and changes in working capital. Adjusted free cash flow was $15.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This compares to $19.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. (See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.)\nSame-Restaurant Sales Performance\nFirst Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nApplebee's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales increased 3.3% for the first quarter of 2018. IHOP's domestic system-wide comparable same-restaurant sales increased 1.0% for the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial Performance Guidance for Fiscal 2018\nDine Brands reiterates its financial performance guidance for fiscal 2018 contained in the press release issued on February 20, 2018 and the Form 8-K filed on the same day.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results Conference Call Today\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its results on the same day at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"goal\" and other similar expressions. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied in such statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions; our level of indebtedness; compliance with the terms of our securitized debt; our ability to refinance our current indebtedness or obtain additional financing; our dependence on information technology; potential cyber incidents; the implementation of restaurant development plans; our dependence on our franchisees; the concentration of our Applebee's franchised restaurants in a limited number of franchisees; the financial health our franchisees; our franchisees' and other licensees' compliance with our quality standards and trademark usage; general risks associated with the restaurant industry; potential harm to our brands' reputation; possible future impairment charges; the effects of tax reform; trading volatility and fluctuations in the price of our stock; our ability to achieve the financial guidance we provide to investors; successful implementation of our business strategy; the availability of suitable locations for new restaurants; shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of products from third parties or availability of utilities; the management and forecasting of appropriate inventory levels; development and implementation of innovative marketing and use of social media; changing health or dietary preference of consumers; risks associated with doing business in international markets; the results of litigation and other legal proceedings; third-party claims with respect to intellectual property assets; our ability to attract and retain management and other key employees; compliance with federal, state and local governmental regulations; risks associated with our self-insurance; natural disasters or other series incidents; our success with development initiatives outside of our core business; the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards; and other factors discussed from time to time in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not intend to, nor does it assume any obligation to, update or supplement any forward-looking statements after the date hereof to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes references to the Company's non-GAAP financial measure \"adjusted net income available to common stockholders, \"adjusted earnings per diluted share (Adjusted EPS)\" and \"Adjusted free cash flow.\" Adjusted EPS is computed for a given period by deducting from net income or loss available to common stockholders for such period the effect of any closure and impairment charges, any gain or loss related to debt extinguishment, any intangible asset amortization, any non-cash interest expense, any gain or loss related to the disposition of assets, and other items deemed not reflective of current operations. This is presented on an aggregate basis and a per share (diluted) basis. \"Adjusted free cash flow\" for a given period is defined as cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contracts receivable, less capital expenditures. Management may use certain of these non-GAAP financial measures along with the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of the business and to make certain business decisions. Management uses adjusted free cash flow in its periodic assessments of, among other things, the amount of cash dividends per share of common stock and repurchases of common stock and we believe it is important for investors to have the same measure used by management for that purpose. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes. Additionally, adjusted EPS is one of the metrics used in determining payouts under the Company's annual cash incentive plan. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional meaningful information that should be considered when assessing the business and the Company's performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. Adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nDine Brands Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\n(as adjusted)\nFranchise revenues\n$\n155,313\n$\n154,725\nRental revenues\n30,841\n30,465\nFinancing revenues\n2,009\n2,131\nCompany restaurant sales\n—\n4,140\nTotal revenues\n188,163\n191,461\nCost of revenues:\nFranchise and restaurant expenses\n81,872\n70,167\nRental expenses\n22,641\n22,666\nFinancing expenses\n150\n—\nCompany restaurant expenses\n—\n4,343\nTotal cost of revenues\n104,663\n97,176\nGross profit\n83,500\n94,285\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n41,911\n50,305\nInterest expense\n15,199\n15,363\nClosure and impairment charges\n2,604\n217\nAmortization of intangible assets\n2,502\n2,500\nGain on disposition of assets\n(1,427)\n(109)\nIncome before income tax provision\n22,711\n26,009\nIncome tax provision\n(5,638)\n(10,414)\nNet income\n$\n17,073\n$\n15,595\nNet income available to common stockholders:\nNet income\n$\n17,073\n$\n15,595\nLess: Net income allocated to unvested participating restricted stock\n(568)\n(283)\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n16,505\n$\n15,312\nNet income available to common stockholders per share:\nBasic\n$\n0.93\n$\n0.87\nDiluted\n$\n0.92\n$\n0.86\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic\n17,703\n17,694\nDiluted\n17,845\n17,737\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n0.63\n$\n0.97\nDividends paid per common share\n$\n0.97\n$\n0.97\nDine Brands Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(as adjusted)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n96,399\n$\n117,010\nReceivables, net\n105,834\n140,188\nRestricted cash\n32,391\n31,436\nPrepaid gift card costs\n31,174\n40,725\nPrepaid income taxes\n36,078\n45,981\nOther current assets\n6,906\n12,615\nTotal current assets\n308,782\n387,955\nLong-term receivables, net\n122,362\n126,570\nProperty and equipment, net\n198,624\n199,585\nGoodwill\n339,236\n339,236\nOther intangible assets, net\n581,639\n582,787\nDeferred rent receivable\n81,720\n82,971\nNon-current restricted cash\n14,700\n14,700\nOther non-current assets, net\n3,983\n4,135\nTotal assets\n$\n1,651,046\n$\n1,737,939\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Deficit\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n$\n12,965\n$\n12,965\nAccounts payable\n45,236\n55,028\nGift card liability\n117,266\n164,441\nDividends payable\n11,520\n17,748\nCurrent maturities of capital lease and financing obligations\n12,986\n14,193\nAccrued employee compensation and benefits\n10,098\n13,547\nDeferred franchise revenue, short-term\n10,851\n11,001\nOther accrued expenses\n15,047\n16,001\nTotal current liabilities\n235,969\n304,924\nLong-term debt, less current maturities\n1,267,468\n1,269,849\nCapital lease obligations, less current maturities\n60,268\n61,895\nFinancing obligations, less current maturities\n38,981\n39,200\nDeferred income taxes, net\n114,522\n119,996\nDeferred rent payable\n62,371\n69,112\nDeferred franchise revenue, long-term\n68,581\n70,432\nOther non-current liabilities\n19,772\n18,071\nTotal liabilities\n1,867,932\n1,953,479\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders' deficit:\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, shares: 40,000,000 authorized;

Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company. However, we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales, and, where applicable, rental payments under leases that partially may be based on a percentage of their sales.
