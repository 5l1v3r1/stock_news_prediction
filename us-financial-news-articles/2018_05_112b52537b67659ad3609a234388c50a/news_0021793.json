The ball exited his bat at 104.4 mph and traveled 415 feet, resulting in a wild celebration at home plate.\nTorres’ first career walk-off hit gave the Yankees a sixth straight win and 15th in 16 games since April 20.\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, at 21 years, 144 days old, Torres is the youngest Yankee to hit a walk-off homer. The mark was previously held by Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle (21 years, 185 days old).\nThe homer occurred after Aaron Hicks opened the inning with a double off Cody Allen (2-1) over center fielder Greg Allen’s head. Hicks later scored on Neil Walker’s double to right field.\nAfter the right-handed Otero retired Miguel Andujar, the Indians intentionally walked Giancarlo Stanton to face Torres.\nBefore Torres celebrated the two-week anniversary of his promotion to the Yankees, the Yankees scored three in the eighth off Cody Allen on a single by Brett Gardner and a two-run double by Aaron Judge.\nChasen Shreve (2-0) pitched a hitless ninth and earned the win.\nBefore the Yankees began their comeback, Yonder Alonso broke up a no-hit bid by the Yankees with a leadoff single in the top of the eighth inning against Betances.\nThe Indians finally broke through when Alonso slapped a 2-2 curveball into right field just past the diving attempt of Torres at second base.\nAfter Alonso’s hit, Yan Gomes followed with a single and pinch runner Rajai Davis stole third before scoring on Tyler Naquin’s single up the middle.\nTwo batters later, Francisco Lindor blooped a soft double into right field for a 2-0 lead and Cleveland added an insurance run when Naquin scored on a passed ball by catcher Gary Sanchez during an at-bat by Jason Kipnis.\nKipnis then lifted a sacrifice fly to make it 4-0.\nClevinger allowed a single to Hicks in the fifth and set a career-high with 10 strikeouts while allowing two runs in 7 1/3 innings.\nThe Indians came back after being confounded by German’s array of breaking pitches in six innings. Filling in for the injured Jordan Montgomery, he threw a career-high 84 pitches, striking out nine while throwing a combined 59 curveballs and changeups.\nNeither team had a hit until Hicks opened the fifth with a single up the middle.\nThe Indians threatened twice to get their first hit, but Torres made a nice play on the run in right field on Naquin’s ground ball to end the fifth. Two innings later, Didi Gregorius ranged to his left and made a strong throw to retire Edwin Encarnacion on a groundout to the hole in shortstop.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:51:50.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
