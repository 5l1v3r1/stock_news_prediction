Neither player has reached an ATP Tour final before.\n“You never know what’s going to happen in tennis,” Daniel said.\n“It could be a really easy match, I could lose easily, win easily; win tough, lose tough. It’s more important to think about how to recover the best I can for tomorrow.”\nJaziri claimed his first victory against a top 10 rival when he knocked out world number five Grigor Dimitrov in Dubai earlier this year.
