The new bloc would result in the largest free trade area in terms of participating countries since the formation of the World Trade Organization .\nBut Nigeria and South Africa, the region's two largest economies, did not get on board, citing concerns over safeguarding jobs and cheap Chinese goods flooding the market .\nThe summit took place in the Rwandan capital of Kigali.

Kenya and Ghana, both African economies boasting strong fundamentals, ratified the agreement last week. Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who leads the east African powerhouse economy which has seen double-digit GDP (gross domestic product) growth as recently as 2017, said on Monday that his country is ready to follow suit.\nIntra-African trade currently comprises less than 20 percent of the continent's total, with countries often focussed on exporting commodities to former colonial powers instead. It is hoped that the new free trade deal will shift emphasis away from this and towards manufacturing.\nThe African Union posits the agreement as uniting a market of 1.2 billion people with a combined gross domestic product of $2.5 trillion.\n\"We have to make sure that the rules of engagement when it comes to the free trade area are clearly defined,\" both in terms of protecting national economies and establishing their manufacturing capacities, Kie said. \"It's not going to come overnight.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T17:42:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
