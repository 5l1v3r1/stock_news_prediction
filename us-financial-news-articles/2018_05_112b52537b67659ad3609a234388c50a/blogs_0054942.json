Public transportation and trash collection services have been reduced in major cities such as Sao Paulo because of fuel shortages.\nAuto production in Brazil, which accounts for about a quarter of its industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday, according to carmakers association ANfavea, in the latest blow to a fragile economic recovery following the worst downturn in decades.
