Petrobras sells 7 million tonnes of naphtha to Braskem annually, Musa said.\n“We don’t want to start the negotiation too close to the deadline,” he told journalists.\nMusa said the company has supply contracts abroad that may reach up to 20 years.\nMusa said he expects Braskem’s U.S. unit to begin operations in its new polypropylene production unit in La Porte, Texas, in 2020. The company last year said the final phase of main construction on the new unit, which will be located next to its existing production facilities, was targeted for the first quarter of 2020.\nMusa said Braskem will try to lead groups vying for the two refining companies in the northeast and southern Brazil that Petrobras plans to sell.\nHe declined to comment on the company’s previously announced project to unify its different share classes into a single common stock.
