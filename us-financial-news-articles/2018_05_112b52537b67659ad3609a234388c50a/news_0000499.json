But it was in place in the weeks before the April 9 raid on his New York City home, hotel room and office by FBI agents, according to NBC News.\nIt is also unknown whether Trump was heard on the wiretaps.\nBut it is known that the president spoke at least once with Cohen last month, shortly after that raid.\nCohen is under criminal investigation by prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for issues that include his business dealings.\nIn addition to serving at Trump's lawyer, Cohen was also counsel for the Trump Organization, the business entity the president previously ran.\nAmong the items seized from Cohen last month were files related to a $130,000 payment he made to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 presidential election.\nDaniels has said the money was in exchange for her promise to keep quiet about an affair she says she had with Trump in 2006 . The White House has denied the affair happened.\nDaniels lawyer Michael Avenatti, during an appearance on MSNBC, said he knew that Michael Cohen's text messages were also tapped by investigators.\n\"It's a fact,\" Avenatti said.\n\"I don't think this president is going to serve out his term. I just don't,\" said Avenatti.\nIt has been previously known that federal prosecutors were monitoring Cohen's email accounts for some time before the April 9 raid.\nLucas Jackson | Reuters President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen leaves federal court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 16, 2018. On Wednesday night, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said that Trump had reimbursed Cohen for that payment to Daniels.\nGiuliani's statement contradicted previous denials by both Cohen and Trump that the president had not paid Cohen.\nGiuliani is now on Trump's legal team for dealing with an ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller . That probe is focused on Russian interference in the presidential election.\nGiuliani is a former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. According to NBC News, he warned Trump against making any more calls to Cohen because of worries that the call in April was recorded by prosecutors.\nThe Washington Post said he was \"furious\" when a reporter informed him of the NBC News story. Giuliani said he had been unaware of any such wiretaps on Cohen.\n\"If they picked up the president, they would have had to notify him,\" said Giuliani.\nHe added that if the NBC report is accurate, it would make a \"mockery of attorney-client privilege, and would amount to government misconduct.\nGiuliani then said he would inform Trump of the news.\nNBC News's story about the wiretap on Cohen says that Giuliani has warned Trump that Cohen is likely to agree to cooperate with prosecutors in a potential probe of the president. But Trump has disputed Giuliani's belief, saying that he expects that Cohen will remain loyal to him.\nDaniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District, scoffed at Giuliani's objection to the wiretap on Cohen.\n\"I don't know where Rudy Giuliani is getting this information,\" Goldman said, noting that Giuliani had been a top prosecutor. \"That is just simply false. He [Giuliani] and his assistants got hundreds and hundreds of wiretaps at the time, and the law has not changed that much to today.\"\n\"It is absolutely it is absolutely not an evisceration of attorney-client privilege,\" Goldman said.\nHe said that the Justice Department runs a risk of tainting a criminal probe if prosecutors in a case come into contact with evidence that is protected by such privilege, which is why they have a \"taint team\" of prosecutors not connected to the case vet the evidence first.\n\"Then to say that Trump should be notified, that's absolutely contrary to all law,\" Goldman added. \"It is a violation of law itself to disclose the existence of a wiretap. So this is PR spin from someone who I admire greatly as the U.S. Attorney from the office I served in.e office I served in.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kevin Brueninger", "external_links": ["https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/feds-tapped-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-s-phones-n871011"], "published": "2018-05-03T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T20:12:32.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
