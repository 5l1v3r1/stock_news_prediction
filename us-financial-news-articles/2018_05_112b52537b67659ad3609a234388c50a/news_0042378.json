Exports, a key driver of Thai growth, rose 12.34 percent in April from a year earlier after increasing 7.06 percent in March, commerce ministry data showed on Tuesday. That beat the median forecast of an 11.25 percent rise in a Reuters poll. The gains were led by stronger shipments of cars and parts, computers and accessories, and rubber products. Imports in April surged 20.36 percent from a year earlier after rising 9.47 percent in March. The poll forecast was for a 13.35 percent jump. That resulted in a trade deficit of $1.28 billion in April, far above a forecast of a $120 million deficit, and against a surplus of $1.27 billion in March. In January-April, exports rose 11.53 percent from a year earlier while imports increased 17.18 percent. The ministry targets export growth of 8 percent this year, after a 9.9 percent rise last year.
