The unit accounted for a quarter of IAC’s total revenue.\nIAC created ANGI by merging its digital home services marketplace business with consumer review website operator Angie’s List that it bought last year.\nFirst-quarter results were also helped by robust growth in its Match Group unit as it benefited from more subscribers to its dating services. IAC owns more than 80 percent of Match Group.\nThe unit, which owns numerous online dating services, reported results on Tuesday that beat estimates and played down the threat of Facebook Inc.\nEarlier this month, Facebook said it was developing a dating feature for its 2.2 billion monthly users. Following the announcement, IAC and Match Group both lost about $5 billion in combined market value.\n“Social networks have always been competitors,” Chief Executive Officer Joey Levin told Reuters.\nWhen asked if IAC plans to invest more in its dating businesses following Facebook’s announcement, Levin said there were no specific investments tied to that.\nIAC has also been ramping up its efforts to expand its presence in the rapidly growing video market through Vimeo, which offers cloud-based video hosting, editing and sharing tools to individuals and business customers.\nTotal subcribers for Vimeo rose 13 percent to 901,000 in the first quarter.\nIAC’s net income surged to $71.1 million, or 71 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $26.2 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier.\nTotal revenue rose about 31 percent to $995.1 million.
