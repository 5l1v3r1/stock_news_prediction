First-quarter 2018 revenues were $273.3 million, relatively flat from $273.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 58% higher compared with $172.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor first-quarter 2018, the Company had net income of $28.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared with net income of $19.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for first-quarter 2018 included pre-tax merger related expenses of $3.3 million. Net loss for first-quarter 2017 was $11.6 million, or $(0.05) per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA 2018 was $71.0 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $63.8 million. In the first quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $21.7 million.\nBusiness Segments\nProppant Solutions Segment\n Proppant Solutions volumes were 2.6 million tons, a decrease of 5% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and more than 25% greater than the first quarter of 2017. Raw frac sand volumes were 2.4 million tons, representing a 6% sequential decline and a 26% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017. While demand remained robust and growing throughout the quarter, raw sand volumes were sequentially lower due to seasonal factors, less production as a result of process engineering changes and a slight impact from rail downtime in the first quarter. Coated proppant volumes were 215,000 tons, which is a 1% increase from the 213,000 tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 33% increase compared with first quarter of 2017.\nProppant Solutions revenues were $242.2 million in first-quarter 2018, a 1% decline compared with $245.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and more than a 70% increase compared with $141.0 million in the first quarter a year ago. Despite growing market demand, Proppant Solutions revenues were relatively flat with the fourth quarter due to the impact of lower volumes, which was offset by a more favorable product mix of coated proppant sales and higher average pricing of nearly $4 per ton on raw sand proppants.\nProppant Solutions gross profit increased to $78.9 million, or $30 per ton, in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $77.2 million, or $28 per ton, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Proppant Solutions gross profit improved in the first quarter due to a more favorable mix of coated proppant sales coupled with higher average pricing on raw sand proppants, offset somewhat by increased operating costs due to lower volumes and seasonal factors. Gross profit 2018 was also impacted by $1.8 million in start-up costs from the Company’s Wexford, Michigan, and Kermit, Texas, mines. Proppant gross profit in the first quarter of 2017 was $27.3 million, or $13 per ton, and included $0.9 million in start-up costs from the Brewer, Missouri, and Maiden Rock, Wisconsin, mines.\nIndustrial and Recreational Products Segment\nIndustrial and Recreational volumes were 578,000 tons in first-quarter 2018, down 3% from the prior year’s first quarter. This decline was mainly due to a customer’s planned shutdown of a plant for maintenance and unseasonably cold weather that delayed some sales into the building products and the sports and recreation end markets.\nRevenues for the segment were $31.2 million in first-quarter 2018, down slightly from $31.6 million in the first quarter a year ago. The slight decrease in revenue was due to lower volumes mostly offset by the price increases implemented at the beginning of the year.\nGross profit for the segment was $12.0 million, or 38% of sales, in first-quarter 2018, compared with $13.5 million, or 43% of sales, in the first quarter of 2017. The lower gross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was due in part to the lower volumes coupled with a delay in building products and sports and recreation sales, which carry a margin higher than the average for the overall segment.\nJenniffer Deckard, Officer, said, “I am pleased with our ability to work through seasonal and operational headwinds, including continued adverse weather conditions, during the first quarter. While dealing with these headwinds, we continued to focus on improving profitability, which grew significantly. We exited the quarter with the strongest sales volume month in our Company’s history and look forward to continuing this momentum, including the opening of our Kermit, Texas, plant, which is expected to begin operations in May.”\nMs. Deckard continued, “Market fundamentals in the second quarter have remained strong, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends due to our increase in production at Kermit and Wexford, and our increasing effective capacity at our other plants.”\nBalance Sheet and Other Information\nThrough the first three months of 2018, net cash generated by operating activities was $13.5 million, driven in large part by an improved pricing environment and higher sales of value-added proppants in comparison to year end. Net cash used in financing activities was $15.5 million, primarily a result of required debt service payments, in addition to a voluntary $10 million paydown of the Company’s revolving credit facility. Capital expenditures were $41.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which included $20.6 million for the Kermit facility.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $84.8 million, and total debt was $734.2 million, compared with $128.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $748.9 million as of December 31, 2017.\nSpecial Shareholder Meeting\nA special meeting of Fairmount Santrol shareholders, to vote on the merger between Unimin Corporation (“Unimin”) and Fairmount Santrol, (the “Merger”) and certain merger-related items, is scheduled to be held on May 25, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time, at the offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Avenue East, Cleveland, Ohio 44114. Holders of record of shares of Fairmount Santrol common stock at the close of business on April 20, 2018, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special meeting. The approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Fairmount Santrol shareholders will collectively receive $170 million in cash at the closing of the Merger (which is estimated to result in cash consideration of approximately $0.74 per share based on Fairmount Santrol’s diluted share count). Additionally, Fairmount Santrol shareholders will own approximately 35% of the combined company at closing, with Sibelco, the current parent company of Unimin Corporation, owning the remaining 65%.\nAt closing, the combined company will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), while Fairmount Santrol will be delisted from the NYSE.\nDeckard concluded, “We remain on track for a mid-year closing of our proposed merger with Unimin, which will build on the combined strengths of both companies to create a diversified solutions provider that is well positioned to capitalize on the greatest opportunities for growth. We have achieved several key milestones since our announcement of the transaction in December, and we look forward to continuing our progress at our special shareholder meeting in May.”\nUse of Certain GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation, asset impairments, and certain other income or expenses. The Company believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate our operational performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing costs or capital structure.\nConference Call\nFairmount Santrol will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors today, May 3, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company's 2018 first-quarter financial results.
