William C. Church. An NRA shooting match in 1876 in Long Island, N.Y.\nA spokesman for the NRA declined to comment.

In 1920, Remington placed an ad in the Boy Scouts of America’s Boys Life magazine offering a booklet showing children “how to organize an official Government N.R.A. Rifle Club among your chums.”\nTo broaden interest in shooting, hunting and other gun issues the group launched a magazine, The American Rifleman, in 1923.\nDoris Dean of Chicago won an event for women in 1941 with a perfect score at Camp Perry outside of Toledo, Ohio, where the NRA held annual shooting matches.

The 16-page book encouraged children to start new NRA clubs to learn how to properly handle guns.\nThe NRA also actively recruited hunters. An ad in a 1964 issue of Guns magazine promoted the benefits of its membership, which included hunting tips and information on its clubs and gun laws. It also came with a year’s subscription to its magazine.\nThe call for gun control legislation grew after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. The group’s float at the 1966 Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif., included the message “Land of the Free” and showed a model of the U.S. Capitol.

While NRA executive Franklin Orth called parts of the bill “unduly restrictive,” he said that “as a whole [it] appears to be one that the sportsmen of America can live with.” PHOTO: Getty Images\nIn a 1970 issue of Field & Stream featuring pro football player Chris Hanburger, an ad used gun control as a reason to join the NRA, saying “powerful forces” are trying to “abolish the hunting rights, privileges and freedoms that you enjoy today!”\nThe organization founded a lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action, in 1975 to fight for gun rights. Led by Harlon Carter, this new politically motivated faction wrested control of the organization at the 1977 annual convention. It opposed any form of gun control, according to Osha Gray Davidson, author of Under Fire: The Nra and the Battle for Gun Control. Harlon Carter, left, and NRA executive Neal Knox, right, in 1978.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan addressed the NRA after it supported him, the first time it backed a presidential candidate. President Reagan looks at his new lifetime membership card for the NRA.

Mr. Dukakis was a staunch supporter of gun control. The NRA ran ads and distributed “Defeat Dukakis” bumper stickers.\nIn 1988, it expanded its mission to teach children about gun safety with coloring books, workbooks, and other materials featuring the character Eddie Eagle. The program stresses four rules if kids find a gun: “STOP! Don't Touch. Leave the Area. Tell an Adult.” PHOTO: Zuma Press\nIn the early 1990s, Congress enacted gun legislation tightening restrictions on handgun sales and banning some firearms. The NRA released an ad in the October 1993 issue of Field & Stream featuring a photo of its new CEO Wayne LaPierre and portraying the government as a threat to gun ownership.\nActor Charlton Heston became a highly visible spokesman for the NRA and led the charge in positioning gun control as unconstitutional. In a 1997 speech, he said “I expect to build an NRA with the political muscle and clout to keep a pro-Second Amendment Congress in place.” Mr. Heston at the 2000 convention PHOTO: Ric Feld/Associated Press\nAfter the Sandy Hook school shooting, President Barack Obama called for new gun control measures. A 2013 NRA video called Mr. Obama an “elitist hypocrite” because he did not embrace the group’s proposal for armed security in schools, while his daughters had Secret Service protection. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the ad “repugnant and cowardly.”\nThe group endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race and spent $30 million in ads, according to FEC filings. One ad focused on the Second Amendment showing that the winning candidate would pick a ninth Supreme Court Justice soon after taking office, and quoted Hillary Clinton as saying “The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.”\nNRATV launched a video campaign, “Freedom’s Safest Place,” in 2016 to “alert Americans to the threats to their freedoms.” NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch defends the role of the Second Amendment to protect gun rights “with the clenched fist of truth.” Critics found it too violent.\nAfter the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, the NRA’s Mr. LaPierre said at the Conservative Political Action Conference that liberal lawmakers are cynically using the latest school tragedy to roll back gun rights. “What they want are more restrictions on the law-abiding,” Mr. LaPierre said. “Think about that. Their solution is to make you—all of you—less free.” PHOTO: Bloomberg News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T21:12:22.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
