REUTERS/Stringer Infectious disease outbreaks can be a challenge in India, the world’s second most populous country, where infection control and surveillance systems are weak, leading to hundreds of deaths annually from diseases such as mosquito-borne dengue.\nThere is no vaccine for the Nipah virus, which is spread through body fluids and can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. The usual treatment is to provide supportive care.\nThe first death in the outbreak in Kerala took place on Friday, the state’s health minister, K.K. Shailaja, said.\n“This is a new situation for us. We have no prior experience in dealing with the Nipah virus,” she said. “We are hopeful we can put a stop to the outbreak.”\nOf 18 people screened for the virus, 12 proved positive, Shailaja told a news conference, adding that 10 of the sufferers had died and the other two were being closely monitored.\nMedics wearing protective gear examine a patient at a hospital in Kozhikode in the southern state of Kerala, India May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer The Indian government dispatched a team of officials from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to investigate the outbreak, it said in a statement.\n“Since all the contacts are under observation and steps to avoid exposure through animal vectors have been taken, there is no reason for people to panic,” it added.\nThe WHO is in contact with government officials in the affected areas, Henk Bekedam, its India representative, said in a statement.\nHealth experts stressed the need for early detection and infection control to arrest the virus’s spread.\nPeople wearing masks are seen at a hospital in Kozhikode in the southern state of Kerala, India May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer “It will not spread like wildfire because it is not airborne, but it can be risky if they don’t follow proper infection control procedures,” said Dr D Himanshu, of King George’s Medical University in the northern city of Lucknow.\nWhile the cause of the outbreak is still being investigated, visiting national health officials tied the initial deaths to “many bats” in a well in Kerala from which the victims drew water, the government said.\nSamples from those bats were among the 60 sent to laboratories to be screened for the virus, it added.\nThe cases provoked concern among residents, a local government official said.\n“A large number of people affected by fever, and even minor ailments, are swarming to hospitals, fearing they have contracted the disease,” said U.V. Jose.\nHealth officials in Kerala, which attracts many tourists, aims to soon issue a travel advisory, tourism official P Bala Kiran said.\nThe Nipah virus was first detected in Malaysia in 1998, and India has suffered two outbreaks in the last decade, killing 50 people, according to the WHO.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and D.
