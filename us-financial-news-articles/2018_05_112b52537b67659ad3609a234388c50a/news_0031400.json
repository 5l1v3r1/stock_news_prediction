(Nasdaq:REFR) announced its financial results for its first quarter Management will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial and operating results as well as recent developments.\nWho: Joseph M. Harary, President & CEO, Seth Van Voorhees, CFO Date/Time: May 14, 2018, 4:30 PM ET Dial-in Information: 1-412-717-9591 Replay: Available on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 for 90 days at www.SmartGlass-IR.com\nKey First Quarter 2018 Comments:\n1) Fee income increased in all major markets for the Company’s SPD-SmartGlass light-control technology.\na. Fee income increased to $433,269 for the 3-month period ending March 31, 2018 as compared to $393,116 for the same period in 2017, a 10.2% increase. This increase in revenues was principally the result of higher revenues from the automotive, aircraft and architectural sectors that was partially offset by modestly lower revenues in the display sector. In 2018, the Company adopted the new ASC 606 revenue recognition guidance which applies to revenues reported beginning with the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported $48,746 higher revenue under ASC 606 as compared to the accounting guidance used prior to the adoption of ASC 606.\nb. Fee income as reported increased by $153,829, or 55% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the previous revenue recognition guidance in place prior to the adoption of ASC 606, fee income for the first quarter of 2018 would have increased by $105,083 or 37.6% over the fourth quarter of 2017.\nc. These revenue increases from last quarter and year over year follow a 22% increase in revenues in 2017 over the prior year.\n2) Expenses declined by $119,107, or -8.8%, for the 3-month period ending March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. This expense reduction follows a $1.6 million expense reduction (-29%) in 2017 as compared to the prior year.\n3) The Company’s net loss was $158,788 (16.7%) lower in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period last year. This follows five straight years in a row of lower losses for the Company.\n4) Cash and cash equivalents increased by $558,698 since the end of 2017 as a result of a financing completed in February.\n5) The interest in using SPD technology for new markets continues to expand as demonstrated by Electrolux, a global leader in appliances, which premiered its \"SenseOven 2.0\" concept at 2018 EuroCucina, Europe’s largest kitchen trade show. The SenseOven 2.0 embeds VariGuard’s SPD-SmartGlass interactive intelligence into the appliance – an electronically dimmable glass which uses Research Frontiers’ patented SPD-Smart light-control film technology.\nFor more details, please see the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which was filed today with the SEC, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.\nResearch Frontiers is the developer of SPD-Smart light-control technology which allows users to instantly, precisely and uniformly control the shading of glass or plastic, either manually or automatically.
