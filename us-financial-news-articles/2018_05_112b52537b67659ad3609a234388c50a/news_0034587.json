Dr. Dansey brings extensive experience in cancer drug development, most recently from Merck Inc. where he was Therapeutic Area Head for Late Stage Oncology, responsible for the ongoing registration efforts for KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab) across multiple tumor types.\n“Roger’s appointment reflects the growing importance of late-stage clinical drug development at Seattle Genetics as we transition to a global, multi-product oncology company,” said Clay Siegall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Seattle Genetics. “Roger’s drug development and approval experience at industry leaders, including Merck, Gilead and Amgen, his deep oncology background and proven ability to collaborate and lead teams, make him an ideal fit for Seattle Genetics as we strive to bring transformative therapies to people with cancer.”\nDr. Dansey stated, “This is an exciting time at Seattle Genetics with both a growing, approved drug in ADCETRIS as well as a product pipeline with important new opportunities, including three solid tumor programs in ongoing or planned pivotal trials. I look forward to working with the many talented individuals at Seattle Genetics to bring these new therapies to patients.”\nRoger D.

Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include that the company may be delayed in its planned clinical trial initiations, the enrollment in and conduct of its clinical trials, obtaining data from clinical trials, planned regulatory submissions, and regulatory approvals in each case for a variety of reasons including the difficulty and uncertainty of pharmaceutical product development, unexpected adverse events or regulatory discussions or actions, including with respect to special protocol assessment agreements defining trial endpoints and the inherent uncertainty associated with the regulatory approval process. The company may also be unable to expand ADCETRIS’ labeled indications due to unexpected or delayed data from its ongoing phase 3 trials or regulatory action, including the risks that the company’s supplemental BLA submissions may not be accepted for filing by, or ultimately approved by, the FDA in a timely manner or at all or with the requested label, and may be unable to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, its product candidates. More information about the risks and uncertainties faced by Seattle Genetics is contained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
