CLEARING A PATH\nAuthorities were trying Sunday to open up a road that was blocked by lava in 2014 to serve as an alternative escape route, Jessica Ferracane of the National Park Service told reporters.\nThe park service is working to bulldoze almost a mile of hardened lava out of the way on nearby Highway 11, which has been impassable, she added.\nThe Hawaii National Guard has warned of mandatory evacuations if more roads become blocked.\nBut officials went house-to-house in the area to urge more residents to flee, Snyder said, though no head count of the new evacuation was available early Sunday.\nFor weeks, geologists have warned that hotter, fresher magma from Kilauea’s summit would run underground and emerge some 25 miles east in the lower Puna district, where older, cooler lava has already destroyed 44 homes and other structures.

REUTERS/Terray Sylvester\n“Summit magma has arrived,” U.S. Geological Survey scientist Wendy Stovall said on a conference call with reporters.\n“There is much more stuff coming out of the ground and its going to produce flows that will move much further away.”\nFountains of bright orange lava were seen spouting at least 20-feet high, and spewing rivers of molten rock on Saturday.\nCarolyn Pearcheta, operational geologist at the Hawaii Volcano Authority, told reporters that hotter and more viscous lava could be on the way, with fountains spurting as high as 600 feet, as seen in a 1955 eruption.\n“We’ve seen the clearing out of the system,” she said. “We call that the ‘throat clearing’ phase.” NEW EXPLOSIVE ERUPTION\nAt the volcano’s summit, another large explosive eruption occurred around midnight, sending up a nearly two-mile-high ash plume (10,000 feet), according to the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.\nScientists expect a series of eruptions from Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, that could spread ash and volcanic smog across the Big Island, the southernmost of the Hawaiian archipelago.\nThat could pose a hazard to aircraft if it blows into their routes at around 30,000 feet (9,144 meters).\nAround 2,000 residents of Leilani Estates and Laipuna Gardens housing areas near Pahoa, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Hilo, were ordered to evacuate due to at least 22 volcanic cracks that have opened.
