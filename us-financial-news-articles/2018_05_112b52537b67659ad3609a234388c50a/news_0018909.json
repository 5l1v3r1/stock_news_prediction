Under the terms of the acquisition agreement GPT shareholders will receive $27.50 in cash for each share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether GPT's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $33.00 per share, or $5.50 above the offer price. Additionally, in its latest financial release, the Company recognized total revenues of approximately $149.5 million, reflecting an annual increase of 15% when compared to the figures reported in the period of the previous year.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether GPT's Board acted in the best interests of GPT's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
