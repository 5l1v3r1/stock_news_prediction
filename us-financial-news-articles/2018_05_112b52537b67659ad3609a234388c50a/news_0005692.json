If the upcoming U.S. jobs data shows gains in wage rises, that would propel the dollar higher,” said Shinichiro Kadota, senior currency strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.\nElsewhere, the euro received some reprieve after posting its biggest weekly loss in more than two months last week with investors squaring positions before the Q1 GDP data due later in the day.\nEconomists polled by Reuters said they thought the euro zone economy grew 2.5 percent year-on-year in the first three months of 2018, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the previous quarter.\nSterling trod water after falling through the $1.36 line in the previous session as investors further reduced bets of a central bank rate hike next week.\nThe British pound edged 0.2 percent higher at $1.3635 after having fallen to a four-month low of $1.3588 on Tuesday on soft UK manufacturing data.\nOther currencies which have borne the brunt of the dollar’s rally in the last two weeks such as the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and the Swiss franc stabilised on Wednesday, rising between 0.2 to 0.4 percent.
