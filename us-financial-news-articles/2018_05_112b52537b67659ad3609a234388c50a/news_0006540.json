Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, the money in 2016 to keep quiet about the alleged sexual encounter before the presidential election.\nIn an interview on Fox News, Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and longtime friend of Trump, said the president knew about the $130,000 payment and reimbursed Cohen.\n“They funneled it through a law firm and the president repaid it,” Giuliani said.\n“He didn’t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know, but he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this,” Giuliani said.\nHe said the payment did not violate campaign finance laws because it was not drawn from Trump campaign funds.\nFILE PHOTO: A combination photo shows Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels speaking in New York City, and U.S. President Donald Trump speaking in Washington, Michigan, U.S. on April 16, 2018 and April 28, 2018 respectively.

Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.”\nCohen has said he paid Daniels out of his own pocket and was not reimbursed by Trump.\nThe White House has denied Trump had sex with Daniels.\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks to members of the media as he attends the funeral service for U.S. evangelist Billy Graham at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S., March 2, 2018.
