US$550 million to US$2.4 billion at end of 1Q 2018\nBruno Chabas, CEO of SBM Offshore, commented:\n\"SBM Offshore has delivered another solid quarter including financials in line with expectations. Our Lease and Operate business continues to generate significant cash flow. This combined with the conclusion of the Turritella transaction during the quarter, led to a substantial decrease of our net debt position. In Turnkey, activity levels are increasing on the back of two major projects which are progressing according to plan. The market outlook is positive as the industry continues to recover, albeit gradually. In this context, where shorter cycle times are a key value driver, we remain confident that the Fast4Ward TM program will transform our industry, delivering ­­­cost competitiveness for deepwater projects through standardization. The combination of our unique experience, track record of delivery, retained Turnkey capacity, balance sheet and the game-changing Fast4Ward TM program, make the Company well positioned to benefit from this recovery while allowing commercial discipline to be maintained.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nOn January 16, 2018, the FPSO Turritella transaction was completed. Client proceeds were received, debt repaid, loan and swap positions unwound and partner compensation paid. The impact on the Company's Directional net debt from this transaction was a reduction of c. US$460 million.\nDirectional revenues over the first quarter of the year came in at US$385 million compared to US$420 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing a decrease of c. 8%. This was caused by lower Lease and Operate revenues, mainly due to FPSO Turritella leaving the fleet early in the first quarter of 2018. Based on the major orders won during 2017, Turnkey continues to improve year-on-year and showed a revenue increase of US$12 million to a total of US$54 million for the period. Turnkey activity is ramping up on the Castberg turret mooring system. As the FPSO Liza project is 100% owned by SBM Offshore, it did not contribute to Directional revenues in the period as it remained accounted for as capex.\nDirectional net debt decreased by c. US$550 million in the first quarter of the year. This movement was mainly caused by the FPSO Turritella transaction and strong cash flows from the Lease and Operate segment more than offsetting investment in FPSO Liza and the construction cost of the Fast4Ward TM hull.\nProject Review\nFPSO Liza\nWork on FPSO Liza is ongoing and progressing in accordance with project schedule. The vessel is currently undergoing conversion works at the construction yard in Singapore.\nTurret Mooring System (TMS) Johan Castberg FPSO\nWork on the TMS for Statoil's Johan Castberg FPSO is progressing well, in line with schedule. The first steel cut in the Dubai Dry Docks World yard is targeted to be performed during May 2018.\nFast4Ward TM\nOn March 23, 2018 the construction of the first new-build, multi-purpose Fast4Ward TM hull commenced with the celebration of the first steel cut at the construction yard of Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding and Offshore Co., Ltd. in China.\nCompliance\nDiscussions between the Ministry of Transparency, Oversight and Control (Ministério da Transparência, Fiscalização e Controle - \"MTFC\"), the General Counsel for the Republic (Advocacia Geral da União - \"AGU\"), Petrobras and SBM Offshore relating to the leniency agreement remain ongoing. Whilst discussions are ongoing, the MTFC has formally reopened the associated administrative procedure.\nThe damage claim filed by the Federal Prosecutor's Office (Ministério Público Federal - \"MPF\") based on the Brazilian Improbity Act with the Federal Court in Rio de Janeiro against a Brazilian subsidiary of the Company, an intermediate holding company in Switzerland and a number of individuals, including former employees of the SBM Offshore Group remains under review by the court. The claim relates to the alleged improper sales practices prior to 2012 that are also the subject of the discussion with other Brazilian authorities and Petrobras.\nUnder the current circumstances, the Company does not foresee an all-encompassing final resolution in Brazil in the short term and it cannot guarantee that a satisfactory resolution will be reached with the authorities, nor predict the timing thereof.\nPost-Period Events\nDividend\nOn April 11, 2018, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) voted in favor of the proposed US$0.25 per ordinary share dividend distribution, representing an increase of c. 9% compared to last year. The dividend was paid on May 4, 2018 to all shareholders of record as at April 16, 2018. Dividends were paid in Euros using an exchange rate of 1.2380, which equates to €0.2019 per ordinary share.\nGuidance\nThe offshore oil and gas services market is recovering gradually as evidenced by the increased number of offshore projects progressing towards and taking final investment decisions. The oil and gas industry has managed to improve offshore project economics and lower break-even prices to levels that are competitive in today's market reality. The Company continues to believe that oil will remain one of the main energy sources for the short to medium term, with gas remaining a source for longer, while the energy industry is going through transition towards more sustainable energy sources in the long term.\n2018 Directional revenue guidance is maintained at around US$1.9 billion, with around US$1.3 billion from Lease and Operate and around US$600 million from Turnkey. 2018 Directional EBITDA guidance is also maintained at around US$750 million. This excludes the gain on the sale of FPSO Turritella and an expected positive impact from implementation of IFRS 16.\nThe guidance assumes a partial sell-down of the Company's ownership share of FPSO Liza, which remains subject to negotiation and Management decision.\nConference Call\nSBM Offshore has scheduled a conference call followed by a Q&A session on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 18:30 (CEST).\nThe call will be hosted by Bruno Chabas (CEO), Philippe Barril (COO), Erik Lagendijk (CGCO) and Douglas Wood (CFO).
