The move drew a scathing response from President Tayyip Erdogan and ministers from his Islamist-rooted ruling AK Party.\n“Is it your place to make such remarks? We see this only as a reflection of your ignorance. You are no different than Daesh (Islamic State) ... No matter how much you attack what’s sacred to us, we will not do the same. We are not despicable,” Erdogan said in a speech.\nFrance has been one of the most vocal critics of Turkey’s military operation in northern Syria against the Kurdish YPG, which Turkey considers a terrorist organization.\nAnkara has said that a French pledge to help stabilize a region controlled by Kurdish-dominated forces amounted to support for terrorism and could make France a “target of Turkey”.
