The co-pilot and one cabin crew member suffered minor injuries, but no passengers were harmed.\nChinese authorities said Airbus has assigned a team to provide technical support for the investigation into the cause of the incident.\nAirbus didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has delivered nearly 1,500 A319s globally, according to its website.\nSichuan Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines , the country’s biggest state-run carrier in terms of fleet size, confirmed that the aircraft had experienced a “mechanical failure,” but didn’t provide additional details.\nPictures circulated on social media showed the plane missing a windshield, though the aircraft appeared otherwise undamaged. The jetliner in question was less than seven years old, according to aviation website planespotters.net.\nSichuan Airlines, and Chinese commercial aviation in general, have a good safety record. Foreign pilots working in the country say Chinese airlines are extremely cautious about letting planes take off with even very minor technical issues, and that this focus on safety contributes to the chronic flight delays at Chinese airports.\nSichuan Airlines is primarily a regional carrier serving western China, though it has been adding long-haul international routes. In late 2016, it began flying directly to Vancouver, Canada from Zhengzhou, a city about 400 miles south of Beijing.\n—Chunying Zhang contributed to this article.\nWrite to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:55:00.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
