(NASDAQ: PULM) today reports its first quarter results.\n\"We reached a major milestone for our Pulmazole program in the first quarter with the initiation of dosing in our phase 1/1b study. With a financing that closed in April, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet by bringing in gross proceeds of $15.9 million,\" said Robert W. Clarke, Ph.D. , chief executive officer of Pulmatrix.\nFinancials\nAs of March 31, 2018, Pulmatrix had $1.55 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $3.6 million as of December 31, 2017. In early April 2018, Pulmatrix completed a financing that resulted in $15.9 million total gross proceeds, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses.\nPulmatrix generated $0.2 million of revenues in the first quarter of 2018, compared to no revenue for the first quarter of 2017. The revenue for the first quarter of 2018 resulted from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics award related to our Pulmazole program.\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.2 million, compared to $1.7 million for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to increases in clinical development costs and external service costs on the Pulmazole and PUR1800 projects. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.0 million, compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased employment costs and increased patent costs relating to the in-licensed Respivert compounds.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.2 million compared to a net loss of $3.5 million in the same period last year. The increase in net loss was attributable to the noted operating expense increases.\nAbout Pulmatrix\nPulmatrix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary disease using its patented iSPERSE™ technology.
