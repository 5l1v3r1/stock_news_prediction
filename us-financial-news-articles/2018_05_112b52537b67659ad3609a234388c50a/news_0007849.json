Research firm DesRosiers Automotive Consultants said number of passenger cars sold fell 12.4 percent in the month to 58,083 vehicles with Fiat Chrysler and General Motors recording a drop in overall sales.\nIn contrast, number of light trucks sold in Canada rose 2.2 percent.\n“Despite the market’s orientation towards light-duty trucks, we still saw lower sales – and in some cases significantly lower sales – at each of the Detroit-based companies, which is somewhat counter-intuitive,” said David Adams, President of the Global Automakers of Canada.\n“The weather in April has been decidedly cool across most of the country – perhaps delaying the traditional spring market a bit.”\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s Canadian unit said its total vehicle sales fell 16 percent in April from a year earlier, hurt by a steep decline in demand for its Ram Truck Brand from a year earlier.\nA bulk of the company’s vehicle business came from a more than 200 percent rise in the number of Alfa Romeo cars sold. Jeep SUV and crossover sales also rose 5 percent.\nFord Canada’s total sales fell 1.2 percent to 30,045 vehicles.\nRival General Motors said its total vehicle sales in Canada fell 4.6 percent to 29,537 vehicles, hurt by a 6.3 percent fall in Chevrolet sales.
