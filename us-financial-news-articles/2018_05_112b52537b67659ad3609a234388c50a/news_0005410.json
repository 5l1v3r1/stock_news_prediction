Airbnb rentals accounted for slightly more than 4 percent of total residential units in those areas.\nThose same areas saw rents rise most rapidly. In Chelsea, rent rose 21.6 percent or $398 per month between 2009 and 2016. In Greenpoint and Williamsburg, rent rose by 18.6 percent or $659 per month.\nNew York City Airbnb rentals are no longer at highs, but in many cases those rentals are still illegal. After a 2014 report found that three-quarters of Airbnb listings in the city were in violation of regulations, Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2016 signed a bill allowing hosts to be fined up to $7,500 for violating regulations, The New York Times reported.\nFor its part, Airbnb has been proactive in removing what it calls \"bad actors\" — or those hosts who violate local laws or company policy. Since November 2016, it has removed close to 5,000 bad actors in New York City, alone, according to a spokesperson.\nFollowing Cuomo's signing of the bill, Airbnb listings declined from their highs. But Comptroller Stinger's report demonstrates those listings are actively impacting rent increases — legal or not.\n\"Airbnb has grown exponentially at the expense of New Yorkers who face rising rents and the risk of being pushed out of communities they helped build. If we're going to preserve the character of our neighborhoods and expand our middle class, we have to put people before profits. It's that simple,\" Stringer said.\nAirbnb took issue with the methodology behind the findings of Stringer's report. The online hospitality marketplace argued that most hosts share their homes, rather than removing permanent housing from the market, and that rising rental rates cannot be attributed to Airbnb when prices have been rising for decades.\n\"This mistakes correlation for causation, and it is deeply problematic,\" a company blog post said.\nIn the aftermath of the comptroller's study, Airbnb filed a Freedom of Information Law request with New York City's comptroller office. It hopes to acquire communications on the development of the report.\n\"Additionally, other information has been brought to our attention and we have reason to believe that this report was influenced by powerful special interests,\" said Chris Lehane, head of global policy for Airbnb.\nAirbnb has sparred with regulators across the globe, but Chief Executive Brian Chesky in February seemed to be changing his approach to responsibility for how the company can impact housing markets and neighborhoods.\n\"When Airbnb started 10 years ago it was kind of the culture that you really can't take responsibility for what happens on your platform,\" he said. \"We changed our point of view.\"\nChesky's February statements represent an evolution for the company, which previously defended itself as a passive technology platform, not responsible for what homes it listed or how they were used.\n—Reuters contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Airbnb co-founder: We're a responsible actor in homesharing regulations show chapters Airbnb co-founder: We're a responsible actor in homesharing regulations 8:33 PM ET Thu, 22 Feb 2018 | 03:22", "external_links": ["https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/868/new-york--ny", "https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/the-impact-of-airbnb-on-nyc-rents/", "https://www.airdna.co/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/technology/new-york-passes-law-airbnb.html"], "published": "2018-05-04T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:16:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
