He has over 17 years of strategic advisory experience. Before UBS, he held senior roles in healthcare investment banking at Citigroup Global Markets and Credit Suisse.\nTransaction activity in healthcare services has increased dramatically due to several sector tailwinds including technology disruption, innovative new business models, vertical integration, regulatory and reimbursement changes, consumerism in healthcare and favorable demographics. Mr. Crowell will work to capitalize on these trends and advance Macquarie Capital as a market leading advisor and underwriter for healthcare services and technology-enabled healthcare companies.\n“Bo brings to Macquarie Capital deep and diverse advisory experience for healthcare services companies and possesses both the industry insight and relationships to build and lead our business in the Americas” said Michael Silverton, Head of Macquarie Capital Americas. “Expanding our expertise to incorporate healthcare services builds on our strong track record of advising service industries and gives us a presence in the largest market for healthcare services.”\nMr. Crowell will focus on mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity capital raisings and providing customized solutions to clients that may incorporate Macquarie Capital’s principal investing capability. His past transactions include: the acquisition of Coventry by Aetna, sale of Health Plan Services to Wipro, the sale of ATI Physical Therapy to Advent International and financing for Hellman & Friedman’s acquisition of Multiplan Inc.\nMr. Crowell’s hiring follows the appointment of Julian Feneley , who joined Macquarie Capital in London last year. They will complement Macquarie Capital’s healthcare activities in Australia, Germany and Asia. Mr. Crowell will also work closely with Macquarie Capital sector teams in technology, services and insurance, to both serve broad client needs across the healthcare sector and to leverage the deep expertise that Macquarie has established in these areas.\nMacquarie Capital has advised a range of healthcare and healthcare-related clients in the technology and insurance industries. The firm advised Centerbridge Partners on its acquisition of Superior Vision Corporation, was a joint bookrunner on the $1.7 billion financing in KKR’s acquisition of WebMD Health Corp, was a principal co-investor in Summit Partners’ acquisition of HealthSun Health Plans, China Resources’ Investment in GenesisCare and is an investor in several healthcare companies, including Vision Group Holdings and Compassus.\nAbout Macquarie Group\nMacquarie Group (Macquarie) is a global provider of banking, financial, advisory, investment and funds management services.
