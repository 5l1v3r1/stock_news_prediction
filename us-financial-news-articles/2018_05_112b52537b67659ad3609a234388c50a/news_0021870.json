REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nProsecutors are looking into possible evasion of capital gains tax worth about 10 billion won (6.8 million pounds) in relation to the transfer of shares of an LG affiliate, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said in a text message to reporters.\nA spokesman at LG Corp, the group’s holding company, had no immediate comment.\nThe probe into the country’s fourth-biggest conglomerate by assets would be the latest in a string of troubles faced by families controlling the country’s conglomerates, known as chaebols.\nA tantrum by the heiress of Korean Air Lines Co Ltd earlier this year reignited public anger at the behaviour of the rich and powerful, and sparked investigations into her family and its businesses.\nThe liberal government of Moon Jae-in has pledged to pursue chaebol reform, urging them to improve governance structures to improve transparency and fair competition.
