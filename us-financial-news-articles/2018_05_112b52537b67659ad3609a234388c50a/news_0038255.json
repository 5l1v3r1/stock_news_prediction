(NASDAQ: ALDX) (Aldeyra), a biotechnology company devoted to development of next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We are pleased with our progress in the first quarter, as we continued to advance our product pipeline for the treatment of immunological diseases,\" stated Todd C. Brady, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO of Aldeyra. \"Our research collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovation to develop novel drug candidates for systemic inflammatory diseases, the initiation of late-stage clinical testing in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, and the poster presentations of our ocular inflammation programs, all highlight the promise of our platform across a number of product candidates and indications. We look forward to multiple milestones over the next year, including Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical results in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, respectively.\"\nRecent Highlights\nReproxalap, a novel late-stage product candidate focused on a broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases, continued to progress.\nIn January 2018, Aldeyra initiated the enrollment of a Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with dry eye disease (DED). The trial will assess two concentrations of topical reproxalap (0.1% and 0.25%) against vehicle over 12 weeks of treatment in 300 patients with moderate DED. Consistent with Aldeyra's Phase 2a DED clinical trial, endpoints will include standard signs and symptoms characteristic of the disease. Results from the trial are expected to be announced in the second half of 2018.\nIn April 2018, Aldeyra enrolled the first patient in a Phase 3 allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial. The multi-center, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled trial is expected to enroll 300 patients, randomized equally to receive either topical ocular 0.25% reproxalap, 0.5% reproxalap, or vehicle in a conjunctival allergen challenge model of acute allergic conjunctivitis. The primary outcome measure will be patient-reported ocular itching. Results from the trial are expected in the second half of 2018, or early 2019.\nResearch collaboration initiated with Johnson & Johnson Innovation to advance immune-modulating drugs for systemic inflammatory diseases . In February 2018, Aldeyra entered into an agreement with Janssen Research & Development, LLC (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to collaborate with Janssen on the development of novel product candidates designed to sequester pro-inflammatory reactive aldehyde species (RASP). The agreement is intended to advance existing analogs of reproxalap for the treatment of systemic inflammatory diseases.\nReproxalap and ADX-103, novel RASP scavengers, featured in a podium presentation and three posters at the 2018 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting. In May 2018, Aldeyra held a podium presentation on the Phase 2a clinical trial results of reproxalap in DED. In addition, Aldeyra presented a poster on the Phase 2b clinical trial results of reproxalap in allergic conjunctivitis, as well as two posters demonstrating activity of reproxalap and ADX-103 in preclinical models of pan-ocular and retinal inflammation, diabetic macular edema, and dry age-related macular degeneration.\nDavid McMullin joins Aldeyra as Senior Vice President Corporate Development and Strategy. In May 2018, Aldeyra hired David McMullin to oversee Aldeyra's commercial planning, corporate development, and business development activities. Formerly of Shire plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, and Novartis AG, Mr. McMullin brings extensive experience leading business development, strategic planning, commercial, and operational activities in the biopharmaceutical industry.\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Review\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Aldeyra reported a net loss of approximately $8.4 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $5.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.43 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.37 per share for the same period in 2017. Losses have resulted from the costs of Aldeyra's clinical trials and research and development programs, as well as from general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $6.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $3.2 million is primarily related to the increase in research and development expenditures, including manufacturing, preclinical, and clinical development costs, and an increase in personnel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.7 million for the quarter ended 2017. The increase of $0.2 million is primarily related to an increase in legal and patent-related costs, rent, consulting costs, and personnel costs.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total operating expenses were approximately $8.5 million, compared to total operating expenses of approximately $5.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $38.9 million as of March 31, 2018.\nConference Call & Webcast Information\nAldeyra will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to discuss the results. The dial-in numbers are 1-877-266-8979 for domestic callers and 1-412-317-5231 for international callers. A live webcast of the conference call will also be available on the investor relations page of the Aldeyra Therapeutics corporate website at www.aldeyra.com . After the live webcast, the event will remain archived on the Aldeyra Therapeutics website for one year.\nAbout Aldeyra Therapeutics\nAldeyra Therapeutics is developing next-generation medicines to improve the lives of patients with immune-mediated diseases. Aldeyra's lead product candidate, reproxalap, is a first-in-class treatment in late-stage development for dry eye disease and other forms of ocular inflammation. Aldeyra is leveraging its experience in ocular inflammation to develop other product candidates for systemic inflammatory disease. None of Aldeyra's product candidates have been approved for sale in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nAbout Dry Eye Disease\nDry eye disease is a common and chronic inflammatory disease estimated to affect approximately 20 million people in the United States, and is characterized by insufficient moisture in the anterior surface of the eye, leading to dryness, inflammation, pain, discomfort, irritation, and, in severe cases, decreased vision. Among physicians and patients, existing therapy for dry eye disease is generally regarded as inadequate.\nAbout Allergic Conjunctivitis\nAllergic conjunctivitis is a common allergic disease that affects 20% or more of the population worldwide. The disease is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva (a membrane covering part of the front of the eye), resulting in ocular itching, excessive tear production, lid swelling, and redness. Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic conjunctivitis, but use is limited by lack of durable activity and ocular dryness.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding Aldeyra's strategy, future operations, future, prospects, plans, and objectives and Aldeyra's plans and expectations for its product candidates.
