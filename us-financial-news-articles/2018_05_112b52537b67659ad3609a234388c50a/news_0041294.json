Director Yoon Jong-bin poses.\nThe spy thriller was shot between January and July 2017, around the time when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered a series of missile and nuclear tests, rattling neighbouring nations and the new U.S. administration.\nSince then, relations have thawed and the film premiered at the days before the North and South were due to hold high-level talks to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.\nBut hours before the talks were due to start on Wednesday, the North called them off, complaining that the United States was pushing it for “Libya-style” denuclearisation.\nHollywood Reporter critic Deborah Young said: “... for sheer topicality, the film is hard to beat, and to find a full-blown entertainment yarn in Cannes ... that’s partially set in newsworthy North Korea is rather astounding.”\nThe script is based on the personal notes of a South Korean spy, Park Suk-young, known as “Black Venus”, who posed as a businessman to infiltrate the North and get information on its nuclear programme.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nFor the South Korean cast and crew of “The Spy Gone North”, current events were never far from their minds.\n“When I read the script for the first time, I made a joke to the director, saying: is it possible to actually produce this movie?” said actor Lee Sung-min who plays an aide to the North’s former leader, Kim Jong Il.\n“Since then, the relationship has improved, but if tensions had remained as they were before, this movie could have been a very problematic one,” he told Reuters in an interview conducted before the cancellation of Wednesday’s talks.\nHwang Jung-min, who plays Black Venus, said he hoped the film would help foreign audiences understand Korean history, and how there is no “fun” in and “no need” for political war games.\nAsked if he thought Kim would watch his movie, director Yoon Jong-bin replied: “It would be nice”.\nThe runs to May 19.
