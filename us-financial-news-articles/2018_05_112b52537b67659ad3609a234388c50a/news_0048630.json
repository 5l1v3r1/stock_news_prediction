The Company's peptide or nucleic acid-based immunotherapeutic products comprise multiple naturally processed epitopes (NPEs) that are designed to comprehensively stimulate a patient's killer T cells and helper T cells, and to restore or further augment antigen presentation using proprietary nucleic acid-based expression systems. This unique approach can produce off-the-shelf T cell vaccine candidates that elicit a broad-based T cell response and can be used without respect to HLA type. The Company's technologies may be used as stand-alone medications or in combination with other treatment modalities. TapImmune has announced a proposed merger with Marker Therapeutics, Inc., a privately-held clinical-stage developer of a transformative, non-genetically engineered, multi-antigen T cell therapy platform, which will add a significant portfolio of clinical-stage cell therapies to create a leading immuno-oncology pipeline.\nFor additional information, please visit: https://tapimmune.com/ .\nTo receive future press releases via email, please visit:\nhttps://tapimmune.com/investors/email-alerts/ .\nFollow us on Twitter @Tapimmune_Inc , or follow us on Facebook .\nFor answers to frequently asked questions, please visit our FAQs page: https://tapimmune.com/investors/frequently-asked-questions/ .\nForward-Looking Statement Disclaimer\nThis release contains forward-looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
