It follows a Lifetime biopic made for the 2011 wedding of William and Kate.\n“One of the reasons that we love them so much is because they are a unifying force in a very divisive time,” said co-writer Scarlett Lacey.\nFraser, who had to drop his broad Scottish accent to play Harry, said he did not want to do a mere copycat of the tall, ginger-haired prince.\n“I really wanted to see him as a human being who just happens to be a prince,” Fraser said.\nFitz-Henley said she saw Markle as “a really great example of confidence.”\nMarkle and Harry were not consulted in the making of the film, but the producers say the couple are aware of it and the producers hope they will see it.\n“We admire them as a couple, so we hope they watch it and they think it is funny and sweet,” said Michele Weiss, one of the executive producers.
