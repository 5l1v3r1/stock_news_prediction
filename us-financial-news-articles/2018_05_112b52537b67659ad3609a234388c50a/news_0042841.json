I didn’t expect to have these emotions already during qualifying here,” said Zarco. “For sure, I wanted to be fast, but when I saw the 31.185 on the dashboard I was surprised myself.”\nFactory Ducati riders Andrea Dovizioso and Jorge Lorenzo qualified fifth and sixth with Italian Andrea Iannone fourth on a Suzuki. Italian great Valentino Rossi qualified ninth.\nBritain’s Cal Crutchlow, a race winner in Argentina last month, had a big crash and was taken to hospital for checks. The LCR Honda rider will start 13th if fit to compete.
