He said two other laborers died in a landslide in an another mine nearby. It was not immediately clear if that was caused by the explosion.\nAccidents are frequent in the province’s mines, where safety measures are basic and much of whose workforce is drawn from laborers from other parts of Pakistan.\nThe mines are mostly owned by state-run Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation, which leases many of them to private contractors.\nThe country has huge coal reserves estimated at more than 184 billion tonnes. It produces 4 million tonnes of coal annually, most of which is consumed by brick-making kilns.\nThe Marwar coalfields lie some 60 km (35 miles) east of Baluchistan’s capital Quetta.
