These citizens were murdered for protesting against injustice. My thoughts & prayers are with the families of these martyrs and the injured,” Gandhi said in a tweet.\nLocal TV showed police trying to disperse the crowd with tear gas and water cannons. Smoke rose from several parts of the sleepy port city near the tip of the Indian peninsula.\nState Minister D. Jayakumar in a televised address on Tuesday said police have fired on protesters and that it was “unavoidable”. PLAN TO DOUBLE OUTPUT\nThe plant, which can produce 400,000 tonnes of copper a year, has been shut for more than 50 days and will remain closed until at least June 6 because the local pollution regulator will not allow it to operate due to alleged non-compliance with environmental rules.\nEnvironmental activists and some local politicians want the government to shut the plant down permanently.\n“The inaction of the government has led to the people’s protests, and police resorting to firing to control it. Action should be taken to shut down the plant immediately to address this issue,” M.K. Stalin, leader of the main opposition group in Tamil Nadu, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, said in a Facebook post.\nVedanta says the protests are based on “false allegations” and that it plans to double capacity at the smelter to 800,000 tonnes per year.\n“We would like to restart the plant as soon as possible, in a peaceful manner,” P Ramnath, chief executive of Vedanta Ltd’s copper business told Reuters.\nThe plant was shut for more than two months in 2013 by an Indian environmental court after residents complained about emissions.
