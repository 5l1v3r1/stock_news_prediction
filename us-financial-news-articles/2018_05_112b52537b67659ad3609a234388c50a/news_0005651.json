Mr. Carter had no role in that reporting or Iconix’s other actions as a public company,” a representative for Jay-Z said in a statement to CNBC.\n“Mr. Carter is private citizen who should not be involved in this matter,” the statement said.\nIn November, Carter failed to appear after an initial SEC order. In February, the SEC issued a second subpoena for Carter’s testimony. He declined to appear or provide any dates on which he would be available, the SEC statement said.\nJay-Z continued as chief creative officer of the Rocawear brand after the 2007 sale. Iconix also entered a separate joint venture with the rapper as part of the sale to identify brands to be acquired or developed.
