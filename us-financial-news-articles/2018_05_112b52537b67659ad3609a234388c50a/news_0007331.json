The FAA said another group of CFM56-7B engines will need to be inspected by August under the regulation. The FAA also said it is requiring repeat inspections of engines as part of Tuesdayâ€™s action. The announcement comes the same day President Donald Trump is set to meet with passengers and the flight crew at the White House of Southwest Flight 1380.
