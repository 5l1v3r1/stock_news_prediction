REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko President Cyril Ramaphosa, who came to power in February when former leader Jacob Zuma was ousted by his own party, has pledged to redistribute land without compensation, a move popular with poorer black voters ahead of an election next year.\nThe African National Congress (ANC) on Monday said it would “test the argument” that land redistribution without compensation is permitted under current laws, which would avoid the risky strategy of trying to change the constitution.\nRelated Coverage South Africa's ANC to 'test constitution' on land expropriation “Ramaphosa is working hard to defuse this issue. There is a carefully calculated move to work within the current legal framework,” said political analyst Daniel Silke.\nFILE PHOTO: Residents walk through crowded shacks in Khayelitsha township, near Cape Town, South Africa July 9, 2012. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/File Photo “Changing the constitution over an issue that can be dealt with under current laws would be a red flag to a bull with foreign and domestic investors.”\nWith parliamentary elections next year, accelerating land reform will help to nullify the threat of the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a party whose push for radical wealth redistribution is attractive to disillusioned ANC supporters.\nThe EFF says the constitution must be changed to ensure radical redistribution of land and other parts of the economy from the white minority to the black majority.\nCattle graze at a farm in Delmas, in Mpumalanga province, South Africa May 20, 2018. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko “The ANC has become disposed to expropriate without compensation precisely because of pressure from the EFF,” said Lesiba Teffo, political analyst and a professor at the University of South Africa.\n“I think the majority of the people will be happy with a measured approach. The EFF has overplayed the race card.”\nSome investors are concerned that the ANC’s reforms will result in white farmers being stripped of land to the detriment of the economy, although Ramaphosa has repeatedly said any changes will not compromise food security or growth.\nExperts say South Africa will not repeat the violent land seizures seen in neighbouring Zimbabwe.\nReporting by Joe Brock, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:10:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
