That would amount to total annual savings of around 3.5 billion euros for employees and employers, he said.\nThe majority of the 800,000 job vacancies registered in May were permanent, full-time jobs subject to social security contributions. Workers were mainly sought in construction, transportation and warehousing as well as social and health care.\nThe rock-solid labour market is likely to further boost consumer confidence and household spending in Europe’s biggest economy, which has seen domestic demand overtake exports as its main growth driver in recent years.\nKfW economist Joerg Zeuner said German companies had become more cautious due to trade frictions with the United States.\n“However, an end to the upswing is not yet in sight. Companies in all sectors of the economy are still hiring,” he added.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber and Holger Hansen; Editing by Maria Sheahan and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:11:57.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
