Futures contracts have already been created,” Carney said in a speech delivered at Bloomberg’s offices in London.\n“We can expect Floating Rate Notes and loans referencing SONIA to follow. The end point should be an ecosystem for interest rate markets which has an altogether healthier foundation than at present.”\nAfter banks were fined for rigging Libor, an interest rate the industry compiled itself at the time, central banks sought alternatives that were harder to manipulate.\nThe BoE took over responsibility for Sonia in 2016 and wants it to replace Libor completely by the end of 2021. Sonia reflects bank and building societies’ overnight funding rates in the sterling unsecured market.\nCarney also said more needed to be done to counter misconduct in the financial sector.
