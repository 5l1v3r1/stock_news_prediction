The development is a boon to companies looking to borrow cheaply while the economy is doing well. But regulators are raising red flags, particularly since rising interest rates may make it harder for businesses to pay off the loans.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, in a report last week identified the easing of commercial loan standards as a top risk in the industry. While the rate of bad business loans remains very low and most banks still have a moderate risk appetite, the regulator said that over the past year it privately issued more warnings ordering financial institutions to modify their business-lending practices.\n“The worst loans are often made in the best of times,” Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting warned on Thursday.\nBanks became more conservative lenders following the financial crisis, tightening standards in some sectors to focus on loans that are, for instance, secured by a business’s inventory or energy reserves, and typically would have to be paid back first in the event of a bankruptcy. Around 2013, terms started loosening a bit, the OCC said.\nThen, in late 2016, banks’ commercial-loan growth slowed sharply for reasons that still aren’t clear . The annual growth rate was 1.3% at the end of 2017, down from 12% three years earlier.\nRelated Video The retail banking industry is undergoing another major shift, and the future looks high-tech, sophisticated, and, for big banks, very urban. So what has changed? Photo: Shaumbé Wright/The Wall Street Journal Eager for loan growth to fuel profits, banks since then have been loosening standards further to attract business, the OCC said. They are extending interest-only periods, allowing borrowers to draw down bigger portions of the value of collateral and relaxing covenants meant to protect from losses, the agency said. Many large banks are also lowering rates over their cost of funds, according to the Federal Reserve.\nThe developments appear to have revived commercial loan growth , which has risen to a 3% annual rate as of mid-May.\nBut regulators are clamping down. The number of outstanding Matters Requiring Attention, or MRAs—citations the OCC gives when it wants a bank to modify its practices—involving underwriting commercial loans rose 24% from the first quarter of 2017 through the first quarter of 2018, the agency said. MRAs involving banks making exceptions to their typical policies governing commercial lending rose 45% over that same period.\nThe regulator didn’t say which specific banks received MRAs, though if left unresolved the citations can lead to a public enforcement action.\nBusiness-loan rates are generally pegged to benchmark interest rates, which are rising. Eventually, that “could affect affordability of current debt service requirements or refinance ability,” the OCC said.\nBanks aren’t necessarily diving back into the riskier categories of business loans that they gave up after the crisis. Instead, they are becoming more aggressive in making the types of loans they consider safe, recent lending practices show. The shift is turning up in businesses in industries that banks were recently wary of, like retail and energy.\nIn 2016, nonbank lender Encina Business Credit started operating with a business strategy of making asset-based loans to distressed companies that banks shied away from. Bill Kearney, senior managing director at the firm, said in the past year banks are increasingly outbidding Encina and other nonbank lenders on loans to struggling retailers.\nRelated Reading\nMain Street Banks’ New Lending Rivals: Hedge Funds and Private Equity The Economy Is Humming, but Businesses Aren’t Borrowing (Nov. 26) Why Banks Haven’t Been Burned by Retail’s Meltdown (May 28, 2017) When accessories retailer Charming Charlie LLC emerged from bankruptcy in late April, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. gave it a five-year, $35 million asset-backed loan, according to court documents.\nThat Pittsburgh-based bank also offered a similar loan to teen retailer Rue21 Inc., which emerged from bankruptcy in September, people familiar with the matter said. But Rue21’s current lender, Bank of America Corp., agreed to increase the company’s asset-backed loan from $125 million to around $140 million, the Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nBanks feel comfortable with the loans, which are backed by assets like stores’ inventories or accounts receivable, because they have proven to be extremely safe , according to a 2017 Journal analysis of bankruptcy documents. Even in cases when retailers have gone bankrupt, banks have generally been repaid in full.\nLenders initially pulled back from similar loans in the energy industry backed by oil and gas reserves in 2015 and 2016 when prices fell. Now the pendulum is swinging the other way: most of these new loans in the energy sector now allow for higher levels of debt relative to some earnings measures, said Buddy Clark, a partner at law firm Haynes and Boone LLP.\nMore than 80% of energy borrowers were expected to see their borrowing capacity increase from late 2017, according to an April survey from the law firm.\n—Soma Biswas contributed to this article.​\nWrite to Rachel Louise Ensign at rachel.ensign@wsj.com and Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:52:59.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
