The Wells Fargo Bank facility is comprised of a term loan of $50.0 million and a revolver of $5.0 million. The proceeds from the new loan were used in part to pay off the amounts outstanding under the existing term loan agreement, which bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus 8.25% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Borrowing under the new Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company’s selection, of either (i) Base Rate plus a margin of 3.5% to 2.0% or (ii) a LIBOR plus a margin of 4.5% to 3.0%, with margin steps down based upon on the Company’s leverage ratio. With this refinancing, Model N will have a 45% to 64% reduction in LIBOR margin.\nFinancial Impact of Debt Refinancing and Interest Rate\nExcluding any prepayment penalty, Model N anticipates the new loan to reduce its cash interest payment by approximately $0.8 million for the remainder of fiscal 2018. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect to incur a one-time charge of approximately $3.2 million in connection with the refinancing, of which approximately $1.7 million is non-cash unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs write-off and $1.5 million in prepayment penalty. These amounts will be recorded as interest expense.\nBusiness Highlights:\nAstraZeneca subscribed to Revenue Cloud for Pharma for their U.S. business. Upon go-live, AstraZeneca will complete their On-Premise Transition (OPT) and become the first major pharmaceutical company to run their global business on Revenue Cloud for Pharma.

Further information on risks that could affect Model N’s results is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, and any current reports on Form 8-K that we may file from time to time. Should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could expectations. Model N assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update any such after the date of this release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\nOur reported results include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net (loss) income per share, and adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP gross profit excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition & integration related expenses, deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of intangible assets. Non-GAAP loss from operations and non-GAAP net loss exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and acquisition & integration related expenses, deferred revenue adjustment and valuation allowance resulting from Revitas acquisition as they are often excluded by other companies to help investors understand the operational performance of their business and, in the case of stock-based compensation, can be difficult to predict and therefore we have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted Non-GAAP results with GAAP. In addition, stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period and company to company due to such things as differing valuation methodologies and changes in stock price. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss, adjusted depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition & integration related expenses, deferred revenue adjustment, interest (income) expense, net, and other (income) expenses, net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. Reconciliation tables are provided in this press release.\nModel N Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nAs of March 31, 2018\nAs of September 31, 2017\nAssets

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Model N uses non-GAAP measures of adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, loss from operations, net loss, weighted average shares outstanding and net loss per share, which are adjusted to exclude certain legal expenses, Channel Insight and Revitas acquisition related costs, deferred revenue adjustment and valuation allowance resulting from Revitas acquisition, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and includes dilutive shares where applicable. We believe these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future. These adjustments to our current period GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of Model N’s underlying operating results and trends and our marketplace performance. The non-GAAP results are an indication of our baseline performance that are considered by management for the purpose of making operational decisions. In addition, these non-GAAP results are the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating loss, net loss or basic and diluted net loss per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and are subject to limitations.\nWhile a large component of our expenses incurred in certain periods, we believe investors may want to exclude the effects of these items in order to compare our financial performance with that of other companies and between time periods:\n(a) Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash item. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(b) Amortization of intangible assets resulted principally from acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization is a non-cash item. As such, we believe exclusion of these expenses provides for a better comparison of our operation results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(c) In January 2017, we acquired Revitas, as part of the acquisition we incurred certain non-recurring integration costs. We believe that exclusion of these acquisition related adjustments and costs provides for a better comparison of our operation results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(d) Represents deferred revenue adjustment resulting from purchase price accounting that is related to the Revitas acquisition and is a non-cash item. As such, we believe this adjustment provides for a better comparison of our operation results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006570/en/\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nICR for Model N\nStaci Mortenson, 650-610-4998\ninvestorrelations@modeln.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\npr@modeln.com\nSource: Model N, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006570/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.modeln.com&esheet=51803028&newsitemid=20180508006570&lan=en-US&anchor=www.modeln.com&index=1&md5=4a3dc047ab8ae56d4d58e5ebddef12cd"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:02:37.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
