The euro zone crisis prompted bailouts of Greece, Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Portugal, financed in large party by Germany, Europe’s biggest creditor.\n“Italy (illustrates that) when we react too late to the causes of crises, we generate undesirable phenomena like populism, extremism and nationalism,” Costa said, standing next to Merkel. “Europe needs to work quickly to avoid and prevent situations like this.”\nOn Wednesday Italian President Sergio Mattarella gave more time to the leaders of the far-right League and anti-establishment Five Star Movement to make another attempt at forming a government after months of crisis.\nGlobal financial markets were more stable on Thursday after falling earlier this week on the spectre of another Italian election dominated by debate over Italy’s future in the euro zone.\n“Sadly (Italy) has shown that we are all indirectly hit when there is a specific problem in one of our countries,” Costa said.\nMerkel said she would work with a new Italian government.\n“In Italy we’re waiting for the government to form, I want to reach out to the new government in an open-minded way,” she said.\nPortugal became a poster child for adopting harsh austerity during its bailout, which has resulted in strong economic growth and rising foreign investment, including from German companies.\nBosch has invested more than 300 million euros in the last two years on a plant in the city of Braga, which Merkel visited on Wednesday.\nVolkswagen is the biggest German company in Portugal, having invested around 3 billion euros over the past 20 years in its Autoeropa plant near Lisbon, including last year’s expansion worth 700 million to make the new T-Roc sport utility vehicle.
