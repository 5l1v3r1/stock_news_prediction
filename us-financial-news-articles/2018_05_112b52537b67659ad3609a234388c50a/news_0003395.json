Five banks— Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and UBS AG —pleaded guilty in May 2015 and paid $5.6 billion in penalties to resolve investigations into whether the banks worked together to manipulate foreign currency prices.\nIn a separate case that grew out of the investigations, prosecutors in July charged two HSBC Holdings PLC employees with fraudulently front-running a $3.5 billion currency trade for a client. The HSBC traders have pleaded not guilty.\n—Telis Demos contributed to this article.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T00:30:56.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
