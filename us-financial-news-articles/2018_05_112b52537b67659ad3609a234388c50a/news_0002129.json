GAAP and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits from higher volume, strong operational performance, higher pension income, a lower share count and the benefit of tax reform. GAAP EPS also included a change in deferred taxes offset by charges related to transitioning and exiting a commercial business and other items. Orders increased 27%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2.\nYear-to-date revenue increased 4%, with growth across all segments. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits from higher volume, strong operational performance, higher pension income, a lower share count and tax gains, partially offset by the ADS-B program transition in the first half of the year. GAAP EPS also includes adjustments incurred in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. Orders increased 25%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2.\nCommunication Systems\n($ millions) Third Quarter Year to Date FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Revenue $ 481 $ 461 4 % $ 1,380 $ 1,304 6 % Operating income $ 147 $ 140 5 % $ 409 $ 379 8 % Operating margin 30.6 % 30.4 % 20bps 29.6 % 29.1 % 50bps Revenue increased 4% in the third quarter from growth in Tactical Communications and Night Vision. Tactical Communications revenue grew 3% with DoD Tactical up 48% on strong readiness demand from the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, partially offset by a 12% decline in International Tactical, reflecting a tough year-over-year comparison. Night Vision revenue grew double digits on increased demand from the U.S. Army. Operating income grew 5% and margins expanded 20 bps on increased volume and operational efficiencies.\nCommunication Systems order momentum continued in the third quarter, marking the seventh straight quarter of year-over-year orders growth for the segment.\nDoD Tactical orders grew 27% from readiness and modernization initiatives on ground and airborne platforms. Key orders included: Upgrade of vehicular radio systems for the U.S. Air Force Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles Single-Channel Ground and Airborne Radio Systems (SINCGARS) for the U.S. Army Highband Networking Radios TM for the U.S. Army's upper tactical network International Tactical orders grew 15% with several key wins, including an award from an Asian nation to integrate, modernize and upgrade their command and control network and multiple orders across several countries supporting security forces modernization, counter-terrorism and border control. Public Safety orders grew 28% on increased demand from state and local agencies for legacy system upgrades, including the Washington State Department of Transportation and the cities of San Antonio and Miami Beach. Night Vision orders grew 10% on momentum with the U.S. Army, receiving a $30 million award to support increased logistics readiness.\nElectronic Systems\n($ millions) Third Quarter Year to Date FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Revenue $ 609 $ 553 10 % $ 1,733 $ 1,660 4 % Operating income $ 112 $ 115 (3 )% $ 322 $ 360 (11 )% Operating margin 18.4 % 20.8 % (240)bps 18.6 % 21.7 % (310)bps Revenue increased 10% in the third quarter from higher volume in Avionics, with growth on F-35 and other international platforms, growth in Electronic Warfare (EW) on F-16 and F/A-18 platforms and in C4ISR from the ramp of U.K. robotics and the UAE battle management system. Operating income declined $3 million as the benefit of higher volume was more than offset by increased research and development investment and program revenue mix.\nOrder momentum was strong in Electronic Systems with bookings in EW and Avionics of more than $500 million across multiple platforms. EW received a $184 million, 3-year contract for electronic jamming systems for U.S. Navy, Australian and Kuwaiti F/A-18 aircraft and a $28 million contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command to provide electronic warfare capabilities for rotary aircraft. In Avionics, in addition to strong orders for F-35, F/A-18 and P-8 platforms, Harris was awarded a £59 million contract supporting the U.K. Ministry of Defence and a partnering nation for Paveway weapon interface kits that advance tactical air-to-ground warfare capabilities.\nSpace and Intelligence Systems\n($ millions) Third Quarter Year to Date FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Revenue $ 482 $ 475 1 % $ 1,413 $ 1,396 1 % Operating income $ 82 $ 76 8 % $ 250 $ 231 8 % Operating margin 17.0 % 16.0 % 100bps 17.7 % 16.5 % 120bps Third quarter segment revenue increased 1% as growth from Classified programs, driven by the ramp of small satellites, ground-based processing adjacency and space surveillance programs, was partially offset by expected lower revenue from environmental programs. Operating income increased 8% to $82 million and margins expanded 100 basis points on strong program execution and incremental pension income.\nIn Classified programs, order momentum remained strong. These orders included follow-on contracts supporting space asset protection and situational awareness capabilities, additional funding for a small satellite award announced in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and a contract award from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for geospatial imaging services.\nInvestments in technology have enabled Harris to successfully expand into a full mission provider for small satellites and strengthen its position as partner of choice for payloads in large exquisite satellite systems. The company continued to leverage its investments and was selected for a strategic multi-year contract of approximately $500 million for exquisite space systems.\nCash and Capital Deployment\n($ millions) Third Quarter Year to Date FY 2018 FY 2017 Change FY 2018 FY 2017 Change Operating cash flow $ (143 ) $ 194 $ (337 ) $ 230 $ 489 $ (259 ) Adjusted operating cash flow* $ 157 $ 194 $ (37 ) $ 530 $ 489 $ 41 Adjusted free cash flow* $ 121 $ 164 $ (43 ) $ 451 $ 410 $ 41 *Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the attached tables.\nIn the first three quarters of fiscal 2018, Harris generated adjusted free cash flow of $451 million, excluding a $300 million voluntary pension contribution in the third quarter, and returned $402 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the period with $443 million of cash.\nGuidance\nAs a result of strong year-to-date performance, Harris updated its guidance for fiscal 2018 to the following:\nRevenue of approximately $6.14 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2017 (tightened from previous guidance of $6.08 - 6.14 billion, up 3 - 4%) GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $5.93 - $5.98 and non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $6.45 - $6.50 2 (tightened from previous guidance of $5.78 - $5.98 GAAP and $6.30 - $6.50 non-GAAP) Adjusted free cash flow of $900 - 925 million 2 (increased from previous guidance of approximately $900 million).

A “non-GAAP financial measure” is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Harris management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Harris management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze Harris business trends and to understand Harris performance. In addition, Harris may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAttachments: Financial statements (8 tables)\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that reflect management's current expectations, assumptions and estimates of future performance and economic conditions.
