A New York Times report published later that day said there was no available evidence to suggest that the informant had been \"implanted,\" or that the person's work was politically motivated.\nOn Sunday, Trump took action against the alleged use of an informant, demanding that the Justice Department investigate whether his campaign had been \"infiltrated or surveilled\" for \"Political Purposes.\"\ntrump tweet\nThe Justice Department appeared to comply with the request , announcing Sunday evening that its internal watchdog would investigate the matter as part of a broader probe surrounding Trump's campaign.\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said that \"if they had spies in my campaign, that would be a disgrace to this country,\" and that it \"would probably make every political event ever look like small potatoes.\"\nComey wrote extensive notes after his interactions with Trump before his departure from the FBI. He also recounted his experiences with the president in detail in his recently released memoir, and has criticized the president in subsequent media appearances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T18:17:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
