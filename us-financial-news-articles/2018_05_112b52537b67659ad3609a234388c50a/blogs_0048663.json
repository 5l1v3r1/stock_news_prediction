Overall, gross profit margin improved to 44.3% during its fiscal first quarter from 44% posted during the same period last year.\n“Biggest drivers of our supply chain headwind were related to transportation costs due to higher fuel prices, as well as the expected costs related to the new distribution centers opened in the second half of 2017,” said Mr. Shepard, who has filled in as CFO since the April departure of Tom Okray.\nWhile a boon to beat-down energy companies, rising fuel costs have rippled through U.S. earnings reports this quarter. Since April, companies from American Airlines Group to CSX have pointed to higher fuel costs as a factor pressuring results.\n“Fuel prices grew quicker, faster than expected, we had that built in and we are going to continue to monitor it for the reminder of the year,” an Advance Auto Parts spokesman told CFO Journal.\nProduction cuts by major crude oil exporting countries have spurred the run-up of prices at the gas pump. Average regular retail gas prices across the U.S. reached $2.92 a gallon on Monday — the highest level since 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n“We did have a – clearly, a plan in terms of where we felt fuel prices were going to be this year, and it’s above that,” said CEO Thomas Greco, speaking on the call. “We didn’t plan for the current price of fuel.”\nFor its latest quarter, Advance Auto Parts reported net sales slipped slightly to $2.87 billion from $2.89 billion during the same period last year. Comparable store sales retreated 0.8%.\nShare this: EARNINGS EARNINGS CALL FUEL PRICES Previous CFO Moves: Six Flags Entertainment, Nissan Motor, Tronc ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T23:35:47.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
