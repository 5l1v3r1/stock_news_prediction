Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 30, 2018 Germany's Alexander Zverev in action during his second round match against Serbia's Dusan Lajovic REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nThe second-seeded German smashed a racket in frustration before finding his groove and setting up a meeting with 26th- seeded Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.\nZverev has yet to reach the last eight at a Grand Slam but his huge talent told in the end against the world number 60.\nAsked about the gap between his ATP tour and his Grand Slam performances, Zverev said: “Everybody tries to make a bigger story out of it than it is. I have had great success on the ATP Tour, won three Masters, made two other finals this year. Related Coverage\n“I’m not worried. I know if I’m doing the right things\nand if I do the right work I’ll win those long matches, Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 30, 2018 Germany's Alexander Zverev in action during his second round match against Serbia's Dusan Lajovic REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nand the success will come itself. This is not something I think of on a daily basis.”\nAfter all, 20-times Grand Slam champion Roger Federer was also a relatively late bloomer.\n“He (Federer) told me a story about how he never made it past quarters until he was, what, 23 years old or something like that,” said Zverev.\n“I still have a little bit of time. Hearing that from the greatest player of all time is comforting, because you always think, Oh, if I’m not going to win this one, I’m never going to win one.” Slideshow (3 Images)\nThe 21-year-old Zverev had to cope with the frustration of an error-riddled start of the match.\nHe dropped serve twice in the opening set as Lajovic kept his cool and held serve to take the lead on Court One.\nLajovic toyed with the German, who lost his temper when he was broken in the third game of the second set and crushed his racket in frustration.\nHorrible unforced errors and ill-timed rushes to the net followed as Zverev struggled for control but he broke back for 3-3 and regained his composure to convert his first set point on Lajovic’s serve to level the match.\nThere were more jitters, though, as he trailed 2-1 in the third when he dropped serve on a double fault. Lajovic went on to bag the set and Zverev had his back to the wall.\nBut the German, who leads the ATP Race, was fully focussed as he raced through the fourth set by sticking closer to the baseline and he ended the match with an unreturnable serve.
