(NASDAQ:OTIC), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for otology, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its corporate activities and product pipeline.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Subsequent Highlights\nCompleted a Type C Meeting with FDA for OTIVIDEX ™ in Ménière’s Disease: In March 2018, Otonomy completed a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that confirmed the requirement for one additional successful pivotal trial to support a submission for U.S. registration of OTIVIDEX in Ménière’s disease. Otonomy expects to initiate this trial in mid-2018.\nObtained FDA Approval of OTIPRIO ® for the Treatment of Acute Otitis Externa : In March 2018, the FDA approved OTIPRIO (ciprofloxacin otic suspension) for the treatment of patients with acute otitis externa (AOE). This approval significantly increases the potential market opportunity for OTIPRIO with approximately 4 million episodes of AOE occurring each year in the United States. OTIPRIO continues to be available for purchase by customers while Otonomy evaluates commercial partnering options for the product including divestiture.\nAdvancing Multiple Programs for Sensorineural Hearing Loss: In January 2018, Otonomy announced the advancement of three distinct programs for hearing loss that address different pathologies and broad patient populations. OTO-413 is a sustained-exposure formulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in development for the repair of cochlear synaptopathy and the treatment of speech-in-noise hearing difficulties. The company expects to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in hearing loss patients in the first half of 2019. OTO-5XX is an otoprotectant in development for the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. OTO-6XX induces hair cell regeneration and is being developed for the treatment of severe hearing loss.\nDeveloping OTO-313 for the Treatment of Tinnitus: Gacyclidine is a potent and selective N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical safety trial, with no safety concerns observed. The company expects to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for OTO-313, an improved formulation of gacyclidine, in tinnitus patients in the first half of 2019.\nPresented Data for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Programs at International Otology Research Conference: In February 2018, company scientists and research collaborators delivered multiple data presentations at the Association for Research in Otolaryngology (ARO) Annual MidWinter Meeting. These presentations included data supporting the therapeutic potential of OTO-413 for the repair of cochlear synaptopathy.\n“We completed a productive first quarter by obtaining clarity from FDA on the registration requirements for OTIVIDEX in Ménière’s disease, receiving approval for OTIPRIO in acute otitis externa, and advancing our multiple development programs for hearing loss and tinnitus,” said David A. Weber, Ph.D., president and CEO of Otonomy. “We are on track with our efforts to initiate the remaining pivotal trial for OTIVIDEX and are making good progress towards the completion of a partnering transaction for OTIPRIO.\"\nAnticipated Upcoming Milestones\nInitiate Phase 3 clinical trial for OTIVIDEX in Ménière’s disease in mid-2018.\nComplete commercial partnership or divestiture of OTIPRIO in mid-2018.\nIn second half of 2018, select a candidate for clinical development for both OTO-5XX and OTO-6XX hearing loss programs.\nIn first half of 2019, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OTO-313 in tinnitus patients.\nIn first half of 2019, initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of OTO-413 in hearing loss patients.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $110.2 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $120.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nRevenue: Net sales of OTIPRIO totaled $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nOperating Expenses: GAAP operating expenses were $11.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $27.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation and rent abatement expense, were $9.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $22.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses: GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.6 million, compared to $13.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased clinical trial activities for OTIPRIO and OTIVIDEX versus the prior year period.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $6.2 million, compared to $14.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily a result of reduced selling expenses due to the discontinuation of promotional support for OTIPRIO.\nFinancial Guidance: Otonomy reaffirms its expectations that GAAP operating expenses for 2018 will be in the range of $52-$57 million, and that non-GAAP operating expenses for 2018 will be in the range of $40-$45 million.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nOtonomy management will host a webcast and conference call regarding this announcement at 4:30 p.m. EDT/1:30 p.m. PDT today.

Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation and rent abatement expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses are provided as a complement to operating expenses provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes non-GAAP operating expenses help indicate underlying trends in the company’s business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company’s financial position. Management also uses non-GAAP operating expenses to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally and to manage the company’s business and to evaluate its performance. The attached financial information includes a reconciliation of the GAAP operating expenses to non-GAAP operating expenses and a reconciliation of GAAP operating expense guidance to non-GAAP operating expense guidance.\nAbout Otonomy\nOtonomy is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for otology.
