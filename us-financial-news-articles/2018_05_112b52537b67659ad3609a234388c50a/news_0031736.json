We (DoD and EPA) cannot seem to get ATSDR to realize the potential public relations nightmare this is going to be.”\nCritics of the decision say that it’s being buried in order to put corporate profits above public safety. Vanity Fair notes that releasing the report has potential to dramatically increase the cost of cleanup at the affected sites, many of which use a foam that contains the harmful chemicals suspected to have been found in the contaminated water. Several large companies have previously had to pay billions to settle contaminated water and associated personal injury claims.\nThe study has yet to be released more than three months later, and there is currently no scheduled date to release the report.
