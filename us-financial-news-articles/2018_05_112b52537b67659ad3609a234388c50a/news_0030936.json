Its shares fell 3.5 percent.\n“With the Liberty deal announced and India set to close, he leaves behind a strategically well-positioned portfolio for his successor Nick Read, who we think is a safe pair of hands,” analysts at Bernstein said. END OF ERA\nIn Read, 53, investors will get a chief executive groomed for the job.\nRead said he had been alongside Colao through the process of reshaping Vodafone, and he would now deliver the benefits for shareholders and customers.\n“I think now is the time to really focus on our organic plan, really focusing on digital transformation of our business and the customer experience,” he told reporters.\n“And of course there’s a big opportunity of integrating these new businesses, both Liberty and over in India.”\nHaving joined Vodafone in 2001, Read’s roles have included running the British and emerging market operations. He has also sat on the boards of the company’s listed operations in Africa and Qatar, its subsidiaries in India and Egypt and its joint venture in Australia.\nOne area that remains to be tackled is Britain, Vodafone’s home market where it languishes in third place behind BT’s EE and Telefonica’s O2. Annual organic service revenue there fell 3.5 percent, compared with growth in the rest of Europe.\nThe management changes were announced as the company reported a 1.4 percent rise in organic service revenue for its fourth quarter, beating analyst forecasts of a 1.1 percent rise.\nFull year core earnings rose 11.8 percent to 14.7 billion euros, beating guidance for “around 10 percent” organic growth and just ahead of analyst forecasts of 14.6 billion euros.\nFor 2019, the group struck a more cautious tone with a forecast of organic core earnings growth of between 1 and 5 percent, and free cash flow before spectrum costs of at least 5.2 billion euros, slightly down on the 2018 number of 5.4 billion euros. WORK TO DO\nChairman Gerard Kleisterlee said Colao had been an “exemplary leader and strategic visionary who has overseen a dramatic transformation of Vodafone”.\nBorn in northern Italy, Colao cut his teeth as a management consultant at McKinsey before in 1996 he joined Omnitel Pronto Italia, which later became Vodafone Italy.\nA keen cyclist, the tall Colao has lived a quiet life in London, largely avoiding London’s corporate social scene.\nColleagues say he enjoys the cut and thrust of talking to journalists and analysts, and will also happily discuss European politics and regulation. Analysts have speculated that he could move into Italian politics.\nHis departure follows that of Martin Sorrell at WPP after 33 years in charge, meaning the FTSE 100 has lost two of its longest-serving CEOs in a short period of time.\n“It has a been a real privilege to lead the group through a decade of massive strategic transformation culminating in today’s good financial performance,” Colao told reporters.\n“But it is not yet the time for goodbyes. There is still a lot to do between now and October.” ($1 = 0.8390 euros) Editing by Keith Weir", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:18:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
