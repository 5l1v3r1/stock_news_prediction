The United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries said the election did not meet democratic standards.\nU.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Monday limiting Venezuela’s ability to sell state assets. Maduro responded on Tuesday by accusing the U.S. charge d’affaires, Todd Robinson, of being involved in a “military conspiracy,” and ordering him and another senior diplomat to leave the country within 48 hours.\nThe State Department and the two diplomats have denied Maduro’s allegations.\nMaduro’s second six-year term will begin in January.
