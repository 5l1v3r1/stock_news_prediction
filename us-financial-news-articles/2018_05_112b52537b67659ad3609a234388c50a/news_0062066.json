(CSE:GET.CN) (OTCQB:GLNNF) (FKT:GJT) (“Glance” or the “Company”) Chief Executive Officer Desmond Griffin today announced that both of the leading independent proxy advisors have recommended that shareholders vote only the BLUE proxy FOR the Glance nominees (the “Glance Nominees”) in a contested election for the Board of Directors.\nGlass Lewis & Co., LLC (“Glass Lewis”) and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”) are recognized as the leading independent proxy voting and corporate governance advisory firms in both Canada and the United States. Their analyses and recommendations are relied upon by hundreds of major institutional investment firms, mutual funds and fiduciaries throughout North America.\nThe independent recommendations, based on a careful review of the facts and arguments made by Glance and by the dissident shareholder Penny Green, are intended to assist shareholders in making choices regarding proxy voting decisions.\nThe Glass Lewis report consists of 18 pages of detailed analysis. In recommending that its clients vote the BLUE proxy FOR the Glance Nominees, Glass Lewis made the following comments:\n“We believe that Ms. Green’s attempts to take substantially all of the credit for the Company’s share price run-up prior to her ouster, and deflect blame for the Company’s share price decline following her departure, is highly disingenuous.” “We believe the Dissident’s acquisition strategy largely amounts to a highly speculative plan that is short on key details.” “We are highly skeptical of Ms. Green’s attempt to draw a decidedly favourable correlation between her presence with the Company and the Company’s share price.” “The Dissident’s case is insufficient to warrant rejection of any of the Management Nominees or the support of any of the Dissident Nominees.”\nThe ISS report consists of 21 pages of detailed analysis. In recommending that its clients vote the BLUE proxy FOR the Glance Nominees, ISS made the following points:\n“The Dissident has failed to provide a detailed business plan and has not identified a qualified and credible new management team to run the Company.” “The Dissident’s aggressive acquisition strategy may introduce further risks.” “The Dissident has failed to make a compelling case that a change in board control is warranted.” “The proposed Dissident slate does not appear to represent an improvement over the management slate, which includes four independent nominees.”\nVote the BLUE proxy\nPlease read Glance’s proxy contest materials filed on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ) and on Glance’s website at https://glance.tech/agm18/ and then vote only the BLUE proxy well in advance of the proxy voting deadline on June 8, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific time). Shareholders who may have voted the dissident proxy have every right to change their vote by now submitting the BLUE proxy, as it is the later dated proxy that will be counted at the meeting.\nShareholders with questions about voting their shares should contact DF King at 1-855-487-9247 (toll free) or by email at inquiries@dfking.com . The meeting will be held at 1200 Waterfront Centre, 200 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 12, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time).\nAbout Glance Technologies Inc.\nGlance Technologies owns and operates Glance Pay, a streamlined payment system that revolutionizes how smartphone users choose where to shop, order goods and services, make payments, access digital receipts, redeem digital deals, earn great rewards & interact with merchants.
