We are confident this partnership is the best structure to manage risk and ensure WaterFix is built on time, on budget and to the highest engineering standards.”\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is a cooperative of 26 cities and water agencies serving nearly 19 million people in six counties. The district imports water from the Colorado River and Northern California to supplement local supplies, and helps its members to develop increased water conservation, recycling, storage and other resource-management programs.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514006445/en/\nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California\nRebecca Kimitch\n(213) 217-6450\n(202) 821-5253, mobile\nor\nBob Muir\n(213) 217-6930\n(213) 324-5213, mobile\nSource: Metropolitan Water District of Southern California", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514006445/en/"], "published": "2018-05-15T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T03:28:22.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
