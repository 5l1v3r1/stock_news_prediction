So far, the European Union (EU) and the United States appear reluctant to remove preferential trade access for Cambodia’s vital garments’ sector, Fitch’s BMI research unit said last month.\nSupported by recovering global demand, Cambodia’s textile sector rebounded during the second half of last year, exporting $7.2 billion worth of goods, a 7.7 percent growth, slightly below 8.4 percent in 2016, the World Bank said.\nExports to the EU surged 7.4 percent in December from year-ago levels, versus a drop of 1.0 percent in May, the report said.\nExports to the United States in December rebounded, climbing 3.7 percent compared with a fall of 3.5 percent a year ago.\nThe World Bank said the government’s target of reaching 2 million foreign tourists by 2020 was feasible.
