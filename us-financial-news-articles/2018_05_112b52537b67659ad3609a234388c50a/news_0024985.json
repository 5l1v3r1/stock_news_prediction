(NASDAQ: DBX), a leading global collaboration platform, today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“2018 has already been a banner year for Dropbox, and we're proud of our strong first quarter as a public company,” said Dropbox Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston. “Growth in paying users and increased adoption of premium plans helped drive first quarter revenue of $316 million, up 28% year-over-year. We continued to add value to our platform with new product features, and enhanced our ecosystem through partnerships with Salesforce and Google. Our team is focused on building a great business for the long-term, and we’re excited for the opportunities ahead of us.”\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nTotal revenue was $316.3 million, an increase of 28% from the same period last year. Paying users totaled 11.5 million, as compared to 9.3 million for the same period last year. Average revenue per paying user was $114.30, as compared to $110.79 for the same period last year. GAAP gross margin was 61.9%, as compared to 62.3% in the same period last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 74.2%, as compared to 63.5% in the same period last year. GAAP operating margin was (147.3%), as compared to (13.5%) in the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 10.9%, as compared to 2.2% in the same period last year. GAAP net loss was ($465.5) million, as compared to ($33.1) million in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income was $30.9 million, as compared to $5.2 million in the same period last year. GAAP operating margin and net loss for the first quarter of 2018 included a $418.7 million stock-based compensation charge due to the achievement of the liquidity event-related performance condition in connection with our initial public offering (\"IPO\") for two-tier restricted stock units that met their service-based vesting condition as of the end of the first quarter of 2018, and a $13.9 million employer payroll tax charge related to these restricted stock units. Net cash provided by operating activities was $61.8 million, as compared to $61.6 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow was $51.9 million, as compared to $56.5 million in the same period last year. GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share was ($2.13), compared to ($0.17) in the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.08, compared to $0.02 in the same period last year. (1) Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $846.0 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\n(1) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share is calculated based upon 373.1 million and 342.3 million diluted weighted-average shares of common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInitial Public Offering and Private Placement\nOn March 27, 2018, we completed our IPO and a concurrent private placement where 40,761,905 shares of Class A common stock were sold at $21 per share, including 26,822,409 shares by the Company and 9,177,591 shares by selling stockholders in our IPO, and 4,761,905 shares by the Company in a private placement to Salesforce Ventures LLC. The underwriters of the IPO exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 5,400,000 shares of Class A common stock at $21 per share, which closed on April 3, 2018. As a result of our IPO and the concurrent private placement, we received total gross proceeds of $776.7 million, before deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering expenses. The proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters' option, net of underwriting fees totaled $108.4 million and are not reflected in the ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balance at the end of the first quarter of 2018 as the transaction closed in April.\nStock-Based Compensation and Employer Payroll Tax Expense Related to Restricted Stock Units\nWe historically granted two-tier restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") to employees, with our last two-tier award grant occurring in 2015. These awards have both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-related performance condition. The stock-based compensation expense related to these awards was previously unrecognized as the satisfaction of the performance condition was not deemed probable. The liquidity event-related performance condition was satisfied upon our IPO. As a result, we recognized $418.7 million in stock-based compensation expense related to two-tier RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition had been met as of the end of the first quarter of 2018. We expect to record additional stock-based compensation of $2.6 million relating to two-tier RSUs throughout the remainder of 2018 as their respective service-based vesting conditions are met. During the quarter, we also released 26.8 million shares of common stock underlying the vested two-tier RSUs, and as a result recorded $13.9 million in employer related payroll tax expenses associated with these same awards.\nFinancial Outlook\nDropbox will provide forward-looking guidance in connection with this quarterly earnings announcement on our conference call, webcast, and on our investor relations website at investors.dropbox.com .\nConference Call Information\nDropbox plans to host a conference call today to review its first quarter financial results and to discuss its financial outlook.

outflows related to the build-out of our new corporate headquarters in San Francisco, CA. Net cash provided by operating activities includes tenant improvement allowances related to our new corporate headquarters and represents cash received from our landlord to offset this build-out. These amounts are presented net in the table above.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors and others with additional information regarding Dropbox's results, we have disclosed the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses (including research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative), non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, free cash flow (\"FCF\") and non-GAAP diluted net income per share. Dropbox has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, and net income differs from GAAP in that it excludes stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll tax expense relating to the release of two-tier RSUs. Non-GAAP net income also includes the income tax effect of these adjustments. Free cash flow differs from GAAP net cash provided by operating activities in that it treats capital expenditures as a reduction to net cash provided by operating activities. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share differs from GAAP diluted net loss per share in that the numerator utilizes the non-GAAP net income as described above, and the weighted-average shares used in the computation include certain shares that are excluded from the GAAP diluted net loss per share calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nDropbox's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate Dropbox's financial performance and the ability to generate cash from operations. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Dropbox's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in Dropbox's business, as they exclude expenses that are not reflective of ongoing operating results. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Dropbox's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies.\nWe believe that the non-GAAP financial measures non-GAAP cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, net income, and diluted net income per share are meaningful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude.\nWe believe that FCF is an indicator of our liquidity over the long term, and provides useful information regarding cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow our business. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of FCF are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under capital leases, includes capital expenditures related to our new corporate headquarters, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe use of non-GAAP cost of revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, income from operations, net income, free cash flow, and diluted net income per share measures has certain limitations as they do not reflect all items of income, expense, and cash expenditures, as applicable, that affect Dropbox's operations. Dropbox compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. Additionally, we have provided supplemental disclosures in our reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow to include capital expenditures related to our new corporate headquarters, net of tenant improvement allowances. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Management encourages investors and others to review Dropbox's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006227/en/\nDropbox\nInvestors:\nDarren Yip\nir@dropbox.com\nor\nMedia:\nSaman Asheer\npress@dropbox.com\nSource: Dropbox, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.dropbox.com%2F&esheet=51804317&newsitemid=20180510006227&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.dropbox.com&index=2&md5=fe9100ada77c3ec26a307c6298aec89f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.dropbox.com%2F&esheet=51804317&newsitemid=20180510006227&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.dropbox.com&index=1&md5=dddae21c2eef194e7801c289e4f4382b", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006227/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdropbox.com&esheet=51804317&newsitemid=20180510006227&lan=en-US&anchor=dropbox.com&index=3&md5=1ff869fe4510ad52b85de28642dd4ba0"], "published": "2018-05-11T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:11:42.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
