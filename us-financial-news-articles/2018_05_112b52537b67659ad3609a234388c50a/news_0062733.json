As a result, we think the repeat of a 2012-style euro crisis remains a small possibility,” Wee said, adding he remained optimistic on euro zone economic growth and regional equity markets.\nJapan’s biggest private life insurance firm, Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen ($44.21 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, also said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings.\nTRADE FEARS Equity futures signalled a stronger open on Wall Street , after Tuesday’s harsh session which saw all three U.S. indexes lose between 0.5-1.2 percent , led by financial sector stocks.\nAsian markets however remained under pressure, with an index of non-Japanese Asian stocks, hurt also by news that the United States was pressing ahead with tariffs and restrictions on investments by Chinese companies. Beijing meanwhile said it was ready to fight back if Washington ignited a trade war.\nJapan’s Nikkei sold off 1.5 percent to a six-week low while Shanghai shares also dropped 1.4 percent. Trade-sensitive emerging equities fell 1.2 percent to 5-1/2-month lows.\n“Overall, this (U.S.) move puts a trade war scenario back on the agenda,” Rabobank analysts told clients.\nEmerging markets are also suffering from the dollar’s renewed surge since mid-April, with Indonesia raising interest rates for the second time in two weeks to support the rupiah currency .\nThe politics and fears of an economic hit across the euro zone has driven investors into U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds pushing yields 15-20 basis points lower They have also fuelled a sharp rise in the yen and Swiss franc, especially against the euro.\nThe euro attempted to bounce off 10-month lows against the dollar rising 0.5 percent to $1.160, while against the Swiss franc and yen it firmed around 0.3 percent.\n“The risk to the euro is predominantly political in the near term,” Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at Societe Generale, said, adding the euro would likely stay capped at $1.15 or $1.16 until the Italian political crisis was resolved.\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose 6.5 basis points to 2.83 percent while German yields rose around 5 basis points\nOil prices meanwhile struggled as expectations grew that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran, even as U.S. output has surged in recent years.\nBrent futures traded around $75.50 per barrel, well off recent 3-1/2-year highs above $80.
