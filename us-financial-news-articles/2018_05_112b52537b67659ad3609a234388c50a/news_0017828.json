Net income of $20.9 million was down 6.7% over the prior-year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $28.8 million decreased 5.3% over the prior-year first quarter. Earnings per unit of $0.51 was down 5.6%, over the prior-year first quarter. Quarterly distribution declared per unit of $0.567 remained flat compared to the prior-year first quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities of $37.3 million increased by 245.4% over the prior-year first quarter. Distributable cash flow attributable to Ciner Resources LP of $13.2 million decreased by 1.5% over the prior-year first quarter. The distribution coverage ratio was 1.16: 1.0 and 1.17: 1.0 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nKirk Milling, CEO, commented: “We are pleased our results generally fell in line with expectations and that most of the primary metrics we look at to gauge business performance have improved with some even better than expected. Production volumes in the quarter were up 2.6% over last year, which was right in line with expectations. International prices were up 7.9% after netting out the freight impact from our affiliate sales. Domestic volumes were up 13.9% compared to last year. Both of these exceeded our expectations and caused us to adjust our 2018 outlook. While we did experience a 5.3% reduction in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter due to higher expenses in professional fees related to our operational-excellence initiatives and higher SG&A costs, we expect that fees related to our various initiatives will moderate as the year progresses.”\n“For the balance of 2018 we anticipate that a strong global economy will continue to drive demand and growth throughout the world. It appears most global markets are very tight with low inventory levels, which should put more upward pressure on prices particularly in Asia. We also believe our domestic volume will improve as the year progresses and provide further positive impact on our average sales price.”\n2018 Outlook:\nWe expect our total volume sold to be flat to up 2% compared to the previous estimate of 1% to 3%. We expect domestic volume to increase by 125,000 to 150,000 short tons compared to the previous estimate of 80,000 to 125,000 short tons. We expect domestic pricing to be down 1% to 3%. We expect international prices to be up 1% to 3% compared to the previous estimate of flat to down 2%** Maintenance of business capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $13 to $15 million. Expansion capital expenditures are planned to be in the range of $55 to $65 million compared to the previous estimate of $30 to $35 million.\n** Excluding the change related to freight from CIDT sales in 2017.\nFinancial Highlights Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, (Dollars in millions, except per unit amounts) 2018 2017 % Change Soda ash volume produced (millions of short tons) 0.669 0.652 2.6 % Soda ash volume sold (millions of short tons) 0.668 0.671 (0.5 )% Net sales $ 121.2 $ 126.6 (4.3 )% Net income $ 20.9 $ 22.4 (6.7 )% Net income attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 10.1 $ 10.9 (7.3 )% Earnings per Limited Partner Unit $ 0.51 $ 0.54 (5.6 )% Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 28.8 $ 30.4 (5.3 )% Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP (1) $ 14.4 $ 15.1 (4.6 )% Net cash provided by operating activities $ 37.3 $ 10.8 245.4 % Distributable cash flow attributable to Ciner Resources LP (1) $ 13.2 $ 13.4 (1.5 )% Distribution coverage ratio (1) 1.16 1.17 (0.9 )% (1) See non-GAAP reconciliations Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth a summary of net sales, sales volumes and average sales price, and the percentage change between the periods.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Percent\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nNet sales (Dollars in millions): 2018 2017 Domestic $ 55.3 $ 49.1 12.6 % International 65.9 77.5 (15.0 )% Total net sales $ 121.2 $ 126.6 (4.3 )% Sales volumes (thousands of short tons): Domestic 257.0 225.7 13.9 % International 410.6 445.1 (7.8 )% Total soda ash volume sold 667.6 670.8 (0.5 )% Average sales price (per short ton): Domestic $ 215.18 $ 217.55 (1.1 )% International $ 160.50 $ 174.03 (7.8 )% Average $ 181.55 $ 188.68 (3.8 )% Percent of net sales: Domestic sales 45.6 % 38.8 % 17.5 % International sales 54.4 % 61.2 % (11.1 )% Total percent of net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % Consolidated Results\nNet sales. Net sales decreased by 4.3% to $121.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $126.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven by a decrease in total average sales price of 3.8%, as well as a decrease in soda ash volumes sold of 0.5%. The decrease in total average sales prices was primarily driven by the absence of international sales to CIDT in the first quarter of 2018. During 2017, international average sales price reflected the increase in freight costs driven by export sales volume to CIDT. During 2017, international average sales price reflected the increase in freight costs driven by export sales volume to CIDT. There were no sales to CIDT during the three months ended March 31, 2018, as the previous contract concluded in the 2017 year.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold, including depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and freight costs decreased by 5.0% to $93.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $98.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to a decrease in freight costs of 13.6% to $34.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $39.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in freight costs was driven by no export sales volumes to CIDT during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the prior year first quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25.5% to $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The two primary drivers for the increase were higher selling and administrative fees relating to our affiliate, ANSAC, which directly correlates with the volume we sell to ANSAC, and higher expenses from our ERP implementation project.\nCAPEX AND ORE TO ASH RATIO\nThe following table below summarizes our capital expenditures, on an accrual basis, and ore to ash ratio:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Capital Expenditures Maintenance $ 2.8 $ 2.7 Expansion 4.8 1.7 Total $ 7.6 $ 4.4 Operating and Other Data: Ore to ash ratio (1) 1.55: 1.0 1.51: 1.0 (1) Ore to ash ratio expresses the number of short tons of trona ore needed to produce one short ton of soda ash and includes our deca rehydration recovery process. In general, a lower ore to ash ratio results in lower costs and improved efficiency. FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.1 million. In addition, we have approximately $92.9 million ($225.0 million, less $120.5 million outstanding and less standby letters of credit of $11.6 million) of remaining capacity under our revolving credit facilities. As of March 31, 2018, our leverage and interest coverage ratios, as calculated per the Ciner Wyoming Credit Facility, were 1.07: 1.0 and 25.37: 1.0, respectively.\nCASH FLOWS AND QUARTERLY CASH DISTRIBUTION\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $37.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $10.8 million of cash provided during three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily driven by $9.1 million of working capital provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $18.5 million of working capital used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $27.6 million increase in working capital provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $26.5 million decrease in due-from affiliates.\nCash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were offset by cash used in investing activities of $4.0 million for capital expenditures and cash used in financing activities during the three month period of $41.4 million. The cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2018 was due to distributions paid of $23.6 million and net repayments of long-term debt of $17.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the $10.5 million in net borrowings during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Distribution\nOn April 26, 2018, the Partnership declared its first quarter 2018 quarterly distribution of $0.567 per unit. This is consistent with the distribution declared during the first quarter of 2017. The quarterly cash distribution is payable on May 21, 2018 to unitholders of record on May 7, 2018.\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\nCiner Resources LP will host a conference call tomorrow, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

We also present the non-GAAP financial measures of:\nAdjusted EBITDA; Distributable cash flow; and Distribution coverage ratio.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax, depreciation, depletion and amortization, equity-based compensation expense and certain other expenses that are non-cash charges or that we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations. Distributable cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash paid for interest, maintenance capital expenditures and income taxes, each as attributable to Ciner Resources LP. The Partnership may fund expansion-related capital expenditures with borrowings under existing credit facilities such that expansion-related capital expenditures will have no impact on cash on hand or the calculation of cash available for distribution. In certain instances, the timing of the Partnership’s borrowings and/or its cash management practices will result in a mismatch between the period of the borrowing and the period of the capital expenditure. In those instances, the Partnership adjusts designated reserves (as provided in the partnership agreement) to take account of the timing difference. Accordingly, expansion-related capital expenditures have been excluded from the presentation of cash available for distribution. Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances. We define distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of distributable cash flow as of the end of the period to cash distributions payable with respect to such period.\nAdjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in our industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our unitholders; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may be defined differently by other companies, including those in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, (Dollars in millions, except per unit data)\n2018 2017 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income: Net income $ 20.9 $ 22.4 Add backs: Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 6.8 6.7 Interest expense, net 0.7 0.9 Restructuring charges and other, net (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) — 0.4 Equity-based compensation expense 0.4 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 28.8 $ 30.4 Less: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest 14.4 15.3 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 14.4 $ 15.1 Reconciliation of distributable cash flow to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 14.4 $ 15.1 Less: Cash interest expense, net attributable to Ciner Resources LP 0.3 0.4 Less: Maintenance capital expenditures attributable to Ciner Resources LP 0.9 1.3 Distributable cash flow attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 13.2 $ 13.4 Cash distribution declared per unit $ 0.567 $ 0.567 Total distributions to unitholders and general partner $ 11.4 $ 11.4 Distribution coverage ratio 1.16 1.17 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash from operating activities: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 37.3 $ 10.8 Add/(less): Amortization of long-term loan financing (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Net change in working capital (9.1 ) 18.5 Interest expense, net 0.7 0.9 Restructuring charges and other, net (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) — 0.4 Other non-cash items — (0.1 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 28.8 $ 30.4 Less: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest 14.4 15.3 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 14.4 $ 15.1 Less: Cash interest expense, net attributable to Ciner Resources LP 0.3 0.4 Less: Maintenance capital expenditures attributable to Ciner Resources LP 0.9 1.3 Distributable cash flow attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 13.2 $ 13.4 The following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measure of net income for the periods presented:\n(Dollars in millions, except per unit data)\nCumulative\nFour\nQuarters\nended\nQ1-2018\nQ1-2018 Q4-2017 Q3-2017 Q2-2017 Q1-2017 Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income: Net income $ 84.9 $ 20.9 $ 27.2 $ 19.3 $ 17.5 $ 22.4 Add backs: Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 27.2 6.8 6.9 7.0 6.5 6.7 Asset impairment charges 1.6 — — 1.6 — — Interest expense, net 2.7 0.7 0.3 0.9 0.8 0.9 Restructuring charges and other, net (included in selling, general and administrative expenses) 0.4 — 0.1 — 0.3 0.4 Equity-based compensation expense 1.7 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.5 — Adjusted EBITDA 118.5 28.8 34.9 29.2 25.6 30.4 Less: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest 59.4 14.4 17.3 14.7 13.0 15.3 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 59.1 $ 14.4 $ 17.6 $ 14.5 $ 12.6 $ 15.1 Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 59.1 $ 14.4 $ 17.6 $ 14.5 $ 12.6 $ 15.1 Less: Cash interest expense, net attributable to Ciner Resources LP 1.9 0.3 0.5 0.6 0.5 0.4 Less: Maintenance capital expenditures attributable to Ciner Resources LP 5.5 0.9 2.5 0.8 1.3 1.3 Distributable cash flow attributable to Ciner Resources LP $ 51.7 $ 13.2 $ 14.6 $ 13.1 $ 10.8 $ 13.4 Cash distribution declared per unit $ 2.268 $ 0.567 $ 0.567 $ 0.567 $ 0.567 $ 0.567 Total distributions to unitholders and general partner $ 45.6 $ 11.4 $ 11.4 $ 11.4 $ 11.4 $ 11.4 Distribution coverage ratio 1.13 1.16 1.28 1.15 0.94 1.17\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005972/en/\nCiner Resources LP\nInvestor Relations\nScott Humphrey, 770-375-2387\nChief Financial Officer\nSHumphrey@ciner.us.com\nSource: Ciner Resources LP", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciner.us.com&esheet=51802152&newsitemid=20180507005972&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ciner.us.com&index=1&md5=8e232d2edadfe22a8e7638e54822baa9", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005972/en/"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T23:28:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
