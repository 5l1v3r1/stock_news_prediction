Harper led off with a homer in the first — his second leadoff homer in three days — and added a two-run shot in the second.\nThe right fielder has now homered four times in the four games since shifting to the top spot. He finished 2-for-5 with those three RBIs.\nStarter Gio Gonzalez (4-2) returned after a 39-minute rain delay in the fourth and left after five with the Nationals holding a 7-0 lead. He gave up only two hits and struck out five with two walks.\nPhillies starter Nick Pivetta (1-2) lasted just one inning plus three batters and allowed six runs on five hits, including the Harper homers.\nThe Harper first-inning homer plus RBI singles from Ryan Zimmerman and Matt Wieters gave Washington a 3-0 lead in that frame.\nIn the second, Harper belted his two-run blast to make it 5-0 before Adams hit a two-run homer later in the inning on the first pitch from Drew Hutchison. Adams — who also homered Thursday — helped Gonzalez on defense in the fourth with a leaping catch of a Maikel Franco fly ball at the wall in left.\nThe Phillies scored three against Trevor Gott in the sixth thanks to back-to-back homers from Carlos Santana (two-run) and Franco (solo). Gott then left with what appeared to be an injury.\nAnthony Rendon played third base in his rehab assignment at Class A Potomac, and The Washington Post reported that he went 3-for-4 and could return Saturday. The Post also said that Rendon “reluctantly” said he’s had a hairline fracture of his left big toe. The team had been calling it a bruise/contusion.\nShawn Kelley (ulnar nerve irritation) will do a rehab assignment at Potomac Sunday and also could be back soon after that, according to The Post.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:07:34.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
