The lignite-fired power plant in Belchatow, European Union's biggest polluter, will need to buy up to 20 million tonnes of CO2 emission permits by 2013, its chief Jacek Kaczorowski told Reuters on August 21, 2009. The plant released the equivalent of nearly 31 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere last year, topping by 4 million tonnes its EU-set ceiling as part of the bloc's attempts to curb global warming.

It said this could add 12 billion euros per year to the budget.\nIt also proposed that member states contribute 20 percent share of revenues from national emission trading system auctions to be worth 3 billion euros a year to the EU budget.\nEU governments should also contribute 80 cents per kilogram of non-recycled plastic packaging waste for a total amount estimated at 7 billion euros for the budget.\n($1 = 0.8335 euros)\nReporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar; Editing by Foo Yun Chee\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T18:16:14.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
