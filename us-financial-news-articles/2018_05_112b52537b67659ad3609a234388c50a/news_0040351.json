While the price disparity between a single bitcoin and a bar of soap, for example, may be huge, Cammarata said BitPay allows users to pay a fraction of each bitcoin. In addition, most shoppers use the coins to buy monthly or yearly subscriptions, not \"one-off purchases,\" he said.\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC Michael Cammarata, CEO of Schmidt's Naturals. Subscriptions, he said, are \"totally customizable,\" allowing customers to order on a long-term basis and decide what and how much they want. Cammarata said that so far, most people using bitcoin are parents who are buying yearly subscriptions, or packages of toiletries, for their college kids.\nSchmidt's is the first Unilever store to accept bitcoin as a payment. It started on Monday. The company, which Unilever recently acquired , also sells products at retailers such as Target , Macy's , Bloomingdale's and drug stores nationwide, Cammarata said. But for now, bitcoin can only be used for payments on the website.\nAnd, for now, bitcoin is the only digital coin accepted. But Cammarata said the payment method might expand to include cryptocurrencies such as ripple and ethereum.\n\"We're going to start with bitcoin and see how it goes,\" Cammarata said. \"If the demand is there we'll expand.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.unilever.com/news/Press-releases/2017/unilever-to-acquire-schmidts-naturals.html"], "published": "2018-05-16T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:32:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
