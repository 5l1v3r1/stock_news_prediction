It offered a coupon of 7.875 percent, a full point above what was originally anticipated.\nSince the deal, WeWork’s bond 96208LAA9=RRPS has fallen sharply, last trading at 94.125 cents to the dollar to yield 9.029 percent.\nAMERICAN GREETINGS CORP RATING: MOODY’S Caa1, S&P CCC+\nISSUE DATE: APRIL 9, 2018 Greeting-card maker American Greetings cut its deal size twice, ultimately selling $282.5 million at 87 cents on the dollar, down from its initial target of $325 million. While the coupon remained 8.75 percent, the repricing resulted in a yield-to-maturity of nearly 11.5 percent.\nThe company had to tighten covenants as well, reducing the pro forma leverage ratio needed to make restricted investments. It also removed a provision that would have allowed the company broad discretion in the use of asset sale proceeds.\nOn the secondary market, trading in American Greetings’ bond 026375AR6=RRPS has been choppy, swinging above and below its opening price of 91.25 cents on the dollar. It last traded at 91.25 cents to yield 10.56 percent.\nMCDERMOTT INTERNATIONAL RATING: MOODY’S B2, S&P B-\nISSUE DATE: APRIL 18, 2018 To sell its $1.3 billion bond, oil construction firm McDermott International ( MDR.N ) offered a discount of 94.75 cents on the dollar with a coupon of 10.625 percent, delivering a yield-to-maturity of 11.865 percent for initial buyers.\nIt also added a new protection designed to prevent the transfer of valuable intellectual property to unrestricted subsidiaries.
