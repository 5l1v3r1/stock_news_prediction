REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo The 8-1 decision cast into doubt evidence that police obtained from the search that was used to convict defendant Ryan Collins of receiving stolen property. The case will return to lower courts to determine if the officers had alternative grounds for entering the property without a warrant.\nThe case involved a stolen motorcycle that was covered by a tarpaulin and parked on private property next to a house in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on May 14 limited the ability of police to search rental cars driven by someone other than the person who signed the rental agreement.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T18:31:09.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
