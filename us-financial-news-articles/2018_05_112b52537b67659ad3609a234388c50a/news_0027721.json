(NYSE:SXE) (“Southcross” or the “Partnership”) today announced first quarter financial and operating results.\nSouthcross’ net loss was $16.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $15.4 million for the same period in the prior year and $17.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) was $15.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $18.0 million for the same period in the prior year and $17.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was lower than the prior quarter primarily due to lower processed gas volumes resulting from lower volumes delivered by producers. This was partially offset by lower operating and general and administrative expenses.\nProcessed gas volumes during the quarter averaged 234 MMcf/d, a decrease of 9% compared to 256 MMcf/d for the same period in the prior year and a decrease of 8% compared to 255 MMcf/d for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, growth and maintenance capital expenditures were $3.4 million and were related primarily to various projects to connect new production to our assets.\nCapital and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Southcross had total outstanding debt of $530 million, including $83 million under its revolving credit facility, as compared to total outstanding debt of $527 million as of December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with the amendment to Southcross’ revolving credit agreement executed December 29, 2016, Southcross issued $15 million of senior unsecured notes to certain funds managed by EIG Global Energy Partners and Tailwater Capital in January 2018. At May 4, 2018, Southcross had more than $24 million in available liquidity.\nCash Distributions and Distributable Cash Flow\nDistributable cash flow (as defined below) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $5.0 million, compared to $8.9 million for the same period in the prior year and $5.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Partnership did not make a cash distribution for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and is not allowed to make any cash distributions until the Partnership’s consolidated total leverage ratio, as defined under its credit agreement, is at or below 5.0x to 1. At March 31, 2018, the Partnership’s consolidated total leverage ratio was approximately 8.6x to 1 compared to approximately 8.1x to 1 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. In addition, under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of October 31, 2017, with American Midstream Partners, LP (“AMID”), its general partner, and a certain wholly owned subsidiary of AMID pursuant to which Southcross will merge with AMID’s wholly owned subsidiary (the “merger”) , the Partnership is not permitted, without the prior written consent of AMID, to declare or pay any distribution or dividends on its common units during the pendency of the merger.\nAbout Southcross Energy Partners, L.P.\nSouthcross Energy Partners, L.P. is a master limited partnership that provides natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression and transportation services and NGL fractionation and transportation services.

We also present the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income/loss, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, equity in losses of joint venture investments, certain non-cash charges (such as non-cash unit-based compensation, impairments, loss on extinguishment of debt and unrealized losses on derivative contracts), major litigation costs net of recoveries, transaction-related costs, revenue deferral adjustment, loss on sale of assets, severance expense and selected charges that are unusual or non-recurring; less interest income, income tax benefit, unrealized gains on derivative contracts, equity in earnings of joint venture investments, gain on sale of assets and selected gains that are unusual or non-recurring. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key metric used in measuring our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt agreements and is used as a supplemental measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make future cash distributions; operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on investment opportunities.\nWe define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA, plus interest income and income tax benefit, less cash paid for interest, income tax expense and maintenance capital expenditures. We use distributable cash flow to analyze our liquidity. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances. Distributable cash flow is used to assess the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make future cash distributions to our unitholders; and the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are not financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to their most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in this press release. Net income and net cash provided by operating activities are the GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because each excludes some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility across industry lines.\nContact:\nSouthcross Energy Partners, L.P.\nMallory Biegler, 214-979-3720\nInvestor Relations\ninvestorrelations@southcrossenergy.com\nSOUTHCROSS ENERGY PARTNERS, L.P.
