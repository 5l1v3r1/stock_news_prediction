(“Glance” or the “Company”) (CSE:GET.CN) (CSE:GET.WT) (OTCQB:GLNNF) (FKT:GJT), controlling 11.17%, congratulates her director nominee Spiros Margaris for, this week, being named the top global influencer in three separate categories: fintech, blockchain and artificial intelligence.\nThe internationally-recognized rankings are determined by Onalytica — the world’s leading Influencer Relationship Management (IRM) SaaS platform recognized by Gartner, Forrester and major corporations — who base their analysis on a thought leader’s resonance (how much engagement they are driving), relevance (number of tweets on topic), reach (number of followers) and reference (how often they are referenced by other influencers).\n“Over the past several years, Mr. Margaris has gained a reputation as one of the most knowledgeable fintech experts in the world. These three top rankings — the triple crown of fintech — are clear examples of how respected he is by the international fintech community,” said Ms. Green. “I’m thrilled to have Mr. Margaris as part of my slate and to be able to leverage his reputation, his knowledge, and his international contacts to take Glance forward. While it is unfortunate that Glance just saw fit to dismiss him as an advisor and deny shareholders of his expertise just days before this international honour, it does speak volumes about the current board’s lack of judgement in this area and self-preservation.”\nIn addition to the number one rankings, Mr. Margaris also ranked 10 th in Onalytica’s Insurtech influencer ranking, 10 th in their Bitcoin ranking and 12 th in their Digital Transformation list.\nIT’S TIME FOR A BOARD UPGRADE\nMs. Green is asking fellow shareholders to support her in reversing the dramatic value destruction that has taken place at Glance over the past several months, by electing Mr. Margaris and the rest of her highly-qualified, and experienced director nominees (the “Nominees”) at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on June 12, 2018. Along with Mr. Margaris, Ms. Green’s Nominees include herself, William Davis, Jonathan Fry, and Monique Imbeault, all of whom bring superior skill-sets to the current board and position Glance well for the future in what is a fast-moving industry.\nIn addition to putting forward five Nominees to the board, Ms. Green’s information circular outlines a clear five-point plan for growth which includes: A new management team; a strong revenue strategy which includes pursuing a number of licensing opportunities; an aggressive acquisition strategy; and a robust investor and media relations strategies. These initiatives are expected to substantially increase Glance’s revenues, expand the Company’s international reach, and rebuild shareholder value.\n“The current board just doesn’t have the experience to take Glance to the next level. Specifically, over the past year, our company has evolved from a mobile payments company with one vertical to a company with a tremendous opportunity to become a global leader in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space,” Ms. Green said. “As the one who recruited the current board members to Glance, I am most qualified to tell you that the opportunity at Glance has grown much bigger than they are able to competently handle. While they will attack the Nominees I have put forward, I am happy to have a discussion about the superior and additive skill-set, experience, and international connections they bring to the table.”\nWith the industry’s evolving nature, Glance needs a board that possesses the most cutting-edge expertise and experience in big data, blockchain & cryptocurrency and fintech – experience that the existing board just doesn’t have.\nExperience/Skills William\nDavis III\nJonathan\nFry\nPenny\nGreen\nMonique\nImbeault\nSpiros\nMargaris\nArtificial Intelligence/Big Data ■ ■ ■ Blockchain & Cryptocurrency ■ ■ ■ ■ Finance & Capital Markets ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ FinTech/Mobile Payment ■ ■ ■ ■ In addition to the above, Ms. Green’s slate includes:\nEstablished leaders across industries.
