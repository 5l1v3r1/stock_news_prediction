Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Mets won for the 10th time in 28 games following an 11-1 start. The Diamondbacks have lost eight of nine.\nDeGrom (4-0), who missed a start earlier this month due to a hyperextended right elbow and threw 45 pitches while lasting only one inning in his return Sunday, allowed one run on six hits and no walks while throwing 71 of his 100 pitches for strikes. The 13-strikeout effort was the fourth of his career, including one in the 2015 playoffs, and his first since he whiffed 13 against the Miami Marlins on April 15, 2017.\nThe Diamondbacks got only one runner beyond first base in the first five innings before scoring in the sixth, when Steven Souza Jr. singled with one out and scored on Jake Lamb’s double. The run snapped deGrom’s scoreless streak at a career-high 24 2/3 innings. Souza later left the contest after reaggravating a right pectoral injury.\nAstros 4, Indians 1\nCharlie Morton extended his career-long winning streak to nine games when Houston rallied on his behalf, scoring twice in the seventh inning to scratch out a win over visiting Cleveland.\nMorton (6-0) was exceptional again at home, improving to 5-0 with a 1.85 ERA at Minute Maid Park this season. He limited the Indians to four hits and a walk over seven innings, recording eight strikeouts while tossing 97 pitches.\nCleveland designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion struck for a solo home run to the opposite field in right with one out in the seventh to sully the Morton ledger. It was Encarnacion’s 10th home run on the season.\nRoyals 5, Yankees 2\nWhit Merrifield had three hits and tied a career high with three stolen bases to spark host Kansas City to victory over New York.\nMerrifield helped the Royals halt a five-game losing streak with a double and two singles in his first three at-bats against CC Sabathia (2-1) to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Merrifield also stole three bases for the third time in his career and for the second time this season (also May 6).\nNeil Walker hit an RBI single and Miguel Andujar lifted a sacrifice fly for the Yankees, who played for the first time since Tuesday due to a rainout in Washington. New York also lost for the fourth time in its last 23 games.\nOrioles 7, Red Sox 4\nA four-run fourth inning helped Alex Cobb get his first win with Baltimore at Boston’s expense, snapping a 13-game road losing streak for the Orioles.\nCobb (1-5) gave up three runs on 10 hits and a walk with three strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings. It was the Boston native’s first win since Sept. 22 with Tampa Bay versus Baltimore. Cobb had a 7.06 ERA through six starts after joining the Orioles in March.\nMookie Betts hit a solo homer and had two RBIs and both Andrew Benintendi and Eduardo Nunez drove in one for Boston, which had won four of six. The Red Sox are 13-13 since their franchise-best 17-2 start.\nCubs 8, Reds 1\nAddison Russell tied a career high with four hits and Jon Lester (4-1) permitted just two hits over six innings as Chicago routed host Cincinnati.\nRussell’s chance at the first five-hit game of his career ended with a walk in the eighth inning. By then, the game was well in hand, with Chicago collecting a whopping 15 hits off three Reds pitchers. Willson Contreras went 3-for-6 with an RBI while Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo each bagged two hits.\nAfter a 93-minute rain delay before first pitch, the first five Cubs to bat touched Homer Bailey (1-6) for hits. Ben Zobrist singled and Bryant doubled to set the table. Rizzo, Contreras and Russell all dug in and took bites with RBI singles for a 3-0 lead before Bailey got his first out.

Tigers right-hander Michael Fulmer, who had allowed just two hits in blanking Seattle through the first six innings, walked Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager leading off the inning.

But it was Choo who delivered the big blast, pulling a high sinker into the seats in right field in the third inning for his sixth home run of the season.\nWhite Sox left fielder Nicky Delmonico left the game in the second inning after being hit by a pitch that fractured his right hand. He is expected to miss four to six weeks. Chicago starter Carson Fulmer (2-4) was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte following the game after he allowed eight runs on just three hits in two-plus innings.\nRays 8, Angels 3\nWilson Ramos homered twice and Blake Snell threw 6 2/3 strong innings to help carry Tampa Bay past host Los Angeles for its fifth win in a row.\nThe home runs for Ramos were Nos. 99 and 100 of his career, part of a 15-hit attack by the Rays offense. Six different players had at least two hits, including three each from Brad Miller and Mallex Smith. Daniel Robertson also homered for Tampa Bay.\nSnell (5-3) followed up Chris Archer’s solid outing in the first game of the series on Thursday with one of his own.

Los Angeles has lost four in a row.\nMarlins 2, Braves 0\nRight-hander Dan Straily pitched seven scoreless innings and retired the final 11 batters he faced to help visiting Miami defeat Atlanta.

Belt had homered in each of his previous four games.\nNolan Arenado got a third-inning rally rolling by drawing a walk, after which Trevor Story singled. One out later, Desmond belted a three-run homer to center field, putting the Rockies ahead for good at 3-1. Desmond made it 4-1 in the sixth with a two-out, ground-rule double, again scoring Arenado, who had led off the inning with a double.\nCardinals 12, Phillies 4\nJose Martinez had four hits, including a home run, to go along with five RBIs as St. Louis routed visiting Philadelphia.\nTommy Pham added three hits, Francisco Pena had three hits, including a home run, and scored three runs while starter Michael Wacha allowed two earned runs in six solid innings.
