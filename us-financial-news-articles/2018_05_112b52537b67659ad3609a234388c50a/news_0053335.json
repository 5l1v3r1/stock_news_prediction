REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/File Photo International rights watchdogs have reported the detention of as many as 11 activists, mostly women who previously campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom’s male guardianship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions.\nThe government announced last week that seven people had been arrested for suspicious contacts with foreign entities and offering financial support to “enemies overseas”, and said other suspects were being sought. It did not name the detainees.\nThe terms of release for Aisha al-Manea, Hassa al-Sheikh and Madeha Alajroush, who have been campaigning since 1990 to lift the driving ban, were unclear. Their names had not appeared in local media reports that denounced some of the other detainees as traitors.\nActivists and diplomats have speculated that the new wave of arrests may be aimed at appeasing conservative elements opposed to social reforms pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It may also be a message to activists not to push demands out of sync with the government’s own agenda, they said.\nThe remaining detainees - including Eman al-Nafjan, Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef, Ibrahim Modeimigh and Mohammed al-Rabea - were unlikely to be released soon, according to fellow activists, who fear they could be kept in jail for months without being charged.\nGovernment officials were not immediately available to comment on the releases.\nState-backed media have labelled those held as “agents of embassies”, unnerving diplomats in Saudi Arabia, a key ally of the United States.\nPrince Mohammed has courted Western allies in a bid to open up the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom and diversify its oil-dependent economy, the region’s largest.\nBut while many hailed the end of the ban on women driving as proof of a new progressive trend, it has been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch and Stephen Kalin; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T11:39:04.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
