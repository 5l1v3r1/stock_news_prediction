REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration President Donald Trump is preparing to impose new sanctions on Iran, the White House said on Wednesday, following the U.S. withdrawal from the multinational 2015 agreement that stalled Iran’s nuclear program.\nThe sanctions would aim to limit global trade of the oil producer’s crude. The effects may be muted as major Asian importers, China chief among them, are likely to continue buying Iranian oil.\nThe People’s Republic stands to benefit if it can use its leverage as the world’s largest importer of crude by insisting that its oil purchases from Iran be priced in yuan.\nOil is priced and traded in U.S. dollars because of the dominance of the dollar-denominated Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarks. Pricing imports in yuan would therefore spare China the cost of exchanging dollars, and would increase the use of the renminbi in global financial trade, which could ultimately hurt the dollar’s international clout.\nIran’s exports are expected to decrease, as are foreign investments in the country. That would hurt not just Iran’s economy but also the dollar’s liquidity, as the global oil trade undergirds the greenback, said Edward Al-Hussainy, senior analyst, global rates and currency at Columbia Threadneedle in Minneapolis. This provides Iran an incentive to approach the People’s Bank of China to discuss a yuan-denominated deal.\nDuring the last round of sanctions prior to the nuclear deal, Iran’s oil supplies fell by around one million barrels per day. But its oil minister said on Thursday that Trump’s decision to quit the pact would not affect Tehran’s exports.\nIn the interest of exerting more control over the price of oil imports, China in March launched a crude futures exchange that could become a yuan-denominated benchmark to rival Brent and WTI.\n“China is the largest commodity producer in the world and the largest commodity consumer in the world, so it would make sense that Chinese futures that are close to the areas of supply and demand would be a more natural benchmark than the U.S. markets,” said Marwan Younes, founder and chief investment officer of Massar Capital Management in New York.\nShortly after the exchange launched, Reuters reported on March 29 that Chinese regulators had informally asked a handful of financial institutions to prepare for pricing China’s crude imports in the yuan, according to three sources at some of the financial firms.\nBoth endeavours are part of a larger effort by Beijing to establish its currency internationally.\nChina has further incentive to establish an interest in Iran’s oil industry, as the country lies at the crossroads of China’s “One Belt, One Road” project, which aims to invest more than $1 trillion in infrastructure from railroads and ports to energy, in more than 60 countries spanning Europe, Africa and Asia.\nReporting by Kate Duguid; Editing by Bill Berkrot\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:05:25.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
