REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nThe commission has been pressurising Ireland to recover the taxes as soon as possible to allow it to close the EU Court of Justice’s action for missing the deadline.\nIreland has insisted that it has acted as fast as it could to facilitate collection and management of such a large sum.\nIn March, Ireland appointed Amundi, BlackRock Investment Management and Goldman Sachs Asset Management to manage an escrow account to hold the money and make low risk investment decisions that protect the Irish taxpayer.\n(This version of the story corrects currency conversion in the first paragraph.)
