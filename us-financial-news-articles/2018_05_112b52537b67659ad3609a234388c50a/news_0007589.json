S&P alluded to that in its statement, saying the central bank has been “facing increasing political pressure.”\nWith the weakening of the lira against the dollar, the private sector will have a harder time repaying its foreign currency-denominated debt, S&P said, adding this would negatively impact government debt - 40 percent of which is denominated in foreign currency.\nNumerous large Turkish companies have sought to restructure their debts. Reuters reported in April that Turkish food giant Yildiz Holding would restructure $6.5 billion of its $8.5 billion in debt.\nTurkey’s Dogus Holding, with outstanding loans that stood at 23.5 billion Turkish lira ($5.73 billion) at the end of 2017, is also in talks with banks on debt restructuring, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n“Our downgrade reflects our view that there is a risk of a hard landing for Turkey’s overheating, credit-fueled economy,” S&P said.\n$1 = 4.1015 Turkish lira Reporting by David Dolan; writing by Ali Kucukgocmen; editing by Peter Graff and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T01:21:42.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
