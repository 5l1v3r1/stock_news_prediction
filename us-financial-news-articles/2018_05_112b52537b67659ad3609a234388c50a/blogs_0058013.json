That compares with an average of just under $1.9 million for the comparable periods over the last eight years.\nIn those previous years, the EPA spent as little as $1.7 million and as much as $2.2 million to protect the previous two administrators, Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson, as well as interim officials.\nPruitt and the EPA are currently facing about a dozen investigations into various ethics, spending and management issues. A central focus of the probes is the cost of Pruitt's travel and his security detail.\nThe records released Friday showed the EPA spent more than $2.7 million in payroll for Pruitt's security detail during the period. The agency spent an additional $763,263 in travel costs for personnel charged with protecting Pruitt.\nPruitt was sworn into office on Feb. 17, 2017. The analysis period runs from the third quarter of the government's fiscal year, which begins on April 1. The data are broken down by quarter, so it is not possible to discern how much EPA spent to protect Pruitt immediately after he was confirmed.\nPruitt and his staff have consistently sought to justify the higher costs by pointing to a higher-than-average number of threats against the administrator. Pruitt has become a lightning rod for his history of climate change skepticism and his cozy relationship with the energy, agricultural and chemical companies he is responsible for regulating. show chapters 5:52 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 02:24\n\"Administrator Pruitt has faced an unprecedented amount of death threats against him and to provide transparency EPA will post the costs of his security detail and pro-actively release these numbers on a quarterly basis. Americans should all agree that members of the President's cabinet should be kept safe from violent threats,\" EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement Friday.\nPruitt has also stressed that expenses like flying first class were recommended by his security detail.\nHowever, Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland pressed Pruitt about an EPA inspector general report that showed Pruitt had asked for round-the-clock security early in his tenure. Pruitt repeatedly refused to state clearly whether or not he had made the request himself.\nA separate EPA watchdog report found the agency had violated the law by approving $43,000 in expenses to install a soundproof phone booth in Pruitt's office without seeking congressional approval.\nâ€” CNBC's John Schoen contributed to this story.", "external_links": ["https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-05/documents/psd_quarterly_payroll_costs_beginning_fy_2009_-_rev5-14-2018.pdf", "https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-05/documents/psd_quarterly_travel_costs_beginning_fy_2009_-_5-11-2018.pdf"], "published": "2018-05-25T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:02:01.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
