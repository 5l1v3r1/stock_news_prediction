European champions Portugal are first up in Group B — a match which is likely to decide who will finish top. They also face Iran and Morocco.\nIf Lopetegui’s side win the group they are likely to face either Uruguay or Egypt in the last 16, with a possible mouthwatering quarter-final against Argentina, Croatia or France coming next.\nReporting by Richard Martin; editing by Martyn Herman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T02:19:41.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
