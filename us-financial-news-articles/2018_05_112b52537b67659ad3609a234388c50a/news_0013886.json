That's lower than the turnout recorded in 2009 and far below analysts' expectations.\nAnwar Amro | AFP | Getty Images A Lebanese Sunni cleric puts his checked ballot in the box as he casts his vote in the first parliamentary election in nine years, at a polling station in the capital Beirut on May 6, 2018. A drop in voter turnout came despite a reformulated electoral system designed to encourage citizens to cast their ballot through proportional representation.\nThe country's official result is expected to be announced on Monday morning.\nPolitical deadlock Voter apathy in Lebanon is perhaps not so surprising given the social and economic upheavals in the country in recent years.\nSince its last election, Lebanon has been engulfed by a refugee crisis which has seen more than one million displaced Syrians stream over its borders, overwhelming the country of around 4.5 million. It also suffered an ongoing waste management crisis during which trash piled up in city streets, went two years without an effective government, experienced a sharp rise in public debt, witnessed multiple terrorist attacks, and had its prime minister temporarily resign in what many described as a kidnapping .\nNonetheless, what has been consistent over the past decade, many Lebanese citizens say, is entrenched corruption, cronyism and political deadlock that's prevented the government from fixing its most pressing problems.\nâ€” CNBC's Natasha Turak contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T10:16:06.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
