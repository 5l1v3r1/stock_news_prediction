Though that cut off malicious communications, it still left the routers infected, and Friday's warning was aimed at cleaning up those machines.\nTetra Images | Getty Images Infections were detected in more than 50 countries, though the primary target for further actions was probably Ukraine, the site of many recent infections and a longtime cyberwarfare battleground.\nIn obtaining the court order, the Justice Department said the hackers involved were in a group called Sofacy that answered to the Russian government.\nSofacy, also known as APT28 and Fancy Bear, has been blamed for many of the most dramatic Russian hacks, including that of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.\nEarlier, Cisco Systems Inc said the hacking campaign targeted devices from Belkin International's Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear Inc, TP-Link, and QNAP.\nAn FBI official told Reuters that the kinds of devices known to be affected by the hack were purchased by users at electronic stores or online.\nHowever, the FBI was not ruling out the possibility that routers provided to customers by internet service companies could also be affected, the official added.\nCisco shared the technical details of its investigation with the U.S. and Ukrainian governments. Western experts say Russia has conducted a series of attacks against companies in Ukraine for more than a year amid armed hostilities between the two countries, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and at least one electricity blackout.\nThe Kremlin on Thursday denied the Ukrainian government's accusation that Russia was planning a cyber attack on Ukrainian state bodies and private companies ahead of the Champions League soccer final in Kiev on Saturday.\n\"The size and scope of the infrastructure by VPNFilter malware is significant,\" the FBI said, adding that it is capable of rendering peoples' routers \"inoperable.\"\nIt said the malware is hard to detect, due to encryption and other tactics.\nThe FBI urged people to reboot their devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and help identify infected devices.\nPeople should also consider disabling remote-management settings, changing passwords and upgrading to the latest firmware.\nWatch this Russian hacker break into our computer: show chapters Watch this Russian hacker break into our computer and take complete control in minutes 8:31 AM ET Sat, 5 Aug 2017 | 02:43", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:51:01.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
