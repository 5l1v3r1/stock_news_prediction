Although automated, each warehouse will employ around 600 people each.\nSchlotman said it will be a \"relatively slow\" process with each site taking around two years as the firms identify locations, secure permits and then build the warehouses. Following that, Ocado will install the robotic technology.\nshow chapters Opportunity in the US is tremendous: Ocado CEO 10 Hours Ago | 03:00 Luke Jensen, CEO of Ocado Solutions, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Thursday that getting into the U.S. market would prove a tremendous opportunity as Americans warmed to the idea of online deliveries.\n\"The grocery online market in the U.S. has been relatively underdeveloped compared with some European markets. It represents less than 2 percent of the total grocer market, versus 7.5 percent in the U.K., but is now growing very fast and is an enormous growth market,\" he said.\nJensen added that the recent Amazon tie-up with Whole Foods proved that the U.S. grocery market is changing and that people want to both order online and shop in-store.\nThe deal is the latest in a series of tie-ups announced by Ocado recently. It has already inked agreements with Sweden's ICA, Canada's Sobey's and French supermarket operator Casino.\nJensen told CNBC he was \"very comfortable\" that the necessary financing is in place to fulfil all of the contracts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T13:30:11.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
