My last day at HMG will be May 31 and a full transition plan is underway that will be seamless and complete.\nIt has been a fun and at times challenging journey but by the grace of God, and with the help of committed co-founders and a solid group of investors, HMG today is an iconic brand that is stronger than ever and continues to grow.\nEven as I complete my ride with Hispanicize, I am encouraged that the original Hispanicize partners will remain to scale the company in collaboration with our CEO Joe Uva, a very capable management team and a dedicated board of directors. Given Joe’s leadership and a very successful Hispanicize event that we just completed in Miami, I feel the timing is beyond perfect.\nMy decision to depart HMG is based solely on my intense desire to launch a major new venture that has been my dream for years and makes me feel completely fulfilled and frankly, overjoyed. I can’t wait to share with the world what this beautiful new venture is but in the meantime, please know that although I will not be day to day at HMG, I am not fully leaving the company.\nAs the founder, largest individual shareholder and board member of HMG, I plan to be actively engaged with Hispanicize and will use my voice to continue to make sure the company keeps its soul, representing the Latino community that we serve.\nIn big and small ways, many of you have contributed to my growth and the incredible opportunities that are now before me. For that, I am eternally grateful and for this reason today’s news is not so much a “goodbye” as it is a “see you around.'”\nWith all my heart,\nManny\nFor interview requests, email Angela Sustaita-Ruiz, angela@hmgmedia.co .\nCONTACT:\nAngela Sustaita-Ruiz\nangela@hmgmedia.co .\nSource:Hispanicize Media Group(HMG)", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f538e86a-85bf-4506-b117-9e017b9dced9"], "published": "2018-05-15T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:00:54.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
