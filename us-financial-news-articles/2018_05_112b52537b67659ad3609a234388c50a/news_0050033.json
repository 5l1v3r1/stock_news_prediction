REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\nSpeaking at a Bloomberg conference, Ghosn reiterated that the carmakers were examining ways to consolidate the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance and assuage doubts about its survival after his eventual departure. Renault currently owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, which controls Mitsubishi Motors ( 7211.T ).\nAsked whether this could transform the carmakers into a single listed entity in 2018 or 2019, however, Ghosn answered: “I don’t think so.” Reuters reported in March that Renault and Nissan were discussing a deeper tie-up.
