Keep an eye on your mortgage, student loans and credit cards, and look into whether refinancing those accounts can help keep the interest you're paying down. 12:55 PM ET Fri, 18 May 2018 | 01:11\nThe market has already started anticipating rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, and you should too.\nCentral bank officials have said they are planning to raise rates three times this year. That could go up to four hikes, depending on how June unemployment rate numbers play out.\nThose moves under Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will change how you access credit and borrow money.\nOne key area you want to watch is how these changes affect your existing debts, according to Ted Jenkin, CEO of Oxygen Financial.\nMore from Straight Talk:\nHere are three key debts Jenkin recommends you should watch. Mortgages Ericsphotography | Getty Images\nIf you have an adjustable rate mortgage, now may be the time to lock in a lower rate by moving to a fixed-rate mortgage.\n\"Or you may just want to start paying off the mortgage more quickly,\" Jenkin said. Student loans\nYou should also look at any student loans that have variable rates, which may climb really high as the Fed bumps rates up, Jenkin said.

Credit cards\nYou could get a shock on your credit card statements after rates rise, when your annual percentage rate jumps two or three percentage points.\nAs such, that debt will cost you more, and you will want to adjust your monthly budget to accommodate that, Jenkin said. Or better yet, pay down those debts before rates go up.\nAnd don't forget to look at how these moves could affect your investments.\n\"Typically, as interest rates rise, your equity or stock investments will start to slow down,\" Jenkin said. \"You should think about this when you look at rebalancing your portfolio.\" Lorie Konish Personal Finance Reporter Playing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:58:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
