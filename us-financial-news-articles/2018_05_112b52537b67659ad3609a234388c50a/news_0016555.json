Kusserow, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “I am proud of our first quarter results as once again we have made great progress in all four key areas of our strategy. Total home health admissions and volumes are moving in the right direction as our business development staffing strategy takes hold. Continued strong performance from our hospice segment, personal care growth and disciplined cost controls have helped to deliver significant increases in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share as compared to the first quarter of 2017. We have once again improved our position as an industry leader in quality, having increased our STARs score for the twelfth straight quarter. Our continued focus on our employees can be seen in our stabilized turnover rates and the investment we have made in operational efficiency has resulted in increased productivity from our clinical staff. We will continue to focus on organic growth in all three of lines of business throughout the remainder of 2018 and have a balance sheet that provides flexibility to execute upon a range of capital allocation priorities. A special thanks to all of our nearly 18,000 employees that helped to deliver such an impressive quarter.”\n2018 Guidance\nNet service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of $1.60 billion to $1.64 billion.\nAdjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $158 million to $163 million.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is anticipated to be in the range of $2.97 to $3.08 based on an estimated 34.85 million shares outstanding.\nThis guidance excludes the effects of any future acquisitions, if any are made.\nWe urge caution in considering the current trends and 2018 guidance disclosed in this press release.

The non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules are as follows: (1) adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. before provision for income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization, excluding certain items; (2) adjusted net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc., defined as net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. excluding certain items; and (3) adjusted net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. per diluted share, defined as net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. common stockholders per diluted share excluding certain items. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, are useful gauges of our current performance and are also included in internal management reporting. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not more meaningful than or as an alternative to the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the company’s financial statements. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures consistently.\nAdditional information\nAmedisys, Inc.
