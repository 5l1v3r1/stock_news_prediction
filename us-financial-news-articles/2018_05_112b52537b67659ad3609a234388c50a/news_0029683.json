That is how close it was.”\n“When they first told me I was on a ventilator, I didn’t believe them. I’ve got other people filling in blanks. If you can’t breathe by yourself, you are not in a good place. I have to be relieved as I nearly died,” he said.\nCampbell remains in hospital while he recovers but said he hopes to be released on Tuesday.\nReporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
