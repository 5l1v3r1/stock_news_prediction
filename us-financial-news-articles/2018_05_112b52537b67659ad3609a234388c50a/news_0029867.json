I feel like they’re tough to read but today I felt like I did a very good job reading the greens,” Johnson said.\n“I haven’t the best record here but it’s a golf course that I like and I feel I should play well here.”\nJohnson has been ranked number one for more than a year, but has four players nipping at his heels, and has to win on Sunday to be certain of retaining his ranking.\nJustin Thomas, Jon Rahm, Jordan Spieth and Justin Rose all have a mathematical chance of going to number one, something Johnson shrugs off as nothing more than noise.\n“I don’t care what people are talking about,” he said. “It doesn’t bother me.”\nKim, meanwhile, reached seven-under after 16 holes, but ran up two straight bogeys as he got a late case of the hooks.\n“The last three holes I missed it a little but I know that miss and I’m going to fix it better for tomorrow,” he said.\nAfter barely a breath of wind in the morning, a light breeze sprang up just after noon — not enough to be a huge bother to the afternoon starters, but probably enough to prevent anyone from going really low.\nTiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Jason Day and U.S. Masters champion Patrick Reed were among the late starters.
