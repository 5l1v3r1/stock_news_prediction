They can alter your voice, airbrush your face, add animation, and are sometimes even brand sponsored.\nPreviously, certain Snapchat Lenses could only respond to facial gestures — for example opening your mouth, or raising your eyebrows might trigger an animation. This latest feature, however, responds to sound.\nThe Snapchat filter itself looks like the image below — an animal-esque overlay with a heart nose, whiskers, and glowing ears — and when you speak or make sounds (the louder the better) the ears expand. (In the final product, it also alters your voice making it high-pitched.)\nMore of the Lenses are expected to roll out this week, according to a report from Engadget . Trying out the first @Snapchat Lens with sound reaction, seems pretty neat! pic.twitter.com/aBHnRBKjny\n— Jake Krol (@Jake31Krol) May 29, 2018 ", "external_links": ["https://www.engadget.com/2018/05/28/snapchat-lens-reacts-to-sound/", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://twitter.com/Snapchat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://t.co/aBHnRBKjny", "https://twitter.com/Jake31Krol/status/1001460746377728002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-05-29T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:46:37.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
