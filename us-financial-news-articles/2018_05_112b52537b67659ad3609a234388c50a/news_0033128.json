Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\nNo financial terms were announced.\nThe Giants wrote in a statement, “The compromise agreement, entered into by all parties, should not be viewed as supporting any allegations, claims or defenses. All parties are grateful to have the matter, which began in 2014, concluded and are now focused on football, the fans and the future.”\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2014, was due to start in Hackensack, N.J., next week after a week’s postponement.\nPlaintiffs Eric Inselberg, Michael Jakab and Sean Godown alleged that in 2010, Manning sent an email asking a Giants equipment manager for two helmets that “can pass as game-used.” Manning has a deal with Steiner Sports to provide memorabilia.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/Files\nThe Giants and Manning maintained that they never did anything wrong.\nNewsday obtained a Manning deposition from 2017 in which he said of the email to the equipment manager, “I believe I’m asking for two helmets that can satisfy as being game-used — satisfy the requirement of being game-used.”\nManning was expected to testify in the case, as was Giants co-owner John Mara (who was listed as a co-defendant) and Steiner Sports CEO Brandon Steiner.\nManning, 37, is set for his 15th NFL season this fall. He is a two-time Super Bowl champion and a four-time Pro Bowl performer.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T08:52:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
