Trump’s decision was not a big surprise as it had been reported thoroughly beforehand,” said Kadota at Barclays.\nThe dollar was 0.05 percent higher at 109.210 yen, edging back towards a high of reached 109.350 the previous day.\nSterling traded at $1.3558 following a decline to a four-month low of $1.3485 overnight.\nThe pound has fallen heavily in recent weeks on expectations the BoE would not, as earlier believed, tighten monetary policy because of a relatively weak economy and as investors piled into a rallying dollar.\nThe Australian dollar extended its overnight slide to $0.7443.\nPressured by the dollar’s broad strength, the Aussie lost 0.85 percent overnight despite an upbeat budget from the country’s government and touched an 11-month trough of $0.7434.
