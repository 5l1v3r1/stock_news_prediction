She has denied any wrongdoing and plans to step down in July.\nControlling shareholder and former chairman Shaul Elovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was also arrested along with a number of other officials connected with Bezeq. They all deny any wrongdoing.\nElovitch controls Bezeq through Eurocom.\n“We continue to believe that Bezeq is fundamentally a well-positioned and resilient business, where — following a sustained period of poor governance and management — a new leadership team can drive performance improvements and rebuild shareholder value,” Elliott said.\nShares in Bezeq were up 0.1 percent in afternoon trade. They are down 20 percent this year and fell by 29 percent in 2017. Reporting by Steven Scheer.
