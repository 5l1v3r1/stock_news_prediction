(Nasdaq:URGN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing advanced non-surgical treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology. The Company has developed RTGel™, a proprietary sustained release, hydrogel-based platform technology that has the potential to improve therapeutic profiles of existing drugs. UroGen's sustained release technology is designed to enable longer exposure of the urinary tract tissue to medications, making local therapy a potentially more effective treatment option. UroGen Pharma's lead product candidates, UGN-101 (MitoGel™, also known as mitomycin urothelial gel) and UGN-102 (VesiGel™, also known as mitomycin intravesical gel), are designed to potentially remove tumors by non-surgical means and to treat several forms of non-muscle invasive urothelial cancer, including low-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma and bladder cancer, respectively. UroGen is headquartered in Ra’anana, Israel with U.S. headquarters in New York.\nUROGEN CONTACT:\nKate Bechtold\nDirector, Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\nKateB@UroGen.com\n914-552-0456\nSource:UroGen Pharma Ltd.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2PCgx9cgYmZ7lfeotziRzvTXu2dC0vTNPfNYqPm6im3MRZJD0_1_Xr3AnoIprMLAFwvPdgVQV5iXemMdJA19YQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P2yXcAMvSKGcPR-SUFWUWcPxaJbUTjECMXgfS0stzQxWX3mGelytHu_W0IabeG4tlXwKhswvdtSH5mQWSCUwuJU8r7zzEvASIXS5VChk0lY=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/daacff39-7b16-44f1-95c4-c22b7970bff1"], "published": "2018-05-08T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:48:32.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
