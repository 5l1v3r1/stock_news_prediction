It is also a crime to take someone abroad to be married against their will. The maximum penalty is seven years.\nKarma Nirvana, a charity supporting forced marriage victims, hailed the verdict as “very significant”.\n“It sets a massive precedent,” said Natasha Rattu, a lawyer at Karma Nirvana.\n“If you are not prosecuting anybody under the law it will not have any deterrent effect.”\nCampaigners said the verdict would encourage girls from communities that practise forced marriage to speak out.\n“Many victims don’t actually acknowledge that they are being abused because they are conditioned to believe that when they get to an age of marriage their parents choose who they marry,” Rattu said.\n“But we are sending out a strong message that they have the choice - and if they are being forced there are consequences.”\nThe government’s Forced Marriage Unit received reports of nearly 2,000 possible cases last year, many involving girls from South Asian backgrounds, but campaigners say the figure is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThe verdict is the second forced marriage conviction in Britain but the first where the defendant was related to the victim. In 2015 a Welsh court convicted a man of using duress to make a woman marry him.\nDetective Superintendent Sally Holmes of West Midlands Police praised the victim’s “extraordinary” bravery.\n“Anyone who is considering marrying a person against their will must understand that we will thoroughly investigate any such offences, wherever they take place in the world,” she said.\nEditing by Claire Cozens and Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
