(NASDAQ:GWRS), (TSX:GWR), a pure-play water resource management company, reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. All quarterly comparisons are to the previous year unless otherwise noted.\nQ1 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues increased 9.3% to $7.4 million, driven by growth in active connections, increased consumption, and approved rate increases.\nNet income increased by $0.1 million to $0.3 million, or $0.02 per share. As a percentage of revenues, net income was 4.3%.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, as defined below, increased 14.1% to $3.7 million. As a percentage of revenues, Adjusted EBITDA was 49.7%.\nQ1 2018 Operational Highlights\nTotal active connections increased 4.9% to 39,542 at March 31, 2018 from 37,687 at March 31, 2017, and up 1.4% (or 5.6% on an annualized basis) from 38,997 at December 31, 2017.\nNominated Debra G.

We believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth. This means we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services areas.\n“Our board nominations and expanded management team during the quarter will help us remain at the forefront of the water management industry, and advance our mission of achieving efficient growth and consolidation.\n“Our recently secured credit facility, combined with positive cash flow and over $6 million in cash, provides us greater financial flexibility as we pursue our growth strategies. This includes taking advantage of favorable market opportunities to aggregate water and wastewater utilities, and continuing to invest in our utilities as they experience rapid growth. Together, this will allow Global Water and its customers to realize the benefits of consolidation.\n“We recently announced an accretive acquisition of Turner Ranches to expand our footprint in Maricopa County, the fastest growing county in the nation, according to U.S. Census Bureau. Turner Ranches will be the second purchase, post-recession, in our declared strategy of pursuing water utility acquisitions. We believe our focus on consolidating, improving, and automating water utility assets will greatly benefit the customers of Turner Ranches, and we look forward to serving these new communities.\n“Along with the Arizona Corporation Commission’s desire for consolidation of the highly-fragmented water utility industry in Arizona and their new policy guidelines that support and incent such consolidation, the stage is well set for additional acquisitions.\n“Looking ahead, we see the potential for growth from our acquisition strategy. We also expect to see continued growth driven by organic growth in new connections, as well as increased consumption and pre-approved rate increases.”\n2018 Financial Summary\nRevenues\nRevenues in the first quarter of 2018 increased by $0.6 million, or 9.3%, to $7.4 million, compared to $6.8 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily attributed to a 4.9% increase in active connections, increased consumption, and the approved increase in rates.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 6.5%, to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in general and administrative expenses, coupled with an increase in depreciation.\nOther Income (Expense)\nTotal other expense increased by $0.2 million, or 21.7%, to $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributed to a $0.2 million increase in other – related party costs and a decrease in the Valencia earn-out of $0.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in interest expense of $0.1 million.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income increased by $0.1 million to $0.3 million, or $0.02 per share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share, for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributed to the $0.3 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $0.2 million increase in other expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $0.5 million, or 14.1%, to $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to organic connection growth, increased consumption, higher rates, and reduced deferred compensation. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by an increase in professional fees and general and administrative salaries, specifically due to a one-time severance payout. (See definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, and its reconciliation to GAAP, below.)\nDividend Policy\nThe company declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.023625 per common share (or $0.2835 per share on an annualized basis), which will be payable on May 30, 2018 to holders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\nGlobal Water's near-term growth strategy for its regulated water, wastewater, and recycled water business is driven by increased service connections, continued operating efficiencies, and utility rate increases approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission. The company will also focus more on its original mission of aggregating water and wastewater utilities, allowing the company and its customers to realize the benefits of consolidation, regionalization, and environmental stewardship.\nConnection Rates\nAs of March 31, 2018, active service connections increased by 1,855, or 4.9%, to 39,542, compared to 37,687 at March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the vacancy rate was at 1.5% down from the peak of 11.2% in February 2009.\nArizona’s Growth Corridor: Positive Population Trends\nThe Metropolitan Phoenix area is steadily growing due to low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The area’s population has increased throughout 2017 and 2018, and it continues to grow. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that Phoenix Metro will have a population of 4.9 million by 2020, up 15% from 2016 census estimates, and reach 6.8 million by 2040.\nAccording to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip real estate consensus panel (\"Greater Phoenix Blue Chip\"), most sectors of real estate are expected to experience improved occupancy and growth. For Maricopa County and Pinal County combined, the Homebuilders Association of Central Arizona, reported that single family housing permits grew 12% to 19,854 units in 2017. Permits are forecasted by the Greater Phoenix Blue Chip to increase to nearly 24,000 permits in 2018 and to 27,000 permits in 2019. In the City of Maricopa, where Global Water has its largest water and wastewater permitted utility service area, the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona reports that permits are up 90% year over year.\nThe company believes this growth outlook, combined with three additional years of rate increase phase-ins, creates an opportunity for it to significantly increase its active connections and grow revenues.\nConference Call\nGlobal Water Resources will hold a conference call to discuss its 2018 results tomorrow, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Thursday, May 10, 2018\nTime: 1:00 p.m. Eastern time (10:00 a.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-855-327-6837\nInternational dial-in number: 1-778-331-2160\nConference ID: 10004716\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay here as well as via a link in the Investors section of the company’s website at www.gwresources.com .\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time.

EBITDA is defined for the purposes of this press release as net income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the gain or loss related to (i) nonrecurring events; (ii) option expense related to awards made to the board of directors; and (iii) equity method investment. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide our investors meaningful measures of overall corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method and timing of expenditures associated with building and placing our systems. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors, and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it provides our investors measures of our recurring core business. However, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that non-GAAP measures, such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. Management's method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss), the most comparable GAAP measures, are included in the schedules attached to this press release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain which reflect the Company's expectations regarding future events. The involve a number of assumptions, risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the . These include, but are not limited to, statements concerning, future net income growth, our strategy, acquisition plans, our dividend policy, trends relating to population growth, active connections, regulated revenue, housing permit projections, and other statements that are not historical facts as well as statements identified by words such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"plans\", \"believes\", \"seeks\", \"estimates\", or the negative of these terms, or other words of similar meaning. These statements are based on our current beliefs or expectations and are inherently subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in political, economic, business, market, regulatory, and other factors. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any , which reflect management’s views as of the date hereof. Factors that may affect future results are disclosed under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), which are available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . This includes, but is not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 which was filed with the SEC.
