(NASDAQ:TTD), a provider of a global technology platform for buyers of advertising, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“The programmatic revolution continues to gain momentum. In the first quarter we surpassed even our own expectations. A steady stream of new brands and agencies joined our platform; we won additional spend from existing customers; and we developed closer relationships with the biggest brands in the world. For the quarter, revenue was $85.7 million, up 61% from a year ago and adjusted EBITDA increased 202% to $18.9 million,” said Founder and CEO of The Trade Desk, Jeff Green. “International growth was again exceptional. Much of our growth came in channels key to our business such as Mobile, Video, Connected TV, and Audio. Data spend in the month of March spiked to an all-time record. We continue to invest in technology infrastructure, product development, and international expansion. These areas of investment are critical to gaining additional market share. We expect the investments we are making now will help drive our next wave of growth in the coming years.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP Results Revenue $ 85.7 $ 53.4 Increase in revenue year over year 61 % 76 % Net Income $ 9.1 $ 4.9 Diluted EPS $ 0.20 $ 0.11 Non-GAAP Results Adjusted EBITDA $ 18.9 $ 6.3 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 22 % 12 % Non-GAAP Net Income $ 15.3 $ 7.8 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $ 0.34 $ 0.18 First Quarter and Recent Business Highlights Include:\nContinued Omnichannel Growth: Omnichannel solutions remain a strategic focus for The Trade Desk as the industry continues shifting toward transparency and programmatic buying. Specific channel highlights include:\n-- Total Mobile (in-app, video, and web) grew 95% from Q12017 to Q12018 and increased to 42% of gross spend for the quarter highlighting the growing scale and importance of this channel to advertisers\n-- Mobile Video grew nearly 160% from Q12017 to Q12018\n-- Mobile In-App grew nearly 110% from Q12017 to Q12018 Newer Channels Delivering Growth: Two of our newest and most promising channels, Connected TV and audio grew multiples faster than The Trade Desk’s larger and more mature channels:\n-- Connected TV grew over 2,000% from Q12017 to Q12018\n-- Audio grew over 650% from Q12017 to Q12018 Strong Customer Retention: Customer retention remained over 95% during the quarter, as it has for the previous 17 quarters. New Products and Features: During the quarter, The Trade Desk released many new product features and enhancements to its platform including:\n-- Integration with On-Target Percentage (OTP) metrics in the Connected TV environment on Campaign and Ad Group dashboards, bringing valuable insights front and center when optimizing to an OTP goal.\n-- Updates to Audience Predictor which enhance lookalike modeling tools to find and target undiscovered audiences based upon first-party data. Recent improvements include improved sampling rates, faster audience creations, inclusion of CPM segments, percent-of-media segments, and the ability to exclude audiences. Best Places to Work: The Trade Desk ranked as one of the best places to work on Glassdoor’s Best Software Companies to Work for in 2018 list.\nSecond Quarter and Revised Full Year 2018 Outlook:\nMr. Green added: “In 2018, we are off to a great start. The biggest brands in the world continue to shift their advertising spending to programmatic through our platform. As a result, we are raising our 2018 revenue guidance to be at least $433 million. At the same time, we are continuing to make large investments in areas critical to our future. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be $133 million for 2018. The secular tailwind of programmatic is strong. Our focus is on gaining share and revenue growth as this will ultimately maximize profitability over the long-term.”\nThe Trade Desk is providing its financial targets for the second quarter of 2018 and revised targets for its fiscal year 2018. The Company’s financial targets are as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2018:\nRevenue of $103 million Adjusted EBITDA of $30 million\nFull Year 2018\nRevenue of at least $433 million Adjusted EBITDA of $133 million or about 30.5% of revenue\nReconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of our stock-based compensation expense that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. We expect the variability of the above charges could have a significant and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIncluded within this press release are non-GAAP financial measures that supplement the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of The Trade Desk, Inc. (the Company) prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust the Company's actual results prepared under GAAP by excluding charges for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense, net, and secondary offering costs. Tax rates on the tax-deductible portions of the stock-based compensation expense approximating 30% and 40% have been used in the computation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Since the other excluded charges are non-taxable, a tax effect for those charges was not included. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company's management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company's operational trends, financial performance, and cash generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for or superior to corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Webcast and Conference Call Details\nWhen: May 10, 2018 at 2:00 P.M.
