But it weakened against the euro by half a percent, to 87.51 pence, thanks to a broad-based euro bounce.\nHopes that Italy could avoid a new election after all helped European markets recover from one of their worst sell-offs in years on Wednesday, though markets remained wary.\nMay’s purchasing-manager index will offer some clues on how the economy is faring. A Reuters poll forecast the index would show growth moderated in April.\nWith monetary policy makers turning more cautious and data-dependent after a subdued first quarter, PMI releases over the next two weeks deserve particular attention, Goldman Sachs strategists said in a note.\nCurrency derivatives tied to the outlook for sterling were trading near their lowest levels in nearly three months.\nRisk reversals for sterling, a gauge of demand for options on a currency rising or falling, are holding near their lowest levels since early March, indicating that investors are looking to protect downside portfolio risk.\nOn a trade-weighted basis, sterling was trading at 78.73, not far from a two-month low of 78.53 hit earlier this month.
