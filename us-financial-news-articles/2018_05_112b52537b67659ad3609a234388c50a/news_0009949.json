(NASDAQ:TLF) today reported the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. A conference call will be conducted by senior management at 10:00 am Eastern Time on May 3, 2018. Dial-in details have been provided previously and are included below for reference.\nNet sales increased 0.7% to $20.3 prior year’s $20.2 million (consolidated same store sales decreased 0.9%, while new stores added $0.3 million of sales). Gross profit margin improved to 63.3% compared to prior year’s 61.0%. Operating income increased 1.8% to approximately $1.8 million from $1.7 million in the prior year. Diluted EPS was $0.14 compared to prior year’s $0.13.\n“We were fairly pleased with this quarter’s performance, as we achieved both top line and bottom line improvements,” commented Shannon Greene, Chief Executive Officer. “While it’s good news, there is still much work to be done to drive sustainable growth in traffic and sales to reach our 2020 financial targets. We remain focused on sales expansion and cost controls to continue the trend of improvement.”\nSales from the North America division, consisting of all stores in the US and Canada, increased $86,000 to $19.3 million in the first quarter, up 0.4% from last year's first quarter sales of $19.2 million. The sales increase in North America was driven by new stores, offset by a 1.2% decline in same store sales. International, consisting of four stores outside of North America, added sales of $972,000 for the quarter, a 5.8% increase from last year’s first quarter sales of $918,000. The sales increase in International was primarily due to foreign currency exchange, as sales in local currency were relatively flat.\nConsolidated gross profit margin increased from 61.0% in the first quarter of 2017 to 63.3% in the first quarter of 2018, primarily due to customer and product mix. Operating expenses increased $525,000 in the first quarter of 2018 to $11.1 million compared to $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, increasing as a percentage of sales from 52.4% in 2017 to 54.6% in 2018. Significant increases in operating expenses relate to personnel and occupancy costs for the three new stores that have opened since the first quarter of last year, as well as personnel and travel costs for the twelve district managers, many of whom had not yet been placed until March and April 2017.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, which was higher than the estimated 21% in prior guidance. Changes to the tax rate include the addition of the new global foreign income provision, the loss of the domestic production deduction, and a lower than expected deferred tax benefit. Additionally, we have not fully completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act and during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we have made no adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017. Any adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017 will be reflected upon the completion of our accounting for the Tax Act which is expected by the third quarter of 2018. At this time, our guidance range for full year 2018 EPS remains unchanged.\nConsolidated net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 3.4%.\nAt March 31, 2018, inventory equaled $36.8 million, with an average inventory per store of $187,000 (excluding inventory at our home office manufacturing and distribution center and in-transit inventory), compared to $176,000 per store at December 31, 2017. Overall, inventory levels decreased $0.5 million since December 31, 2017, mostly at our home office manufacturing and distribution center, while our inventory levels at the stores increased as we stocked up following the holiday season. Cash on hand totaled $19.3 million, an increase of $0.9 million, over December 31, 2017 cash levels.\nTina Castillo, Chief Financial Officer added, “Our first quarter results reflect a positive start to 2018. In addition, during this first quarter, we were successful in repurchasing 72,400 TLF shares, at an average price of $7.47. This buyback was funded with proceeds from our line of credit. We look forward to building on our momentum as we progress through 2018.”\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be conducted by senior management at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 3, 2018 and will be accessible to the public by calling 877-312-5524 or 253-237-1144.
