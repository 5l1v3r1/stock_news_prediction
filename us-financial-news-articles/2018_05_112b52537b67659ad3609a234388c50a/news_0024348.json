Fisher hit his fourth.\nCole was relieved by Joe Smith to start the bottom of the seventh. He allowed four hits and three walks in his six innings.\nCole had struck out 12 in a no-decision against the A’s in Houston on April 29. He then one-hit the Los Angeles Angels, striking out 16, in his last start.\nThe Astros increased their lead against the Oakland bullpen in the eighth when Yuli Gurriel doubled home George Springer and Jose Altuve, both of whom had singled.\nMengden (2-4) was pulled immediately following Fisher’s homer in the seventh, having allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out four and did not walk a batter.\nThe loss was his 11th in 12 decisions in his career in Oakland.\nAstros relievers Smith, Will Harris and Ken Giles retired all nine batters they faced in relief of Cole. Giles was credited with his fifth save after a 1-2-3 ninth.\nHouston pitchers allowed three or fewer runs for the fourth straight game.\nAltuve went 3-for-4 to raise his batting average to .331.\nThe A’s were out-hit 10-4, with one of the Oakland hits being a double by Stephen Piscotty, who recorded a hit for the second straight game following the death of his mother on Sunday.\nThe A’s, who were held to two or fewer runs for the fifth straight game, split a six-game homestand after having swept three from the Baltimore Orioles.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:35:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
