REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nFinance minister Philip Hammond favours an approach that would keep Britain close to the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc, but the central bank does not want to be left as a “rule-taker”, according to the report.\n“It is very, very bad. The bank wants to have as much control as possible and doesn’t want to be a rule-taker,” the FT quoted one BoE official as saying. Another said there was a fear that the finance ministry “is going to give it all away”.\nThe Bank of England (BoE) declined to comment on the report.\nThe BoE and the finance ministry, known in Britain as the Treasury, had both backed “mutual recognition” as the basis of a deal in financial services, meaning close co-operation between regulators and financial policymakers would see British and EU regulations recognised by the other party.
