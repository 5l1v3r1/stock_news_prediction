REUTERS/Aaron Harris While plain-spoken populist Doug Ford looked set to lead the PCs to victory in Ontario when the campaign began nearly three weeks ago, momentum in the fight to unseat Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne has shifted to the left.\nAn Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday showed Ford’s PCs with 37 percent support, while the New Democrats, led by longtime opposition legislator Andrea Horwath, had 34 percent, and the ruling Liberals 22 percent.\nAn Ipsos poll taken just before the election campaign began showed the PCs with 40 percent support, the New Democrats with 29 percent and the Liberals with 26 percent.\nOntario is home to a third of Canada’s population of 36 million and is the nation’s economic engine and manufacturing heartland.\nFord, who has drawn comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump for his blunt speech and business background, acknowledged Horwath’s surge as he shifted his attack to her in the final televised leaders’ debate on Sunday.\n“I travel around, I’ve talked to hundreds and hundreds of companies. They are terrified of the NDP coming in,” Ford said during the debate, warning that the NDP - which last governed the province from 1990 to 1995 - was not ready for power.\nProgressive Conservative party leader Doug Ford speaks at a campaign rally in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, April 30, 2018.
