She is a former director at the World Bank and is currently an adviser at the Asian Infrastructure Development Bank. Where China-style economic management has worked\nNonetheless, one African country known for its economic partnership with China is Ethiopia . Infrastructure, as well as industrial parks to boost the manufacturing sector, have been built as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, a multi-billion dollar spending plan to resurrect ancient trading routes centered on China. Jenny Vaughan | AFP | Getty Images People working on an assembly line at Huajian shoe factory in Dukem, Ethiopia, on April 19, 2012.\nEthiopia, an East African country that has seen double-digit gross domestic product (GDP) growth as recently as 2017, has echoed China's state-led development style.\nThis approach \"will only work in countries where the power is highly centralized,\" Anna Rosenberg, research director at emerging market advisory firm Frontier Strategy Group, told CNBC on Friday. Besides Ethiopia, she cited Mozambique and Rwanda as suitable examples. Nigeria's entrepreneurial society was less conducive to China-style economic management, she said.\nHistory could also play a role, Rosenberg suggested. While Cold War allegiances to the Soviet Union may be present in some African countries, Nigeria, by contrast, is a former British colony and therefore more espoused to a free market system. China's strategic partner\n\"I think China sees Africa as a strategic continent that it wants to be a partner with,\" Okonjo-Iweala said. \"Africa does have the natural resources that China lacks in many ways.\"\nBut, she added that in her view, this partnership extends beyond pure economic deals. \"I believe strongly there is overarching political and soft power that is involved.\" show chapters 2:29 PM ET Mon, 30 April 2018 | 04:06\nFor Okonjo-Iweala, it is important to demonstrate the fruits of African business deals with China to the public. She described Beijing-funded new airport terminals in the Nigerian capital Abuja as an example of this because \"people will be able to see them, and witness them, and know that the money went into something concrete.\"\nLast week, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported that Nigeria had signed a deal with the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation to build a railway from its economic hub Lagos to Kano, a commercial hotspot in the north of the country.\nAfrican countries must enter business deals with China \"with our eyes open,\" Okonjo-Iweala said, to capitalize on its manufacturing expertise and technological development.\nAfrica is in the process of expanding its manufacturing sector in an attempt to bolster economic development. Nigeria, as part of an attempt to wean itself off oil dependence, has grown its manufacturing base from just 2.5 percent of value added to GDP in 2009 to 8.8 percent in 2016, according to the World Bank.\nBut with regards to regulating Africa-China business deals, \"we are absolutely not there,\" Okonjo-Iweala said, although she added that this varied between African countries. Providing that fair and transparent agreements are drawn up, \"we can work with China – why not?\" Pius Utomi Ekpei | AFP | Getty Images Oshodi market in Lagos, Nigeria.
