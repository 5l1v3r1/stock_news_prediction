Investors have been selling Treasurys amid fears that rising inflation could lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than the market is expecting.\n\"Rates on risk-free cash assets (government bills and notes) in the U.S. have now risen to a record high against equivalent rates on euro-area debt. If this leads to or is associated with a renewed/sustained rally in the dollar exchange rate, it will have important implications for global asset allocation,\" Darda, the firm's chief economist, said in a note to clients.\nRising rates have helped keep a lid on stock gains in 2018. For the year, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 are up only 0.3 percent and 2 percent, respectively. Last year, both indexes surged at least 19 percent.\nDarda added gold could be in danger, as the higher rates could spark a bear market for the precious metal. \"Although the relationship isn't perfect, rising real rates ... have been strongly inversely related to the level of gold prices over the last two decades.\"\nGold prices have been under pressure this year, falling more than 1 percent in that time period. The precious metal also posted its biggest one-day decline since November 2016 on Tuesday, dropping to a level not seen since Dec. 28.\nGold futures for June delivery settled up 0.1 percent at $1,291.50 per ounce on Wednesday.
