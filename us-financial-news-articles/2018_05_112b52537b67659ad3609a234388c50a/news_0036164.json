Gross margin was $1.3 million, or 21.7% of revenues during the first quarter compared to $0.9 million, or 33.5% for Q1 2017. Q1 2018 operating loss was $1.06 million compared to an operating loss of $.3 million for Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $.2 million or 3.9% for Q1 2018 compared to earnings of $.1 million or 4.1 % for Q1 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.05 million or ($0.09) per basic and diluted share versus a net loss of $.3 million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share for Q1 2017. More than 2.8 million total transactions were processed during Q1 2018. More than $782 million total dollars were processed during Q1 2018. Achieved a company record high 305% percent increase in credit card dollars processed and 307% percent increase in credit card transactions in the first quarter compared to Q1 2017. Payment Data Systems continues to be in solid financial condition with $3.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 electronic check transaction volumes were up 5% over the fourth quarter of 2017, representing the third consecutive quarter of growth. Returned check transactions processed during first quarter of 2018 were up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Electronic check transaction volumes during the first quarter of 2018 were down 2% versus the same time period in 2017. Returned check transactions processed during the first quarter of 2018 were down 2% versus the same time period in 2017.\n“As we expected, we have started off the new business year with solid growth, continuing the trend we set at the end of last year with record year-over-year transaction levels and triple digit revenue increases,” said Louis Hoch, president and CEO of Payment Data Systems. “In 2017 we initiated a revenue growth plan focused on both organic and growth through acquisition. In support of the revenue growth plan, we are implementing multiple enhancements to our secure payment applications and launching several additional products. The results speak for themselves as revenues and volumes continue to grow greatly. Our outlook for 2018 is to continue this trajectory and we expect record annual revenues for 2018.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ending March 31, 2018\nRevenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 108% to $5.8 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 versus the same period in 2017 was due to the acquisition of the business of Singular Payments, LLC on September 1, 2017 and included organic growth from existing services. Revenues increased 4% versus Q4 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company has $3.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt, compared to $4.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nGross margin dollars in the first quarter were $1.3 million, or 21.7% of revenues, compared to $0.9 million, or 33.5% of revenues in the first quarter of last year.\nOur first quarter operating loss was $1.06 million compared to an operating loss of $.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of $.2 million compared to positive adjusted EBITDA of $.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. One-time expenses affecting Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $.2 million.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.05 million, or ($0.09) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $.3 million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. Factors contributing to the increased net loss were approximately $.3 million of incremental amortization expense related to the Singular Payments acquisition, approximately $.2 million of incremental stock (non-cash) compensation expense and incremental salaries and payroll related expenses as we build out our sales force to drive incremental revenues.\nOperating expenses (including COGS) were $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 versus the $3.1 million during the first quarter of 2017. The incremental operating expenses reflect the incremental processing cost and salaries and employee related expenses related to the acquisition of the business of Singular Payments.\nConference Call and Webcast\nPayment Data Systems, Inc.’s management will host a conference call with a live webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to provide a business update.\nTo listen to the conference call, interested parties within the U.S. should call 1-844-883-3890.

The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with financial measures it uses in the management of its business. The Company defines EBITDA as operating income (loss), before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as defined above, plus non-cash stock option costs and certain non-recurring items, such as acquisitions. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as indicators of the Company's operating performance and ability to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and other investments and, in the absence of refinancing options, to repay debt obligations.\nManagement believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors in evaluating the Company's operating performance because non-cash costs and other items that management believes are not indicative of its results of operations are excluded. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP measures, which have limitations as an analytical tool. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, may differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. For a description of our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss), see the section of this press release titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\"\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DISCLAIMER\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this release include which are covered by safe harbors.
