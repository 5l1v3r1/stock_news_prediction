REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\nPSA Group, which bought Opel from General Motors ( GM.N ) for $2.6 billion (£1.96 billion) last year, is aiming to restore profitability by 2020 after two decades of losses at the unit.\nWorkers at German production sites in Ruesselsheim, Kaiserslautern, Eisenach, Dudenhofen and Bochum will have their jobs guaranteed until July 2023 and investments have been budgeted for each site, according to a joint statement by the company, its works council and trade union IG Metall.\nIn return, the labour side agreed for pay rises under a industry-wide collective bargaining agreement to be delayed until 2020.\nThe agreement said job cuts would be limited to 3,700 employees and that it would only be based on voluntary leave programmes, adding that around 3,500 employees had already accepted such offers.
