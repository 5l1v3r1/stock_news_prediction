Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nMembers of the Independent Community Bankers Association listen to U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on May 1, 2017. EPA/JIM LO SCALZO Good morning. Legislation amending the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act will bring regulatory relief to smaller community banks. Yet observers caution the changes won’t take immediate effect and that regulatory oversight should remain a business priority.\nThe legislation, awaiting signing by President Donald Trump, leaves untouched most major provisions of the 2010 law, intended to prevent crises like the 2008 crash. The overhaul raises the threshold at which banks face tighter oversight to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.\nIt also frees small mortgage lenders from a data-reporting requirement; exempts banks with $10 billion or less in assets from a ban on making speculative bets; and allows small banks to file shorter financial reports with regulators, be examined less often and be released from some capital rules.\nSmaller banks will have to show patience as some changes won’t take immediate effect, said Pamela Purdue, executive vice president and chief regulatory officer at Continuity, a compliance-management firm that puts out a quarterly report looking at the impact of regulations on community banks.\nMany of the changes will have to be enacted through the rule-making process, an effort that took about seven years after Dodd-Frank was passed. The current overhaul isn’t likely to go any faster, she said. “The first rule of this is patience,” she said.\nThe need to change software so that it conforms to the law’s amended provisions will slow relief for banks as well, Ms. Purdue said. “Yes it’s a relief but at the same time there still will be pain before we get the relief since banks just installed much of which has to be uninstalled,” she said.\nWhile waiting for changes to take effect, community banks should plan the steps they will take in response, rank them by difficulty and make resources available for the shift, said Ms. Purdue.\nWhen the regulatory burden finally shrinks banks can reallocate their compliance spending to other, more pressing areas, said Don Andrews, head of the global risk and compliance practice at law firm Reed Smith.\n“I don’t think community banks are out of the woods,” said Mr. Andrews. “They still are dealing with very meager resources compared to larger banks and there still are significant regulatory requirements they need to meet. They shouldn’t be deluded into thinking they don’t have to meet these challenges.”\nCOMPLIANCE\nU.S. trading partners expressed alarm about threatened American tariffs on imported cars.
