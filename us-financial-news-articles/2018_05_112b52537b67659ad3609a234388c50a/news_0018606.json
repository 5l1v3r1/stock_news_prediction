REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File Photo 7-Eleven is discussing a partnership to operate convenience stores in gas stations operated by BR Distribuidora, as Petrobras Distribuidora is also known, Valor reported, citing three sources with direct knowledge of the matter. BR is the fuel distribution arm of state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA.\nLojas Americanas would prefer to own the stores, but to do so BR would have to spin off its convenience store operations, Valor reported.\nRepresentatives for BR Distribuidora, 7-Eleven and Lojas Americanas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe transaction is part of efforts by BR Distribuidora to double down on its convenience stores, which have higher margins than its core fuel distribution business, as it grapples with a slower-than-expected economic recovery in Brazil.\nIn a recent conference call, Marcelo Bragança, BR Distribuidora’s head of gas stations, said the company will propose a new business model for convenience stores to its board in coming months.\nCommon shares in BR Distribuidora are up 33.2 percent this year, surpassing an 8.3 percent increase by Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index.\nReporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:38:00.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
