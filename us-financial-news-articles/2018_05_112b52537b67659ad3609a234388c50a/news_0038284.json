He also said that the U.S. decision on Iran was “rash” amid nuclear talks regarding the Korean peninsula.\n(Corrects paragraph 2 to show it was not Russia’s view that preserving nuclear deal would be impossible without changes, but that another party had presented it that way)\nReporting by Katya Golubkova; Editing by Alison Williams\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
