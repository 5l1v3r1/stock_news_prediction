Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani tells @GStephanopoulos “we don’t have to” comply with a potential subpoena from the special counsel, adding “He's the President of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” https://t.co/LYBy2d6vA3 pic.twitter.com/EefBTa11GQ\n— ABC News (@ABC) May 6, 2018\n“I’ve got a client who wants to testify… I hope we get a chance to tell him the risk that he’s taking,” Giuliani said. “So he may testify. We may actually work things out with Bob Mueller. Because working with him directly is good.”\nThe former New York City mayor also said that Mueller’s team keeps “undermining” the potential for talk to Trump with them. Trump himself said Friday he would love to talk to Mueller if he was “treated fairly.”\nStephanopoulos also asked Giuliani whether Trump would comply with a subpoena.\n“Well, we don’t have to,” Giuliani said simply. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.”\nGiuliani caused a media frenzy last week after telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Trump repaid personal attorney Michael Cohen for the $130,000 payment Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election, supposedly for her silence regarding an alleged affair with Trump in 2006 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T20:10:26.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
