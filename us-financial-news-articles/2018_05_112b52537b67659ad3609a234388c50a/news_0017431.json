It said costs not covered by insurance or delays in receiving insurance payments “could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas’s and Sempra Energy’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.”\nThe utility said the latest estimate included $928 million of costs already recovered or likely to be recovered from insurance. It said about 60 percent of the total cost was for temporary relocation of residents who live near the facility, which is close to the Porter Ranch neighborhood in Los Angeles, including cleanup costs.\nAliso Canyon, with a capacity of 86 billion cubic feet (bcf), is SoCalGas’ biggest storage facility. State regulators estimated 4.62 bcf of gas leaked at Aliso Canyon. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day.\nThe facility represents 63 percent of the utility’s gas storage capacity, making it a key part of the company’s ability to deliver fuel to customers, especially on the coldest days when demand for heating is highest and the hottest days when a lot of gas is used to generate power for air conditioning.\nState regulators have limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into Aliso Canyon to a total of 24.6 bcf. They have also said the company can only withdraw gas from the facility when other options are not available to meet demand.\nMany residents and government officials want SoCalGas to shut the Aliso Canyon facility.
