Soros, now 87 and based in the United States, is Jewish. FILE PHOTO - The signboard of George Soros' Open Society Foundations (OSF) is seen in a building in Budapest, Hungary, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo/File Photo “SPLINTER IN THE EYE”\nOn Monday, Orban’s cabinet minister Antal Rogan said the government would further tighten restrictions on non-governmental organizations in its planned “Stop Soros” bill. He did not provide details.\nThe bill already allows the interior minister to ban NGOs active in the immigration field that he deems to pose a “national security risk”, and it imposes a 25 percent tax on foreign donations to NGOs that back migration.\nThe OSF is a top donor of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which campaigns for human rights.\n“Our situation is likely to get tougher,” said the group’s co-chair Marta Pardavi. “The Helsinki Committee is a definite splinter in the government’s eye, so whatever changes they are thinking about, our legal problems will persist.”\nBut Pardavi added that it had no plans to leave Budapest and would not back away from its advocacy of the rights of asylum seekers and other core issues unless forced to do so.\nThe Central European University, founded in Budapest by Soros in 1991 after the fall of communism in eastern Europe, said on Tuesday it would stay in the Hungarian capital despite the OSF decision to leave.

Its rector, Michael Ignatieff, said new students in 2019 might have to enrol across the border in Austria if the CEU fails to strike a deal with Hungary under the new law, which sparked street protests and an EU legal challenge.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Ignatieff urged the Orban government to recognize that CEU now met conditions stipulated in the new law.\n“CEU cannot go into another academic year in a situation of legal uncertainty,” he said.
