Also lacks the firepower of some of her rivals.\nJelena Ostapenko (Latvia)\nBorn: June 8, 1997 (Age 20)\nGrand Slam titles: 1\nBest Roland Garros performance: Winner (2017)\n2018 WTA match record: 12-11\n2018 WTA titles: 0\nBiggest weapon: Her fearlessness. The Latvian’s groundstrokes scorch the court and she generates tremendous power with her forehand and backhand.\nBiggest weakness: Inconsistency. Her go-for-broke attitude on every point means she often racks up as many unforced errors as she does winners.\nGarbine Muguruza (Spain)\nBorn: Oct. 8, 1993 (Age 24)\nGrand Slam titles: 2\nBest Roland Garros performance: Winner (2016)\n2018 WTA match record: 15-9\n2018 WTA titles: 1\nBiggest weapon: Muguruza’s height enables her to clobber huge groundstrokes and take the ball early. Has already proven herself a Grand Slam champion.\nBiggest weakness: Sometimes lacks a Plan B when things do not go her way.\nMaria Sharapova (Russia)\nBorn: April 19, 1987 (Age 31)\nGrand Slam titles: 5\nBest Roland Garros performance: Winner (2012, 2014)\n2018 WTA match record: 12-7\n2018 WTA titles: 0\nBiggest weapon: Her ferocious fighting spirit makes her one of the toughest opponents to finish off. Powerful groundstrokes help her to control matches from the baseline.\nBiggest weakness: Poor court coverage and a lack of variation in her game. It will also be interesting to see how the famously fickle French crowd reacts to the Russian on her first return to Roland Garros since her doping ban.\nCaroline Wozniacki (Denmark)\nBorn: July 11, 1990 (Age 27)\nGrand Slam titles: 1\nBest Roland Garros performance: Quarter-finals (2010, 2017)\n2018 WTA match record: 23-8\n2018 WTA titles: 1\nBiggest weapon: Wozniacki’s tenacity, rather than searing power, can wear down opponents. Has a cool head under pressure.\nBiggest weakness: Lacks a killer shot and has a tendency to get drawn into long rallies at the baseline. Has never looked completely comfortable on the Roland Garros clay.\nSerena Williams (U.S.)\nWorld ranking: 453\nBorn: Sept. 26, 1981 (Age 36)\nGrand Slam titles: 23 (Australian Open 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2015, 2017; French Open 2002, 2013, 2015; Wimbledon 2002, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2016; U.S. Open 1999, 2002, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014)\nBest Roland Garros performance: Winner (2002, 2013, 2015)\n2018 WTA match record: 2-2\n2018 WTA titles: 0\nBiggest weapon: One of the best serves in the history of women’s tennis combined with heavy, punishing groundstrokes. An on-court demeanour that can intimidate opponents.\nBiggest weakness: A question mark hangs over her fitness level ahead of her first Grand Slam since the birth of her daughter.
