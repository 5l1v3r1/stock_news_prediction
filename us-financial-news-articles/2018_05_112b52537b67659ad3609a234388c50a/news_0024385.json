The S&P 500 gained 15.07 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,712.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.80 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,385.70.\nOil prices were in flux and gave up earlier gains as investors took profit on a rally triggered by the potential disruption to crude flows from major exporter Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions.\nThe United States said on Tuesday it plans to impose new sanctions against Iran after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 that curbed Tehran’s nuclear activities in exchange for removal of U.S. and European sanctions.\nBrent crude futures were down 0.08 percent at $77.13 a barrel, after hitting $78 earlier in the day, their highest since November 2014.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were last up just 0.04 percent at $71.18.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:43:16.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
