By using sophisticated algorithms to direct an electron beam, the Company creates visual images with colour-shifting effects such as 3D, perceived movement, and can also display high-definition colours including skin tones, and whites and blacks, which are not possible using holographic technology.\nAdditional information about Nanotech can be found at the Company’s website www.nanosecurity.ca , the Canadian disclosure filings website www.sedar.com or the OTCMarkets disclosure filings website www.otcmarkets.com .\nNanotech Security Corp.: Canada Investor Relations : U.S. Investor Relations: Shana Chow Sean Peasgood Matthew Selinger info@nanosecurity.ca all@SophicCapital.com mselinger@threepa.com +1.604.678.5775 +1.647.699.9845 +1.817.310.8776 Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies\nof the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource: Nanotech Security Corp.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/465f82dc-08e2-45a6-b452-6b4f726979bc", "http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129657"], "published": "2018-05-02T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T02:10:37.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
