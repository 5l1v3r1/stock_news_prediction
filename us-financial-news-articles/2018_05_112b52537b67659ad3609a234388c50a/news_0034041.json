Things are not looking good on that front at present. And as a result nor are they for sterling,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\nOn Tuesday, UK data showed British employers hired many more workers than expected in early 2018, a tentative sign that the economy’s weak start to the year may be temporary.\nHowever, wage growth data remained mixed, with annual growth in earnings, excluding bonuses, at 2.9 percent in the three months to March, as expected in the Reuters poll.\nSterling fell 0.1 percent to $1.3490, not far from the 2018 low reached on Tuesday of $1.3452.\nA rally in the dollar and sliding expectations for British interest rate rises have caused what had been one of the best performing major currencies to give up all its 2018 gains.\nVersus the euro, the pound declined 0.1 percent to 87.735 pence per euro.
