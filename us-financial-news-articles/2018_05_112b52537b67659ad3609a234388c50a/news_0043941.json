July hard red winter wheat was up 20-1/2 cents, or 3.9 percent, at $5.47 a bushel.\nBoth were above all key moving averages. Both also dropped below Monday’s low before rising above Monday’s high, a bullish technical indicator.\n“Right now we’re working on an outside reversal higher in Chicago and Kansas City wheat. If we close above yesterday’s high, that’s a pretty strong buy signal for the technical guys,” Seifried said.\nSoybeans slipped from session highs as follow-through buying from Monday’s steep rally faded. The market was weighed down by a bumper harvest in Brazil and a lack of new U.S. soybean purchases by China following a thaw in trade tensions over the weekend.\nBetter-than-expected U.S. soybean planting progress also capped the market after the USDA said 56 percent of the crop had been seeded as of Sunday, well ahead of the five-year average of 44 percent.\nCorn planting was 81 percent completed, in line with the average pace, USDA said.\nCBOT July soybeans were up 1 cent at $10.26-1/4 a bushel. The contract encountered chart resistance at its 50-day moving average and failed to hold support at its 100-day moving average.\nCBOT July corn added 2-1/4 cents to $4.05 a bushel.
