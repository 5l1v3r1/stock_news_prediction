(TSX VENTURE:NWE), an oil and gas and environmental services company focused on Western Canada, today announced its financial results for the eight months ended December 31, 2017.\nCHANGE IN FINANCIAL YEAR-END\nNWE has changed its financial year-end from April 30 to December 31 to better conform with other similar energy services companies in the industry and to line up the company’s quarterly filings with more traditional quarters.\nConsequently, NWE is reporting audited financial results for an eight-month transition period from May 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 with a twelve-month comparative period from May 1, 2016 to April 30, 2017, as well as quarterly results for a two-month transition period from November 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 with a three-month comparative period from February 1, 2017 to April 30, 2017. Readers should be cautioned that the transition and comparative periods not only relate to a difference in the number of months but, in the case of the eight-month transition period, does not include the winter months of January to March, which is typically is one of the company’s most active periods.\nGoing forward, NWE will use a customary quarterly reporting calendar based on a December 31 financial year-end, with fiscal quarters ending on the last day in March, June, September and December each year.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nGerry E. Kerkhoff, President and Chief Executive Officer of NWE stated, “New West is coming off a very active winter season with continued top line growth. Our drilling services equipment was at near full utilization, we secured larger projects in completions and production with some of the most active producers in the Duvernay and Montney plays and are increasingly recognized as one of the most reliable fluid transportation companies in the region.”\nMr. Kerkhoff continued, “Our rapid revenue growth in 2017, however, came with some expected growing pains. Particularly, our gross margin was depressed due to certain non-recurring expenses, higher than normal repair and maintenance expenses associated with the fluid hauling equipment acquired in March 2017 and a greater reliance on low margin third party contractors needed to complete larger projects.”\nMr. Kerkhoff concluded, “In 2018, we expect to complete major equipment repairs that will increase our revenue generating units by approximately 45% and anticipate continued revenue growth and improvements in gross margin as equipment costs normalize, service rates increase due to stronger demand and we bring more revenue generating units into service, reducing our reliance on third party contractors.”\nRevenue was $13,383,615 in the eight months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11,927,912 in the twelve months ended April 30, 2017, and $3,671,672 in the two months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $4,876,588 in the three months ended April 30, 2017.\nThis significant improvement reflects increased activity and equipment utilization across all drilling, completions and production sectors.\nGross margin was 17% in the eight months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 23% in the twelve months ended April 30, 2017, and NWE operated at a near break-even gross margin in the two months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a gross margin of 23% in the three months ended April 30, 2017.\nThis decrease in gross margin is due in part to roughly $490,000 of non-recurring expenses incurred by the vacuum truck and fluid transportation services division in November and December 2017, including approximately: $150,000 in major repair expenses associated with the fluid hauling equipment acquired in March 2017; $150,000 in auction related expenses incurred in respect of the sale of approximately $1.1 million of equipment; and, $190,000 in respect of provincial sales taxes levied by the Province of British Columbia resulting from an audit. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher fuel and labour costs and a greater reliance on low margin third party contractors.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2,478,715 in the eight months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,949,944 in the twelve months ended April 30, 2017, and $721,841 in the two months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $752,642 in the three months ended April 30, 2017.\nThis increase was mainly due to expenses associated with the hiring of personnel to meet increased demand, and the establishment of operations in Grande Prairie, servicing the completions and production sectors.\nFor the two months ended December 31, For the three months ended April 30,\n2017 2017 Vacuum Truck\n& Fluid\nTransportation\nServices Environmental\nServices Corporate Total Vacuum Truck\n& Fluid\nTransportation\nServices Environmental\nServices Corporate Total $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Revenue 2,841,146 830,526 - 3,671,672 3,837,133 1,039,455 - 4,876,588 Direct costs 2,993,173 626,358 - 3,619,531 3,034,928 727,687 - 3,762,615 Gross margin (152,027 ) 204,168 - 52,141 802,205 311,768 - 1,113,973 G & A expenses 417,734 251,317 52,790 721,841 283,796 361,276 107,570 752,642 Share base pmts - - 92,538 92,538 - - 276,740 276,740 Finance charges 112,897 9,256 20,271 142,424 199,146 13,861 39,348 252,355 Depreciation 266,362 - - 266,362 407,641 - - 407,641 Disposal of assets 1,167,918 - - 1,167,918 - - - - Net loss before tax (2,116,938 ) (56,405 ) (165,599 ) (2,338,942 ) (88,378 ) (63,369 ) (423,658 ) (575,405 ) Total assets 12,713,646 1,164,457 42,179 13,920,282 14,569,579 1,094,911 149,016 15,813,506 EBITDAC* (229,761 ) (47,149 ) (52,790 ) (329,700 ) 518,409 (49,508 ) (107,570 ) 361,331 For the eight months ended December 31, For the twelve months ended April 30,\n2017 2017 Vacuum Truck\n& Fluid\nTransportation\nServices Environmental\nServices Corporate Total Vacuum Truck\n& Fluid\nTransportation\nServices Environmental\nServices Corporate Total $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Revenue 10,025,549 3,358,066 - 13,383,615 8,328,756 3,599,156 - 11,927,912 Direct costs 8,876,817 2,285,518 - 11,162,335 6,784,347 2,451,885 - 9,236,232 Gross margin 1,148,732 1,072,548 - 2,221,280 1,544,409 1,147,271 - 2,691,680 G & A expenses 1,344,646 917,926 216,143 2,478,715 1,139,606 1,378,828 431,510 2,949,944 Share base pmts - - 356,067 356,067 - - 276,740 276,740 Finance charges 443,991 34,354 102,618 580,963 342,809 17,091 76,173 436,073 Deprecation 1,170,421 - - 1,170,421 1,364,747 - - 1,364,747 Disposal of assets 1,247,131 - - 1,247,131 - - - - Net loss before tax (3,057,457 ) 120,268 (674,828 ) (3,612,017 ) (1,302,753 ) (248,648 ) (784,423 ) (2,335,824 ) Total assets 12,713,646 1,164,457 42,179 13,920,282 14,569,579 1,094,911 149,016 15,813,506 EBITDAC 144,086 154,622 (216,143 ) 82,565 404,803 (231,557 ) (431,510 ) (258,264 )\n* Normalized EBITDAC is earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based payments and is a measure of NWE’s operating profitability.
