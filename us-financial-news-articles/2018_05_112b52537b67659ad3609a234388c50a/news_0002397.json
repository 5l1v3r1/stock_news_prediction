Modular – US modular space average monthly rental rate of $533, or a 3.9% year over year increase. Pro-forma, including results of Williams Scotsman, Acton, and Tyson for all periods presented, monthly rental rates increased 9.9% year over year. Modular – US average modular space units on rent increased 13,583, or a 38.7% year over year increase, including both organic growth and growth from recent acquisitions, and average modular space utilization decreased 50 basis points (“bps”) to 71.8% as a result of businesses acquired at lower utilization rates. Pro-forma, including results of Williams Scotsman, Acton and Tyson for all periods presented, units on rent increased 2.9% year over year. Consolidated net loss of $6.8 million includes $3.2 million of discrete professional fees, restructuring costs, transaction expenses and integration costs related to the integration of Acton and the acquisition and integration of Tyson, and $3.5 million of public company expenses incurred in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $35.5 million from our Modular – US and Modular – Other North America segments (the “Modular Segments”), representing a 32.5% (or $8.7 million) year over year increase as compared to the same period in 2017. We continued to deploy our acquisition strategy and made significant progress on the integration of Acton. On January 3, 2018, the Company acquired Tyson, a provider of modular space rental services primarily in Indiana, Illinois and Missouri. We completed integration planning for the Acton business, purchased December 20, 2017, and migrated Acton onto the Williams Scotsman operating platform effective April 3, 2018.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment (in thousands) 2018 2017 Modular – US $ 32,612 $ 23,683 Modular – Other North America 2,880 3,119 Modular Segments Adjusted EBITDA 35,492 26,802 Corporate and Other — (4,856 ) Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 35,492 $ 21,946 Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Consolidated net loss $ (6,835 ) $ (10,179 ) 1 - WillScot Corporation (formerly known as Double Eagle Acquisition Corp.) acquired Williams Scotsman International, Inc. (“WSII”) on November 29, 2017 (the “Business Combination”). The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Double Eagle Acquisition Corp. by WSII. Prior to completing the Business Combination, WSII’s parent company undertook an internal restructuring in which WSII’s remote accommodations business was removed from WSII. Financial results from WSII’s former remote accommodations business are presented as discontinued operations in the financial statements. As a result of the Business Combination, (i) Williams Scotsman’s consolidated financial results for periods prior to November 29, 2017, reflect the financial results of WSII and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the accounting predecessor to Williams Scotsman, and (ii) for periods from and after this date, Williams Scotsman’s financial results reflect those of Williams Scotsman and its consolidated subsidiaries (including WSII and its subsidiaries) as the successor following the Business Combination.\n2 - Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as segment-level results to net loss, have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included at the end of this press release.\nBrad Soultz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams Scotsman commented, “We are delighted with our first quarter results, which are in line with our full-year outlook for 2018. We are seeing strength across all end markets in the United States and continued penetration of value-added products and services, which is driving our organic growth. We made significant progress in the first quarter integrating the recent acquisitions of Acton and Tyson, which puts us on track to deliver the synergies that we anticipated and validates the scalability of our operating platform. In particular, Tyson migrated onto our information systems within three weeks post-closing, and Acton migrated onto our systems on April 3, approximately three months post-closing.\n“We continue to focus on our priorities of growing modular leasing revenues by increasing modular space units on rent, both organically, and through strategic acquisitions in order to deliver \"Ready to Work\" solutions to our customers. In our Modular – US segment in particular, modular space units on rent are up 38.7% in the first quarter, driving total revenues up 39.7% year over year. Modular Segments Adjusted EBITDA is up 32.5% year over year, driven both by organic growth and from the contributions from Acton and Tyson.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal consolidated revenues increased 35.8% to $134.8 million, as compared to $99.3 million in the prior year quarter.\nModular – US segment revenue increased 39.7% to $122.1 million, as compared to $87.4 million in the prior year quarter, with modular space average units on rent up 38.7% and average monthly rental rate up 3.9% compared to the prior year quarter. On a pro-forma basis, including results of Williams Scotsman, Acton and Tyson for all periods presented, total revenues in the Modular – US segment increased $10.7 million, or 9.6% year over year, primarily reflecting a 2.9% increase in average modular space units on rent, and a 9.9% increase in average modular space monthly rental rates, offset partially by reduced sales of rental units.\nModular – Other North America segment revenue increased 5.0% to $12.7 million, compared to $12.1 million in the prior year quarter, with modular space average units on rent up 13.3% and average monthly rental rate up 2.1% compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe Modular Segments delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $35.5 million, up 32.5% compared to $26.8 million in the prior year quarter. Modular – US segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 37.6% to $32.6 million, and Modular – Other North America segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $0.2 million to $2.9 million from the prior year quarter. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased 62.1% to $35.5 million, as compared to $21.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nConsolidated net loss was $6.8 million, including $3.2 million of discrete professional fees, restructuring costs, transaction expenses and integration costs incurred, primarily related to the integration of Acton and the acquisition and integration of Tyson. We anticipate cost savings related to these acquisitions to start being realized in the second quarter of 2018. Consolidated net loss also includes $3.5 million of public company expenses incurred in the quarter, which is consistent with full year guidance.\nCapital expenditures for rental equipment from continuing operations increased $9.4 million, or 41.4%, to $32.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $22.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net capital expenditures for rental equipment also increased $7.2 million, or 42.9%, to $24.0 million. The increase was largely funded by $7.5 million of insurance proceeds received in the quarter related to losses incurred during Hurricane Harvey. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s total debt balance increased by $37.3 million to $664.1 million due to the acquisition of Tyson, as well to fund a $22.8 million reduction of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the Business Combination and certain aged accounts. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $243.8 million of availability under its senior secured revolving credit facility, with ample liquidity to execute upon its 2018 Outlook.\n2018 Outlook\nManagement reaffirmed the Company’s outlook for full year 2018, inclusive of the Acton and Tyson acquisitions. This guidance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the “Forward-Looking Statements” below:\nTotal revenue between $560.0 million and $600.0 million\nAdjusted EBITDA between $165.0 million and $175.0 million, 33% to 41% growth over 2017\nNet rental capital expenditures after proceeds from rental unit sales between $70.0 million and $100.0 million\nAnnual Meeting Date\nThe Company’s annual meeting of stockholders will occur on June 19, 2018, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time at our corporate headquarters located at 901 S. Bond St., Suite 600, Baltimore, Maryland. The record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting will be April 23, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Williams Scotsman believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it (i) allows investors to compare performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance; (ii) is used by our board of directors and management to assess our performance; (iii) may, subject to the limitations described below, enable investors to compare the performance of Williams Scotsman to its competitors; and (iv) provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. A metric similar to Adjusted EBITDA is also used to evaluate Williams Scotsman’s ability to service its debt. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures differently, and therefore Williams Scotsman’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. For reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release, see “Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures” included in this press release.\nConference Call Information\nWilliams Scotsman will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its first quarter results at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, May 4, 2018.

Our Adjusted EBITDA reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations:\nCurrency (gains) losses, net: on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency. Substantially all such currency gains (losses) are unrealized and attributable to financings due to and from affiliated companies. Goodwill and other impairment charges related to non-cash costs associated with impairment charges to goodwill, other intangibles, rental fleet and property, plant and equipment. Restructuring costs associated with restructuring plans designed to streamline operations and reduce costs. Costs to integrate acquired companies. Non-cash charges for stock compensation plans. Other expense includes consulting expenses related to certain one-time projects, financing costs not classified as interest expense and gains and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing WSC’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to meet our obligations.\nThe table below presents the unaudited reconciliation of net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above for further information regarding the Company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss $ (6,835 ) $ (10,179 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax — 2,205 Loss from continuing operations (6,835 ) (12,384 ) Income tax benefit (420 ) (4,869 ) Loss from continuing operations before income tax (7,255 ) (17,253 ) Interest expense, net 11,719 22,077 Depreciation and amortization 26,281 18,661 Currency losses (gains), net 1,024 (2,002 ) Restructuring costs 628 284 Integration costs 2,630 — Stock compensation expense 121 — Other expense 344 179 Adjusted EBITDA $ 35,492 $ 21,946 Loss from Continuing Operations to Adjusted EBITDA non-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe following tables present unaudited reconciliations of the Company’s loss from continuing operations before income tax to Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in thousands) Modular – US Modular –\nOther North\nAmerica Total Loss from continuing operations before income taxes $ (5,308 ) $ (1,947 ) $ (7,255 ) Interest expense, net 11,160 559 11,719 Depreciation and amortization 22,892 3,389 26,281 Currency losses, net 157 867 1,024 Restructuring costs 618 10 628 Integration costs 2,630 — 2,630 Stock compensation expense 121 — 121 Other expense 342 2 344 Adjusted EBITDA $ 32,612 $ 2,880 $ 35,492\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017 (in thousands) Modular – US Modular –\nOther North\nAmerica Corporate &\nOther Total Loss from continuing operations before income taxes $ (5,530 ) $ (1,016 ) $ (10,707 ) $ (17,253 ) Interest expense, net 15,559 1,178 5,340 22,077 Depreciation and amortization 15,163 3,142 356 18,661 Currency gains, net (1,599 ) (187 ) (216 ) (2,002 ) Restructuring costs — — 284 284 Other expense 90 2 87 179 Adjusted EBITDA $ 23,683 $ 3,119 $ (4,856 ) $ 21,946 Net Capital Expenditures for Rental Equipment non-GAAP Reconciliation\nThe following table provides an unaudited reconciliation of purchase of rental equipment to Net Capital Expenditures for Rental Equipment:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Total purchase of rental equipment $ (32,084 ) $ (24,897 ) Total purchases of rental equipment from discontinued operations — (2,220 ) Total purchases of rental equipment from continuing operations (32,084 ) (22,677 ) Proceeds from sale of rental equipment 8,128 5,844 Net Capital Expenditures for Rental Equipment $ (23,956 ) $ (16,833 ) Contact Information\nInvestor Inquiries:\nMark Barbalato\ninvestors@willscot.com Media Inquiries:\nScott Junk\nscott.junk@willscot.com\nSource:Williams Scotsman", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=whHmERAFEl2GToqdycFJgxi_9iPKC_KeXgPaDeD6PQ6-0g27vrgIoraMiRPsossLSY1lEJf_h27_8mhMHlDYV9l6oqWfG9gWYawsqgm488_oQWPXebY9kWBgL586pHRU", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/aeed7f0c-90d3-4f93-b1fb-14d748f5eba5", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=whHmERAFEl2GToqdycFJgxi_9iPKC_KeXgPaDeD6PQ7yQwEU5oMdFV4cAPBMoYlWWtA9i-ZQce5wEURHjTwqQtNfFZ245gdDc-N9rOt5gye05yHB_Xdgpgov_9c1nFwS", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=whHmERAFEl2GToqdycFJg7HOhdURfJwa1xyArwIR1RcNL2NaGeb46XsLA0jWyDI2prinRSqkdPT9p31xOIH7QQ=="], "published": "2018-05-04T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:46:18.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
