Hernandez was quoted at the weekend by Mexican newspapers criticizing Damojh for its safety record.\nThat probe led to a suspension for about two months.\nSeparately, Damojh has been subject to annual reviews, most recently in November 2017, the aviation authority said. The company has also renewed its airworthiness certificates every two years, most recently in October 2017, it added.\nCuban investigators have so far recovered the cockpit voice recorder and were still looking for the flight data recorder.\nFriday’s crash was the worst in Cuba since a Soviet-built Ilyushin-62M passenger plane came down near Havana in 1989 killing all 126 people on board and another 14 on the ground.
