More supply from two of the world’s largest oil producers put additional pressure on the inflation outlook.\nAt 9:17 a.m. (1317 GMT), the 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and regular 10-year Treasury notes, was 2.10 percent, which was the lowest since April 11. It was 3 basis points lower than late on Thursday.\nJust last week, the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate hit 2.21 percent, which was the highest level since August 2014, Reuters and Tradeweb data showed.\nEarly Friday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was 2.941 percent after touching its lowest level in almost three week. It climbed to 2.128 percent last week, which was the highest since July 2011.\nThe five-year TIPS breakeven rate fell to 2.07 percent, which was the lowest since April 11. Last week, it hit 2.17 percent, the highest since April 2014.\nShorter-dated TIPS rates are sensitive to energy prices.\nU.S. crude futures were down 2.6 percent at $68.91 a barrel in early Friday trading.
