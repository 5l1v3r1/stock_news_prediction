Not that anyone in Washington seems to have noticed.\nPreliminary results indicate that Iran’s proxy Hezbollah and its allies won more than half the seats in Lebanon’s 128-seat parliament, consolidating the Shiite militia’s political grip on the country. Thanks to Lebanon’s sectarian political system, Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a Sunni, will likely keep his job, but his clout will be considerably weakened given the clobbering his Future Movement took at the polls.\nVoter turnout fell five percentage points from the 2009 election, mostly because Lebanese citizens didn’t have much of a choice between Hezbollah and Hezbollah-lite. Mr. Hariri threw his lot in with the terror group when he accepted a power-sharing arrangement in 2016 with former general Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, to break a political stalemate. The country is overwhelmed with Syrian refugees and its economy is stagnating.\nForeign Edition Podcast\nForeign Edition Podcast: Kerry’s secret Iran deal diplomacy. Foreign Edition Podcast The Trump Administration seems to have adopted a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil approach regarding Hezbollah’s influence on Mr. Hariri and his government. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited the country in February and tried to distinguish between Hezbollah, the terrorist organization, and Hezbollah, the political party. They share the same principles. Mr. Trump compounded the confusion in April by commending “the government of Lebanon’s progress” in passing a budget, deploying Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) on the Syrian border and fighting Islamic State. The LAF is outmanned and outgunned by Hezbollah.\nLebanon has more strategic importance than its small size because it abuts Israel and serves Iran’s interests. Iran is using Hezbollah to build up a second front in southern Syria for launching missiles into the Jewish state during the next, inevitable war. Mr. Trump is poised to announce his decision on the Iran nuclear deal as early as Tuesday, but he also needs a larger containment strategy that treats Lebanon with more than naive neglect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T13:18:23.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
