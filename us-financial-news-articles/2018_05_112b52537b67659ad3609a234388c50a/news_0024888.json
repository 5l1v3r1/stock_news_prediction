(NASDAQ: EZPW) (the “Company”), a leading provider of pawn loans in the United States and Latin America, announced today the pricing of its $150 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes were offered in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company granted an option to the initial purchaser for up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will pay interest semiannually at an annual rate of 2.375% and will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company’s Class A Non-Voting Common Stock (“Class A common stock”) or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate at such time. The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 62.8931 shares of the Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.90 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock), representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 20% above the closing price of $13.25 per share of the Company’s Class A common stock on May 9, 2018. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.\nThe Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 1, 2024, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holder only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date.\nThe Company, at its option, may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes on or after May 1, 2022, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days, including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe Company estimates that it will receive net proceeds from the offering of approximately $145.2 million (or approximately $167.0 million if the initial purchaser exercises its option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting fees and estimated expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes and potentially to fund acquisitions. The Company is in various levels of discussion regarding a number of acquisition opportunities in the U.S., Canada and Latin America, and has entered into non-binding letters of intent to acquire pawnshops in Latin America. At this time, there can be no assurance that the Company will actually complete any of those potential acquisitions.\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes or any shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nThe Convertible Notes and any shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The offering is being made to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis announcement contains certain forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s strategy, initiatives and expected performance.
