The presentation and other materials regarding the Board’s recommendation for the 2018 Annual Meeting can be found at https://investor.natus.com/ . Highlights include:\nNatus Has a Track Record of Enhancing Shareholder Value Since 2004, Natus’ revenues have grown from approximately $34 million to more than $500 million. Natus has increased its stock price by 155% over the last five years 1 and by 799% since Jim Hawkins was appointed CEO 2 , outperforming major indices during those time periods. Natus has announced $80 million in repurchase programs over the last four years and returned approximately $42 million to shareholders via buybacks over that same timeframe.\nNatus Continues to Execute a Proven Strategy Since Jim Hawkins joined the Company in 2004 as CEO, the Board and management team have continued to focus on a strategy of growth, innovation and efficient capital allocation. Natus has developed from a small, single product company into a leader in three major markets. The Company has successfully improved segment margin performance of acquired businesses, including its largest deals Nicolet, Otometrics and Integra Life Sciences. Natus’ long-term financial goals are driven by the execution of its strategic plan.\nNatus Has the Right Board to Execute This Strategy The Natus Board comprises six highly-qualified directors, five of whom are independent. All of Natus’ highly-qualified Board members and director nominees bring significant relevant experience and offer a diverse mix of skills and expertise. Implemented and overseen by the Board, performance-focused compensation policies are aligned with shareholder interests. Natus executives are not paid cash bonuses when performance criteria are not met.\nVoce’s Attack on Natus is Uninformed and Offers No Defined Plan Voce Capital, an activist shareholder, proposes to gain control of the Board, but it has not articulated what it would do if it gained control. If Voce is successful, Voce nominees would occupy three out of six Board seats. The only plan Voce has communicated is to halt Natus’ successful acquisition strategy and cease R&D activities. Voce’s nominees add no incremental value compared to Natus’ slate. In fact, many of the companies in which Voce’s nominees have served have exhibited substantial declines in shareholder value.\nThe Natus Board Has Attempted on Multiple Occasions to Find a Mutually Agreeable Resolution with Voce The Board believes that avoiding this costly and unnecessary proxy fight with Voce would have been best for Natus and its shareholders. For this reason, over the several weeks before filing its proxy statement, Natus made multiple proposals to Voce in an attempt to reach a reasonable resolution. Voce rejected the Board proposals and in our opinion, Voce’s increasingly unreasonable demands underscore that Voce is really fighting to take control of Natus.\nNatus’ Strategy is Disciplined and Has Established the Company as a Global Market Leader Natus has delivered strong growth and performance, positioning Natus for the future. Natus has efficiently allocated capital to drive long-term value. The Company has exhibited an ongoing commitment to refreshing its Board of Directors Voce lacks a plan and its slate is less qualified.\nShareholders are urged to protect their investment and keep Natus on the right track\nThe Natus Board urges shareholders to vote the WHITE proxy card today FOR the election of Doris Engibous and Robert Weiss. The Natus Board also unanimously recommends that shareholders not vote for the removal of Chairman Robert Gunst.\nAll shareholders should be aware that any vote for Voce nominees on Voce’s blue proxy card will revoke any previous proxy submitted by a shareholder, including any votes submitted on the Company’s WHITE proxy card FOR any of the Board’s nominees. It is critical that shareholders DO NOT RETURN ANY PROXY CARD SENT BY VOCE, EVEN AS A PROTEST VOTE AGAINST VOCE OR THE VOCE NOMINEES. The Natus Board strongly urges shareholders to DISCARD all blue proxy cards or other materials sent by Voce .\nNatus shareholders are reminded that their vote is important, no matter how many or how few shares they own.
