Apparel companies H&M, Inditex’s Zara and Gap are already on Tmall.\nCanada Goose, known for its $900 parkas, has been moving to boost margins by expanding its direct-to-consumer business, manufacturing more of its coats itself and launching new product lines including knitwear.\nWhile several rivals and department stores have reported falling sales and shrinking margins, the company’s luxury brand has helped cushion it from the retail industry’s struggles.\nCanada Goose shares have climbed almost 30 percent this year, compared with a 1 percent decline in the Toronto stock benchmark.\nThe company appointed Scott Cameron as president for Greater China. He was previously an executive vice president for e-commerce, stores and strategy.\nChief Executive Officer Dani Reiss has said the company, which began opening its own stores in 2016 after selling through wholesalers since its founding in 1957, expects to have about 20 brick-and-mortar stores around the world by 2020. It currently has its own stores in Toronto, New York, Chicago and London, and with a partner in Tokyo.
