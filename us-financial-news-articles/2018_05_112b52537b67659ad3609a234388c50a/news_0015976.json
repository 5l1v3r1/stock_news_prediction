We are investigating whether there are more casualties and the cause of the blast,” police Captain Farah Ismail told Reuters.\n“The death toll may rise,” he added.\nResidents said the kiosks were busy with soldiers buying khat. “I counted five dead people, including two shoe shiners, a mother who sold khat and two customers. There were 10 other injured civilians,” shopkeeper Ahmed Mohamud told Reuters.\n“I could also see several soldiers in uniform being transported from the blast scene but I could not confirm whether they were dead or wounded.”\nAbdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab’s military operation spokesman, said the group was behind the attack and that its target was the soldiers.\nAl Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalia’s central government and establish its own rule based on its interpretation of Islamic law.\nSince being pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011, the group has lost control of most of Somalia’s cities and towns. But it retains a strong presence in regions outside the capital.\nAdditional reporting by Feisal Omar in Mogadishu; Editing by George Obulutsa\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T17:48:49.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
