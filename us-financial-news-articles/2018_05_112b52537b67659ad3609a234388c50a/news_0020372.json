We believe this will represent a functional cure 2 out of 3 e-antigen positive and 2 out of 5 e-antigen negative patients, or half of the patients in the study, achieved productive and sustained host responses. These were characterized by mild ALT elevations coinciding with continued reductions in various viral markers which persisted after ARC-520 therapy was removed Two patients that experienced sustained host responses but had not yet serocleared, appear poised to potentially seroclear if the trends in the decrease of viral markers continues Presented preclinical data on both ARO-AAT and ARO-HBV at EASL Made continued progress on the emerging pipeline of RNAi therapeutics developed using the Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM TM ) platform including: The cardiometabolic pipeline, which includes ARO-APOC3, targeting apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC3), and ARO-ANG3, targeting angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) The pulmonary pipeline, which includes ARO-ENaC, formerly called ARO-Lung1, which is an inhaled RNAi therapeutic targeting the epithelial sodium channel alpha subunit (αENaC) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis ARO-HIF2 for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma\nSelected Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter Financial Results\nARROWHEAD PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.

Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead’s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.\nFor more information, please visit www.arrowheadpharma.com , or follow us on Twitter @ArrowheadPharma .
