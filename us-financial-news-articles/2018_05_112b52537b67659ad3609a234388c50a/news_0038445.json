Walter Thompson advertising agency found Americans age 13 to 20 were less likely than millennials to only buy clothes designed for their own gender.\nOn Phluid’s front door, another sign reads: “This is a welcoming, inclusive, diverse, and safe space. Intolerance will not be tolerated.”\nInside, cropped Chinese red sweat pants hang on racks next to mesh jerseys and colorful tank tops.\nOne hurdle was finding genderless mannequins for the sales floor, said Smith.\nHe commissioned a set with chests that are flatter that the usual female versions, but not completely flat.\n“It’s not for everybody. There is always going to be a girl who wants to wear a full dress and a guy who wants to wear polo and cargo shorts,” said Smith.\n“But I also think that there will be a girl who wants to wear a polo and cargo shorts and a boy who wants to wear a full dress.”\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst and Claire Cozens.
