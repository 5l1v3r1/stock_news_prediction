REUTERS/Yves Herman\nThe target was not “some fetish,” but reflected changing security requirements in the world, Merkel told senior military officers. She said it was clear that the German military needed to rebuild its stocks of equipment after years of declining spending.\nMerkel also called for Germany to remain committed to multilateral agreements at a time when the United States had withdrawn from the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate deal. But she said the transatlantic relationship would remain a firm pillar of European security despite those differences.
