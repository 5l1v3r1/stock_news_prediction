(“ Partner ” or the “ Company ”) (NASDAQ and TASE: PTNR), a leading Israeli communications provider, announced today its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n1 The quarterly financial results are unaudited.\n2 For the definition of this and other Non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this press release.\nCommenting on the first quarter 2018 results, Mr. Isaac Benbenisti, CEO of Partner noted :\n\"Partner started 2018 with significant momentum – in the first quarter the Post-Paid cellular subscriber base continued to grow and Partner TV's subscriber base has reached over 77 thousand households as of today. In addition, the deployment of the fiber optic infrastructure was accelerated significantly, and by year end, we intend to be present in over half of the cities in Israel.\nIn the cellular segment, in the first quarter the Post-Paid subscriber base increased by 16 thousand, thanks to subscribers that choose Partner over the competitors. The consistent growth in Post-Paid subscribers, for 11 consecutive quarters, results from, among other things, value offers which include unique benefits such as wifi calling, co-operation with Apple Music, and the fact that Partner's service continues to be a competitive advantage as reflected in the Consumer Protection Authority's report published last month.\nA year ago we revealed our strategic partnership with Netflix which includes a user experience and unique value offers for Partner TV customers. Last month we reported an additional significant milestone with the announcement that Partner TV was chosen by Amazon Prime Video as its first partner in Israel. Partner TV's technological advantage is also highlighted through the upcoming FIFA World Cup games, since all of Partner set top boxes support 4K viewing as part of the basic service and with no need to change equipment.\nThe fiber optic project, Partner Fiber, continues to expand, and in the first quarter of 2018 we doubled the deployment pace. We are reaching 27 cities with Partner Fiber as of today, with an independent fiber optic infrastructure that allow speeds of up to 1,000 megabits. Through the combined offers of Partner Fiber and Partner TV, more and more households in Israel are enjoying a more advanced technology and attractive prices compared to that were offered to them up until now.”\nMr. Tamir Amar, Partner's Chief Financial Officer, commented on the first quarter 2018 results:\n“The first quarter results of 2018 reflected the Company's strategy in the fixed-line segment and equipment sales. Our rapid growth in the number of TV subscribers and in wholesale internet customers combined with our business model for these activities resulted in improved operational results in these activities compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This improvement was reflected, among other things, in growth in service revenues and in EBITDA from the fixed-line segment compared to the fourth quarter. In addition, in equipment sales, the actions that we carried out last year continue to be reflected in our results, and in the first quarter of 2018, we reported equipment sales revenues of NIS 201 million and gross profit of NIS 43 million, compared with revenues of NIS 163 million and gross profit of NIS 26 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the cellular segment, we continue to see that the management of our Post-Paid subscriber base is also reflected in the first quarter of 2018, with growth in the Post-Paid subscriber base of 16 thousand subscribers, lower price erosion from these subscribers compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2017, and continued decline in the churn rate of these subscribers as well as in the overall cellular churn rate of the Company. The Company's cellular churn rate declined by one basis point, compared to the first quarter of 2017, to 8.8% in the quarter, continuing the trend of the declining cellular churn rate for Partner over the past three years. We put emphasis on increasing the value we provide our Post-Paid subscribers both through value-added cellular services and through additional services that the Company provides.\nThe Company's CAPEX in the quarter totaled NIS 138 million, with the growth mainly reflecting investments in the Company's growth engines – the fiber optic cable infrastructure and TV services. We are in advanced stages of negotiations with Cellcom regarding possible collaboration in the fiber optic infrastructure that both companies are deploying, in order to enable a faster deployment rate at a lower cost which will improve the economic returns from the project. This is in addition to the Ministry of Communications decision regarding the ability to use the last manhole before the building, which entails potentially significant cost savings in our fiber optic infrastructure deployment. In addition to our core activities and organic growth engines, Partner is in the process of examining nonorganic growth opportunities including, among others, conducting an initial assessment of entry into the credit and debit card market, through either acquisitions or internal development.\nThe impact of the reduction in our debt level, the early repayments and the refinancing of debt that we undertook is also reflected in the quarter's results, with finance costs totaling NIS 18 million, including early loan repayment expenses of NIS 9 million (the first quarter being the final quarter to include significant early repayment expenses as part of the Company’s debt restructuring which took place in the fourth quarter of 2017). As of the end of the first quarter, our net debt totaled NIS 0.9 billion and gross debt decreased to NIS 1.6 billion from NIS 1.9 billion in the previous quarter.”\nNIS Million\nQ1’18\nQ4’17\nComments\nService Revenues 625 630 Equipment Revenues 201 204 Total Revenues 826 834 Gross profit from equipment sales 43 40 OPEX 498 519 Decline mainly reflected higher periodic payroll & related\nexpenses in Q4 2017 and a decline in marketing expenses\nAdjusted EBITDA 177 158 Increase mainly a result of a decline in OPEX Profit (loss) for the Period 9 (50) Increase resulted mainly from an improvement in EBITDA\nand the early loan repayment expenses of NIS 65 million in\nQ4 2017, compared with NIS 9 million in Q1 2018.

The decrease was mainly the result of the continued price erosion of cellular services (both Post-Paid and Pre-Paid) due to the continued competitive market conditions.\nService revenues for the fixed-line segment in Q1 2018 totaled NIS 202 million (US$ 57 million), an increase of 4% from NIS 194 million in Q1 2017. The increase reflected the revenues from TV services as well as increase in revenues from internet services, which were partially offset principally by the decline in revenues from international calling services.\nEquipment revenues in Q1 2018 totaled NIS 201 million (US$ 57 million), an increase of 23% from NIS 163 million in Q1 2017, largely reflecting higher volumes of equipment sales as well as a change in the product mix.\nGross profit from equipment sales in Q1 2018 was NIS 43 million (US$ 12 million), compared with NIS 26 million in Q1 2017, an increase of 65%, mainly reflecting the higher sales volumes and higher profit margins from sales due to a change in the product mix.\nTotal operating expenses (‘OPEX’) totaled NIS 498 million (US$ 142 million) in Q1 2018, an increase of 4% or NIS 20 million from Q1 2017. The increase mainly reflected the additional expenses relating to the Company's TV service and the growth in internet services, partially offset principally by a decline in doubtful debt expenses and a decline in international calling services expenses. Including depreciation and amortization expenses and other expenses (mainly amortization of employee share based compensation), OPEX in Q1 2018 increased by 3% compared with Q1 2017.\nOperating profit for Q1 2018 was NIS 32 million (US$ 9 million), a decrease of 70% compared with NIS 105 million in Q1 2017. See Adjusted EBITDA analysis for each segment below.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 totaled NIS 177 million (US$ 50 million), a decrease of 29% from NIS 251 million in Q1 2017. As a percentage of total revenues, Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 was 21% compared with 31% in Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the cellular segment was NIS 134 million (US$ 38 million) in Q1 2018, a decrease of 28% from NIS 187 million in Q1 2017, reflecting the decrease in cellular service revenues and the fact that since Q3 2017 the Company does not record any income with respect to the settlement agreement with Orange, partially offset by an increase in gross profit from equipment sales and a decline in OPEX. As a percentage of total cellular segment revenues, Adjusted EBITDA for the cellular segment in Q1 2018 was 21% compared with 29% in Q1 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fixed-line segment was NIS 43 million (US$ 12 million) in Q1 2018, a decrease of 33% from NIS 64 million in Q1 2017, reflecting the increase in OPEX, partially offset by the increase in service revenues. As a percentage of total fixed-line segment revenues, Adjusted EBITDA for the fixed-line segment in Q1 2018 was 19%, compared with 30% in Q1 2017.\nFinance costs, net in Q1 2018 were NIS 18 million (US$ 5 million), a decrease of 22% compared with NIS 23 million in Q1 2017. The decrease largely reflected lower interest expenses in view of the level of debt which was lower by more than NIS 1 billion compared with Q1 2017, and a decrease in foreign exchange rate expenses, partially offset by early loan repayment expenses of NIS 9 million recorded in Q1 2018.\nIncome taxes for Q1 2018 were NIS 5 million (US$ 1 million), compared with NIS 18 million in Q1 2017.\nProfit in Q1 2018 was NIS 9 million (US$ 3 million), compared with profit of NIS 64 million in Q1 2017, a decrease of 86%.\nBased on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during Q1 2018, basic earnings per share or ADS, was NIS 0.05 (US$ 0.02), compared to basic earnings per share of NIS 0.41 in Q1 2017.\nCellular Segment Operational Review\nAt the end of Q1 2018, the Company's cellular subscriber base (including mobile data and 012 Mobile subscribers) was approximately 2.67 million including approximately 2.34 million Post-Paid subscribers or 88% of the base, and approximately 331 thousand Pre-Paid subscribers, or 12% of the subscriber base.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the cellular subscriber base decreased by approximately 7 thousand subscribers. The Post-Paid subscriber base increased by approximately 16 thousand subscribers, while the Pre-Paid subscriber base decreased by approximately 23 thousand subscribers.\nThe quarterly churn rate for cellular subscribers in Q1 2018 was 8.8%, compared with 9.8% in Q1 2017.\nTotal cellular market share (based on the number of subscribers) at the end of Q1 2018 was estimated to be approximately 25%, compared to 26% in Q1 2017.\nThe monthly Average Revenue per User (“ ARPU ”) for cellular subscribers in Q1 2018 was NIS 58 (US$ 17), a decrease of 5% from NIS 61 in Q1 2017. The decrease mainly reflected the continued price erosion in key cellular services due to the competition in the cellular market.\nFunding and Investing Review\nIn Q1 2018, Adjusted Free Cash Flow totaled NIS 21 million (US$ 6 million), a decrease of 83% from NIS 126 million in Q1 2017.\nCash generated from operations decreased by 24% to NIS 157 million (US$ 45 million) in Q1 2018 from NIS 207 million in Q1 2017. The decrease mainly reflected the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA.\nCash capital expenditures (‘CAPEX payments’) , as represented by cash flows used for the acquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets, were NIS 138 million (US$ 39 million) in Q1 2018, an increase of 68% from NIS 82 million in Q1 2017. The increase mainly reflected the increase in investments related to the fiber optic infrastructure deployment and TV service.\nThe level of Net Debt at the end of Q1 2018 amounted to NIS 919 million (US$ 262 million), compared with NIS 1,415 million at the end of Q1 2017.\nRegulatory Developments\nThe Ministry of Communications' service portfolio on physical infrastructure (the \"Service Portfolio\") enables service providers (such as Partner) to use Bezeq's physical infrastructure components (such as manholes, ducts, poles, boxes, dark fibers, optical wavelengths etc.).\nOn April 16, 2018, the Ministry of Communications issued its ruling on various disputes that arose between Partner and Bezeq regarding the implementation of the Service Portfolio .\nThe main disagreement between the parties stemmed from the fact that Bezeq refused to allow Partner to deploy fibers to buildings from the physical infrastructure components of Bezeq that are located at the entrance to the ducts that belong to the buildings and that lead into the buildings .\nThe Ministry of Communications determined that Bezeq's refusal was contrary to the purpose of the regulation, creating a significant barrier to the deployment of optical fibers and service provision to customers, and determined that Bezeq will enable Partner to deploy communications cables using the infrastructure components leading to the buildings and to perform any necessary works .\nThe Ministry's ruling will reduce the cost, and accelerate the pace of deployment of Partner's fiber optic project .\nOther Developments\nOn May 30, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors resolved to adopt a buyback plan of the Company's ordinary shares which are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, up to an aggregate amount of NIS 200 million (\"the Plan\"). The Plan will be implemented in multiple tranches, the first tranche being in the amount of NIS 50 million of the Company's ordinary shares. The implementation of subsequent tranches will be subject to approval of the Company's Board of Directors. The Plan will be executed in accordance with the Israel Securities Authority Safe Harbor opinion regarding buyback securities by a corporation. For further details regarding the Plan, please see the Company's immediate report of May 31, 2018.\nConference Call Details\nPartner will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 31, 2018 at 10.00AM Eastern Time / 5.00PM Israel Time .\nTo join the call, please dial the following numbers (at least 10 minutes before the scheduled time):\nInternational: +972.3.918.0685\nNorth America toll-free: +1.888.281.1167\nA live webcast of the call will also be available on Partner's Investors Relations website at: www.partner.co.il/en/Investors-Relations/lobby/\nIf you are unavailable to join live, the replay of the call will be available from May 31, 2018 until June 30, 2018, at the following numbers:\nInternational: +972.3.925.5945\nNorth America toll-free: +1.866.276.1485\nIn addition, the archived webcast of the call will be available on Partner's Investor Relations website at the above address for approximately three months.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes within the meaning of Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the safe harbor provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
