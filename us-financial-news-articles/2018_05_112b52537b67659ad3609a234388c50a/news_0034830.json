North Korea also called off high-level talks with South Korea scheduled for Wednesday, blaming U.S.-South Korean military exercises.\n“We’ll have to see,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if the summit was still on.\n“No decision, we haven’t been notified at all ... We haven’t seen anything, we haven’t heard anything,” he added, while saying he would continue to demand denuclearization.\nCancellation of the summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, would deal a major blow to what would be the biggest diplomatic achievement of Trump’s presidency.\nTrump has raised expectations for success even as many analysts have been sceptical about the chances of bridging the gap due to questions about North Korea’s willingness to give up a nuclear arsenal that it says can hit the United States.\nThe White House said it was still hopeful the summit would take place, but Trump was prepared for a tough negotiation.\n“The president is ready if the meeting takes place,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told Fox News. “If it doesn’t, we’ll continue the maximum pressure campaign that’s been ongoing.”\nSanders said the North Korean comments were “not something that is out of the ordinary in these types of operations.”\nNorth Korea’s first vice minister of foreign affairs, Kim Kye Gwan, cast doubt on whether the summit, which is set for Singapore, would be held.\nHe specifically criticized U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who has called for North Korea to quickly give up its nuclear arsenal in a deal that would mirror Libya’s abandonment of its programme for weapons of mass destruction.\n“If the U.S. is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the ... summit,” he said.\nNorth Korea clashed with Bolton when he worked under the Bush administration. Related Coverage Factbox - Could Libya's nuclear pledge be a template for North Korea?\n“We shed light on the quality of Bolton already in the past, and we do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him,” Kim, the vice minister, said.\nIn an interview with Fox News Radio, Bolton brushed aside the remarks against him as “nothing new” and said odds were still in favour of the summit going ahead, but the United States would not soften its demands.\n“I think that’s where the president is; we are going to do everything we can to come to a successful meeting, but we are not going to back away from the objective of that meeting which is complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.”\nSanders appeared reluctant to endorse the Libya model that the outspoken and hawkish Bolton has touted, most recently on U.S. television on Sunday.\nShe said the model that would be followed in dealing with North Korea was “the President Trump model.”\n“He’s going to run this the way he sees fit. We’re 100 percent confident ... he’s the best negotiator.”\nA U.S. official said the North Korean statements had taken the White House off guard after North Korean leader Kim’s diplomatic outreach both to the United States and South Korea. “MISERABLE FATE”\nKim Kye Gwan derided as “absurd” Bolton’s suggestion that discussions with North Korea should be similar to those that led to components of Libya’s nuclear programme being shipped to the United States in 2004.\n“(The) world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq which have met miserable fate,” Kim said in an apparent reference to the demises of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Iraqi former president Saddam Hussein.\nHe said North Korea was a nuclear weapon state while Libya had been at the initial stage of nuclear development.

Yonhap via REUTERS\nThe doubt thrown over the summit comes a week after Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers.\nThe North Korean statements marked a dramatic reversal in tone from recent months when Pyongyang appeared to embrace efforts to negotiate.\nNorth Korea had announced it would publicly shut its nuclear test site next week and also improved the mood for a summit by releasing three detained Americans last week.\nSome analysts and U.S. officials believe North Korea may be testing Trump’s willingness to soften the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization.\nNorth Korea could also be trying to capitalise on an apparent gap in messaging between Bolton and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nPompeo, who returned from his second visit to Pyongyang last week with the freed Americans, has stressed the economic benefits, possibly including U.S. investment, that could flow to the country if it agrees to denuclearize.\nKim Kye Gwan’s statement appeared to reject such promises, saying North Korea would never give up its nuclear programme in exchange for trade with the United States.\n“We have already stated our intention for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and made clear on several occasions that precondition for denuclearization is to put an end to anti-DPRK hostile policy and nuclear threats and blackmail of the United States,” Kim said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\nNorth Korea defends its nuclear and missile programmes as a necessary deterrent against perceived aggression by the United States, which keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\nIt has long said it is open to eventually giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and ends its “nuclear umbrella” security alliance with Seoul.\nNorth Korea announced it was pulling out of the talks with South Korea after denouncing U.S.-South Korean “Max Thunder” air combat drills, which it said involved U.S. stealth fighters, B-52 bombers and “nuclear assets”.\nAmerican stealth F-22 fighters were spotted in South Korea in May, but the U.S. military command in South Korea said no B-52s were scheduled to take part.\nA South Korean defence ministry official said the drills would go on as planned.

Ambassador Karel van Oosterom, who chairs the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, said he remained hopeful.\n“Anyone who has had anything to do with DPRK in the past 20, 30, 40 years has seen that engaging in the political contact with DPRK is complex,” he said. “The road ahead will have bumps, and I think we are hitting one of the bumps at the moment.” Reporting by Josh Smith and Christine Kim in Seoul, Tim Kelly in Tokyo, Philip Wen and Christian Shepherd in Beijing, David Brunnstrom, Phillip Stewart, Tim Ahmann, Matt Spetalnick, Lesley Wroughton and Doina Chiacu in Washington and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Editing by Alistair Bell and James Dalgleish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:17:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
