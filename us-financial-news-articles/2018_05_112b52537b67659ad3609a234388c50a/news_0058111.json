Olsen Energy, Odfjell Drilling, Rowan Companies, Maersk Drilling and Seadrill.\nOil companies, including Equinor, Eni, Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum rent rigs to search for hydrocarbon reserves off Norway.\nReporting by Terje Solsvik, editing by Gwladys Fouche\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:21:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
