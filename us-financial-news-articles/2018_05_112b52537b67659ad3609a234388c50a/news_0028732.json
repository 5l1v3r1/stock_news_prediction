They have engaged an external mortgage broker consultant to assist in identifying lenders to provide replacement financing, as well as directly contacting banks and other capital providers and has launched a mezzanine funding program through an overseas affiliate of WGI. Management has also been actively discussing significant developed and bulk land sales opportunities, with the intention of bringing forward cash flow to repay debt.\nThe single-family market in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan statistical area (“ MSA ”), and specifically in the Prince George’s County submarket, continues to be strong. The Project is selling lots to three homebuilders, NVR, Inc., Mid-Atlantic Builders and Haverford Homes. As of April 30, 2018 NVR, Inc. had closed on 96 lots, Haverford Homes had closed on 67 lots, and Mid-Atlantic Builders had closed on 42 lots.

The securing of a grocery anchor tenant by the retail developer partner should also positively impact the sales momentum for other components of the Project, including the development of townhomes and other future residential development, by providing an important retail-based service and community amenity. Kimco, our retail joint venture partner, continues to market the site to potential anchor grocer tenants. Kimco received two letters of intent in the 1 st quarter of 2018. Kimco is negotiating with one of the grocers and expects to have a fully executed LOI complete by the 2 nd quarter of 2018. Many smaller retailers have expressed interest in both in-line stores and individual pad sites. We will begin to negotiate leases with those potential clients after we have agreed to terms with the grocer anchor. Engaging in discussions with commercial and residential developers to broaden the awareness of the Project and explore sales and/or partnering opportunities to realize the highest and best use and associated values for the Project. The Corporation received three letters of intent for the purchase of parcels in Phase 2 and 3.

The impairment of $32,111,709 ($25,259,280 USD) was recorded on Phase 1 and Phase 1A, as the expected realizable value of these phases were lower than carrying value.

Professional fees increased by $79,593, due to an increase in audit expenses and the incurrence of corporate secretarial services that in 2016 were provided by WIGI for no additional charge.

These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $54,003 in marketing expenses as higher client communication, media placement and signage expenses were incurred in 2016 as builders heavily marketed lots and $25,866 lower director fees in 2017 due to the entity having only one independent director during the second and third quarters of 2017.\nTotal Other Items consists of foreign exchange losses and has increased by $872,531 from total Other Item expenses of $759,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, to total Other Item expenses of $1,631,531 for the year ended December 31, 2017.
