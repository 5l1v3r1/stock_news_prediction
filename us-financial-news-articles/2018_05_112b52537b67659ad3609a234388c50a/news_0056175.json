Interior Minister Herbert Kickl has denied suggestions there has been any purge of staff.\n“Today is day one of a new start for the protection of the state and constitution in Austria,” Kickl told a news conference announcing a reform process to be mapped out this year and carried out by mid-2019.\nThe news conference was Kickl’s first public appearance with a newly reinstated Peter Gridling, the head of the BVT, whom Kickl had suspended for being one of the five officials under investigation.\nAn administrative court recently overturned that suspension, meaning Gridling can resume his duties.\n“We are currently in a very difficult phase,” said Gridling, who will lead the overhaul.\n“There is great uncertainty among BVT staff. We want to lift that uncertainty. We want to work with staff to get this process started.”\nKickl said the overhaul would involve strengthening “internal controls and the internal security system” and would be informed by the prosecutors’ investigation, but did not elaborate.\n“There is a certain need for improvement,” he said.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:26:09.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
