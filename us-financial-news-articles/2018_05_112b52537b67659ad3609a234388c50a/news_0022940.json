(Nasdaq: RMNI), a global provider of enterprise software products and services, and the leading third-party support provider for Oracle and SAP software products, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510006180/en/\nRimini Street Announces Fiscal First Quarter 2018 Financial Results (Photo: Business Wire)\n“Rimini Street executed well in the first quarter of 2018, in revenue, service delivery and global operations,” stated Seth A. Ravin , Rimini Street co-founder and CEO. “We increased our investment in sales and marketing, and invested in the development of several new product and service solutions launched in April and May. We also had positive developments in our ongoing litigation with Oracle, including the U.S. Court of Appeals reversing and vacating certain awards, and ordering Oracle to refund approximately $50 million (which Oracle has done, a portion of which has been paid into escrow). Rimini Street plans to fuel growth and continue improving operating leverage by recruiting and hiring additional senior executive talent, further increasing sales and marketing investments, ramping up sales of new product and service offerings, and expanding global service delivery capabilities.”\n“Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 came in within our guidance range, and was driven by balanced growth across all geographies. The litigation refund of $21.5 million we received from Oracle in the quarter was used primarily to pay down debt obligations under our credit facility on April 3, 2018,” stated Tom Sabol , Rimini Street CFO. “This decreased our total debt obligations while lowering our go forward debt servicing costs. In addition, we remain committed to further reducing our cost of capital and improving free cash flows to fund investment in growth opportunities.”\nLaunch of New Product and Service Solutions\nOn April 24, Rimini Street announced the immediate availability of Rimini Street Mobility and Rimini Street Analytics – its latest offerings in a new family of solutions designed to provide an improved competitive advantage to organizations with mature and valuable enterprise software investments. Rimini Street Advanced Database Security was the first offering in this new family of products, and launched in 2017. Rimini Street’s new solutions enable an organization to quickly and cost-effectively modernize their current enterprise software with the latest desired features and capabilities, future-proof their technical platforms against yet-unknown technology changes, and secure their systems against a constantly evolving threat environment. Rimini Street’s new solutions allow organizations to leverage their existing systems as a solid foundation for an innovative hybrid IT strategy.\nAdditionally, today, Rimini Street announced the extension of its proven, award-winning support model and global capabilities to SaaS products, beginning with the launch of services for Salesforce Sales Cloud and Service Cloud products. The Company’s goal is to help clients achieve greater success by optimizing their investment across the hybrid enterprise, which now includes support for traditionally-licensed and SaaS enterprise software. Salesforce customers can leverage Rimini Street’s award-winning, ultra-responsive support services to supplement and complement their core Salesforce-provided maintenance program to accelerate delivery of capabilities, optimize total operating costs and maximize ROI. These new services will enable Salesforce customers to benefit from Rimini Street’s proven 24x7x365 operational support with 15-minute guaranteed response for urgent issues, in addition to managed system administration and configuration, customization and integration project services.\nPress releases that contain additional information about the new product and service solutions are posted on the Company’s website.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet Revenue was $59.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 22% compared to $49.1 million for the same period last year.

Non-GAAP Operating Income was $6.1 million for the quarter compared to $7.1 million for the same period last year.

In addition, on May 2, 2018, as agreed upon between Rimini Street and Oracle, Oracle placed an additional $28.5 million in a court-controlled escrow account to be distributed following the outcome of a remand decision on attorney’s fees.
