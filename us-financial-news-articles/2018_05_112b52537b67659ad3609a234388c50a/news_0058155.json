It was the twelfth consecutive week that prices were higher than in the corresponding year-ago week.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 83.7 percent of volumes last week, down from 84.9 percent the previous week.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week dropped to 293 tonnes from 576 tonnes in the same week last year.\nSeparately, volumes to Hong Kong rose to 290 tonnes last week from 192 tonnes in same week last year.
