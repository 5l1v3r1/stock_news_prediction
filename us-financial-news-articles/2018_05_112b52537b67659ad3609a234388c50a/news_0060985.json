Such a maneuver, he said, tends to “take a long time to really move the dial and have something.”\n“I do think that’s going to be very challenging,” he said of his interpretation of Apple’s content strategy.\nAs the head of Fox, Murdoch obviously has a vested interest in what Apple is doing.

He didn’t, however, offer alternative paths for Apple to follow.
