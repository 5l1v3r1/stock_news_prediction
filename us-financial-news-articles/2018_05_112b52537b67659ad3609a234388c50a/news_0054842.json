Britain’s Home Office could not be reached for comment.\nAbramovich did not attend Saturday’s FA Cup final in London, the showpiece end to the English soccer season when Chelsea beat Manchester United. It was not clear where he is currently staying.\nRelations between Britain and Russia hit a low after London accused Moscow of poisoning former double-agent Sergei Skripal in Britain in March, prompting countries around the world to expel scores of Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind.\nAbramovich made his fortune in the oil industry in the 1990s in Russia and bought Chelsea in 2003 since when he has helped to transform the club into one of the most successful in the Premier League.
