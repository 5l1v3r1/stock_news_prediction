(NYSE: MSM) , a premier distributor of Metalworking and Maintenance, Repair and Operations (MRO) products and services to industrial customers throughout North America, has acquired All Integrated Solutions (AIS) from New York-based private equity firm High Road Capital Partners. AIS is a leading value-added distributor of industrial fasteners and components, MRO supplies and assembly tools based in Franksville, Wisconsin. The stock purchase transaction closed on April 30, 2018.\nAIS delivers production fasteners and custom tool and fastener solutions for use in the assembly of manufactured commercial and consumer products. The company's 135-plus associates serve customers in a region that includes Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and North Dakota.

Both organizations make sure the right fasteners and supplies are available when our customers need them without fail.
