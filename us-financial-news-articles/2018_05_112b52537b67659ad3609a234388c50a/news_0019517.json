(\"Theravance Biopharma\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: TBPH) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.3 million. The Company's first quarter operating loss was $65.0 million or $51.0 million excluding share-based compensation expense. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $435.5 million as of March 31, 2018 and includes the $100 million upfront payment associated with the global development and commercialization agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) for TD-1473.\nRick E Winningham, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"We are very pleased with our achievements in the first quarter of 2018, led by our global collaboration with Janssen for the development and commercialization of TD-1473 in inflammatory intestinal diseases. As we look to the remainder of 2018, we are enhancing our focus on the most important strategic priorities for the Company, which are those programs where we think there is the greatest opportunity to create transformational medicines. For revefenacin, our commercial readiness activities are underway in anticipation of approval in the US for COPD later this year. With TD-1473 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and TD-9855 for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, we are advancing two highly differentiated assets through mid-stage development. In research, we are preparing to progress a novel inhaled JAK inhibitor for serious respiratory diseases into the clinic. These assets, combined with our strong balance sheet and emerging cash flows from our economic interest in Trelegy Ellipta, position us to advance all segments of our business – from research to commercial – with the goal of creating transformational medicines.\"\nProgram Updates\nTrelegy Ellipta (first once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) 1 : GSK reported first quarter 2018 net sales of $14.6 million; Theravance Biopharma entitled to approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of the product U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an expanded indication of Trelegy Ellipta for treatment of a broader population of COPD patients with airflow limitation or who have experienced an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms Expanded indication based on the positive results of the landmark 10,355 patient IMPACT study, which was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine Boxed warning removed from Trelegy Ellipta prescribing information Velusetrag (TD-5108; 5-HT4 agonist): Collaboration partner Alfasigma S.p.A. (Alfasigma), which funded majority of Phase 2 gastroparesis program costs, has exercised its option to develop and commercialize velusetrag Alfasigma opt-in decision results in $10 million payment to Company and right to receive future potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments and royalties Theravance Biopharma has elected not to pursue further development of velusetrag, based on the Company's planned pipeline investments and in light of the current FDA requirement that a chronically administered gastroparesis product in this class complete a large Phase 3 safety study Global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize velusetrag will transfer to Alfasigma, under the terms of the existing collaboration agreement Revefenacin (TD-4208, nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)): Mid-cycle review meeting with FDA is complete FDA reiterated no Advisory Committee meeting planned for revefenacin Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date remains on track as November 13, 2018\nAnticipated Near-Term Milestones and Events\nTD-1473 (intestinally restricted pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor): Initiations of Phase 2 induction study in Crohn's disease and Phase 2b/3 induction and maintenance study in ulcerative colitis planned in the second half of 2018 TD-9855 (norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitor (NSRI)): Data from exploratory Phase 2a study in patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) by end of July 2018 Revefenacin (TD-4208, nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)): Potential regulatory approval in the US for COPD, with assigned PDUFA date of November 13, 2018 Novel inhaled JAK inhibitor: Progression into first-in-human studies in late 2018 or early 2019 Trelegy Ellipta 1 : Potential label expansion in EU expected in 2018, supported by submission of IMPACT data to European Medicines Agency; completion of Phase 3 CAPTAIN study in asthma patients expected in early 2019\nNotes:\n1 As reported by Glaxo Group Limited or one of its affiliates (GSK); reported sales converted to USD; economic interest related to Trelegy Ellipta (the combination of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol, (FF/UMEC/VI), jointly developed by GSK and Innoviva, Inc.) entitles Company to upward tiering payments equal to approximately 5.5% to 8.5% on worldwide net sales of the product\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.3 million, comprised of revenue from collaborative arrangements and US net product sales of VIBATIV ® . This represents an increase of $5.2 million over the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily related to revenue recognized from the non-refundable, upfront payment associated with the global development and commercialization agreement with Janssen for TD-1473, which will be recognized over the course of the TD-1473 Phase 2 program.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nR&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $47.8 million, compared to $40.6 million in the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs, share-based compensation and allocated expenses. First quarter R&D expenses include non-cash share-based compensation of $6.6 million.\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nSG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $24.7 million, compared to $20.8 million in the same period in 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher expenses in G&A related to external-related expenses, employee-related costs, and share-based compensation. First quarter SG&A expenses include non-cash share-based compensation of $7.4 million.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash, totaled $435.5 million as of March 31, 2018. This amount includes the $100 million upfront payment associated with the global development and commercialization agreement with Janssen and excludes $10.0 million payment from Alfasigma associated with exercise of its option for velusetrag.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company's guidance on operating loss excluding non-cash share-based compensation for the full year of 2018 remains unchanged at $180.0 to $200.0 million. The actual amount could be above or below this forecast as a result of a variety of factors impacting the business, including the amount of revenue recognized in 2018 related to the global collaboration agreement with Janssen (currently expected to be less than $25 million), the timing and cost of clinical studies associated with Company's key programs, and net product sales of VIBATIV ® . The Company's financial guidance for 2018 does not include income related to Trelegy Ellipta.\nConference Call and Live Webcast Today at 5:00 pm ET\nTheravance Biopharma will hold a conference call and live webcast accompanied by slides today at 5:00 pm ET.

(\"Theravance Biopharma\") is a diversified biopharmaceutical company with the core purpose of creating medicines that help improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illness.\nIn our relentless pursuit of this objective, we strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization, and utilize both internal capabilities and those of partners around the world. Our research efforts are focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology. Our research goal is to design localized medicines that target diseased tissues, without systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. These efforts leverage years of experience in developing localized medicines for the lungs to treat respiratory disease. The first potential medicine to emerge from our research focus on immunology and localized treatments is an oral, intestinally restricted pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, currently in development to treat a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases. Our pipeline of internally discovered product candidates will continue to evolve with the goal of creating transformational medicines to address the significant needs of patients.\nIn addition, we have an economic interest in future payments that may be made by Glaxo Group or one of its affiliates (GSK) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva, Inc. relating to certain programs, including Trelegy Ellipta.\nFor more information, please visit www.theravance.com .\nTHERAVANCE ® , the Cross/Star logo, and VIBATIV ® are registered trademarks of the Theravance Biopharma group of companies.
