Three people have been charged for carrying out the murder but police have not identified who ordered it.\nAddressing the crowd, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said Malta was moving forward on issues of justice but he did not mention the investigation into Caruana Galizia’s murder.\nHe said, however, he had been victim of “the biggest lie” in Malta’s political history, an apparent reference to the journalist’s allegations - so far unproven - that his family had received kickbacks.
