(NASDAQ:EYEN), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of ophthalmology products utilizing its patented piezo-print technology to deliver micro-therapeutics topically to the eye, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n1Q 2018 Business Highlights\nRaised $24.5 million in net proceeds from initial public offering in January 2018; Completed EYN PG21 study demonstrating a robust intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of the company’s micro-therapeutic Latanoprost. Full results will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference; Received positive feedback from FDA to advance MicroProst for Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma (CACG) into Phase III development; Received positive feedback from FDA to advance MicroPine for progressive pediatric Myopia into Phase III development with possibility of only one trial required for registration; Expanded executive management, Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board.\nDr. Sean Ianchulev, Eyenovia’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer commented, “We started 2018 with the successful completion of our initial public offering in January, which will help support our late stage clinical pipeline as we steadily advance 3 programs into Phase III development over the next 12 months. We also recently completed an ancillary clinical trial demonstrating the robust IOP lowering effect of our high-precision, piezo-print micro-dosing platform in 30 subjects (60 eyes). This clinical trial builds upon previously reported clinical data from our two Phase II studies in mydriasis and we intend to submit it for presentation to a major medical conference. We are preparing to submit two INDs by the end of 2018 as we move towards the initiation of the MicroStat Mydriasis Phase III program later this year and the MicroProst CACG Phase III program in the first half of 2019. Furthermore, we are encouraged by the FDA feedback to advance MicroPine for pediatric myopia into Phase III development, with the possibility of only one Phase III trial. With our robust pipeline and highly differentiated technology platform, we believe that our accomplished team is well positioned to execute on our outlined programs which have the potential to transform the field of ophthalmology and the way in which we treat front-of-the-eye conditions.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Review\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net loss was approximately $(3.4) million, or $(0.45) per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $(1.1) million, or $(0.49) per share for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses totaled approximately $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to approximately $0.9 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of 130%.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1.3 million, compared with approximately $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 583%.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were approximately $3.4 million, compared to total operating expenses of approximately $1.1 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of 210%.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s cash balance was approximately $27.6 million compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nCompleted initial public offering of 2,730,000 shares of common stock in January 2018.
