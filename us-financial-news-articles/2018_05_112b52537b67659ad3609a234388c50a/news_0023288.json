Police said they did not know the nationalities of the other drivers.\n“There were many trucks burnt ... The protesters were complaining that truck owners are only hiring foreign nationals,” said KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele.\nZambia’s High Commissioner, Emmanuel Mwamba, said the attacks could “halt the movement of goods and services between the two countries.”\nMost of Zambia’s copper exports reach the international market via South Africa’s roads and through its port at Durban.\nZambia’s got 27.5 percent of its imports from South Africa in March, Central Statistical Office data shows.\nReporting by Chris Mfula in Lusaka and additional reporting by Patricia Aruo in Johannesburg; Editing by James Macharia and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:39:25.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
