The single currency slid to a new 2018 low on Wednesday just above $1.18.\n“Short term interest rates are predicting deposit rates to hit 0 percent by the end of 2019 - that is an unsustainable scenario if growth doesn’t pick up soon,” said Rishi Mishra, interest rates strategist at Futures First Info Services.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:57:51.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
