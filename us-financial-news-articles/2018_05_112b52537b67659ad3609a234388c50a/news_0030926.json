Led by Scott Burns and Ted Lain, MD, MBA, Sanova is partnering with well-respected medical and cosmetic dermatologists across the Sunbelt states to focus solely on providing exceptional care to medical and cosmetic dermatology patients.\nDr. Ted Lain said, \"The leading dermatologists in Austin came together to build a new platform to provide high-quality patient care. So much of our time historically was spent on operational duties, pulling us away from our patients. Sanova Dermatology will allow us to put patient care first. We now have the expert resources of a team of billing, marketing, and insurance experts to help prioritize customer service and handle the administrative headaches that bog down most private practice physicians today.\"\nScott Burns, Chief Executive Officer of Sanova Dermatology, said, \"Partnering with Spindletop Capital provides us with significant practice management experience and dermatology domain expertise. Spindletop is a uniquely qualified partner given its team, led by physician investors, and including past presidents of the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Society of Plastic Surgery, and former leadership teams from both Galderma and Merz.\"\nDr. Evan Melrose, a Managing Director at Spindletop Capital, said, \"We are excited to be partnering with Dr. Lain, Scott, and the core team of well-respected clinicians. The delivery of dermatologic care is going through a transformative phase in the US today. We have committed substantial resources to provide strategic, clinical, and operational support to build Sanova into the best-in-class platform for providing high-quality patient care.\"\nThe investment in Sanova Dermatology represents the latest platform in the continuation of Spindletop Capital's healthcare investment strategy, and is its first investment in Spindletop Healthcare Growth Capital Fund II. Previous platform investments include Bioventus (a regenerative medicine platform) and HNI Healthcare (a leading SaaS/Hospitalist company with over 250 physicians).\nMcDermott Will & Emery provided legal counsel to SCM.\nAbout Sanova Dermatology\nSanova Dermatology, based in Austin, was founded by leading dermatologists to provide high-quality, comprehensive dermatology care to their patients.
