REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo Mahathir, 92, led an opposition coalition to a spectacular win over Najib’s previously undefeated ruling alliance in a general election on May 9, having campaigned aggressively over people’s rising living costs and a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).\n“We find that the country’s finances for example, was abused in a way that now we are facing trouble settling debts that have risen to a trillion ringgit,” Mahathir said when speaking for the first time to staff of the prime minister’s office.\n“We have never had to deal with this before. Before we never faced debts higher than 300 billion ringgit, but now it has climbed to 1 trillion ringgit,” Mahathir said.\nIn his first week in charge, Mahathir announced that a broad-based goods and services tax (GST) would be zero-rated from June 1, as his government works to replace it with a reinstated sales and services tax (SST).\nMahathir had also promised to reintroduce fuel subsidies besides doing away with GST, all part of his coalition’s pledge to tamp down rising living costs.\nMahathir’s fiscal measures, however, would widen Malaysia’s fiscal deficit and are credit negative without any offsetting measures, according to ratings agency Moody’s.\nRelated Coverage Malaysia sets up new 1MDB criminal taskforce Najib’s government had planned to collect 43.8 billion ringgit ($11.05 billion) in 2018 in GST, about 18 percent of total revenue.\nDuring the election campaign, Najib had warned that Mahathir’s economic proposals would result in debt ballooning to over 1 trillion ringgit.\nNajib also rebutted opposition claims that federal debt had risen to alarming levels under his governance, and said that debt amounted to about 50.9 percent of its GDP at June 2017, which was below the government’s limit of 55 percent.\nMahathir said last week that many of the figures recording the country’s financial position may be false.\nMalaysia’s anti-graft agency has summoned Najib to give a statement on Tuesday in connection with a probe on SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB.\nThe summons came days after police raided six premises linked to the former prime minister as part of investigations into the state investment fund that Najib founded in 2009.\nAmong the items seized include 284 boxes of designer handbags and dozens of bags filled with cash and jewelery, from a luxury condominium in the center of Kuala Lumpur linked to Najib.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; editing by Praveen Menon and Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T06:55:39.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
