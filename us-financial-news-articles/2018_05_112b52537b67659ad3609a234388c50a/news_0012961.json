However, the hardline militants have also claimed responsibility for several attacks that never happened.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared nationwide victory over the Islamic State in December, five months after his forces recaptured Iraq’s second city Mosul in a protracted battle with the jihadist militants.\nIslamic State, however, continues to carry out bombings, assassinations and ambushes in different areas of Iraq, and remains active in neighboring Syria.
