REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nThe party estimated 160,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest - the Paris prefect’s office put the tally at 40,000 - and France Unbowed is pushing to hold a much larger rally with unions and other forces on May 26.\n“The issue here are the endless gifts being made to the rich while the French people are struggling,” Melenchon told TF1 television ahead of the march, which drew a diverse crowd, from hospital workers and parent groups to communist supporters.\nThere were a few isolated scuffles at the march and at least four people had been arrested, while one policeman was injured, the police prefect’s office said.\nYet despite simmering protest movements, on the 50th anniversary of the May 1968 student riots that brought France to its knees, unions have lost clout and the mood is far from revolutionary.\nSome 45 percent of French people gave Macron’s first year in office the thumbs up, according to a poll of more than 13,500 by Ipsos-Sopra Steria published on Saturday in Le Monde, with the planned overhaul of the SNCF proving the most popular reform.
