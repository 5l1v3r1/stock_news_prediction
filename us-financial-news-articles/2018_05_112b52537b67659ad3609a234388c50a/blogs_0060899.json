Facebook data can certainly be analyzed without preventing residents from accessing the platform. When Facebook has been banned in other countries, it has been before an election as a way to prevent residents from communicating about that election. It led to an indefinite ban in China.\nThat said, a ban will only impact a small percentage of PNG’s population. Recent statistics put the area’s internet penetration at just 12%.
