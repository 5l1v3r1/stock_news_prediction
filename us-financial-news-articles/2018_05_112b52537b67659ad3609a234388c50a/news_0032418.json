The loss of life and the large number of injured Palestinians is tragic ... Such violence is destructive to peace efforts,” the spokesman told reporters.\n“We call on all sides to show restraint and refrain from any further violence. Palestinians have the right to protest but these protests must be peaceful. We are concerned that extremist elements may be seeking to hijack peaceful protests to further their own objectives. Israel has the right to defend its borders ... but the use of live fire is deeply troubling.”\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper, writing by William James\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
