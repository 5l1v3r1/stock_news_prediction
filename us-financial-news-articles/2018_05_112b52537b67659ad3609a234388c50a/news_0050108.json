(TSX.V:VRR) (FSE:5VR) (OTCBB:VRRCF), the \" Company \", or “ VR ”, is pleased to announce that it has closed the recently announced acquisition (see terms in News Release dated May 1, 2018) of the Kraut Property. The Kraut Property consists of 6 mineral claims in one contiguous block covering 124 acres and is located within the southern part of the Walker Lane belt in west-central Nevada, approximately 5 kilometers northwest of the Company’s Danbo Property in Nye County, Nevada.\nThe Company intends to commence surface exploration at Kraut early this summer. The work will be a natural extension of its work at its Danbo property during the past two years. The Company will leverage a modern understanding of the nearby Round Mountain gold deposit, and recent innovations in exploration technologies for Tertiary epithermal gold systems in general in the Walker Lane Belt in Nevada in order to evaluate the large area of alteration and surface gold geochemistry evident at Kraut.\nPlease see the Company’s website at www.vrr.ca for more complete information on the near-by Danbo property.\nTechnical information for this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101, and reviewed on behalf of the Company by Dr. Michael Gunning P.Geo., a non-independent Qualified Person.\nAbout VR Resources\nVR is a new listing in the junior exploration space (TSX.V: VRR; Frankfurt: 5VR; OTCBB: VRRCF). The diverse experience and proven track record of its Board in early-stage exploration and discovery is the foundation of VR. The Company is focused on exploring for large copper-gold mineral systems in the western United States. VR is the continuance of 4 years of active exploration in Nevada by a Vancouver-based private exploration company. VR is well financed for its exploration strategy , which is currently focused on three core properties, namely Bonita, Junction and Danbo. VR owns its exploration assets outright, and will evaluate new opportunities on an ongoing basis, whether by staking or acquisition.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS:\n“Michael H.
