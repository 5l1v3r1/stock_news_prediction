Share prices of potentially-affected “middlemen” such as pharmacy-benefit managers, and to a lesser extent health insurers, fell sharply but then rebounded within minutes in late trading.\nInvestors shouldn’t relax, though.\nThe relief rally made a certain amount of sense. After all, Mr. Trump’s comments were characteristically vague and didn’t unveil any immediate action to cut drug spending that might harm the profitability of companies like Express Scripts Holding ESRX 2.59% or CVS Health . CVS 3.16% Express Scripts said it was “pleased” in a statement released after the president’s speech.\nBut while the pace of any reform will be deliberate, a look at the policy proposals that the Department of Health and Human Services released Friday suggest that more serious action on drug pricing is a distinct possibility in the months to come.\nFor starters, HHS says it will examine whether PBMs should be required to have a fiduciary duty to their clients. Any such requirement would have a significant impact on the PBM business model since those companies make money by collecting rebates from manufacturers as well as by distributing drugs to patients via specialty pharmacies that they also control. Those businesses do better when list prices go up, despite PBMs’ stated focus on keeping drug costs low—an apparent conflict.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Seema Verma said the current structure of PBMs “makes it unclear who they’re actually aligned with” in a speech earlier this week. HHS raised questions that echo that sentiment: “Should PBMs be forbidden from receiving any payment or remuneration from manufacturers, and should PBM contracts be forbidden from including rebates or fees calculated as a percentage of list prices?”\nOther drastic action could be in the works over the longer term. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested earlier this month that the government could re-examine whether rebates to middlemen should be exempt from anti-kickback laws, a possibility also raised by HHS on Friday. Importantly, these actions might not require legislation from Congress to take effect, though legal challenges from industry would be a given.\nEnjoy Friday’s sense of catharsis. There is every indication that health care investors could soon get spooked again.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:28:57.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
