REUTERS/Benoit Tessier Shares in Air France KLM were down 1.6 percent in early session trading, with the stock having lost around 50 percent in value since the start of 2018.\nAir France’s French unions have been staging a strike in protest over pay demands, with the dispute having led to the resignation of Air France KLM boss Jean-Marc Janaillac.\nAir France had offered workers a pay rise of 2 percent in 2018 and a further 5 percent over the following three years, but French unions, which have demanded 5.1 percent this year, have complained management is not serious about talks.\nAfter negotiations reached a deadlock, Janaillac called a for a vote on May 4, the results of which went against him.\nJanaillac had been CEO for less than two years, running into the same union resistance to reform as his predecessor. His exit raises questions over Air France’s ability to cut costs to compete with Gulf carriers and low-cost airlines.\nThe French government, the national carrier’s largest shareholder with a 14 percent stake, has said it will not ride to the rescue of Air France.\nReporting by Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:10:17.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
