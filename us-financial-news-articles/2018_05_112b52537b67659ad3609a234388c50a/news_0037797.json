Stephen Hodge, a former senior vice president for sales at StarKist, pleaded guilty last year to price-fixing\n\"American consumers deserve free enterprise, not fixed prices, so the department will not tolerate crimes like the one charged in today's indictment,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement announcing Lischewski's indictment.\nLischewski's attorney, John Keker, said his client has lived a hardworking and ethical life and is innocent.\n\"When the facts are known and the truth emerges, Mr. Lischewski will be found not guilty, and that vindication will rightfully restore his good name,\" Keker said in a statement.\nThe U.S. government began investigating price fixing of canned tuna between StarKist, Bumble Bee Foods and Chicken of the Sea more than two years ago.\nTwo other executives at Bumble Bee have pleaded guilty in the price-fixing scheme, and Bumble Bee Foods last year agreed to pay a $25 million fine after pleading guilty to price fixing.\nBumble Bee general counsel Jill Irvin has said the company hired a chief compliance officer last fall and recently reformed its guidelines and policies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:39:56.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
