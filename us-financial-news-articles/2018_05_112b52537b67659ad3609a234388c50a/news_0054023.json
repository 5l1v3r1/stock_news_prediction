(TSX-V:VENZ) (“ Venzee ” or the “ Company ”) announces it has filed its Q1 financial statements and is hosting a conference call to discuss these results and provide an update on operations on Tuesday, May 29, 2018 at 6:00AM PDT (9:00AM EDT). The conference call will be hosted by CEO Peter Mackay, CFO Joshua Lebovic, and VP of partner development, John Abrams. Investors who have questions following the update on operations will be invited to communicate their questions to management after the call. The financial statements are available under the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com .\nDuring the quarter, Venzee added John Abrams and Peter Montross to its sales and partner development team. Both Mr. Abrams and Mr. Montross joined Venzee from Shotfarm, a Chicago-based competitor to Venzee, to lead the enterprise sales and partnership growth.\nAs announced on April 10th, the Company is in advanced discussions with more than 20 potential enterprise channel partners, many of which have a strong market share in their respective verticals in North America. Targeting additional channel partners remains a strong focus of the Company to increase industry-wide adoption of the Venzee platform.\nTo date, the company has executed 7 letters of intent with these potential channel partners and continues to advance these towards definitive partnership agreements.\nJohn Abrams, VP of Partner Development, said “Channel Partner engagement in the first quarter exceeds expectations.” According to Abrams, “retailer demand for Omnichannel content has driven brands to demand more from their content management system investment. By connecting with the Venzee platform, brands can distribute and syndicate authentic product content from their existing systems more quickly, to more channels, with less effort, and less error.”\nVenzee’s Channel Partners and their clients benefit from the range of integration options Venzee provides. Venzee’s comprehensive API, FTP, and Autopilot solutions allow any content management system or system integrator to enable integration and deliver instant client results.\nAccording to Abrams, “Channel Partner engagements with globally recognized PIM, MDM, and DAM system suppliers are expected to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year as existing solution providers expand their content syndication offerings by partnering with Venzee to offer our leading-edge content delivery solutions.”\nVenzee's channel partners are primarily technology-focused companies and global system integrators which benefit by providing Venzee's solutions to their current and future customers.\nChannel partners significantly expand the Company's ability to introduce, educate and sell Venzee content exchange products across multiple retail, distribution and manufacturing clients.\nVenzee's targeted channel partners act as a marketing and sales force multiplier validating and endorsing the Venzee platform while promoting the Venzee value proposition across a significant customer base.\nThe Venzee platform complements the majority of content management systems used today by mid-market and larger retail, distribution and manufacturing companies. The Venzee platform provides any content management system with scalable, reliable and efficient content ingestion and distribution capabilities.\nResignation of Chief Financial Officer\nJoshua Lebovic has advised Venzee that he will resign as Chief Financial Officer to pursue a new opportunity, effective June 15. In submitting his resignation, Mr. Lebovic did not express any disagreement with the Company on any matter related to the Company’s operations, policies or practices, including its controls or financial-related matters. Mr. Lebovic will support the Company up until his successor is identified and appointed, and will assist Venzee in ensuring an orderly transition of his duties.\n“On behalf of everyone at Venzee and our Board of Directors, I want to thank Joshua for his financial leadership and many contributions during his time as CFO. We wish him success in his new endeavor,” said Peter Mackay.\nThe Company has initiated a search for a new CFO and expects to be able to announce a replacement in due course.\nDetails of the Conference Call:\nDate: Tuesday, May 29th 2018\nTime: 6:00 a.m. PDT / 9:00 a.m. EDT\nOperator Assisted Toll-Free Dial-In Number: (866) 521-4909\nLocal or International Dial-In Number: (647) 427 2311\nThere will also be a playback of the conference call, available in MP3 format by contacting investor relations below.\nAbout Venzee\nVenzee is a SaaS (software as a service) company that launched in 2014 to help e-commerce vendors and retailers collect, transform and deliver data for the digital supply chain.
