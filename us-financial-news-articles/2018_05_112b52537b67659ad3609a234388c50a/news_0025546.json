Adam Jones led off with a single, and one out later, Schoop also singled.\nRoyals rookie starter Eric Skoglund retired Trumbo on an infield popup for the second out, but he left a fastball out over the plate for Davis, who went the opposite way to left field, his fourth home run of the season and second in two nights, to give Baltimore a 3-2 lead.\nThe Royals tied it in the sixth. Jorge Soler, coming off a three-hit game on Tuesday, hit a leadoff double, and Cashner responded by getting a strikeout and an infield popup. But Duda flared a single to shallow left-center field to tie the game.\nCashner (1-4) didn’t figure in the decision. In six innings, he gave up three runs on six hits, with two walks and three strikeouts.\nSkoglund (1-2) wasn’t around for the decision, either. He was pulled after getting Davis on a hard line drive to lead off the bottom of the seventh. He gave up the three runs on five hits, with a walk and three strikeouts.\nRoyals center fielder Abraham Almonte left the game in the bottom of the sixth inning. An announcement said only that he had an illness.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:39:47.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
