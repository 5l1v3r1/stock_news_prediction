No one died in that incident.\nVarela said that Joshua Holt, a U.S. citizen and Mormon missionary who jailed in the Helicoide, was still incarcerated. The Helicoide revolt prompted the U.S. government to call for his release.\nA U.S. citizen was also being held at the Fenix prison, officials from the U.S. embassy in Caracas told a news conference, adding that they were concerned for his safety.\nWeapons and drugs are rife in Venezuela’s infamous prisons.\nReporting by Deisy Buitrago, Andreina Aponte and Girish Gupta; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T00:42:26.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
