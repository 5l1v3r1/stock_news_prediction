He declined to give any details about how many of Germany’s Eurofighters were affected by the spare parts logjam.\nThe ministry acknowledged that the component supply issue could exacerbate existing problems with the readiness of the Eurofighter warplanes, but declined to give any details.\nIt was not immediately clear if the issue also affected the five other countries that have received Eurofighter jets under a joint project of Britain’s BAE Systems, European airplane maker Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo. More than 500 of the jets have been delivered to Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria and Saudi Arabia.\nSources familiar with the issue denied a report by Spiegel Online that only 10 German Eurofighter jets were ready for use as a result of the issue, noting that at least 14 jets were in use around the world at the moment.\nAirbus said the restricted supply of the components was “being urgently addressed by the Eurofighter industrial community” and it would work closely with the German air force to minimize the impact of the situation.\nIt said it had provided the German Air Force with “a package of best practices, training and workarounds to mitigate the shortage of components and has put in place measures to increase the output of repairs to the existing inventory.”\nSources familiar with the issue said the German government was notified about the issue at the end of March, and faulted BAE for failing to provide further advance notice of the issue, which would have allowed preemptive orders of needed parts.\nA spokeswoman for BAE said the company was supporting the Airbus-led efforts to address the issue as part of the Eurofighter consortium.
