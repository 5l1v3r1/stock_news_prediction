Class-action litigation can result in large damages awards by juries and is harder for businesses to fight than cases brought by individual plaintiffs.\nThe NLRB argued that the waivers violate federal labor law and let companies evade their responsibilities under workplace statutes. Workers have fought back against the waivers, arguing that the cost of pursuing their cases individually in arbitration is prohibitively expensive.\nThe three consolidated cases that came before the court involved professional services firm Ernst & Young LLP, gas station operator Murphy Oil USA Inc and healthcare software company Epic Systems Corporation.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:34:45.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
