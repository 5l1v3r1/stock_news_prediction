The United Nations said last week that it believed at least 47 people had been killed, most of them students.\nProtesters have also called for the resignation of Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla accused of seeking to establish a family dynasty in the Central American country.\nNicaragua’s Episcopal Conference said in a statement that it would act as a mediator and witness in talks, with the aim of bringing the sides to agreement.\nEarlier on Monday, Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States, which includes the IACHR, posted a letter on his Twitter account from Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Denis Moncada inviting the IACHR to visit the country.\nThe letter did not specify when the visit would take place.\nThe IACHR is a leading human rights organization that has tackled issues of torture, killings and disappearances in North, Central and South America for nearly 60 years.\nReporting by Oswaldo Rivas; Writing by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Dan Grebler and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T04:07:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
