Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk\nVera Jourova, who handles justice, consumers and gender equality for the European Commission, speaks at a news conference on the General Data Protection Regulation in January. EPA/Shutterstock Good morning. Companies will need to be more transparent about how they manage employee data or risk getting caught on the wrong side of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, Risk & Compliance Journal reports .\nThe law takes effect May 25 and builds upon existing European data-privacy rules to protect personal identifiable information and to empower the individuals who are the subject of the data. The burden of compliance falls on organizations that hold and process information.\nCompanies need to examine their legal basis for for processing staff data and look at employee contracts, policies and handbooks to decide on what needs to be changed to make sure their handling of information remains lawful, said Rohan Massey, head of privacy and cybersecurity at Ropes & Gray in London.\nThose reviews can have an upside, said John Bowman, senior principal at business management consulting firm Promontory Financial Group, an IBM company. They offer an opportunity for companies to streamline their processes and avoid further risks, he said.\n“Companies need to understand the purpose of the processing and not exceed those, not do unnecessary processing,” said Mr. Bowman. GDPR stresses “principles of data minimization and storage limitation so data shouldn’t be stored for longer than is necessary,” he said. “That actually reduces a company’s risk; in case of a breach there is less data being affected.”\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nFinCEN delays rule on automatically revolving accounts. An office within the Treasury Department briefly delayed implementation of part of a rule requiring banks to identify the true owners of a corporate account.\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, issued a statement Wednesday saying it would delay the requirement relating to specific financial products, such as certificates of deposit or loan accounts, by 90 days, citing concern from financial institutions about their ability to comply.\nUnder the rule, which went into effect May 11, banks are required to ask for the identity of the true, beneficial owners of new accounts opened by companies. The rule defines a beneficial owner as any individual who owns a 25% or more stake in the company, or a person with a controlling interest in it.\nWhen issuing guidance ahead of the rule’s implementation, however, FinCEN said it treats a loan renewal, or the rolling over of a certificate of deposit, as a “new account,” necessitating the identification process once again. But some banks haven’t treated renewals or rollovers as new accounts, FinCEN said Wednesday , and the agency “believes that further consideration of this issue is appropriate.”\n“Every major bank would have struggled with implementing this,” said Alma Angotti, a former FinCEN enforcement attorney who now is a managing director at Navigant Consulting Inc., which advises companies and banks on compliance issues.\nThe 90-day delay is enough time for the banks to get a handle on how many accounts they hold that have this rollover feature, she said, adding that it will allow them to figure out which ones fall under the new requirements.\n“The biggest issue was it was a surprise” to the banks, she said. “This was a process they were having trouble getting done before the rule went into effect.” — Samuel Rubenfeld\nCOMPLIANCE\nThe U.S. sanctioned Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, a top Hezbollah financier and the group’s representative to Iran.
