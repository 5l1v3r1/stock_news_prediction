Haidara’s cross found its way to Xaver Schlager whose shot was going off target until it hit the toe of Marseille defender Sarr and went in.

It happened late but it happened.”\nThe set-piece that led to the winning goal was contentious as Salzburg thought the ball had come off a Marseille player last.\nSalzburg manager Marco Rose and some of his players argued with the officials following the final whistle.\n“I’m sorry for the guys who played their great Europa League season, then we were whistled away by the referee, what am I supposed to do? That’s unbelievable,” Rose said.\n“My boys are great,” he added. “They have great characters, we also had the opportunity to win but Marseille is in the final, we have to watch. We are very disappointed.” Reporting by Christian Radnedge,; Editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:00:30.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
