But if we ever fail, we deserve to lose.”\nThe PAP has ruled Singapore, one of the world’s richest and most stable countries, without interruption since independence in 1965, when Lee Kuan Yew led the island as it split from Malaysia following prolonged turmoil.\nLee has congratulated Mahathir Mohamad, 92, on becoming Malaysian prime minister. Mahathir served as Malaysia’s leader until a year before Lee became Singapore’s third prime minister in 2004.\nLee called the change of government “momentous” and said he planned to visit Malaysia on Saturday.\nThe PAP has dominated Singapore’s politics, winning a significant majority of parliamentary seats in every election. Its worst showing was in 2011 when 40 percent of voters turned against it, partly in dismay over growing strains on public services.\nSingapore’s next general election is due by early 2021.\nLee said last year he was ready to step down in the next couple of years, but no successor has been chosen from a group of younger ministers tasked with selecting a leader from within their ranks.\nCurrently nine of 100 MPs are from the opposition Workers’ Party.\n(Changes grandfather to father in paragraph 4)\nEditing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:17:50.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
