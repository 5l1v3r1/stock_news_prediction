(“Lane Quinn”), one of the leading group benefits consulting firms in the Alberta market (the “Transaction”).\nFounded in 2001, Lane Quinn is based in Calgary, Alberta, and has over 500 clients in Alberta and British Columbia. With a strong focus on value-added consulting advice, supported by first-rate client service, Lane Quinn has demonstrated a strong track record of growth, and developed an exceptional reputation in the market. Lane Quinn’s owners, Jay Quinn and Blaine McGillivray, as well as its management team and staff, bring significant experience in the group benefits market, and will continue to grow Lane Quinn as part of the People Corporation group of companies.\nLaurie Goldberg, Chairman and CEO of People Corporation, commented, “We are very excited to announce the acquisition of Lane Quinn, which is among the leading firms in the Alberta market, and an outstanding complement to our existing Hamilton+Partners operations.” Mr. Goldberg continued, “We are very pleased to welcome Jay, Blaine and the rest of the Lane Quinn team into the People Corporation family. This transaction enhances our position in the region, as we look to continue to grow the People Corporation business in Western Canada.”\nJay Quinn added, “I am very excited that Lane Quinn is joining with People Corporation. Our industry continues to evolve, and clients’ expectations continue to increase with respect to their employee benefit programs. Partnering with People Corporation, with its national footprint and significant scale, creates an opportunity to enhance the solutions we provide to our client base with access to a broader suite of products and services. Also, after getting to know People Corporation over many years, I see a very strong fit for our clients, suppliers, employees and all other stakeholders.”\nHighlights of the Transaction include:\nLane Quinn is among the leaders in the Alberta market, with a large and diversified client base, and a track record of growth. Lane Quinn’s legacy of extraordinary service and client-focused solutions will continue as part of People Corporation, with opportunities for future growth through accessing the broad and deep portfolio of products and solutions of a large, national platform. The Transaction significantly enhances the Company’s market position in the Alberta market by adding a business that is highly complementary to the Company’s existing operations in the region.\nPeople Corporation has agreed to purchase the shares of Lane Quinn and related entities for $20 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. Of the total purchase price, $14 million will be paid in cash on closing of the Transaction, $1.75 million will be satisfied through the issuance of 235,001 shares of People Corporation to the Vendors, and the remaining $4.25 million will be paid by way of deferred payments following the first and second anniversaries of the closing. The cash portion of the purchase price will be funded through drawing on the Acquisition Revolver component of the Company’s existing credit facilities with its senior lenders. The deferred payments are subject to potential adjustment related to the financial performance of the business over that period. In addition, the Vendors may be eligible to receive a potential additional payment after three years following closing of the Transaction should the Lane Quinn business exceed certain financial performance thresholds.\nMr. Goldberg concluded, “This acquisition is strategically significant for our group benefits consulting business overall, and particularly given our growth aspirations in Western Canada. Partnering with firms that are a strong cultural fit, and that share the same relentless pursuit of client-focused solutions, will continue to be a focus for our firm. With strong access to capital, and a reputation for working with partners to achieve synergistic outcomes, we are well-positioned for ongoing growth.”\nAbout People Corporation\nPeople Corporation is a national provider of group benefits, group retirement and human resource services.
