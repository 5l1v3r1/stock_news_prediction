We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of our performance. It is commonly used to analyze and compare media companies based on operating performance, leverage and liquidity. Nonetheless, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indication of our financial performance, an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of liquidity. Other companies may compute Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner; therefore, Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as we report it.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA over Total Revenues.\nInvestor Relations Contacts\nIn Buenos Aires:\nIn London:\nIn New York:\nAgustín Medina Manson\nPatricio Gentile\nAlex Money\nJasford IR\nMelanie Carpenter\nGrupo Clarín S.A.\nI-advize Corporate Communications\nTel: +54 11 4309 7215\nTel: +44 20 3289 5300\nTel: +1 212 406 3692\nEmail: investors@grupoclarin.com\nE-mail: alex@jasford.com\nE-mail: clarin@i-advize.com\n releases/grupo-clarin-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-1q18-300646807.html\nSOURCE Grupo Clarín S.A.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/grupo-clarin-announces-first-quarter-2018-results-1q18-300646807.html"], "published": "2018-05-11T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T04:31:30.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
