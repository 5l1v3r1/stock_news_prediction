Olsen Energy ( FOE.OL ), Odfjell Drilling ( ODLL.OL ), Rowan Companies ( RDC.N ), Maersk Drilling ( MAERSKb.CO ) and Seadrill ( SDRL.OL ).\nOil companies, including Equinor ( EQNR.OL ), Eni ( ENI.MI ), Aker BP ( AKERBP.OL ) and Lundin Petroleum ( LUPE.ST ) rent rigs to search for hydrocarbon reserves off Norway.
