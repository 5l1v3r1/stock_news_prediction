(CSE:NP) (Frankfurt:4NP) (“ New Point ” or the “ Company ”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an Exploration Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement with Majuba Hill LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the “Owner”), for the Majuba Hill Copper Project. The copper porphyry prospect is located 70 miles southwest of Winnemucca, Nevada and 156 miles from Reno. The Owner has granted to New Point the exclusive option and right to acquire ownership of the property (the “Option”) for the final purchase price of USD$4,000,000 and a series of minimum payments.\nMajuba Hill Copper Property, Nevada\nBryn Gardener-Evans, President & CEO commented: “We are extremely pleased to add this past-producing copper project to New Point’s portfolio. Majuba Hill reportedly produced 2.8 million pounds of copper, and the data for Majuba Hill indicates a target for a potentially large mineralized body with encouraging porphyry copper and silver – tin type mineralization. Only a small portion of the property has been drill tested, with significant intervals that included 113m at 0.45% copper, and 47m at 1.06%. Our aim is to follow up on both the upper oxide and deeper sulphide targets at Majuba Hill with a comprehensive technical program as soon as possible.”\nSmall scale historic mining concentrated on the Majuba fault zone and the veins in subordinate structures. Historic underground mining on the property produced 2.8 million lbs of copper; 184,000 ounces of silver; 885,800 lbs lead; 106,000 lbs zinc; 21,000 lbs tin; and 5,800 ounces of placer and lode gold between 1907 and 1960. * 1\nOxide copper-silver veins are found in the upper part of the system while at depth, quartz-sulfide stockwork veinlets, porphyry copper style, are more predominant. Between 2007 and the present, 35 holes with a total of 18,584 feet were drilled at Majuba. Prior to this, 28 holes with a total of 23,316 feet were drilled between 1920 and 1975, most of it by Mine Finders in the early 1970’s. Drilling has shown significant intercepts of low grade copper and silver in both oxide and sulfide mineralization as seen below in a summary table.\nSignificant drill intercepts - Majuba Hill Project\nCopper (0.04% Cutoff)\nSilver (3 g/t Cutoff) Gold (0.050 g/t Cutoff) Hole From-m To-m Interval-m Grade % Hole From-m To-m Interval-m Grade g/t Hole From-m To-m Interval-m Grade g/t MM-02 0.0 41.1 41.1 0.08 % Silver MM-02 1.7 68.6 66.8 4.78 MM-02 50.3 122.8 72.5 0.38 % MM-02 68.6 122.8 54.2 13.97 MM-05 0.27 % Silver MM-05 2.4 89.2 89.2 16.53 MM-06 0.0 47.4 47.4 1.06 % Silver MM-06 0.0 119.7 119.7 32.18 Gold MM-06 4.6 35.1 30.5 0.16 MM-07 18.3 93.0 74.7 0.11 % Silver MM-07 4.6 146.3 141.8 22.10 Gold MM-07 64 131.1 67.1 0.25 MM-07 98.1 129.5 31.4 0.37 % MM-15 125.0 163.1 38.1 0.08 % Silver MM-15 118.9 167.6 48.8 9.22 MM-15 192.0 254.5 62.5 0.07 % MM-16 13.7 59.4 45.7 0.08 % Gold MM-16 47.244 65.5 18.3 0.17 Silver MM-17 0.0 160.0 160.0 9.21 Silver MM-17 44.2 94.5 50.3 15.20 Silver MM-17 100.6 131.1 30.5 13.84 MM-20 146.3 323.9 177.6 0.13 % Silver MM-20 115.8 323.9 208.1 6.01 Gold MM-20 76.2 114.3 38.1 0.17 MM-20 Gold MM-20 207.3 323.9 116.6 0.15 MM-21 160.0 344.4 184.4 0.18 % Silver MM-21 12.2 231.6 219.5 12.47 MM-21 Silver MM-21 236.2 347.5 111.3 11.29 MMX-24 150.9 207.3 56.4 0.10 % Silver MMX-24 24.4 362.7 338.3 8.50 Not Assayed MMX-24 222.5 335.3 112.8 0.45 % Not Assayed MH-10 56.4 91.4 35.1 0.14 Silver MH-10 57.9 100.6 42.7 7.09 Gold MH-10 161.544 172.2 10.7 0.10 Silver MH-10 143.3 217.9 74.7 10.92 Gold MH-10 179.832 187.5 7.6 0.13 Silver MH-10 227.1 281.9 54.9 9.13 MH-11 0.0 274.3 274.3 0.04 % Silver MH-11 0.0 274.3 274.3 7.25 Gold MH-11 0 274.3 274.3 0.13 MH-11 33.5 102.1 68.6 0.09 % Silver MH-11 16.8 120.4 103.6 10.85 Gold MH-11 47.244 48.8 1.5 6.44 Silver MH-11 125.0 163.1 38.1 5.66 Gold MH-11 53.34 54.9 1.5 0.33 MH-12 Silver MH-12 0.0 352.0 352.0 6.86 MH-12 157.0 187.5 30.5 0.12 % Silver MH-12 79.2 187.5 108.2 11.10 MF-01 216.4 371.9 155.4 0.163 % Silver MF-01 219.5 374.9 155.4 9.23 MF-01 219.5 353.6 134.1 0.244 % Silver MF-01 304.8 338.3 33.5 13.45 Silver MF-02 0.0 388.3 388.3 4.72 MF-02 61.0 115.8 54.9 0.36 % Silver MF-02 42.7 134.1 91.4 13.60 Silver MF-03 0.0 1033.6 1033.6 3.04 MF-03 121.9 0.180 % Silver MF-03 100.6 298.7 198.1 5.20 MF-03 100.6 0.092 % Silver MF-03 667.5 765.0 97.5 5.09 MF-04 Silver MF-04 0.0 773.6 773.6 3.98 MF-04 3.0 67.1 64.0 0.06 % Silver MF-04 3.0 64.0 61.0 5.55 MF-05 658.4 725.4 67.1 0.190 % MF-05 MF-10 57.9 88.4 30.5 0.063 % MF-10 DDH-8 73.2 201.2 128.0 0.250 % Silver DDH-8 152.4 201.2 48.8 3.86 DSM-02 25.9 63.8 37.9 0.22 % Deal Terms\nNew Point shall pay the following minimum payments in US dollars to the Owner:\nOn the parties’ execution of the Agreement $50,000 250,000 shares First anniversary of Effective Date $50,000 250,000 shares Second anniversary of Effective Date $75,000 250,000 shares Third anniversary of the Effective Date $100,000 250,000 shares Fourth anniversary and each subsequent anniversary of the Effective Date $125,000 no shares The Minimum Payments shall not be credited against the Purchase Price if New Point elects to exercise the Option.

Each unit will consist of one common share and one half share purchase warrant. Each warrant will entitle the holder to acquire an additional share at a price of $0.35 for a period of one year from closing. The net proceeds of the financing will be used for exploration and development at the Majuba Hill property, project acquisition and exploration, and general working capital. The shares will have a hold date of four months and one day following the closing date.\nQualified Person\nTechnical aspects of this press release have been reviewed and approved by Mr. Eric Saderholm, P.Geo., the designated Qualified Person (QP) under National Instrument 43-101.\nData Verification\nDrill data verification was largely a matter of comparing the source files with the working files with an eye towards shifts in fields discussed in the geochemical data. Historical air photos and the field check were both used to verify drill sites, if not for the actual drill hole number, at least for checking that a hole was drilled at a certain location in the approximate time period indicated in the reports. The volume, shape and grade of the mineralized bodies at Majuba Hill have yet to be determined.\nMAX Resources drilled 5 core holes (MM-02, MM-03, MM-05, MM-06, and MM-07) to twin Minterra reverse circulation holes (MH-02, MH-03, MH-05, MH-06 and MH-07). The holes were collared within about 5 meters of each other and drilled at roughly the same azimuth (263 and 260 degrees) at 70° dip.\nAbout New Point Exploration Corp.\nNew Point (CSE: NP) is engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing mineral properties related to the growing battery industry.
