The new rules will increase gasoil consumption by close to 1 million barrel per day at the expense of the high-sulphur fuel oil that is typically used to power ship engines.\nSingapore, the world’s largest marine refuelling hub, became the first port to mandate the use of mass flow meters in 2017, making them compulsory for marine fuel oil bunker barges licensed by the MPA.
