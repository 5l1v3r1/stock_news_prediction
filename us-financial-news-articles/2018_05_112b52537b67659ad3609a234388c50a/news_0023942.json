His deep experience in Health Plan leadership will be instrumental in leading Diplomat in the rapidly evolving healthcare environment. On behalf of my fellow Board members, we look forward to the next stage of the Company's growth under Brian's leadership and are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead.\"\nAs Executive Vice President and CEO for IngenioRx, a role he assumed in March 2018, Mr. Griffin is responsible for building the IngenioRx organization, which will begin offering a full suite of PBM solutions starting in 2020. For the three years prior, Mr. Griffin served as Executive Vice President and President of Anthem's Commercial and Specialty Business Division. He joined Anthem in 2013 as President and CEO of the company's second largest affiliated health plan, Empire BlueCross BlueShield, a role he held for two years.
