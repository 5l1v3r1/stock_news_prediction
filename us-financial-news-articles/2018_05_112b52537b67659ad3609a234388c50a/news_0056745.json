But aid groups say the chaos of war means few will be able to do so in the time specified. The law has yet to be applied.\nBassil, whose country hosts more than a million Syrian refugees, voiced concern over the limited time frame given for refugees to prove possession of their properties.\n“The inability of the refugees to practically present what proves their possession (of their properties) during the given time limit might lead to them losing their properties and their sense of national identity,” Bassil said in the letter, according to a Foreign Ministry statement.\n“This would deprive them of one of the main incentives for their come return to Syria,” he added, echoing comments earlier this week by Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.\nHariri said the law “tells thousands of Syrian families to stay in Lebanon” by threatening them with property confiscation.\nBassil sent a similar letter to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, calling for action to protect the rights of Syrian refugees in maintaining their properties.\nReporting by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by Helen Popper\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T13:19:10.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
