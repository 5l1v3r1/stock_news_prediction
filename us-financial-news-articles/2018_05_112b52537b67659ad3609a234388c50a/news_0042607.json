As volatility returned during the fourth quarter, our private holdings proved resilient, adding significant value,” Chief Executive Mark Machin said in a statement.\nThe fund has diversified internationally, becoming one of the world’s biggest investors in infrastructure and real estate.\nIt is also a major global investor in equities and bonds, with most of its earnings derived from overseas.\n$1 = 1.2778 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:21:10.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
