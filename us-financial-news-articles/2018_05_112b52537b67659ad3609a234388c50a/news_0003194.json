The agreement seeks to keep increases in the planet’s average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius.\nThe bloc aims to reduce its carbon emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, with a 60 percent drop by 2040.\nWhile the 2008 financial crisis had a dampening effect on industrial activity, recent increases in economic growth have been accompanied by higher emissions of carbon.
