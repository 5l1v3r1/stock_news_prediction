Yields on U.S. benchmark 10-year notes and 30-year yields slid to two-week lows, while those on two-year noted fell to a one-week trough. The Labor Department said U.S. non-farm payrolls grew by 164,000, lower than market expectations for a rise of 192,000 jobs. Average earnings growth, a closely-monitored inflation indicator, grew by just 0.1 percent in April after rising 0.3 percent the previous month. \"This is not enough for the Fed to pause. They will still hike in the June meeting,\" said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist, at Schwab Center for Financial Research in New York. \"If people were worried about a faster pace of hike, this report should calm those ...The curve will likely resume its flattening bias in the long term, but it wonâ€™t invert in the foreseeable future,\" he added. In morning trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year yields fell to 2.914 percent from 2.946 percent late on Thursday. U.S. 30-year bonds slid to 3.089 percent, from Thursday's 3.121 percent. U.S. two-year yields were also down at 2.480 percent, from 2.484 percent on Thursday. The yield curve flattened again after the report, with the spread between U.S. 2-year and 10-year notes contracting to 43.90 basis points, the tightest in two weeks. The flattening yield curve is being driven by doubts among investors that inflation will pick up over the long term.
