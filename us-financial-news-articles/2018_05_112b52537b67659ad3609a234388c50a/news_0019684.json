(Nasdaq:ECYT), a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted therapeutics for personalized cancer treatment, today announced financial results for the first quarter ending Mar. 31, 2018 and provided an operational update.\n“We made important progress during the first quarter in establishing the design of our phase 3 VISION trial of 177 Lu-PSMA-617, securing clinical supply of no-carrier-added Lutetium, and raising sufficient capital to fund the company through expected completion of the trial,” said Mike Sherman, president and CEO of Endocyte. “We continue to expect the first patient visit in the VISION trial in the second quarter and are working to advance EC17/CAR T-cell therapy, our folate-targeted CAM-based therapy, for which we expect to have an IND submitted in the fourth quarter of 2018.”\nMr. Sherman continued, “In addition, we are encouraged by the updated 30 patient data from the ongoing phase 2 trial at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia, published today in The Lancet Oncology . We anticipate an update at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June with early data on the additional 20 patients dosed in the expansion phase of that trial. Enrollment also continues in the phase 2 TheraP trial in Australia comparing 177 Lu-PSMA-617 to cabazitaxel in 200 patients.”\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nFinalized the design for the phase 3 VISION trial evaluating 177 Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) following a successful End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Announced an agreement with ITM Isotopen Technologien München AG to supply no-carrier-added Lutetium ( 177 Lu) to support the phase 3 VISION trial. Presented data on the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) adaptor molecule (CAM) platform at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2018 confirming the anti-tumor activity of Endocyte’s folate-targeted EC17/CAR T-cell therapy. Completed an underwritten registered public offering of 20,535,714 shares of its common stock, including full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $4.20 per share. Endocyte received aggregate net proceeds from the offering of approximately $80.9 million. Hired additional experienced clinical trial professionals to ensure strong execution and support the success of its clinical programs. Elected Patrick Machado, J.D., co-founder and former chief business and financial officer of Medivation, and Dawn Svoronos, former president of Merck’s Europe/Canada region, to serve on the Board of Directors, bringing significant commercial leadership and understanding of the prostate cancer market to the Board.\nExpected 2018 Milestones\nFirst patient visit for phase 3 VISION trial of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC (2Q 2018). 50-patient response rate data readout of investigator-initiated trial of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia, to be presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (June 2018). Publications on additional ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 in prostate cancer patients (2018). IND for phase 1 trial of EC17/CAR T-cell therapy in patients with osteosarcoma (4Q 2018).\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nEndocyte reported a net loss of $8.6 million, or $0.16 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.0 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a strategic portfolio review announced in June 2017 which led to a reduction in workforce and the discontinuation of certain research and development activities, including: a decrease of $1.4 million in expenses related to pre-clinical work and general research, including the development of EC2629; a decrease of $0.8 million in EC1169 trial expenses; a decrease of $0.6 million in EC1456 trial expenses; a decrease of $0.5 million in compensation expense as a result of employee terminations since March 31, 2017, and a decrease of $0.4 million in manufacturing expense for EC1169 and EC1456. These decreases were partially offset by: an increase of $0.8 million in expenses related to development of PSMA-617; and an increase of $0.2 million related to our CAR T-cell therapy program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, which were consistent with the $3.7 million of expenses for the same period in 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents and investments were $173.1 million at Mar. 31, 2018, compared to $127.6 million at Mar. 31, 2017, and $97.5 million at Dec. 31, 2017. Cash, cash equivalents and investments of $173.1 million at Mar. 31, 2018 included $80.9 million of net proceeds from our public offering of 20,535,714 shares of our common stock that closed in March 2018.\nFinancial Expectations\nThe company anticipates its cash, cash equivalents and investments balance at the end of 2018 to exceed $130 million. Based on current operational assumptions, Endocyte has sufficient cash to fund its activities through the expected end of the VISION trial and potential proof of concept of its EC17/CAR T-cell therapy.\nConference Call\nEndocyte management will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\nU.S. and Canadian participants:\nInternational:\n(877) 845-0711\n(760) 298-5081 A live, listen-only webcast of the conference call may be accessed by visiting the Investors & News section of the Endocyte website, www.endocyte.com .\nThe webcast will be recorded and available on the company's website for 90 days following the call.\nWebsite Information\nEndocyte routinely posts important information for investors on its website, www.endocyte.com , in the “Investors & News” section.
