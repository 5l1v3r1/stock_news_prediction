(Nasdaq:ICPT), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases, today announced its financial results 2018.\n“We progress to date in 2018, as we continue to work to strengthen our leadership position in NASH and remain on track for the top line readout of data from our Phase 3 REGENERATE trial in the first half of 2019. Based on our review of the evolving competitive landscape, the new data released at the recent International Liver Congress in Paris and the strength of OCA’s Phase 2 and other data, we continue to believe in OCA’s significant potential in NASH,” said Mark Pruzanski, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Intercept. “In addition, we are encouraged by the recent momentum we have seen in our Ocaliva PBC business, where our team remains focused on both education and execution given the sizeable unmet medical need for this important therapy.”\nRecent Developments\nIn April 2018, we issued and sold 2,695,313 shares of our common stock in a registered public offering at a price to the public of $64.00 per share. Our Chief Executive Officer and certain members of our board of directors participated in the public offering at the price offered to the public and on the same terms as the other purchasers in the public offering. Concurrently with the public offering, we issued and sold, in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 1,562,500 shares of our common stock to our largest existing stockholder, Genextra S.p.A., Samsara BioCapital, L.P. and certain other purchasers at a sale price equal to the price to the public in the public offering. We received net proceeds from the public offering and concurrent private placement of approximately $261.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses of approximately $11.1 million.\nOcaliva® (obeticholic acid or OCA) Commercial Highlights\nWe recorded $35.2 million of Ocaliva net sales in the first quarter of 2018, comprised of U.S. Ocaliva net sales of $28.5 million and ex-U.S. Ocaliva net sales of $6.7 million.\nOcaliva was approved in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in May 2016 for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (“UDCA”) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. We commenced sales and marketing of Ocaliva in the United States shortly after receiving marketing approval, and Ocaliva is now available to patients primarily through a network of specialty pharmacy distributors. In February 2018, the Ocaliva label in the United States was updated to include a boxed warning and a dosing table that reinforced the existing dosing schedule in PBC patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C or decompensated cirrhosis.\nOcaliva was granted conditional approval by the European Commission in December 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA, and we commenced our European commercial launch in January 2017. Since January 2017, Ocaliva has also received regulatory approval in several of our target markets outside Europe, including Canada and Israel. We have been working with the European Medicines Agency and other relevant regulatory authorities outside the United States since the FDA’s February 2018 Ocaliva label update to harmonize the Ocaliva label outside the United States and ensure that it sufficiently reinforces the importance of appropriate dosing in PBC patients with advanced cirrhosis.\nSelected First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues\nWe recognized $36.0 million in total revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, including $35.2 million of Ocaliva net sales and $0.8 million of licensing revenue related to the amortization of upfront payments under our license agreement with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd.\nOperating Expenses\nOur cost of sales was $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. Prior to the FDA’s approval of Ocaliva, we expensed costs related to the manufacturing and buildup of our Ocaliva commercial launch supplies. As a result, our cost of sales in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included only packaging and labeling expenses incurred during the quarter. We expect our cost of sales to remain negligible until the previously expensed supplies of Ocaliva are sold.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $62.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up from $61.1 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related costs to support our continued commercial and international Ocaliva initiatives.\nResearch and development expenses increased to $48.7 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up from $43.8 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by increases in OCA research and development activities, partially offset by decreases in compensation-related and other costs.\nIn the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we recorded $111.4 million in total operating expenses and $97.8 million in non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $12.3 million and depreciation expense of $1.3 million. References in this press release to “non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses” mean our total operating expenses, as calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), adjusted for the effects of two non-cash items: stock-based compensation and depreciation. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses to total operating expenses for all historical periods presented is included below under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses to Total Operating Expenses”.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $7.5 million. Our interest expense is related to the $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Convertible Notes”) that we issued in July 2016.\nNet Loss\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we reported a net loss of $81.6 million.\nCash Position\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale of approximately $326.1 million, compared to $414.9 million as of December 31, 2017. Subsequently, in April 2018, we completed a public offering and concurrent private placement of our common stock. We received net proceeds from the public offering and concurrent private placement of approximately $261.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses of approximately $11.1 million.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nBased on our first quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of 2018, we are announcing a 2018 Ocaliva net sales guidance range of between $170 million and $185 million. In addition, we are confirming our previously announced 2018 non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses guidance range of between $390 million and $410 million. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. A quantitative reconciliation of projected non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses to total operating expenses is not available without unreasonable effort primarily due to our inability to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of future stock-based compensation expense.\nConference Call on May 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET\nWe are hosting our first quarter 2018 financial results conference call and webcast on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET. The conference call will be available on the investor page of our website at http://ir.interceptpharma.com or by calling (855) 232-3919 (toll-free domestic) or (315) 625-6894 (international) five minutes prior to the start time (no passcode is required). A replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the completion of the call and will be available for two weeks.\nAbout Intercept\nIntercept is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and biliary atresia. Founded in 2002 in New York, Intercept has operations in the United States, Europe and Canada.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release presents non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses on a historical and projected basis. For the periods presented, non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses exclude from total operating expenses, as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, the effects of two non-cash items: stock-based compensation and depreciation. Non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses is a financial measure that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, investors should consider non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in addition to, but not as a substitute for, total operating expenses that we calculate and present in accordance with GAAP. Among other things, our management uses non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses to establish budgets and operational goals and to manage our business. Other companies may define or use this measure in different ways. We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses provides investors and management with helpful supplemental information relating to operating performance and trends. A table reconciling non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses to total operating expenses for all historical periods presented is included below under the heading “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses to Total Operating Expenses”. A quantitative reconciliation of projected non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses to total operating expenses is not available without unreasonable effort primarily due to our inability to predict with reasonable certainty the amount of future stock-based compensation expense.\nAbout Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid)\nOcaliva is indicated in the United States for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on a reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a surrogate endpoint which is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, including an improvement in liver transplant free-survival. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. We are conducting a Phase 4 clinical outcomes trial, which we refer to as our COBALT trial, of OCA in patients with PBC with the goal of confirming clinical benefit on a post-marketing basis. In December 2016, Ocaliva received conditional marketing authorization in Europe for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA, conditioned upon us providing further data post-approval to confirm benefit. For detailed safety information for Ocaliva 5 mg and 10 mg tablets including posology and method of administration, special warnings, drug interactions and adverse drug reactions, please see the European Summary of Product Characteristics that can be found on www.ema.europa.eu.\nU.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWARNING: HEPATIC DECOMPENSATION AND FAILURE IN INCORRECTLY DOSED PBC PATIENTS WITH CHILD-PUGH CLASS B OR C OR DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS\nIn postmarketing reports, hepatic decompensation and failure, in some cases fatal, have been reported in patients with Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) with decompensated cirrhosis or Child-Pugh Class B or C hepatic impairment when OCALIVA was dosed more frequently than recommended. The recommended starting dosage of OCALIVA is 5 mg once weekly for patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C hepatic impairment or a prior decompensation event.\nContraindications\nOCALIVA is contraindicated in patients with complete biliary obstruction.\nWarnings and Precautions\nHepatic Decompensation and Failure in Incorrectly-Dosed PBC Patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C or Decompensated Cirrhosis\nIn postmarketing reports, hepatic decompensation and failure, in some cases fatal, have been reported in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or Child-Pugh B or C hepatic impairment when OCALIVA was dosed more frequently than the recommended starting dosage of 5 mg once weekly. Reported cases typically occurred within 2 to 5 weeks after starting OCALIVA and were characterized by an acute increase in total bilirubin and/or ALP concentrations in association with clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening of hepatic encephalopathy).\nRoutinely monitor patients for progression of PBC disease, including liver-related complications, with laboratory and clinical assessments. Dosage adjustment, interruption or discontinuation may be required. Close monitoring is recommended for patients at an increased risk of hepatic decompensation. Severe intercurrent illnesses that may worsen renal function or cause dehydration (e.g., gastroenteritis), may exacerbate the risk of hepatic decompensation. Interrupt treatment with OCALIVA in patients with laboratory or clinical evidence of worsening liver function indicating risk of decompensation, and monitor the patient’s liver function. Consider discontinuing OCALIVA in patients who have experienced clinically significant liver-related adverse reactions. Discontinue OCALIVA in patients who develop complete biliary obstruction.\nLiver-Related Adverse Reactions\nDose-related, liver-related adverse reactions including jaundice, worsening ascites and primary biliary cholangitis flare have been observed in clinical trials, as early as one month after starting treatment with OCALIVA 10 mg once daily up to 50 mg once daily (up to 5-times the highest recommended dosage). Monitor patients during treatment with OCALIVA for elevations in liver biochemical tests and for the development of liver-related adverse reactions.\nSevere Pruritus\nSevere pruritus was reported in 23% of patients in the OCALIVA 10 mg arm, 19% of patients in the OCALIVA titration arm, and 7% of patients in the placebo arm in a 12-month double-blind randomized controlled trial of 216 patients. Severe pruritus was defined as intense or widespread itching, interfering with activities of daily living, or causing severe sleep disturbance, or intolerable discomfort, and typically requiring medical interventions. Consider clinical evaluation of patients with new onset or worsening severe pruritus. Management strategies include the addition of bile acid resins or antihistamines, OCALIVA dosage reduction, and/or temporary interruption of OCALIVA dosing.\nReduction in HDL-C\nPatients with PBC generally exhibit hyperlipidemia characterized by a significant elevation in total cholesterol primarily due to increased levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Dose-dependent reductions from baseline in mean HDL-C levels were observed at 2 weeks in OCALIVA-treated patients, 20% and 9% in the 10 mg and titration arms, respectively, compared to 2% in the placebo arm. Monitor patients for changes in serum lipid levels during treatment. For patients who do not respond to OCALIVA after 1 year at the highest recommended dosage that can be tolerated (maximum of 10 mg once daily), and who experience a reduction in HDL-C, weigh the potential risks against the benefits of continuing treatment.\nAdverse Reactions\nThe most common adverse reactions from subjects taking OCALIVA were pruritus, fatigue, abdominal pain and discomfort, rash, oropharyngeal pain, dizziness, constipation, arthralgia, thyroid function abnormality, and eczema.\nDrug Interactions\nBile Acid Binding Resins\nBile acid binding resins such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam adsorb and reduce bile acid absorption and may reduce the absorption, systemic exposure, and efficacy of OCALIVA. If taking a bile acid binding resin, take OCALIVA at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after taking the bile acid binding resin, or at as great an interval as possible.\nWarfarin\nThe International Normalized Ratio (INR) decreased following coadministration of warfarin and OCALIVA. Monitor INR and adjust the dose of warfarin, as needed, to maintain the target INR range when coadministering OCALIVA and warfarin.\nCYP1A2 Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index\nObeticholic acid, the active ingredient in OCALIVA, may increase the exposure to concomitant drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates. Therapeutic monitoring of CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. theophylline and tizanidine) is recommended when coadministered with OCALIVA.\nInhibitors of Bile Salt Efflux Pump\nAvoid concomitant use of inhibitors of the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP) such as cyclosporine. Concomitant medications that inhibit canalicular membrane bile acid transporters such as the BSEP may exacerbate accumulation of conjugated bile salts including taurine conjugate of obeticholic acid in the liver and result in clinical symptoms. If concomitant use is deemed necessary, monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin.\nPlease see Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING and Medication Guide for OCALIVA.\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-782-ICPT or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains , including, but not limited to, statements regarding the progress, timing and results of our clinical trials, including our clinical trials for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), the safety and efficacy of our approved product, Ocaliva (obeticholic acid or “OCA”), the potential approval of OCA for indications other than primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”), the timing and potential commercial success of OCA and any other product candidates we may develop and our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, financial guidance, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth.\nThese statements constitute within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
