The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, headed for its largest weekly increase in a month, as the market prepared for potential disruption to crude flows from major exporter Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions.\nU.S. crude prices were up 0.1 percent at $71.24 a\nbarrel.\nThe U.S. dollar extended losses against a basket of\nmajor currencies after the consumer price data. Some investors have been expecting an acceleration in inflation to allow the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates faster. At 9:10 a.m. EDT (1310 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 0.7 percent higher at C$1.2766 to the greenback, or 78.33 U.S. cents. The currency touched its strongest level since April 20 at C$1.2743. The loonie has rebounded as much as 2 percent since hitting on Tuesday a nearly seven week low at C$1.2998. Canadian new home prices were unchanged in March, as expected, as higher prices in Ottawa were offset by a weaker Toronto market, data from Statistics Canada showed. Canadian government bond prices were higher across a flatter yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year rose 1 Canadian cent to yield 1.953 percent and the\n10-year gained 13 Canadian cents to yield 2.379\npercent. The 2-year yield touched its highest intraday since June 2011 at 1.964 percent. Canada's jobs report for April is due on Friday.\n(Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T04:33:07.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
