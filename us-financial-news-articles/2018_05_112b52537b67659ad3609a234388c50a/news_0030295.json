They should not take the law into their hands... they should have arrested him if he was a suspect,” he said. Mudanya was working as a tout on public minibuses in the area before he was killed, his father said.\nLocal media quoted the police as saying they had shot dead a suspect identified as Shimoli Junior soon after Mudanya was killed. Police had accused Shimoli of attacking sports men and fans in a stadium in the area.\nOkong’o said he had reported the killing at a police station and with the Independent policing oversight authority (IPOA). IPOA was not immediately available for comment.\nState-funded IPOA was established by the government in 2011, after police were blamed for the deaths of dozens of protesters in violent following a disputed presidential election in 2007.\nBut it has only managed to secure a handful of convictions against accused policemen despite numerous complaints against the police from the public.
