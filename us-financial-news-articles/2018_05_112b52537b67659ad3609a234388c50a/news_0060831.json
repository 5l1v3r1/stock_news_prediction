Jose Abreu supplied four hits, including a homer, while scoring twice and driving in two runs. Daniel Palka added a homer and two RBIs for Chicago.\nWhite Sox starter Hector Santiago (1-2) lasted the minimum five innings to pick up his first win of the season. He gave up three runs (two earned) on seven hits and struck out five.\nJeimer Candelario had his first career multi-homer game while scoring three runs and driving in three more for the Tigers.\nTigers starter Francisco Liriano (3-2) surrendered five runs on six hits and struck out eight in five-plus innings.\nAnderson’s throwing error in the first helped the Tigers gain a 2-0 lead in the first. Nicholas Castellanos reached on the miscue and Candelario followed with his first homer of the game, a blast to left-center.\nThe White Sox broke through against Liriano in the third. Anderson drew a one-out walk and scored on Abreu’s two-out double to left.\nCandelario gave the Tigers a 3-1 advantage in the bottom of the inning with a one-out long ball to left.\nChicago flexed its muscles in the fifth to tie it. With one out Anderson smashed his first homer of the game and, one out later, Abreu went deep to the opposite field.\nThe Tigers left two runners on base in the bottom of the inning. The White Sox then scored four runs in the sixth to grab a 7-3 lead.\nPalka led off the inning with a shot that cleared the right-field wall. Yoan Moncada’s single ended Liriano’s day. Louis Coleman entered and gave up a single to Adam Engel. Coleman retired the next two batters before Anderson drilled a no-doubter over the left-field fence.\nAbreu’s second double of the game and Palka’s RBI single made it 8-3 in the seventh.\nDetroit scored an unearned run in the ninth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-27T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:39:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
