Sixty percent of the backlog will be produced for customers during 2018 and 2019, it said.\n“Many countries have already committed to spend more on defence and that creates a big opportunity,” CEO Bezhalel Machlis told Reuters, noting defence spending is on the rise in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific. “The company is growing and this trend will continue.”\nMachlis said the company also hopes to soon complete its 1.8 billion shekel ($502 million) purchase of weapons maker IMI from the Israeli government, which would expand Elbit’s portfolio.\nThe Israeli government has said it expects to complete the sale of IMI by July 1, pending antitrust approval. The deal will likely make Elbit the country’s biggest defence contractor.\nLast month Elbit also completed its purchase of U.S.-based Universal Avionics Systems for $120 million.\nMachlis said he expects revenue from the Avionics deal to be reflected in second-quarter results as Elbit strengthens its position in the commercial aviation market.\n“Acquisitions are part of our strategy and our balance sheet enables us to do it,” he said. “We look for technologies to enhance our portfolio and market positions.”\nAt the same time, Elbit is boosting spending on research and development, he said.\nElbit declared a dividend of 44 cents per share for the first quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter.\nIts shares are up 2.1 percent in late morning trading in Tel Aviv, although they are down 10 percent since the start of 2018.
