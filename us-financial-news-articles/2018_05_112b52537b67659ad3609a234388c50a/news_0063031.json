It also held its growth forecasts steady for next year.\nThe central bank projected the economy would grow between 2 percent and 3 percent in 2018, with fourth-quarter inflation forecast at around 3.8 percent, down from 4.3 percent in the third quarter.\nCentral Bank Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon later said that because growth had been stronger than expected in the first quarter of 2018, there were grounds for optimism.\n“Given that good result in the first quarter, growth for the full year will probably be at the upper end of the 2-3 percent range,” Diaz de Leon told local radio.\nMexico’s economy grew by 1.1 percent during the January-March period in comparison to the previous quarter, official data showed last week.\nThe bank noted its estimates were based on the assumption the next administration would preserve the country’s commitment to “solid” economic policies and sound public finances as well as policies to promote investment and productivity growth.\nMexico holds its presidential election on July 1, with leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador holding a strong lead in opinion polls.\nGovernor Diaz de Leon said the election was one of the risks to economic growth the bank was eyeing.\nA poll by Nomura on Wednesday showed 70 percent of Mexican banks and funds thought Lopez Obrador would significantly change economic policy if elected.\nBut 71 percent of foreign-based respondents thought the changes to economic policy would only be marginal.\nAmong risks to growth and inflation, Mexico’s policymakers are also watching the outcome of talks to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, the United States and Canada, the central bank said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to rip up NAFTA if it is not renegotiated to his liking. Diaz de Leon said, however, that termination of the agreement was not a central scenario for the central bank.
