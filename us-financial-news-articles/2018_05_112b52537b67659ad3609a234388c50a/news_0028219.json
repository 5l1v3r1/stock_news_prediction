Cohen currently is under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in New York.\nGleason's disclosure came four days after Schneiderman resigned hours after a New Yorker article detailed his physical abuse of several women.\nGleason said that he was originally contacted by two women, the first in 2012 and the second in 2013, who separately told him that Schneiderman was sexually inappropriate with them.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the New York Attorney General's office or a lawyer for Cohen.\nThe office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which is overseeing the Cohen probe, declined to comment.\nGleason said that he mentioned the women's allegation in the summer of 2013 to former New York Post columnist Steve Dunleavy, who, the lawyer said, immediately offered to tell Trump. show chapters 1 Hour Ago | 04:15\nIn his letter to Judge Wood, Gleason wrote, \"Mr. Dunleavy did indeed discuss this very matter with Mr. Trump as evidenced by the phone call I received from Attorney Michael Cohen.\"\nBut Dunleavy denied this account â€“ telling CNBC on Friday that he didn't talk to Trump about the matter after Gleason had told him about the two women.\n\"I didn't talk to Trump about this,\" Dunleavy said over the phone from the Florida Keys.
