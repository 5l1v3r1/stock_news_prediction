The violence has tapered off since but there are still sporadic flare-ups.\nSince the border protests began, 113 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, Gaza medical officials said. Most of the participants on Friday kept their distance and remained about 800 metres from the fence. Dozens of youths, however, advanced to around 300 meters distance and burned tyres at one protest spot. East of Gaza City some youths came right up to the fence and tried to pull it apart.\nIsraeli troops fired tear gas and live rounds. Soldiers also fired at kites with flaming tails to try to bring them down before they landed in Israeli farmland and set crops alight.\nGaza health ministry officials said at least 109 protesters were hurt. Medics said at least 10 were wounded by live rounds.\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh and the group’s Gaza leader, Yehya Al-Sinwar, joined separate protest encampments raising cheers from the assembled crowds.\n“The marches of return are not over. They may be smaller but we are continuing,” said Ali, a participant who masked his face with his t-shirt at a protest east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.\nProtesters dispersed as dusk fell to prepare to break their daytime fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\nGaza has been controlled since 2007 by the Islamist group Hamas. Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns, maintain a de facto blockade on Gaza, which has reduced its economy to a state of collapse.\nIsrael has blamed Hamas for provoking the violence.\n“They’re pushing civilians – women, children – into the line of fire with a view of getting casualties. We try to minimize casualties. They’re trying to incur casualties in order to put pressure on Israel, which is horrible,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CBS News last week.\nSalah al-Bardaweel, a Hamas official in Gaza, told a Palestinian television channel that the majority of those killed on May 14 were Hamas members.
