They should not take the law into their hands... they should have arrested him if he was a suspect,” he said. Mudanya was working as a tout on public minibuses in the area before he was killed, his father said.\nLocal media Quote: d the police as saying they had shot dead a suspect identified as Shimoli Junior soon after Mudanya was killed. Police had accused Shimoli of attacking sports men and fans in a stadium in the area.\nOkong’o said he had reported the killing at a police station and with the Independent policing oversight authority (IPOA). IPOA was not immediately available for comment.\nState-funded IPOA was established by the government in 2011, after police were blamed for the deaths of dozens of protesters in violent following a disputed presidential election in 2007.\nBut it has only managed to secure a handful of convictions against accused policemen despite numerous complaints against the police from the public.\nReporting by Humphrey MalaloEditing by\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T17:24:50.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
