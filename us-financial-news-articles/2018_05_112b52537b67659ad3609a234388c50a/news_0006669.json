They not just impact soil, but water, the aquatic system and human health.”\nSoil pollution is a poorly understood, but growing, problem, experts said, with some countries increasing their pesticide use, while the risks of new pollutants, such as waste from old electronics and plastics, are only just being acknowledged.\nClean ups can cost millions of dollars, a huge burden for developing countries, short of both money and manpower to make their soils safe, Naidu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe world has only cleaned up about 10 percent of contaminated sites in about half a century, he added, calling for more regulation and a global accord on contaminants, similar to the Paris Agreement to combat climate change.\nWithout a systematic global assessment of soil pollution, it is hard for nations to understand the scale and severity of the threat, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.\n“We know it’s a problem but it has been difficult to quantify,” said Marco Martuzzi, an environmental expert with the World Health Organization, which is assessing the health impacts of landfills in Europe.\n“When we have acute effects like children dying and contamination that goes through the food chain ... It’s not an acceptable situation.”\nReporting by Thin Lei Win. Editing by Katy Migiro.
