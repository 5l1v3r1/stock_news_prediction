(Nasdaq:FISI) (the “Company”), parent company of Five Star Bank, Scott Danahy Naylon, LLC (“Scott Danahy Naylon”) and Courier Capital, LLC (“Courier Capital”), announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HNP Capital, LLC (“HNP”). HNP is an SEC-registered investment advisory, wealth management and family office services firm based in Pittsford, New York.\nHNP offers investment management, retirement plan services, alternative investments, financial planning and family office services to more than 250 clients. HNP was founded in 2009 by John R. Piccirilli, Chris Hobaica and Nick Norvell, who will continue to manage the firm’s assets after closing. As of March 31, 2018, HNP had approximately $334 million of assets under management.\n“This transaction demonstrates a continued commitment to our long-term strategy of diversifying revenue,” said Martin K. Birmingham, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “It also fills an existing geographic gap in our wealth management business by providing coverage of Rochester and the eastern side of our operating footprint. Courier Capital already provides strong coverage of Buffalo and the western portion of our market. We anticipate significant operating synergies between HNP and Courier Capital, as well as with Five Star Bank. The team at HNP has built a terrific wealth management platform and we look forward to adding them to our organization.”\nJohn Piccirilli, Co-Founder and Principal of HNP commented, “We are very pleased to become part of Financial Institutions, Inc. We are a sales-minded team and believe there will be significant opportunities for growth of our wealth management business. We also believe we will add value to the Company’s other businesses through our existing relationships.”\nThe transaction is subject to typical conditions to closing, and is expected to be completed on or about June 1, 2018. Upon closing of the acquisition, HNP will operate as a subsidiary of Financial Institutions, Inc. and an affiliate of Five Star Bank, Scott Danahy Naylon and Courier Capital.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements as defined by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
