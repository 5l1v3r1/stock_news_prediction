Under ICE rules, coffee stocks are subject to age discounts after 13 months.\nHolding certified stocks is also strategically attractive and paying to roll the stocks forward was an “investment,” the source said.\n“There’s still a level of control that’s exerted when you own the stocks,” the source said. “It’s a value judgment. The people who took delivery were making an investment that Dreyfus wasn’t willing to make at that price point.\nReporting by Ana Ionova; Additional reporting by Gus Trompiz in Paris; Editing by Nigel Hunt and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:40:32.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
