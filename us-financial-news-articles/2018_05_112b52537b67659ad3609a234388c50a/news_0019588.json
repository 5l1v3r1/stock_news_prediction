Net sales rose 47%, driven by a 41% increase attributable to acquisitions and a 6% gain in AMVAC’s traditional base business. Our domestic sales experienced solid performance from granular soil insecticides, herbicides, and soil fumigants. Further, our international business grew significantly with the inclusion of AgriCenter’s Central American franchise.”\nMr. Wintemute continued, “Gross profit increased as a result of improved factory performance, organic growth in the Company’s sales and the addition of products and businesses acquired during 2017. As we anticipated in our last conference call, gross margins decreased slightly due to a product mix influenced by the AgriCenter distribution business. Our operating expenses declined as a percentage of sales, but rose on an absolute basis, as we integrated acquired businesses, made new product introductions, funded regulatory defense of important products, incurred bulk freight costs to meet strong soil fumigant demand and advanced the development of our SIMPAS precision application technology. With modest interest expenses and a reduced tax rate, we posted a 35% year-over-year increase in net income and a 27% increase in EBITDA, 2 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.”\nMr. Wintemute concluded, “During the balance of 2018, we expect continued growth in our herbicide products, our Central American region and our non-crop business. We also anticipate strong demand for our products in cotton, fruit and vegetables, strong sales of our Dibrom® mosquito adulticide in light of predicted Gulf Coast hurricane activity and stable demand for our corn products in spite of weather-related delays in Midwest planting. In addition, we are scheduled to introduce several new products from our development pipeline. We look forward to providing further detail on our financial performance, market outlook and future initiatives during our upcoming conference call.”\nConference Call\nEric Wintemute, Chairman & CEO, Bob Trogele EVP & COO and David T. Johnson, VP & CFO, will conduct a conference call focusing on the financial results at 4:30 pm ET / 1:30 pm PT on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.

Except for the historical information contained in this release, all are estimates by the Company’s management and are subject to various that may cause results to differ from management’s current expectations.

All , if any, in this release represent the Company’s judgment as of the date of this release.\n1 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The items excluded from EBITDA are detailed in the reconciliation attached to this news release. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define EBITDA differently. 2 The Company believes that use of EBITDA is useful to investors in that it is one of the primary bases upon which borrowing capacity is calculated under the Company’s senior credit facility, it gives investors a sense of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations without giving effect to the cost of increased acquisition activity in 2017 and it is commonly used by investors and others as a basis for supporting overall business valuations. Nevertheless, investors should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported in accordance with GAAP.
