To perform both of those functions well, the tiles have to look opaque from street level while remaining transparent to the sun. According to the patent, Tesla achieved this by designing a special louvered glass, which functions much the same way a window blind would.\nTesla patent application explains how its solar roof tiles work https://t.co/hHBUrOa8xX pic.twitter.com/jXdXMokTC4\n— Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) May 8, 2018\nBasically, when viewed from the street, the glass reflects light in such a way that the tile looks opaque, or like the broad side of a window blind, whereas from above, sun rays are clear to bake down between the narrow edges of a blind. Except, of course, it’s a lot more complicated than that.\nIf you want to see it for yourself, head down to your local Home Depot .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:15:27.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
