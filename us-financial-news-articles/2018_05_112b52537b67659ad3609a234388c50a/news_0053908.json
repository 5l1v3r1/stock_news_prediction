A spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the statement.\nHilco currently manages about 20 investments, with a combined turnover of over 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion). Previous restructuring projects include music retailer HMV, the UK arm of stationer Staples and home furnishings retailer Habitat.\nAnalysts at Jefferies said the Wesfarmers disposal was particularly good news for Kingfisher as Wickes is more oriented towards tradesmen.\n“Ultimately, the risk ahead of today was that Wesfarmers would be irrational and back a significant investment to rebrand Homebase stores into Bunnings,” they said, reiterating their “buy” recommendation.\nThey said Homebase under Hilco’s ownership would become “much more sensitive to short, and mid-term, margin and cashflow challenges.”\nOn Thursday Kingfisher said its quarterly sales were hit by winter snow storms which kept British and French shoppers at home.
