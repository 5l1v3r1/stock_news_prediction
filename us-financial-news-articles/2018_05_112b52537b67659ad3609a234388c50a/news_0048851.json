Morgan said in a note for investors.\nBorrowing costs for Italy have already spiked in past weeks as the government coalition moved closer to taking shape.\nThe European Commission also has tools to pressure member states not to let government deficits and public debts rise above set levels but senior officials acknowledge that these have often not been applied strictly - notably to France - and that they may not be strong enough to deter a new Italian government. CAUTION\nAt nearly 10 times the size of Greece’s economy and the third biggest in the euro zone, Italy is seen as far too big for Germany, France and the other 16 states in the euro to bail out.\nUneasy at the prospect of a stand-off with a government in Rome that knows that the whole euro area would suffer from a rerun of the Greek crisis on a grander scale, many of those attending tried to strike a conciliatory tone.\nEU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici and the German and French finance ministers welcomed comments by Conte that they interpreted as signalling a willingness to remain engaged with Rome’s European Union partners.\n“I’m convinced by history, by art, Italy will remain a very important member of the euro zone,” Frenchman Moscovici said.\n“I am going for a constructive dialogue,” he added, insisting that the European Commission would not lecture Rome.\nCountries with smaller economies were less lenient.\nThe Spanish and Irish finance ministers rushed to list their state’s economic strengths as reporters asked questions about the contagion risks of a potential Italian implosion.\nItaly’s small southern neighbour Malta also signalled alarm at the government’s proposed programme:\n“If ... it is just a question of spending and spending and borrowing and spending then unfortunately it will be a replay of Greece,” Maltese Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told reporters, referring to Athens’ effective bankruptcy in 2012.
