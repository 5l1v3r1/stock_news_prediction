We are excited to see continued same door NOI growth, led by Ontario and further improvements in Western Canada, combined with continued successful execution of our value creation initiatives.”\n“Our high-end renovation program continues to generate returns in excess of our targeted 15% to 20%. We have been steadily increasing the number of eligible properties as a result of strong market performance in Ontario, as well as recent acquisitions completed in 2017,” continued Mr. Cook.\nMr. Cook concluded, “We are looking forward to starting our first development in Ontario on the recently acquired land in Kitchener and beginning the second phase of our successful project in Calgary. We remain focused on creating value for our Unitholders through organic growth, growth from new developments, and future acquisition opportunities.”\nFinancial Performance Highlights\n(thousands of dollars, except per unit amounts) Three months ended\nMarch 31 2018 2017 Change Total revenue 88,004 80,949 8.7% Total NOI 47,528 42,338 12.3% NOI margin 54.0 % 52.3% 170 bps Same door NOI increase (decrease) 6.0 % (0.3%) 630 bps Occupancy 93.3 % 92.4% 90 bps Distributions declared per Trust Unit (i) $ 0.41 $0.41 - Measurement excluding Non-recurring Items (ii) : FFO – diluted 28,669 25,036 14.5% FFO per unit – diluted $ 0.49 $0.44 11.4% Funds from operations (“FFO”) is considered a non-GAAP measure and do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). See “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” disclosure below.\n(i) Trust Unit refers to the publicly traded Northview Trust Unit and the Class B LP Unit.\n(ii) See “Non-recurring Items” disclosure below.\nQ1 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nFFO\nDiluted FFO was $28.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $25.0 million for the same period in 2017. Diluted FFO per unit was $0.49 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 11.4% compared to $0.44 for the same period in 2017. The increases in FFO and FFO per unit were due to same door NOI growth, NOI contributions from acquisitions and newly developed properties completed since the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by non-core asset sales.\nSAME DOOR NOI GROWTH OF 6.0%\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, total same door NOI growth was 6.0%, compared to total same door NOI decrease of 0.3% for the same period in 2017. Same door NOI increased 6.9% for the multi-family business segment during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to an increase of 0.5% for the same period in 2017. The multi-family same door NOI increase was led by higher AMR and occupancy across all regions.\nOntario continued with strong same door growth of $1.6 million or 15.4% during the quarter. Of the total same door NOI increase of $1.6 million, $0.9 million was due to higher AMR partially driven from successful execution of the VCIs, $0.2 million was due to higher occupancy, and $0.5 million was due to electricity cost savings.\nIn Western Canada, multi-family same door NOI increased 4.1% in the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to higher revenue from AMR and occupancy increases, partially offset by higher utility costs.\nAMR improvement and higher occupancy in Quebec and Northern Canada resulted in same door NOI increases during the quarter of 6.5% and 3.9%, respectively. In addition, cost savings from the internalization of property management contributed to the same door NOI growth in Quebec.\nSame door NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased 0.8% in Atlantic Canada. The decrease was due to higher maintenance and utilities, partially offset by cost savings from the internalization of property management. Excluding one-time electricity rebates received in the prior year of $0.1 million, same door NOI growth in Atlantic Canada would have been 2.4%.\nSTRONG TRACTION ON VALUE CREATION INITIATIVES\nVCIs resulted in approximately $0.8 million of additional annualized NOI in the first quarter of 2018. The cumulative progress on VCIs is $7.6 million since November 1, 2015, which is 53% of the initial five-year target of $14.3 million established in 2015.\nThe high-end renovation program continues to prove successful, achieving a rate of return of 26% during the quarter, exceeding the target rate of return of 15% to 20%. During the quarter, 113 units relating to the Transaction were completed with an AMR increase of approximately $277 per unit.\nWith the success of the program, management continues to evaluate additional properties and suites for high-end renovations to expand the program. In addition to the high-end renovation program target set in 2015, management has identified 875 units as part of the acquisition completed in December 2017.\nManagement plans to complete approximately 500 units under the high-end renovation program in 2018.\nOCCUPANCY REMAINS STRONG ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO﻿\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, occupancy improved by 270 bps to 93.3%, compared to the same period of 2017 and remains consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017. Occupancy in all regions increased in the quarter compared to the same period of 2017, with Western Canada showing the largest improvement increasing 440 bps to 86.1%.\nNEW ACQUISITIONS OF $34 MILLION\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Northview acquired a property in Nanaimo, BC, for $22.0 million consisting of four buildings containing 137 multi-family units and approximately 6,000 square feet of commercial space, known as Woodgrove Pines. The acquisition includes opportunities for future redevelopment and new units. In addition, a parcel of development land in Kitchener, ON, consisting of 4.3 acres of land was acquired for $5.4 million.\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter, Northview completed the acquisition of 6.9 acres of land for future development in Nanaimo, BC, for $6.3 million.\nGROWTH THROUGH NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS\nNorthview plans to commence development projects with total costs of approximately $50 to $100 million in 2018 in Calgary, AB, and on the recently purchased land in Kitchener, ON. The Calgary, AB, development is the second phase of the successful Vista project. The development in Kitchener, ON, supports Northview’s strategic goal of expanding its in-house development expertise to Ontario and is expected to further drive growth in net asset value.\nNorthview has a development project underway in Canmore, AB, with total estimated development costs of $25.0 million. At the end of the first quarter, $13.3 million has been incurred in respect of this project and occupancy is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Northview completed the development of 132 units in Regina, SK, and 30 units along with approximately 11,000 square feet of commercial space in Iqaluit, NU. In Regina, leasing is ahead of expectations reaching 51% leased and the multi-family units in Iqaluit, NU, have been 100% leased as of May 2018. Northview has recorded a net fair value increase of $7.1 million or 22% relative to total development costs.\nSTRONG COVERAGE RATIOS\nDebt to gross book value was 57.0% as at March 31, 2018, an increase of 60 bps from December 31, 2017. Interest and debt service coverage ratios were 3.09 and 1.65, respectively, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.05 and 1.63, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nDebt to gross book value increased during the quarter as a result of internally funded growth. During this period, organic growth reflected in the same door NOI increase of 6.0% and NOI contributions from acquisitions and newly developed properties improved the interest and debt service coverage ratios.\nNorthview continues to monitor interest rates to identify opportunities to reduce its overall borrowing costs. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, Northview completed $81.2 million of mortgage refinancing, excluding short-term financing, for multi-family properties with a weighted average interest rate of 3.17% and an average term to maturity of 7.2 years.\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION\nNorthview’s consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, can be found on Northview’s website at www.northviewreit.com or www.sedar.com .\nCAUTIONARY AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis media release contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements relating to execution of our strategic priorities, including VCIs and organic growth within our portfolio, development and acquisition opportunities, completion and occupancy of development projects, and opportunities for the reduction of weighted average interest rates.
