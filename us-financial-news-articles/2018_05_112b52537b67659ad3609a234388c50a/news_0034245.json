REUTERS/Issei Kato\nThe 28-year-old, currently ranked number 32 in the world, was charged with missing three tests within a 12-month period on Jan. 11, before the start of the Australian Open.\nCornet had contended that the third missed test, which resulted in the charge, was caused by a misunderstanding, and an independent tribunal ruled in her favor.\nIn evidence given to the tribunal, Cornet said she was in her apartment when the ITF’s doping control officer arrived to conduct the test, but that the intercom buzzer was not working, which led to her missing the test.\nThe tribunal ruled that the doping control officer “did not do what was reasonable in the circumstances (i.e. given the nature of the specified location) to try to locate the (player), short of giving (her) any advance notice of the test.”\n“For that reason, the third Missed Test declared against Ms. Cornet no longer stands,” the tribunal said in a statement.
