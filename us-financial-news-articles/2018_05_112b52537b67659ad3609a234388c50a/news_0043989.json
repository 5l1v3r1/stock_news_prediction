Those were the first trading sessions since May 9 in which the bank did not sell reserves to prop up the peso, which has weakened more than 17 percent this month.\nArgentina was especially hard hit by a general flight from emerging markets in recent weeks. The currencies of neighboring Brazil, Chile and other Latin American countries were also weaker on Friday while Argentina’s Merval stock index extended an eight-day rally by rising 0.65 percent.\nReporting by Jorge Otaola and Walter Bianchi, writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:43:13.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
