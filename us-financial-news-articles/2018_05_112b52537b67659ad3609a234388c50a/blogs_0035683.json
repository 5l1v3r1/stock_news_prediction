An investigation is continuing into the incident, which occurred on Sunday. It said that as of Tuesday, the two staff members are no longer with the company.\nThe response comes as a push for more inclusion becomes a key issue in corporate America. Starbucks Corp. will be closing more than 8,000 company-owned stores on May 29 for anti-bias training after the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia location last month became a flashpoint for the chain.\nCheesecake Factory said that while it’s taking the situation seriously, the media response may have been overblown. It said a staff meeting held at the Miami location at the same time as the incident “may have been perceived as a crowd gathering near the guests’ tables.”\nShares of Cheesecake Factory rose as much as 2 percent to $52.84 on Wednesday. The stock had gained 7.5 percent this year through Tuesday’s close.
