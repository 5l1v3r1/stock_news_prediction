(NYSE: TCI), a Dallas-based real estate investment company, today reported results of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we reported a net loss applicable to common shares of $0.5 million or ($0.05) per diluted loss per share compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $5.4 million or ($0.61) per diluted loss per share for the same period ended 2017.\nDuring this period the company adhered to its overall business strategy to focus only on high value assets and with this in mind, we disposed of several underperforming properties. Though this created a slight reduction in revenue, the overall operating income was virtually consistent with the first quarter of 2017. As the company has been redeploying capital in new residential apartment properties, we fully anticipate increases in both revenue and operating income.\nGoing forward we further believe that operating expenses should remain very manageable as we continue to replace older underperforming assets with newer class A properties.\nRevenues\nRental and other property revenues were $31.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of approximately $0.4 million, compared to the prior period revenues of $31.5 million. This change, by segment, is an increase in the apartment portfolio of $0.9 million, and a decrease in the commercial portfolio of $1.3 million.\nExpense\nProperty operating expenses were $14.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $1.4 million, compared to the prior period operating expenses of $15.9 million. This change, by segment, is a decrease in the apartment portfolio of $0.2 million, a decrease in the commercial portfolio of $0.9 million and a decrease in the land portfolio of $0.2 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents an increase of $0.1 million as compared to prior period depreciation of $6.3 million.\nMortgage and loan interest expense was $14.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents a decrease of $1.1 million, as compared to the prior period expense of $15.2 million. The change by segment is an increase in the other portfolio of $0.4 million and a decrease in the apartment portfolio of $1.4 million, and an increase in the commercial portfolio of $0.2 million. Within the other portfolio, the increase is primarily due to $2.3 million of interest expense related to the bonds.\nOther income was $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This represents an increase of $2.5 million compared to prior period other income of $1.1 million. This increase is due to forgiveness of debt of $1.5 million during the first quarter and $1.8 million of foreign currency translation gain due to change in currency exchange rate.\nGain on land sales increased for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the prior period. In the current period we sold 62 acres of land for a sales price of $3.0 million and recorded a gain of $1.3 million. For the same period in 2017, we sold 2.49 acres of land for a sales price of $1.1 million and recorded a gain of $0.4 million.\nAbout Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc.\nTranscontinental Realty Investors, Inc., a Dallas-based real estate investment company, holds a diverse portfolio of equity real estate located across the U.S., including apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, and developed and undeveloped land.
