(TSX-V:HVT) (\" Harvest One \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Dream Water Products Canada Inc. (“ Dream Water Canada ”) and Sarpes Beverages, LLC (dba Dream Products, LLC) (“ Dream Water USA ”) in exchange for a combination of US$12.5 million in cash and C$18.5 million in shares at a deemed price of C$1.00 per share, representing total consideration of approximately C$34.5 million (the \" Transaction \"). Harvest One continues to hold a substantial cash position of approximately C$62 million and zero debt. As part of this Transaction, the combination of Dream Water Canada and Dream Water USA will become Dream Water Global (“ Dream Water ”) and now owns the worldwide rights and all intellectual property to and for Dream Water.\nStrategic Rationale\nThe Transaction will deliver a ready-made consumer goods marketing, distribution and product development division to Harvest One.\nDream Water is a natural, 2.5oz, 0-calorie, liquid sleep shot. Along with its sleep powder, Dream Water helps promote relaxation and support restful sleep. Dream Water is sold online and in over 30,000 North American retail outlets, while currently generating approximately $6 million per annum in revenue from its current product lines. Harvest One anticipates significant growth of the Dream Water brand and proposition by:\nScaling its current e-commerce and direct to consumer efforts;\nBringing to market Dream Water’s robust product innovation pipeline; and\nExpanding the Dream Water brand into the cannabis space; most notably, to produce additional cannabidiol (“ CBD ”) and/or Full-Spectrum Hemp based product lines where said products can be manufactured and sold within federally regulated markets. Dream Water Canada has established a full cannabis-based product development program to include CBD and/or Full-Spectrum Hemp in oral spray, liquid suspension and soluble powder-based product lines for the Canadian recreational and over-the-counter cannabis markets when they are legalized at the federal level.\nAs a result of the Transaction, Harvest One expects to achieve its strategic goal to operate as a complete, vertically-integrated global group with cannabis cultivation (United Greeneries) plus the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of both medical and pharmaceutical cannabis products (Satipharm) and consumer goods marketing, manufacturing and distribution with Dream Water.\nDescription of Dream Water Products\nDream Water currently produces natural, convenient, travel-friendly, single serving 2.5oz liquid sleep shots and sleep powder packets that you can take with or without water. The products help promote relaxation and support restful sleep. As part of its product innovation pipeline, Dream Water has recently introduced Dream Water Beauty, a nighttime liquid shot with collagen that helps with hair, skin, nail regeneration. Currently in development is Dream Water Sport, a nighttime liquid shot containing branch chain amino acids in support of exercise recovery while sleeping.\nDream Water's products are available from over 30,000 retail outlets across the United States, Canada, Mexico and other foreign markets, including through industry leading grocery, drug and convenience retailers, major North American airports, along with various e-commerce platforms and a growing monthly online subscription service.\nDream Water is in the process of launching an international licensing and distribution division that Harvest One expects to expand rapidly over the next 2 years. Immediate international expansion with Dream Water’s non-cannabis related products will aim to gain brand recognition and distribution footholds in countries where cannabis legalization is yet to be confirmed.\nDream Water will make use of Satipharm’s existing distribution network, leveraging supply agreements already in place with large pharmacy chains in 12 different EU countries including Ireland, UK, Germany, Poland and Italy.\nMackie Research Capital acted as sole financial advisors to Harvest One for the purposes of the Transaction.\nAbout Harvest One Cannabis Inc. (TSXV: HVT)\nHarvest One is a global cannabis company focused on delivering high quality, innovative cannabis products and technology to regulated markets around the world.
