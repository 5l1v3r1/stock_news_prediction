The KPMG logo is seen at the company's head offices in Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa, September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\nThe so-called customs partnership would align Britain’s approach to customs with the EU’s, removing the need for a customs border and would see British authorities collect the tariffs and pass them to the EU if the imports came from elsewhere.\n“Many clients don’t like the New Customs Partnership proposal because it would bring uncertainty, take a long time to implement and mean higher costs,” Bob Jones, KPMG’s Customs lead said.\nJones said the other option a highly streamlined customs arrangement proposal is regarded as a more realistic option for clients, but most would prefer to stay in a customs union with the EU.\nMay’s so-called Brexit war cabinet met on Wednesday and has yet to decide on a proposal for future customs arrangements that will prevent a return to the hard border with EU member Ireland.
