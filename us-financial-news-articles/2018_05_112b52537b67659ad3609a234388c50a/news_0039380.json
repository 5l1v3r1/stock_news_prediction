It’s a new area of research pioneered by Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. To turn leaves into a light source, Strano uses luciferase, the enzyme responsible for a firefly’s glow.\nNewsletter Sign-up A total of three compounds (luciferase, the light-emitting compound luciferin and another enzyme) are packaged in nanoparticles that enter the plant through pores called stomata.\nCurrently, researchers are able to make plants such as spinach, kale and watercress emit a dim light for about 4 hours—up from 45 minutes when the project began in 2015. The goal is a topical solution that can transform a houseplant into a cordless, environmentally friendly lamp.\n“We think we’ll be able to engineer a way for you to just spray it onto a plant, wait an hour, and then that plant will be light-emitting for the duration of its lifetime,” Strano says, adding that a luciferase inhibitor could act as an off-switch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T03:05:15.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
