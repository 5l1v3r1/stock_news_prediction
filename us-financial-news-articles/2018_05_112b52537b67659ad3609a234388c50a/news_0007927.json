(NYSE: LDOS), a global science and technology leader, today reported financial results fiscal year 2018.\nRoger Krone, Leidos Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Our first quarter results demonstrate a strong start to the year, with notable performance in bookings, profitability and cash generation. These results reflect the power of the efficient and flexible cost structure behind our innovative technical solutions, and the unwavering commitment of our employees to deliver excellence in program performance and value to our customers. Book-to-bill was at the highest level of any first quarter in the last five years due to improved win rates and an enhanced business development engine. Strong bookings combined with a positive budgetary outlook bolster our ability to grow and deliver increased value to our customers, shareholders, and employees.\"\nSummary Results\nRevenues for the quarter were $2.44 billion, compared to $2.58 billion in the prior year quarter, reflecting a 5.3% decrease.\nOperating income for the quarter was $159 million, compared to $141 million in the prior year quarter. Operating margin increased to 6.5% from 5.5% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to decreases in amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs and restructuring charges. Excluding these items, non-GAAP operating income margin for the quarter increased to 9.7% from 9.4% in the prior year quarter.\nDiluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") attributable to Leidos common stockholders for the quarter was $0.66, compared to $0.47 in the prior year quarter. Excluding the items mentioned in the preceding paragraph, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.03, compared to $0.88 in the prior year quarter. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 154 million compared to 153 million in the prior year quarter.\nDefense Solutions\nDefense Solutions revenues for the quarter of $1,178 million decreased by $116 million, or 9.0%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to timing of revenue recognition on certain contracts, the completion of certain contracts and net volume decreases, partially offset by revenues from new awards.\nDefense Solutions operating income margin for the quarter was 7.2%, compared to 6.1% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the quarter was 8.7%, compared to 7.3% in the prior year quarter, due to stronger program performance on certain contracts.\nCivil\nCivil revenues for the quarter of $840 million decreased by $2 million, or 0.2%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue change was due to increased revenues from new awards and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. These were more than offset by net volume decreases and lower revenues from our international business due to the completion of a contractual deliverable in the prior year quarter.\nCivil operating income margin for the quarter was 8.8%, compared to 6.4% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income margin for the quarter was 11.8%, compared to 10.5% in the prior year quarter, reflecting stronger program performance on certain contracts.\nHealth\nHealth revenues for the quarter of $425 million decreased by $18 million, or 4.1%, compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to timing of revenue recognition and completion of certain contracts, partially offset by net volume increases.\nHealth operating income margin for the quarter was 9.9%, compared to 10.6% in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income margin for the quarter was 12.5%, compared to 14.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to higher profit write-ups in the prior year quarter.\nCash Flow Summary\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $22 million compared to $71 million net cash used in operating activities in the prior year quarter. The increased operating net cash inflows were primarily due to a higher than expected level of advance contract payments from customers, timing of collections of receivables and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs, partially offset by cash paid in the quarter of $24 million related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the quarter was $96 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to cash paid in the quarter of $81 million related to the 2016 acquisition of the IS&GS Business and higher purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the quarter was $91 million compared to $78 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to the repurchase of shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $10 million.\nAs of March 30, 2018, the Company had $215 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3.1 billion of debt.\nNew Business Awards\nNet bookings totaled $2.5 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02.\nNotable recent awards received include:\nUnited States Army : Leidos was awarded a follow-on $200 million hybrid contract (cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price) to support geospatial requirements, standards and systems across the U.S. Army. The multiple-award contract has a potential five-year period of performance and work will be performed in Alexandria, VA. Under the contract, Leidos will continue to provide technologies and expertise to support the U.S. Army's ongoing geospatial research, integration, development, and operational requirements at the U.S. Army Geospatial Center at Fort Belvoir. Leidos will also develop geospatial enterprise-enabled systems for the Army and other Department of Defense (\"DOD\") and non-DOD entities. United States Army : Leidos was awarded a follow-on prime contract to continue to provide logistics services to the 1st Theater Sustainment Command in support of U.S. Army Central, the Army component of U.S. Central Command. Leidos will apply its expertise in delivering resilient mission logistics services to provide receipt, storage, maintenance, issue and distribution of ammunition. The single-award cost-plus-fixed-fee/cost-plus-incentive-fee contract has a one-year base period of performance, five one-year options, and a total contract value of approximately $112 million. Federal Aviation Administration : Leidos was awarded a task order to develop the 7th Generation geostationary earth orbit satellite used for the Federal Aviation Administration's Wide Area Augmentation System (\"WAAS\"). The task order supports the WAAS, a safety-critical system that augments Global Positioning System (\"GPS\") Standard Positioning Service. WAAS enables aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of flight, including precision approaches to any airport within its service area. The task order has a four-year development phase, and one 10-year Operations and Maintenance phase with a total contract value of approximately $117 million. Intelligence Community : The Company was awarded contracts valued at $1.3 billion, if all options are exercised, by U.S. national security and intelligence clients. Though the specific nature of these contracts is classified, they all encompass mission-critical services that help to counter global threats and strengthen national security.\nThe Company's backlog at the end of the quarter was $17.6 billion, of which $4.6 billion was funded.\nForward Guidance\nThe Company affirms previously issued fiscal year 2018 guidance as follows:\nRevenues of $10.25 billion to $10.65 billion; Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.1% to 10.4%; Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.50; and Cash flows provided by operating activities at or above $675 million.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, asset impairment charges, restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration costs and amortization of an equity method investment to reflect non-GAAP exclusions. See Leidos' non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliation included elsewhere in this release.\nThe Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA margins (non-GAAP) or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to GAAP net income, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Because certain deductions for non-GAAP exclusions used to calculate projected net income may vary significantly based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income at this time. The amounts of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share being materially less than projected adjusted EBITDA margins (non-GAAP) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\nConference Call Information\nLeidos management will discuss operations and financial results in an earnings conference call beginning at 7:30 A.M. eastern time on May 3, 2018. Analysts and institutional investors may participate by dialing +1 (877) 869-3847 (U.S. dial-in) or +1 (201) 689-8261 (international dial-in).\nA live audio broadcast of the conference call along with a supplemental presentation will be available to the public through links on the Leidos Investor Relations website ( http://ir.leidos.com ).\nAfter the call concludes, an audio replay can be accessed on the Leidos Investor Relations website or by dialing +1 (877) 660-6853 (toll-free U.S.) or +1 (201) 612-7415 (international) and entering conference ID 13677974.\nAbout Leidos\nLeidos is a Fortune 500 ® information technology, engineering, and science solutions and services leader working to solve the world's toughest challenges in the defense, intelligence, homeland security, civil and health markets.

Backlog value is based on management's estimates about volume of services, availability of customer funding and other factors, and excludes contracts that are under protest. Our estimate of backlog comprises both funded and negotiated unfunded backlog. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by several factors including modifications of contracts, non-exercise of options, foreign currency movements, etc.\nFunded backlog for contracts with the U.S. government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. Funded backlog for contracts with non-U.S. government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which Leidos is obligated to perform, less revenue previously recognized on the contracts.\nNegotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include future potential task orders expected to be awarded under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (\"IDIQ\"), General Services Administration Schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded or separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future task orders is anticipated.\nThe estimated value of backlog as of the dates presented was as follows:\nMarch 30,\n2018\nDecember 29,\n2017\nDefense Solutions:\nFunded backlog\n$\n2,162\n$\n2,384\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n5,928\n5,285\nTotal Defense Solutions backlog\n$\n8,090\n$\n7,669\nCivil:\nFunded backlog\n$\n1,816\n$\n2,064\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n5,458\n5,321\nTotal Civil backlog\n$\n7,274\n$\n7,385\nHealth:\nFunded backlog\n$\n596\n$\n595\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n1,648\n1,827\nTotal Health backlog\n$\n2,244\n$\n2,422\nTotal:\nFunded backlog\n$\n4,574\n$\n5,043\nNegotiated unfunded backlog\n13,034\n12,433\nTotal backlog\n$\n17,608\n$\n17,476\nTotal backlog at March 30, 2018, included $88 million of benefit due to the exchange rate movements between the U.S. dollar and the British pound.\nLEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.\nUNAUDITED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Company uses and refers to non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP EPS, which are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") and, accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP measures provide another measure of the Company's results of operations and financial condition, including its ability to comply with financial covenants. These non-GAAP measures are frequently used by financial analysts covering Leidos and its peers. The Company's computation of its non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, thus limiting their use for comparability.\nNon-GAAP operating income is computed by excluding the following items from net income: (i) non-operating expense, net; (ii) adjustments to the income tax provision to reflect non-GAAP adjustments; and (iii) the following discrete items:\nAcquisition and integration costs – Represents costs related to the acquisition and integration of the IS&GS Business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Represents the amortization of the fair value of the acquired intangible assets.
