(TSX:DIV) (TSX:DIV.DB) (the “Corporation” or “DIV”) is pleased to announce its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (“Q1 2018”).\nHighlights\nRevenues of $6.0 million for Q1 2018. Mr. Lube royalty rate on non-tire sales at flagship locations increased from 6.95% to 7.45% on May 1, 2018. Mr. Lube royalty pool was adjusted on May 1, 2018 to include two new Mr. Lube locations and to remove one Mr. Lube location that was permanently closed.\nFirst Quarter Results\nIn Q1 2018, DIV generated $6.0 million of royalty revenue and management fees compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues of $3.3 million were generated from Mr. Lube Canada Limited Partnership (“Mr. Lube”), $1.0 million from Sutton Group Realty Services Ltd. (“Sutton”), and $1.7 million were generated from the AIR MILES ® licenses.\nSame-store-sales-growth (“SSSG”) was 4.5% for the Mr. Lube stores in the royalty pool in Q1 2018, compared to SSSG of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Sutton’s fixed royalty increases at a contractual rate of 2% per year, which effectively represents 2% SSSG. According to Alliance Data Systems Inc.’s (“ADS”) news release dated April 19, 2018, the number of AIR MILES ® reward miles issued decreased by 1% in Q1 2018 and is trending to growth over the remainder of 2018.\nFirst Quarter Commentary\nSean Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer of DIV stated, “We are confident that Mr. Lube will continue to deliver robust operating results as they execute on their growth strategy. The historical positive SSSG, the increase in the Mr. Lube royalty rate on non-tire sales by 0.5% and the net addition to the Mr. Lube royalty pool reaffirms the high quality royalty stream of the Mr. Lube business. With approximately $83M of cash on hand, we continue to actively pursue discussions with several potential business partners with the aim of acquiring trademarks and royalties from a diverse group of high-quality businesses.”\nDistributable Cash\nIn Q1 2018, distributable cash was $4.6 million ($0.0427 per share) compared to $3.4 million ($0.0325 per share) in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to the incremental royalty income driven by the acquisition of the AIR MILES ® licenses on August 25, 2017. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense related to the convertible debentures issued on November 7, 2017 and the term loan facility drawn on September 6, 2017 associated with the acquisition of the AIR MILES ® licenses.\nIn Q1 2018, dividends declared were in excess of distributable cash by $1.4 million, which resulted in a payout ratio of 130.1%. However, the Corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan that allows the dividends to be settled through a reinvestment in the Corporation’s shares. As a result, the payout ratio on a cash basis was 114.3% in Q1 2018. The shortfall in distributable cash was funded by the proceeds received from the sale of the trademarks and rights related to the Franworks Franchise Corp. business (the “FW Rights”) in November 2016.\nThe Corporation expects the payout ratio for the 2018 fiscal year, excluding the impact of the dividend reinvestment plan, to be in the range of 110% - 115% (on a cash basis, in the range of 100% - 105%), after taking into account the Mr. Lube royalty rate increase, the net addition to the Mr. Lube royalty pool, and seasonal fluctuations.\nThe Corporation intends to use the remaining proceeds from the sale of the FW Rights as well as the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering to fund future royalty acquisitions, with the intention of achieving a payout ratio that approximate 100% over time. The Corporation expects the payout ratio to remain over 100% until such time as further royalty acquisitions are completed and excess cash has been deployed.\nNet Income\nNet income for Q1 2018 was $2.6 million, compared to net income of $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from operations related to the acquisition of the AIR MILES ® licenses, offset by higher interest expense and income taxes.\nAbout Diversified Royalty Corp.\nDIV is a multi-royalty corporation, engaged in the business of acquiring top-line royalties from well-managed multi-location businesses and franchisors in North America.

By considering these measures in combination with the most closely comparable IFRS measure, management believes that investors are provided with additional and more useful information about the Corporation than investors would have if they simply considered IFRS measures alone. The non-IFRS financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that non-IFRS measures should not be construed as a substitute or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n“Distributable Cash”, “Same Store Sales Growth” and “payout ratio” are used as non-IFRS measures in this press release. For further details, see the “Description of Non-IFRS and Additional IFRS Measures” in the Corporation’s management’s discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nThird Party Information\nThis news release includes information obtained from third party company filings and reports and other publicly available sources.

DIV has not independently verified any of the information from third party sources referred to in this news release nor ascertained the underlying assumptions relied upon by such sources.\nTHE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE HAS NOT REVIEWED AND DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR THE ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information relating to the Corporation and other public filings, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nContact:\nSean Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer\nDiversified Royalty Corp.\n(604) 235-3146\nGreg Gutmanis, Chief Financial Officer and VP Acquisitions\nDiversified Royalty Corp.\n(604) 235-3146\nSource: Diversified Royalty Corp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:14:15.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
