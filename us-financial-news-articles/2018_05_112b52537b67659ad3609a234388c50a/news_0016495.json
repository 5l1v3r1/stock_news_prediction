Adjusted EBITDA and DCF were both positively affected by the $52.6 million gain.\nGross profit in the first quarter of 2018 was $144.3 million compared with $140.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Combined product margin, which is gross profit adjusted for depreciation allocated to cost of sales, was $166.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $162.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCombined product margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and DCF are non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures, which are explained in greater detail below under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Please refer to Financial Reconciliations included in this news release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nGasoline Distribution and Station Operations (GDSO) segment product margin was $113.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $7.6 million compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Honey Farms in October 2017 as well as higher fuel volumes and fuel margins.\nWholesale segment product margin was $47.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $52.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was due primarily to less favorable market conditions in distillates, partly offset by more favorable market conditions in gasoline blendstocks. Crude oil product margin in the first quarter of 2018 was $5.1 million versus $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, due in part to lower sales volume.\nCommercial segment product margin was $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $4.2 million in the same period of 2017, in part due to colder temperatures early in the first quarter of 2018.\nSales in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.8 billion compared with $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017. GDSO segment sales were $979.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $843.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Wholesale segment sales were $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Commercial segment sales were $269.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $201.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nVolume in the first quarter of 2018 was 1.4 billion gallons compared with 1.3 billion gallons in the same period of 2017. GDSO volume was 378.3 million gallons in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 366.1 million gallons in the same period of 2017. Wholesale segment volume was 864.4 million gallons in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 778.3 million gallons in the first quarter of 2017. Commercial segment volume was 144.2 million gallons in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 131.5 million gallons in the same period of 2017.\nRecent Highlights\nGlobal’s Board of Directors announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4625 per unit, or $1.85 per unit on an annualized basis, on all of its outstanding common units for the period from January 1 to March 31, 2018. The distribution will be paid on May 15, 2018 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2018.\nBusiness Outlook\n“We are pleased with the performance of our terminal portfolio and retail locations and continue to pursue accretive opportunities and drive additional volume through our facilities,” Slifka said.\nFor full-year 2018, Global continues to expect to generate EBITDA of $180 million to $210 million, which guidance excludes any gain or loss on the sale and disposition of assets, and any goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. EBITDA guidance for 2018 also excludes the recognition in the first quarter of 2018 of a one-time gain of approximately $52.6 million as a result of the extinguishment of a contingent liability related to the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, which tax credit program expired in 2011. Based upon the significant passage of time from that 2011 date, including underlying statutes of limitation, as of January 31, 2018 the Partnership determined that the liability was no longer required. This recognition of one-time income did not impact cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and will not impact cash flows from operations for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nThe Partnership’s guidance and future performance are based on assumptions regarding market conditions such as the crude oil market, business cycles, demand for petroleum products and renewable fuels, utilization of assets and facilities, weather, credit markets, the regulatory and permitting environment and the forward product pricing curve, which could influence quarterly financial results. The Partnership believes these assumptions are reasonable given currently available information and its assessment of historical trends. Because Global’s assumptions and future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties, the Partnership can provide no assurance that actual performance will fall within guidance ranges.\nWith respect to 2018 net income and net cash from operating activities, the most comparable financial measures to EBITDA calculated in accordance with GAAP, the Partnership is unable to project either metric without unreasonable effort and for the following reasons: 1) The Partnership is unable to project net income because this metric includes the impact of certain non-cash items, most notably those resulting from the sale of non-strategic sites, which the Partnership is unable to project with any reasonable degree of accuracy; and 2) The Partnership is unable to project net cash from operating activities because this metric includes the impact of changes in commodity prices, including their impact on inventory volume and value, receivables, payables and derivatives, which the Partnership is unable to project with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Please see the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this news release.\nFinancial Results Conference Call\nManagement will review the Partnership’s first-quarter 2018 financial results in a teleconference call for analysts and investors today.\nTime: 10:00 a.m. ET Dial-in numbers: (877) 709-8155 (U.S. and Canada) (201) 689-8881 (International) The call also will be webcast live and archived on Global’s website.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nProduct Margin\nGlobal Partners views product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of its operations. The Partnership reviews product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis. Global Partners defines product margin as product sales minus product costs. Product sales primarily include sales of unbranded and branded gasoline, distillates, residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, as well as convenience store sales, gasoline station rental income and revenue generated from logistics activities when the Partnership engages in the storage, transloading and shipment of products owned by others. Product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale as well as product costs related to convenience store items and costs associated with logistics activities. The Partnership also looks at product margin on a per unit basis (product margin divided by volume). Product margin is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements to assess its business. Product margin should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, product margin may not be comparable to product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used as supplemental financial measures by management and may be used by external users of Global Partners’ consolidated financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to assess the Partnership’s:\ncompliance with certain financial covenants included in its debt agreements; financial performance without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or historical cost basis; ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on its indebtedness and to make distributions to its partners; operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale, marketing, storing and distribution of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane, and in the gasoline stations and convenience stores business, without regard to financing methods and capital structure; and viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities.\nAdjusted EBITDA is EBITDA further adjusted for gains or losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nDistributable Cash Flow\nDistributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for the Partnership’s limited partners since it serves as an indicator of success in providing a cash return on their investment. Distributable cash flow as defined by the Partnership’s partnership agreement is net income plus depreciation and amortization minus maintenance capital expenditures, as well as adjustments to eliminate items approved by the audit committee of the board of directors of the Partnership’s general partner that are extraordinary or non-recurring in nature and that would otherwise increase distributable cash flow.\nDistributable cash flow as used in the Partnership’s partnership agreement determines its ability to make cash distributions on incentive distribution rights. The investment community also uses a distributable cash flow metric similar to the metric used in the partnership agreement with respect to publicly traded partnerships to indicate whether or not such partnerships have generated sufficient earnings on a current or historic level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distribution. The partnership agreement does not permit adjustments for certain non-cash items, such as net losses on the sale and disposition of assets and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges.\nDistributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flow from operations, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAbout Global Partners LP\nGlobal Partners is a midstream logistics and marketing master limited partnership that owns, controls or has access to one of the largest terminal networks of petroleum products and renewable fuels in the Northeast.

Accordingly, the Partnership's undistributed net income is assumed to be allocated to the limited partners' interest and to the General Partner's general partner interest. Limited partners' interest in net income is divided by the weighted average limited partner units outstanding in computing the net income per limited partner unit.\nGLOBAL PARTNERS LP CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) (Unaudited) March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 11,693 $ 14,858 Accounts receivable, net 417,657 417,263 Accounts receivable -
