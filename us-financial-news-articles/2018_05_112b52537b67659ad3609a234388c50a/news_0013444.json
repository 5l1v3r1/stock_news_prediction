It is up a hefty 9 percent since it hit a 15-month low as recently as March 26.\n“I would not be surprised if we continue to see very strong UK equities numbers and a really quite material re-rating,” said Guy Monson, chief investment officer at Sarasin & Partners, adding that if Brexit talks result in a settlement there could be a flight back into UK equities.\n“We have been tactically adding on dark days,” he added, saying he was keeping a UK focus “for a real backing of the underdog.”\nInbound M&A interest in British assets continued apace with French property group Fonciere des Regions buying 14 upmarket hotels in Britain from Starwood Capital for 858 million pounds ($1.2 billion).\nThe deal would also see InterContinental Hotels Group sign long-term leases for 13 of those 14 hotels and subsequently rebranding and running them.\n“We have seen absolutely record levels of M&A,” said Sarasin’s Monson.\n“The deal market began the year dotted with a few intra-UK announcements, but has since seen a flurry of large inbound acquisition attempts,” said Liberum strategists.\n“These stocks have offered growing revenue and international exposure at a depressed valuation.” Reporting by Helen Reid Editing by Keith Weir and Hugh Lawson", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T20:42:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
