Concerns about the U.S. deficits and rising government debt needs are also weighing on bonds.\nTwo-year note yields, which are the most sensitive to rate hikes, rose as high as 2.598 percent on Thursday, the highest since August 2008, before falling back to 2.569 percent on Monday.\nBenchmark 10-year note yields rose to 3.128 percent on Friday, the highest since July 2011, before falling back to 3.069 percent on Monday.\nThe Fed will release minutes from its May meeting on Wednesday, which will be further evaluated for indications of how many rate hikes are likely this year.\nThe U.S. central bank left rates unchanged at the meeting and expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near the U.S. central bank’s target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.\nAtlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Monday the U.S. economy is close to meeting the Fed’s employment and inflation goals, with growth of around 2.5 percent expected this year.\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that he expects two further rate hikes this year, and that the economy could possibly support an additional hike.\nTreasuries were also supported on Monday by safety buying as Italy’s borrowing costs surged as two anti-establishment parties that plan to ramp up spending appeared set to form a coalition government.\nEditing by Chizu Nomiyama; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:21:35.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
