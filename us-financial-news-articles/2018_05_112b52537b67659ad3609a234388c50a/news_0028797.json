I was wrong and he caught me.”\nDefending champion Linares tried to keep the fight close in the early rounds but Lomachenko used his nifty footwork and hand speed to dart in and out of his opponent’s range until he was caught on the chin in the sixth.\nLomachenko (11-1-0) lifted himself off the canvas and circled the ring to buy some time before hitting back in the eighth round with effective combinations, opening a cut over his opponent’s left eye in the process.\nDespite blood dripping into his eye, Linares put up some dogged resistance before Lomachenko wrapped up victory with a superbly timed left hook to the Venezuelan’s liver.\nLinares managed to get back up onto his feet but referee Ricky Gonzalez waved off the contest at the 2:08 mark.\n“Linares is a great champion and the fight was good for the fans and everybody. It was a great fight,” Lomachenko said after becoming the fastest boxer to win three titles in different divisions, beating the previous mark of 20 by eight bouts.
