REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\nEtihad has been reviewing its business since 2016 when investments in other airlines contributed to a nearly $2 billion (1.48 billion pounds) loss for the Abu Dhabi state-owned carrier.\nEtihad is considering its options for over 160 aircraft it has ordered, ranging from swapping models to delaying deliveries to outright cancellations, the sources told Reuters.\nA final decision could be based on a combination of the three options, one source said.

A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment, citing company policy to “not comment on delivery schedules nor any discussions with customers”. An Airbus spokeswoman declined to comment, telling Reuters talks with customers were confidential.\nFew details of the review have been made public but Etihad’s new Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas said on April 30 that the airline aims to develop in “a sustainable way”.\nEtihad has 88 Airbus and 78 Boeing jets on order worth tens of billions of dollars, largely from deals signed in 2013, which are scheduled to start delivery from this year.\nThe orders include 62 Airbus A350s and 52 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, according to the two planemakers’ websites.\nThe bulk of the aircraft were ordered when Etihad was pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy to keep pace with regional rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways.\nEtihad said then that under the agreements with Airbus and Boeing, it could transfer orders to airlines it had invested in. At that time, the airline had stakes in several other carriers.\nThe expansion strategy seemingly collapsed last year when Air Berlin and Alitalia filed for insolvency after Etihad invested in them.\nAir Berlin, one of Etihad’s biggest investments, ceased operations last October, while Alitalia, the most high profile, is unlikely to take any aircraft as insolvency proceedings continue.\nEtihad currently holds stakes in four other airlines.
