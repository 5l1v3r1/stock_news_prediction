During the stabbing, the middle daughter, a nine-year-old, escaped to an aunt’s house nearby with the help of her eight-year-old sister, they said.\nInvestigators believe that Ahmad, who has previously lived in Texas and Tennessee, fled with the eight-year-old girl in a black Lexus, Tulsa police spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie said.\n“We’re looking for this mother and this child, still,” MacKenzie said in a phone interview. “We’re getting out as much information as we can, hopefully to find everybody and make sure everybody’s safe.”\nAhmad’s 11-year-old daughter who had too many stab wounds for officers on the scene to count, was in critical but stable condition after surgery Monday night, MacKenzie said.\nThe nine-year-old who escaped told police her mother bound the three sisters’ hands with duct tape and stuffed their mouths with socks, MacKenzie said. After the nine-year-old made her way to her aunt’s home, the aunt went to the house where she discovered the stabbed 11-year-old girl and a fire in the kitchen, which she put out, she said.\nReporting by Peter Szekely in New York; editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:15:26.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
