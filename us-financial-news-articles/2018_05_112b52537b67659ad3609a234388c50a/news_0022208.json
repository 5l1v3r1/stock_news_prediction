Afterwards, she will have plenty of women to serve as her role model for the “Dos and Don’ts” of being royal.\nMarkle could seek to follow in the footsteps of Princess Grace of Monaco, said John Lehman, whose cousin Grace Kelly was a Hollywood star whose 1956 marriage to Prince Rainier III made her Princess Grace of the small Mediterranean principality.\n“She went through some awkward years getting the people in Monaco to accept her,” said Lehman last week.\nStudying hard to overcome cultural barriers in her adopted country, Princess Grace quickly mastered the French language and won the hearts of royalty and commoners alike.\n“It didn’t take too long before she was ‘their’ princess,” said Lehman, a former U.S. navy secretary who often visited Princess Grace at her palace before she died in a car crash in 1982. He is now chairman of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, which supports emerging artists.

The king abdicated the throne in 1936 in order to marry Simpson.\nFrom the outset, the British establishment was uncomfortable with her because she was so outspoken, said Anne Sebba, author of “That Woman: The Life of Wallis Simpson Duchess of Windsor.”\n“I think the problem for Wallis really was that she was brash,” Sebba said. “She would walk into a room and say, ‘Hi, I’m Wallis.’ She’d wear lots of jewellery. She’d talk about money.”\nQueen Noor of Jordan, who was married to King Hussein from 1978 until his death in 1999, also is from the United States.
