(TSX:FTT) (“Finning” or the “Company”) reported first quarter 2018 results today. All monetary amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nQ1 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nAll comparisons are to restated Q1 2017 results (1) unless indicated otherwise.\nEPS (2) of $0.42 per share included insurance proceeds related to Alberta wildfires of $0.03 per share. Adjusted EPS (3)(4) of $0.39 per share was up 42% on a 19% increase in revenues. Canada achieved improved operating leverage. Excluding insurance proceeds received in the quarter related to the 2016 Alberta wildfires, Canada’s SG&A (2) as a percentage of revenue declined by 380 basis points and EBIT margin improved by 80 basis points to 7.5%. South America reported a 13% increase in product support revenues in functional currency, driven by stronger demand from the Chilean mining sector, and an EBIT margin of 8.4%. Working capital to sales ratio improved by 340 basis points to 27.1% - the lowest level over the last two years - on higher sales and supply chain efficiencies. Adjusted return on invested capital (3)(4) of 13.5% was the highest in the last two years. Equipment backlog (3) increased by over $300 million from Q4 2017 to $1.6 billion, driven by strong order intake (3) across all regions and market segments. The current backlog more than doubled from Q1 2017 and is at the highest level since Q2 2012. Annualized dividend was raised by 5.3% to $0.80 per share, reflecting the expectation of improved market conditions and sustainable earnings growth.\n“I am encouraged by the continued positive market momentum and growing backlog at the start of 2018. We achieved strong revenue growth and improved profitability in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from leverage of additional revenues on fixed costs. I am particularly pleased with the progress we are making on our digital and supply chain initiatives, which enable us to reduce our cost to serve while transforming our customer experience. Looking ahead, we remain focused on capturing profitable growth opportunities in our markets, generating improved returns on invested capital, and advancing our long-term strategic priorities,” said Scott Thomson, President and CEO of Finning.\nQ1 2018 FINANCIAL SUMMARY\nAll comparisons are to restated Q1 2017 results (1) unless indicated otherwise.\nQuarterly Overview\n$ millions, except per share amounts Q1 2018 Q1 2017\nRestated (1) % change Revenue 1,670 1,401 19 EBIT 113 86 32 EBIT margin 6.8 % 6.1 % EBITDA (2)(3) 157 131 20 EBITDA margin (3) 9.4 % 9.3 % Net income 71 47 53 EPS 0.42 0.28 53 Free cash flow (263 ) (76 ) (244 ) Included in Q1 2018 results is the following significant item that management does not consider indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount.

New equipment sales increased by 37%, reflecting stronger demand in mining, construction, and power systems markets, particularly in Canada. Product support revenue grew by 10%, with all regions reporting higher parts and service revenues in mining and construction segments. Gross profit increased by 12%. Gross profit margin of 26.3% was below gross profit margin of 28.0% in Q1 2017 primarily due to a shift in revenue mix to new equipment sales. New equipment sales comprised 35% of total revenue compared to 30% in Q1 2017. Excluding insurance proceeds received in the quarter related to the 2016 Alberta wildfires, SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined by 180 basis points from Q1 2017 to 20.1%, reflecting leverage of additional revenues on fixed costs. Adjusted EBIT was up 24% to $106 million and Adjusted EBIT margin increased by 30 basis points to 6.4%, driven mostly by improved operating leverage in Canada. Adjusted EPS was $0.39 per share, up 42% from $0.28 per share in Q1 2017, primarily due to higher Adjusted EBIT. Q1 2018 free cash flow was ($263) million use of cash compared to ($76) million use of cash in Q1 2017 due to higher working capital requirements to meet stronger customer demand.\nInvested Capital (3) and ROIC (2) Q1 2018 Q4 2017\nrestated (1) Q1 2017\nrestated (1) Invested capital ($ millions) Consolidated 3,226 2,830 2,940 Canada 1,778 1,621 1,630 South America (U.S. dollars) 884 784 773 UK & Ireland (U.K. pound sterling) 178 147 172 Invested capital turnover (3) (times) 2.13 2.09 1.89 Working capital to sales ratio 27.1 % 27.4 % 30.5 % Inventory turns (times) 2.80 2.82 2.61 Adjusted ROIC (%) Consolidated 13.5 13.1 10.0 Canada 14.0 13.2 10.2 South America 17.8 18.1 15.6 UK & Ireland 13.4 12.8 7.7 Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, invested capital was up by 12% from Q4 2017 mostly due to an increase in new equipment inventory in all regions to meet stronger demand, and higher parts inventory in Canada in line with growing product support volumes. Lower accounts payable balances in South America due to timing, and an increase in unbilled work-in-progress in all operations due to stronger market activity also contributed to higher invested capital levels compared to Q4 2017. Invested capital turnover and working capital to sales ratio continued to improve and were the best in the last two years, reflecting higher sales and supply chain efficiencies. Adjusted ROIC increased by 40 basis points from Q4 2017, driven mostly by higher Adjusted ROIC in Canada, and was the highest Adjusted ROIC in two years.\nQ1 2018 HIGHLIGHTS BY OPERATION\nAll comparisons are to restated Q1 2017 results (1) unless indicated otherwise.

More information on the impact of this adoption can be found in note 1 of the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements. (2) Earnings Before Finance Costs and Income Taxes (EBIT); Basic Earnings per Share (EPS); Earnings Before Finance Costs, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA); Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A); Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). (3) These financial metrics, referred to as “non-GAAP financial measures”, do not have a standardized meaning under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are also referred to herein as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For additional information regarding these financial metrics, including definitions and reconciliations from each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable measure under GAAP, where available, see the heading “Description of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” in the Company’s MD&A. Management believes that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements with important information regarding the operational performance and related trends of the Company's business. By considering these measures in combination with the comparable IFRS measures set out in the MD&A, management believes that users are provided a better overall understanding of the Company's business and its financial performance during the relevant period than if they simply considered the IFRS measures alone. (4) Certain 2018 and 2017 financial metrics were impacted by significant items management does not consider indicative of operational and financial trends either by nature or amount; these significant items are described on page 3 of the MD&A. The financial metrics which have been adjusted to take into account these items are referred to as “Adjusted” metrics.
