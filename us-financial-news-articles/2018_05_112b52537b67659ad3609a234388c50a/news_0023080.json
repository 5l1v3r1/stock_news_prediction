The timing of stock repurchases and the number of shares of common stock to be repurchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors. Repurchases will be made using the Company's cash resources and may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time-to-time at the Company's discretion without prior notice. Repurchases may be made in the open market, through 10b5-1 programs, accelerated share repurchase programs, through privately negotiated transactions or through the use of derivative instruments.\nAbout Qualcomm\nQualcomm invents breakthrough technologies that transform how the world connects and communicates.
