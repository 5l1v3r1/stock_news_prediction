REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\nThe unions of pilots formally notified the airline last week of its intention to strike, potentially from May 11.\nThe airline said it regretted the action, which would affect more than 60,000 passengers booked on 557 flights into and out of Brussels on the two days.\nPilots want a pay hike, a better work-life balance, improved career prospects and the possibility of earlier retirement. Some 80 percent of them voted to strike. Union leaders have said some of the concerns relate to uncertainty over the future of the airline within Lufthansa.\nBrussels Airlines says it has made a number of offers to address such concerns.\nLufthansa, which took control of the Belgian national flag carrier in 2016, earlier this year appointed a new chief executive officer and chief operating officer for the airline.\nThe German company plans to use Brussels Airlines to expand long-haul operations for its Eurowings budget brand out of Duesseldorf.
