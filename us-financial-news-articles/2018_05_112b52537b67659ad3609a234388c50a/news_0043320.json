The attackers were killed.\n“Islamic State fighters executed an attack on ‘Michael’ Church yesterday in Chechnya’s capital, Grozny,” Amaq said.\nRussia, which hosts the football World Cup next month, has fought two wars with separatists in the mainly Muslim internal republic since the 1991 Soviet collapse, but such attacks have become relatively rare in Chechnya.\nThe wider North Caucasus region remains volatile, however, with unemployment and corruption pushing some to embrace radical Islam.
