Markets expect the central bank to hike rates again this summer, which could put additional pressure on highly indebted consumers.\nOverall, 13 cities saw higher prices in March, while 14 were flat or lower. The new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums.\nOttawa, the nation’s capital, saw the biggest increase, with prices up 1.3 percent. The higher prices may be due to higher employment and a tight resale market, the statistics agency said.\nAmong other major cities, prices in Calgary fell 0.4 percent as builders cited lower negotiated selling prices, while Vancouver, among the country’s most expensive housing markets, was unchanged for a third straight month.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T13:10:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
