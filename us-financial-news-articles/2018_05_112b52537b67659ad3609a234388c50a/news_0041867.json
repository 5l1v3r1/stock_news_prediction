The deals total about 1.5 million tonnes per year of LNG.\nChina overtook South Korea as the world’s second-largest LNG importer in 2017 with imports of 38 million tonnes, 46 percent higher than the year before. The imports soared after the government ordered millions of homes to switch to natural gas and electric heating from coal to counter rising air pollution.\nTo meet the higher demand and to reduce their dependence on supply from state-owned companies, Chinese companies are building their own LNG terminals to import the fuel directly.\nGuangzhou Gas Group, a local government-backed gas distributor and a major supplier to Guangzhou province, plans to build a 2 million-tonnes-per-year receiving terminal at the port of Nansha by 2020.\nState-run Sinopec Corp operates three LNG receiving terminals at the ports of Qingdao, Beihai and Tianjin, each with a import capacity of 3 million tonnes per year.\nSince the first LNG terminal in Guangdong province opened in 2006, China’s state-owned companies now operate over 50 million tonnes of annual import capacity.\nReporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:29:06.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
