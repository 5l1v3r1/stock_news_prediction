I absolutely want to hear from VW what their efforts to this end look like and how they make sure that such a thing (like the emissions scandal) will never happen again,” Grundler said.\nHandelsblatt also Quote: d Larry Thompson, the U.S. monitor appointed under the 2017 plea agreement to oversee VW for three years, as saying that he is “not at all satisfied” with the progress of culture change.\nVW was not immediately available for comment.
