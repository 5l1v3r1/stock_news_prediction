It is the impact of the rates rising facing an expensive capital markets.”\nAmong stocks, Walmart fell 3.3 percent after the retailer took a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion.\nWalt Disney dipped 1.6 percent despite reporting a quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.
