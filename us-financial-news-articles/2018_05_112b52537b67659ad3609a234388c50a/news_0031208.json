We are focusing on acquisitions,” Chief Financial Officer Daniel Burys said. “Probably we will start with activities on this divestment option in the next month.”\nOn a conference call, company executives said a potential divestment could negatively impact its dividend next year depending on the valuation of the Polish business.\nBut any sales was likely not to impact core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Burys said, as the Polish unit was loss-making last year.\nHe reiterated Kofola’s outlook for EBITDA to exceed 1 billion crowns in 2018.\nIn the coming months, Kofola is also likely to lift its free float, with the second biggest shareholder - CED Group, which is a subsidiary of private equity group Enterprise Investors - aiming for a private placement.
