The three countries were EU signatories of the 2015 deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program but which Trump dismissed as “the worst deal ever.”\nThe head of the bloc’s executive, Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, has also presented options the leaders have to shield European investments in Iran and the slowly reviving economic cooperation, which many EU states hope to benefit from.\nAn EU source said after the talks the leaders agreed to start “work to protect European companies negatively affected by the U.S. decision.”\nOptions include allowing the European Investment Bank to invest there and coordinating euro-denominated credit lines from EU states.
