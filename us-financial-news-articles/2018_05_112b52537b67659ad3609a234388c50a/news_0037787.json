But Dorsey argues that the Internet will eventually move to a currency standard that every person and company would ostensibly use to facilitate transactions.\n“Let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” Dorsey said.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nActually getting to a currency standard would likely take significant work and time. While Bitcoin is the most well known of cryptocurrencies, there are several others that have strong backing from the Internet community. And it’s nearly a guarantee that other big companies, like Apple , Google , and Amazon might have something to say about a future Internet currency standard before it’s ever chosen.\nFor his part, Dorsey has been one of the more outspoken proponents of Bitcoin and digital currencies. His digital payment company Square allows for Bitcoin transactions and the company actively buys and sells the digital currency.\nAnd by the sound of his comments, it doesn’t appear Dorsey is letting up on that support anytime soon.
