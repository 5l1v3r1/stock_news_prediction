The board includes ten nationally recognized Latino and African-American leaders across corporate, finance, political, technology and public policy sectors. The board has a mission to guide INSIKT through complex decisions of ethical, affordable and for-profit lending practices; collaboration with legislators to help underbanked communities; and strategies to guide low-income Americans away from predatory lenders.\nThe board is led by Tom Soto, Member of the Board of the New America Alliance, dedicated to advancing the economic development of the American Latino community across the United States. He is joined by Gene Sperling, who brings extensive expertise in the economic issues facing low-income Americans, having served as the Director of the National Economic Council under two presidential administrations.\n\"The INSIKT Advisory Board was formed to help the company balance the economic justice that underbanked communities deserve with the needs of a for-profit lending business. Predatory lenders are exploiting rather than representing the communities they serve, and low-income Americans need a better option to escape endless cycles of debt and build their own American Dream,\" said Tom Soto. \"This board is proud to help INSIKT navigate a complex environment so it can scale its lending business designed for borrower success. We've already begun to guide the leadership team in how to build trust with communities and policy makers that have become rightly distrustful of financial institutions.\"\nTom Soto will lead the Board's operations and internal communications.

He is currently Sr. Advisor to Aspiration, the country's fastest growing online financial services platform.\nGene Sperling has been appointed an independent director of INSIKT's Advisory Board, which includes serving as a liaison with the Board of Directors.
