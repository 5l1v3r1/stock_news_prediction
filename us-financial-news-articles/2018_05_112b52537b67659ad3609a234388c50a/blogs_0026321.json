We are sorry this error occurred, and upon discovery the issue was fixed and the total revenue share received from the third party fund companies (approximately $15,000) was returned to the pension fund. We have been in active dialogue with the client and have been committed to resolving this matter and are disappointed they felt the need to file a complaint requesting information we have provided and are very willing to provide.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-improperly-kept-a-pension-funds-fee-rebates-1525908574"], "published": "2018-05-10T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:16:03.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
