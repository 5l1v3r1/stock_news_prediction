They did not,” spokeswoman Elizabeth Luvonga said. Other dams on the same property, 190 km (120 miles) northwest of Nairobi, also lacked the necessary documents, she said.\n“None of them have permits. That is why they are illegal,” she said.\nReporting by Duncan Miriri; Editing by Ed Cropley\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T16:45:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
