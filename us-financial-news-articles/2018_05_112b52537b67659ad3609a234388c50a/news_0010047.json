Values had been surging at more than 20 percent a year at the peak of the boom.\nMelbourne saw a dip of 0.4 percent in the month, while annual growth slowed to 3.7 percent.\nHome prices outside the major cities edged up 0.4 percent in April to be 2.4 percent higher on the year. Combined, prices across the nation fell 0.1 percent for the month and were up a slight 0.2 percent for the year.\nThe slowdown in the major cities has been much desired by Australia’s bank watchdog which tightened standards on investment and interest-only loans, leading banks to raise rates on some mortgage products.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has also been concerned that debt-fuelled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks.
