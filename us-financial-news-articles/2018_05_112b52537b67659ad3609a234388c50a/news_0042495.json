Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday over the company’s handling of alleged data misuse and election interference on the platform, as the tech giant seeks to appease officials in a region where it is regulated strictly.\nThe event starts in Brussels around 6:30 p.m. local time, or 12:30 p.m. ET.
