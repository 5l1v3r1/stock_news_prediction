FILE PHOTO: Formula One - F1 - Azerbaijan Grand Prix - Baku City Circuit, Baku, Azerbaijan - April 29, 2018 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the race REUTERS/David Mdzinarishvili\nVettel is going for his fourth pole position in a row, and at a circuit that should be a proper benchmark of performance after a thrilling and sometimes chaotic first four races of the season.\nThe German has never before started from the top slot in Barcelona, however, whereas Hamilton — with more poles than anyone in the history of the sport (73) — has done so in three of the last four years and won twice.\nPole matters because only three of the last 17 races at the Circuit de Catalunya, albeit also three of the last seven, have been won from anywhere else on the grid.\nPast performance may provide some comfort to Hamilton but he knows his four-point advantage over fellow four times world champion Vettel owes a lot to luck and that Ferrari have true pace.\n“There’s two weird races which have kept us within the mix but you can’t rely on those for the 17 or however many are left,” Hamilton said after being gifted the win in Azerbaijan two weeks ago.\n“We need ultimate performance and confidence in the car,” added the reigning champion.\n“I’ve got the pace within me, the car has got the pace within it but we’re not unlocking it...we’ve definitely got to improve in lots of areas.”\nBarcelona, resurfaced with smoother asphalt but holding no surprises after weeks of pre-season testing there, could come as something of a relief to Vettel after two chaotic races off the podium following two wins.
