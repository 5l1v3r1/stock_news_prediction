Nobody, and certainly not me,” said Jean-Marc Salmon, a university sociologist who teamed up with like-minded academics, authors and artists to launch the petition.\nTrain services were disrupted for a 14th day since early April on Friday by stoppages that are taking place for two out of every five days.\nThe capacity of the unions to maintain the strike will depend as much on the durability of their and their workers’ finances as on accumulating political capital.\nThe reform of the SNCF is the biggest since France’s nationalization of the railways in 1937; it will phase out the SNCF monopoly in domestic passenger rail and end hiring on more protective contracts than in other sectors.\nSNCF management said the share of staff striking had dropped to 17 percent this week from more than 30 percent when stoppages began on April 3.\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe is set to meet union chiefs on Monday. Analysts believe the government may try to win over the more moderate unions and break the united front that the four main unions have maintained so far.\nSNCF debt tops 46 billion euros, much of it blamed on heavy investment in France’s much-admired TGV high-speed train network at the expense of a far bigger secondary rail network which the company admits neglecting over recent years.\nLosses due to the current wave of strikes total about 250 million euros, according to the SNCF.
