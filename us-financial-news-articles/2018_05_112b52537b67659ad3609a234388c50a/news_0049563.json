Italy’s FTSE MIB index fell 0.7 percent to a fresh 7-week low after coalition parties called for the naming of a eurosceptic economy minister.\nGerman carmakers Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen dropped 1.7 to 2.8 percent after the United States began a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs.\nGermany’s benchmark DAX index fell 0.9 percent and Europe’s autos sector was the worst-performing, losing 1.8 percent.\nDeutsche Bank touched its lowest level since September 2016, ending 4.8 percent down after saying it would cut thousands of staff in a revamp of its investment bank.\nAnalysts at KBW Research said in a note they found Deutsche Bank’s finalised business review “disappointing”, adding: “With the revenue loss from front office staff headcount reductions and expectations already at management target levels, we believe this is priced in and therefore leaves execution risk.”\nDeutsche Bank’s shares are down more than 31 percent so far this year.\nAryzta was a standout faller among individual stocks. Its shares slumped 27 percent after the Swiss food company cut its full-year earnings outlook once more.\nIndustrial distribution firm Electrocomponents jumped 16 percent after reporting double-digit growth in annual revenue and profit, while food ingredients firm Tate & Lyle rose 7 percent after posting higher annual profits.
