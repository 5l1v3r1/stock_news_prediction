Singh, who began the two-day visit to North Korea on Tuesday, reiterated New Delhi’s support for peace initiatives on the peninsula, the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.\nSingh met the vice-president of the presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly, Kim Yong Dae, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and Culture Minister Pak Chun Nam, among others, it said.\n“The DPRK side provided an overview of some of the recent developments in the Korean Peninsula,” the foreign ministry statement said, using the acronym of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\nOn Wednesday, however, North Korea said it might reconsider next month’s meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and its supreme leader Kim Jong Un if Washington insists it unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.\nThe North’s official KCNA news agency said Pyongyang had called off high-level talks with Seoul due on Wednesday.\nIndian analysts said New Delhi could play a bit role in peacekeeping on the peninsula because it had kept its channels of communication open with the North.\nLast year, when then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the issue of India’s diplomatic relations with North Korea, India said they were minimal and aimed at keeping open some channels of communication with the reclusive state.\n“India is the only major country in the region that is not a party to the problem but which has good contacts with the North,” said Prashant Kumar Singh, a specialist on India’s ties with Pyongyang at the Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses.\nThe foreign ministry said the two sides had decided during Singh’s visit to explore cooperation in vocational education, agriculture, pharmaceuticals and promotion of yoga.\nEditing by Sanjeev Miglani and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:19:13.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
