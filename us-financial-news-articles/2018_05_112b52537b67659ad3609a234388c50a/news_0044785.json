The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.26 percent.\nIn the short term, analysts said they expect stocks to continue to trend higher barring a major negative event.\n“This is an indication of what we’ll see near term, because we are through earnings, relatively light on macro data, and with geopolitics, it seems like some of the emotion has been reduced between now and the Korean summit,” said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.\nThe U.S.-China trade news also boosted the U.S. dollar to a five-month high as investors further pared back short positions on the greenback.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.05 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.03 percent to $1.1771.\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback to 111.09 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3413, down 0.43 percent on the day.\nThe yen was pressured by recent weaker Japanese data, the U.S.-China trade war easing and elevated U.S. Treasury yields, analysts said.\nThe euro has suffered amid concerns about political uncertainty in Italy.\nItaly’s far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and to implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of the country’s debt pile.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield IT10YT=RR rose to its highest since April 2017 before easing back.\nOil prices reversed course from choppier early trading and climbed on Iran and Venezuela concerns.\nU.S. crude CLcv1 rose 1.36 percent to $72.25 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $79.16, up 0.83 percent on the day.\nExpectations that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the country’s crude exports have led crude prices higher in recent weeks, and the market is now weighing the possibility of additional sanctions on Venezuela following its presidential election.
