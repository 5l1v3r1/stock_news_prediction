I believe every young conservative should consider attending a college like Pomona, where the adversity I faced paid extraordinary dividends.\nA shy and insecure freshman, I realized quickly that my political views were unwelcome. One night I copied a quote from Thomas Sowell onto the whiteboard outside my dorm room. In the morning someone had scrawled “BIGOT” across Mr. Sowell’s reasoned critique of the welfare state. Upon learning of my views, my peers would turn cold, sometimes angry. When I told some classmates I supported the Second Amendment, one young woman turned red and gritted her teeth. “You wanted those kids in Newtown to die!” she spat. “You killed them!”\nFaculty members were sometimes intolerant, too. When I signed up for a course with a well-known conservative at one of Pomona’s sister colleges, I received an email from my then-adviser, a history professor, who labeled his colleague an “ignorant . . . reactionary neocon” and demanded to know why I’d take a course from someone “so backwards.” Swallowing my shock, I thanked him for the warning—and took the course anyway.\nFacing such hostility is difficult. Many times I found myself anxious that the friends I made, the women I dated and the instructors I respected would despise me if I expressed myself honestly. But I soon recognized that people worth having in my corner would not write me off because of my politics—and there were many professors, peers and mentors at Pomona who recognized the benefit of grappling with challenging perspectives. “I wish that Pomona admitted more students like you,” one of my closest friends, a committed progressive, told me over dinner last year. “What can I learn from people who already agree with me?”\nFor me, what made Pomona inhospitable at times was also what made it valuable. There are great conservative colleges, and I’m sure I would have had a fine experience at one of them. But I would not have grown so much without the challenges I encountered. I would not have had to defend my views in every class; I would not have developed a thicker skin; I would not have developed the inner confidence I now carry with me each day.\nIf conservatives and liberals refuse to attend college together, resolving instead to lock themselves within their respective ideological silos, how can we expect to live and govern together? To the high schoolers out there, this is not to say that the fate of American democracy rests upon the choice you make this spring or the next. But if your experience comes to be anything like mine, should you choose to attend a place like Pomona, you will look back fondly on the challenge you embraced. And for the friends you make in college, your being different will make all the difference.\nMr. Reade is an editor-in-chief emeritus of the Claremont Independent.
