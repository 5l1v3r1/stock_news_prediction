Lehtikuva/Antti Aimo-Koivisto via REUTERS Fortum sought EU approval on May 7, according to the European Commission website. The EU competition enforcer can approve the deal unconditionally or demand concessions. It can also open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns.\nThe deal was cleared by Russian authorities last month. Uniper is against the Fortum bid, saying it makes little sense as it focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants while Fortum targets clean technologies.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:40:35.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
