Funds overall have averaged a 2 percent gain for the year.\nAs for individual stocks, there were some interesting trends.\nFirst and foremost, there's been little shifting of stocks in and out — what is referred to among managers as \"turnover\" — as the biggest bets are providing the best returns.\nWhile Facebook remains the most popular stock for managers, it also increased its popularity more than any other name during the first quarter.\nGoldman strategist Ben Snider said the growth in popularity came \"with hedge funds viewing the stock's volatility as a buying opportunity.\" Indeed, despite a torrent of negative headlines, Facebook shares are up 4.4 percent year to date, nearly double the S&P 500's performance though considerably below the more than 10 percent jump in the technology sector.\nOther most popular adds were Microsoft, Aetna, Monsanto and XL Group. Stocks that saw the biggest decline in hedge fund ownership included Amazon, Apple, McDonald's, Citigroup and Schlumberger.\nHedge fund ownership has turned highly concentrated, with an average 68 percent in holdings coming from the top 10 positions. The record is 69 percent set in the first half of 2016.\nTurnover has been restrained, with just 13 new stocks entering a basket of the 50 most-held positions that Goldman tracks.\nManagers also have been busy covering short positions, as the most-shorted stocks have been outperformers. Snider said energy stocks with the biggest bets again them have surged 30 percent since the start of the second quarter.\nWATCH: Big name hedge funds pile into Facebook show chapters Big-name hedge funds pile into Facebook, sell Apple shares 5:53 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 01:01", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:47:42.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
