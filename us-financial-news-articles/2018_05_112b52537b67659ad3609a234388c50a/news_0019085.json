REUTERS/Yuri Gripas The Governing Council needs more data to make a call on this, he added.\nInvestors have been wondering whether weaker growth and inflation in the euro zone this year would test the ECB’s resolve in dialing back its aggressive stimulus measures.\n“In terms of soft data and some of the hard data, the question is whether it is something just to acknowledge and accept as running out of room, versus a demand issue, which would trigger more questions,” Lane, the governor of the Irish Central Bank, told journalists in Dublin.\n“But let’s see.
