I’ll do everything I can to contribute to the project and hopefully I’ll be among the front runners.\nFormula E’s 2018/19 season, the fifth since the series launched, will bring the debut of the Gen2 car that can hit a top speed of 280kph and will have sufficient battery power to last an entire race.\nDrivers have to switch cars mid-race at present in the city-based series.\nFormer F1 champion Nico Rosberg is an investor in Formula E, while a number of other ex-F1 drivers are competing in the championship, including Massa’s former Sauber team mate Nick Heidfeld.
