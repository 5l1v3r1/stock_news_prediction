(NASDAQ:BWEN) reported sales of $30.0 million in Q1 2018, down 47% compared to $56.1 million in Q1 2017. The sharp decrease was primarily due to a $32.1 million decrease in Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment revenue due to a 64% reduction in tower sections sold, as the two tower production facilities were restarting operations following a near shutdown in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a lower average sales price on the product mix sold. Partially offsetting were increased sales for the Gearing segment, up 127% compared to Q1 2017 due to the strong demand from oil and gas customers, and higher Process Systems revenue, due to the recovery in mining and other industrial markets.\nThe Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $4.8 million, or $.32 per share, in Q1 2018, compared to a net income from continuing operations of $6.5 million, or $.43 per share, in Q1 2017. The prior-year quarter included a $5.1 million, or $.34 per share income tax benefit due primarily to the partial release of a tax valuation allowance related to the Red Wolf acquisition. The remaining difference is primarily due to low tower production in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company reported near break-even results from discontinued operations in Q1 2018, compared to net loss from discontinued operations of $.2 million in Q1 2017. The Company reported non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based payments and restructuring costs) of $1.6 million in Q1 2018, compared to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 million in Q1 2017 (please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release). The $5.5 million decrease was mainly attributable to significantly lower production volume in the Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment, partly offset by improvements in the other business segments.\nBroadwind CEO Stephanie Kushner stated, “We are regaining our footing after a very difficult second half of 2017. We booked $28 million in orders during Q1 2018, which included the first significant tower order in a year following an inventory correction triggered by the merger of our two large tower customers. Our operational leaders did a good job restarting production in our tower plants following a near shutdown last year. Our visibility has improved, although our capacity utilization will only gradually recover this year and we are monitoring the steel tariff impact carefully. We are on track with our 2018 customer diversification initiative of more than $40 million in orders outside of our core customer base.\nKushner continued, “Our Gearing segment is off to a strong start, with first quarter revenue more than double last year. With the resurgence in demand from oil and gas customers, we are continuing to deal with supply chain constraints and general growing pains, which we expect to iron out as the year progresses. Our order visibility is significantly improved in this segment, as customers have secured production slots in response to the threat of rising input costs and lengthening material lead times, and our production is largely booked out for 2018.\nFollowing the decision to exit the CNG market, we will consolidate into one production facility in Abilene, Texas, where we will produce both towers and other heavy fabrications, which will save us about $600 thousand in manufacturing overhead annually.”\nKushner concluded, “As our tower business recovers and our gearing and heavy fabrications orders accelerate, we expect consolidated Q2 revenue to rise to $36-38 million and to return to positive EBITDA generation.”\nOrders and Backlog\nThe Company booked $28.1 million of net new orders in Q1 2018, compared to $40.0 million in Q1 2017. Towers and Heavy Fabrications orders, which vary considerably from quarter to quarter, totaled $7.8 million in Q1 2018, down from $29.1 million in Q1 2017. Gearing orders totaled $15.4 million in Q1 2018, more than double Q1 2017 orders of $7.3 million, as a result of increased orders from oil & gas and industrial customers. Process Systems orders totaled $4.9 million in Q1 2018 compared to $3.6 million in Q1 2017 as a result of the timing of the Red Wolf acquisition in the prior year.\nAt March 31, 2018, total backlog was $136.3 million, compared to $138.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nSegment Results\nTowers and Heavy Fabrications (formerly known as Towers and Weldments)\nBroadwind Energy produces fabrications for wind, oil and gas, mining and other industrial applications, specializing in the production of wind turbine towers.\nTowers and Heavy Fabrications segment sales totaled $16.8 million in Q1 2018, compared to $48.9 million in Q1 2017. The significant decrease was due to a 64% reduction in tower sections sold as our largest customer halted orders beginning in Q2 2017 in order to work off excess inventory, and a lower average sales price on the product mix sold. This was partially offset by increased heavy fabrications volume due primarily to an expanded customer base and the recovery in mining and other industrial markets. The Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment operating loss totaled $1.5 million in Q1 2018 compared to operating income of $5.8 million in Q1 2017. The significant reduction was primarily due to operating at a low capacity level, a less favorable product mix and significant start-up costs related to the quick production ramp up from near shutdown levels in Q4 2017. These factors were partially offset by $1.3 million in savings attributable to reduced labor and overhead expense. The net loss for the Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment totaled $1.1 million in Q1 2018, compared to net income of $4.0 million in Q1 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2018 was a loss of $.1 million compared to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $7.0 million in Q1 2017. The decrease was due to the factors described above.\nGearing\nBroadwind Energy engineers, builds and remanufactures precision gears and gearboxes for oil and gas, mining, steel, wind and other specialized applications.\nGearing segment sales totaled $8.8 million in Q1 2018, compared to $3.9 million in Q1 2017. The $4.9 million increase was due to successful expansion of the customer base and continued strong sales to oil & gas and other industrial customers related to the rebound in these markets. The operating loss narrowed to $.6 million in Q1 2018, compared to $1.5 million in Q1 2017. The improvement was due to the increase in revenue noted above, partially offset by the residual impact of supply chain delays that led to operating inefficiencies, and higher manufacturing variances to support the increased production. The net loss for the Gearing segment totaled $.6 million in Q1 2018, compared to $1.5 million in Q1 2017. The Gearing segment reported slightly positive Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2018 compared to a Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $.9 million in Q1 2017. The $.9 million improvement was due to the factors described above (please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release).\nProcess Systems\nBroadwind Energy designs and manufactures custom, modular systems for compression, filtration and other specialized process applications for the global market. On February 1, 2017, the Company acquired Red Wolf which has been combined with the Abilene-based compressed natural gas (“CNG”) and fabrication business, previously reported as a part of Towers and Heavy Fabrications, to form the Process Systems segment.\nThe Company acquired Red Wolf on February 1, 2017, therefore the 2017 results included only a partial quarter for that operation. Process Systems revenue totaled $4.4 million in Q1 2018 compared to $3.3 million in Q1 2017 due to the recovery in mining and other industrial markets. The operating loss totaled $.9 million in Q1 2018 compared to $.8 million in Q1 2017 due to a less favorable product mix.\nCorporate\nCorporate and other expenses totaled $1.5 million in Q1 2018, down from $1.9 million in Q1 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation and lower salaries and benefits expense due to reduced staffing.\nCash and Liquidity\nDuring Q1 2018, operating working capital (accounts receivable and inventory, net of accounts payable and customer deposits) increased to $14.3 million as production levels increased to support higher scheduled tower deliveries.\nCapital expenditures, net of disposals, in Q1 2018 totaled $.3 million.\nDebt and capital leases totaled $21.2 million at March 31, 2018, including the $2.6 million New Markets Tax Credit loan, which is expected to be substantially forgiven when it matures in Q3 18. The Company was not in compliance with the minimum EBITDA covenant of its credit facility as of March 31, 2018. On May 3, 2018, the Company and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”) executed an amendment to the loan agreement waiving compliance with this covenant. The Company’s $25 million line of credit with CIBC had a balance of $14.2 million at March 31, 2018 and $9.9 million of availability.\nCash assets (cash and short-term investments) remained near zero as expected because the Company’s cash and receipts are automatically applied to the outstanding credit line balance consistent with the terms of the line.\nAbout Broadwind Energy, Inc.\nBroadwind Energy (NASDAQ:BWEN) is a precision manufacturer of structures, equipment and components for clean tech and other specialized applications.

The Company’s management uses adjusted EBITDA when it internally evaluates the performance of the Company’s business, reviews financial trends and makes operating and strategic decisions. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it provides investors with a better understanding of the Company’s past financial performance and future results allows investors to evaluate the Company’s performance using the same methodology and information as used by the Company’s management.
