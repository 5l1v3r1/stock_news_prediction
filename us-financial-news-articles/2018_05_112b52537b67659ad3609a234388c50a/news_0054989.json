Johnson can be heard chuckling on the other end of the line.\nLater in the call, Johnson said he would like to come to Armenia to find out more about “Armenia’s Novichok experiences”, and they also talk about sanctions against Russia and high-profile individuals.\n“You throw a stone in Kensington and you’ll hit an oligarch,” Johnson said, in reference to the central London district favoured by Russian tycoons. “Some of them are close to Putin and some of them aren’t.”\nJohnson is no stranger to controversy. In the run-up to Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership, he compared the goals of the European Union to those of Adolf Hitler and Napoleon, causing consternation in European capitals.\nAlso in 2016, Johnson wrote a controversial poem about Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, involving wild oats and a goat, which the prankster complimented him on.\n“You’re very kind,” Johnson said, before trying to bring the call to a close. Some minutes later, as the prankster is talking, the line goes quiet.\n“The Foreign Secretary realised it was a hoax and ended the call. We checked it out and knew immediately it was a prank call,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.\n“The use of chemical weapons in Salisbury and Syria, and recent events in Armenia are serious matters. These childish actions show the lack of seriousness of the caller and those behind him.”\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:22:03.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
