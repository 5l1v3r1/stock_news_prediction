Noor, who was freed on $400,000 bail, faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges.\nNoor’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, previously said his client should not have been charged and he was simply following his training. Noor has offered Damond’s family his condolences for their loss.\nDamond, who was living in Minneapolis, called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her house, and she approached the police after their arrival, authorities said. Noor then “recklessly” fired his handgun, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said after the officer’s arrest in March.\nMatthew Harrity, the officer driving the police car from which Noor shot, said he was startled by a loud sound and both officers “got spooked” when Damond appeared out of nowhere, prosecutors said.

REUTERS/Craig Lassig/File Photo\nThe shooting drew condemnation in Minnesota and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called it “inexplicable.” Then-Minneapolis police Chief Janee Harteau resigned after city officials said procedures had been violated and Damond “didn’t have to die.”\nThe penalty for third-degree murder is up to 25 years in prison and second-degree manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 10 years.\nDamond, also known as Justine Ruszczyk, had taken the name of her fiance, Don Damond, ahead of their planned August 2017 wedding. She owned a meditation and life-coaching company. FILE PHOTO: Mohamed Noor, 32, is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters March 20, 2018.
