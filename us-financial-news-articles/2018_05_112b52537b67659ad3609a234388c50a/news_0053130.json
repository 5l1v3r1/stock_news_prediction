Data center is Lenovo’s third-largest segment.\n“I think our data center business’ momentum is much stronger. If we continue this, definitely we will break even soon,” he told Reuters.\nOverall business conditions, however, continue to be tough as indicated by Gartner data that shows worldwide PC shipments fell 1.4 percent from a year ago in January through March, the 14th consecutive quarter of decline for the industry.\nLenovo’s net profit over the three months plunged 69 percent to $33 million, but beat a consensus estimate of $27.7 million.\nRevenue for the period rose 11 percent - best pace of growth since the second quarter of 2015.\nThe company's shares, which will be removed from the Hang Seng Index next month, closed up about 2 percent, versus a 0.3 percent gain for the wider market .HSI .\nReporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:33:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
