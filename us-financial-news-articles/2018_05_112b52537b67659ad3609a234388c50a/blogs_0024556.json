By 2001, the company had raised over $32 million in investments and, in 2004, it went public in Hong Kong . Then, in 2011, Tencent debuted its mobile-only messaging app WeChat as a separate entity from QQ . It has since been dubbed \" the one app to rule them all .\"\nWeChat is often compared to Facebook because of its ubiquity in China, where Facebook is banned along with its messaging service WhatsApp . But WeChat's \"super app\" model also goes even further than Facebook for its nearly 1 billion monthly active users , allowing them to text, call, play games, send money, shop, pay at restaurants, hail cab rides and even engage in online dating .\nTencent has branched out successfully into other arenas as well, such as cloud providers, artificial intelligence ventures and entertainment. Epic Games, a subsidiary of Tencent Games, produces the massively popular battle royale game \" Fortnite .\" Tencent is now spending $15 million to bring it to China, according to Variety . Even without that lucrative market, \"Fortnite\" has been a phenomenon: It reportedly made $126 million in February just through in-app purchases.\nLast year, Tencent became the first Asian tech firm to be valued at over $500 billion and is now Asia's most valuable public company .

The two companies are competing to dominate China's trillion-dollar mobile payment market through services like Ten Pay and Alipay.\nAlthough the rivals have traded criticisms , Alibaba CEO Jack Ma , who is not related to Pony Ma, said last year that he appreciates the competition because it allows them to learn from one another. Pony Ma has recalled that he and Jack Ma were like \"younger brothers\" when their companies were gaining traction.\nThe two business moguls have competed for the title of China's richest person since August . Even now, while Forbes puts Pony Ma slightly ahead of Jack Ma, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index gives the Alibaba CEO the edge, calculating that his net worth surpasses Pony Ma's by $8 billion to $10 billion.", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/fortnite-tencent-china-1202785279/", "https://sampi.co/most-popular-chinese-dating-apps/", "http://fortune.com/2017/12/06/tencent-alibaba-china-pony-jack-ma/", "https://www.tencent.com/en-us/articles/1600069.html", "https://www.techinasia.com/history-of-wechat", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJlHqPqf6k8", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2018/03/28/is-alipay-losing-to-wechat-in-chinas-trillion-dollar-payment-war/#1483af328822", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2017/08/07/tencent-chairman-ma-huateng-overtakes-alibabas-jack-ma-as-chinas-richest-man/#3144140a7f56", "http://www.businessinsider.com/wechat-has-hit-1-billion-monthly-active-users-2018-3", "https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/facebook-on-course-to-be-the-wechat-of-the-west-says-gartner/", "https://www.fastcompany.com/3029119/tencent-the-secretive-chinese-tech-giant-that-can-rival-facebook-a", "https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/", "https://blog.ycombinator.com/lessons-from-wechat/", "http://fortune.com/2018/03/22/naspers-tencent-cashing-in/", "https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17148918/fortnite-battle-royale-pubg-monthly-revenue-sales-126-million-superdata-research"], "published": "2018-05-10T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T21:27:00.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
