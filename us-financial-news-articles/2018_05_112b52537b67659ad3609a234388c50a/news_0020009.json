So in the long run, the dollar is likely to decline,” said a currency trader at a Japanese bank.\nTraders also kept an eye on the fate of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal, from which Trump has threatened to pull out.\nAn escalating diplomatic standoff could have innumerable repercussions, including a further rise in oil prices and damage to investors’ risk appetite.\nTrump has said that unless European allies rectify “flaws” in Tehran’s deal with world powers by May 12 he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief for Iran.\nElsewhere, the British pound traded at $1.3538, near its four-month low of $1.3487 touched on Tuesday.\nThe dollar stood little changed at 109.10 yen, off its three-month high of 110.05 yen.\nThe yen’s rebound was in part driven by short-covering by Japanese margin traders, especially against the Turkish lira , which fell to record lows during Japan’s Golden Week holidays.\nThe lira fell more than 4 percent last week versus the dollar.
