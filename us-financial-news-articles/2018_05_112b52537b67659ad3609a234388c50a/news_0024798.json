When they arrived, most were abandoned without the jobs and accommodation they had been promised.\n“The fact that they are foreign makes them vulnerable to being victims of other crimes,” Zarate told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, saying Haitian migrants were at heightened risk of being trafficked into forced labor or sex work.\nHaitian Wadner Maignan works for the Jesuit Service for Migrants, which provides support and legal advice to migrants in Santiago.\nHe says Haitian men often end up working on construction sites and in factories where they are victims of labor exploitation and abuse.\n“They tell me: I don’t get a break at work, they treat me badly, they don’t pay us well - this is very common,” said the 29-year-old, who arrived in Chile three years ago.\nLast month Chile tightened its rules on migration for Haitians and other nationals, citing a need to stem rising illegal immigration.\nIn recent years, Chile has also become a leading destination for migrants from the Dominican Republic, a trend apparent since 2013 said prosecutor Zarate, who is currently investigating a case of two women from the Dominican trafficked into sex work.\nZarate said traffickers made false promises of domestic or retail work to women who were forced into prostitution in the capital’s bars and brothels after arriving to find the jobs did not exist and their passports seized.\n“It’s quite a common situation in Santiago ... women are offered work in a certain way, however it’s to use these women for sexual services,” she said.\nThere have been few convictions for sex trafficking and forced labor involving migrants because most victims do not report it, she said.\n“Unfortunately, people often don’t feel they are victims, for them it’s a form of work,” Zarate said.\n“Getting convictions depends also on a victims’ commitment to continue with an investigation to get results.”\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Claire Cozens.
