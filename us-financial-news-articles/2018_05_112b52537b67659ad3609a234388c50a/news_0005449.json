(TSX:BEP.UN) (NYSE:BEP) (“ Brookfield Renewable ”) today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n“Our business delivered strong results in the first quarter, underpinned by growth in our core business and recent acquisitions which are performing in-line with expectations,” said Sachin Shah, CEO of Brookfield Renewable. “In addition, we continue to have a strong, investment-grade balance sheet with a robust liquidity position and long duration, non-recourse debt providing us with significant financial flexibility as we look forward.”\nFinancial Results For the period ended March 31 US$ millions (except per unit or otherwise noted) Three Months Ended Unaudited 2018 2017 Total generation (GWh) - Actual generation 12,880 10,484 - Long-term average generation 12,852 10,364 Brookfield Renewable's share - Actual generation 6,694 6,161 - Long-term average generation 6,351 5,889 Funds From Operations (FFO) (1) $ 193 $ 166 Per Unit (1) (2) $ 0.62 $ 0.55 Net Income Attributable to Unitholders $ 8 $ 16 Per Unit (2) $ 0.03 $ 0.05 (1) Non-IFRS measure. Refer to “Cautionary Statement Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Measures”.\n(2) For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the weighted average LP Units, Redeemable/Exchangeable partnership units and GP interest totaled 312.7 million (2017: 299.2 million).\nBrookfield Renewable reported net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $8 million ($0.03 per LP unit) compared to net income of $16 million ($0.05 per LP unit) for the same period in 2017. Funds From Operations (FFO) totaled $193 million ($0.62 per LP unit) compared to $166 million ($0.55 per LP unit) for the same period in 2017, representing a 13% year-over-year per unit increase in FFO. These results were supported by high availability across our fleet, above average generation, contributions from new investments and advancement of organic growth initiatives.\nOperating and Financial Results\nIn the first quarter, our hydroelectric segment delivered $208 million of FFO as generation and availability remained strong across our fleet. Total generation was 6% above the long-term average primarily on the back of our North American facilities where, consistent with prior year, generation was particularly strong (10% above the long-term average). Pricing across our hydro portfolio benefitted from inflation indexation of our contracts as well as improved power prices in Brazil driving our average realized pricing up 6% versus last year. Our power marketing teams continue to actively pursue opportunities to sell energy, capacity and related products at a premium to current market prices. We successfully cleared all our eligible capacity into the recent capacity auction in New England, secured new power purchase agreements for our existing assets in Brazil and continued to add duration at our Colombian business by securing several new long-term contracts this quarter. Lastly, we continue to advance our development pipeline, substantially commissioning our 28 megawatt facility in Brazil and progressed construction on an additional 49 megawatts in Brazil.\nOur wind segment delivered $37 million of FFO in the first quarter – $7 million ahead of prior year largely due to the contributions from our investments in TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global. Generation across our wind fleet was in-line with prior year on a same-store basis as our operations benefitted from a high degree of diversification. We also benefitted from 50 megawatts of new wind capacity that we commissioned in Europe in 2017. We continue to leverage our marketing expertise in Brazil to re-contract existing facilities in the free market at higher prices than the current regulated market. We also received regulatory approval to increase the interconnection capacity from our newly acquired Brazilian wind farms, which should result in an incremental 24 gigawatt-hours per year of generation. In Europe, we continue to progress, in aggregate, 47 megawatts of wind development projects in Ireland and Scotland.\nQ1 represented the first full quarter of contributions from our newly acquired solar facilities from TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global, contributing $10 million to FFO. The facilities have been performing well, with high availability and generation in-line with expectations. During the quarter, we also announced a 50:50 joint venture with China's largest warehouse operator to develop rooftop solar on their logistics facilities in the country. Through this partnership, we are targeting to develop and operate 300 megawatts of capacity over the next three years, and based on our estimates of GLP's rooftop space, believe there is a broader 1-gigawatt development pipeline. This partnership represents an opportunity to expand our footprint in China in a measured way, as well as grow our capabilities in the commercial and industrial distributed generation sector.\nOur storage facilities delivered $5 million of FFO during the first quarter, which benefitted from our investment in the First Hydro pumped storage facilities in the U.K. in the second half of 2017 and improved capacity pricing at our Bear Swamp facilities in New England. Our First Hydro facilities continued to have strong availability particularly during the period of very cold weather in March, highlighting the value of these facilities as essential providers of scale, back-up generation and ancillary services. We are leveraging our deep operating expertise to work with our partner to optimize revenues through asset operations, dispatch and trading, which should augment performance over time. We progressed an upgrade to the capacity of our Bear Swamp pumped storage facility in Massachusetts by 60 megawatts to a total of 660 megawatts. As part of this process, we secured a seven-year contract for the capacity from the upgrade and expect to commission the project in 2021.\nBalance Sheet, Liquidity and Interest Rates\nOur liquidity position at quarter end totaled $1.7 billion and we maintained access to diverse sources of capital. We took advantage of strong markets earlier in the quarter and raised $1.5 billion in the markets. This included $1.3 billion of non-recourse financings, which extended the average duration of our non-recourse debt to 10.3 years and reduced our average cost of non-recourse debt to 5.8%.\nWe continue to focus on maintaining a strong, investment grade balance sheet with ample liquidity to ensure downside protection, preservation of capital, and stable cash flows through economic cycles:\nBy underwriting our projects with long-term fixed rate debt, the current rising interest rate environment does not affect the expected returns on our investments Following our recent financings, we have no material maturities in the near term\nWe have minimal interest rate exposure having locked in low, long-term rates over the last several years. Today only 13% of our debt is floating rate, of which less than 6% is in North America and Europe. As such, our business is well protected from a rising rate environment.\nDistribution Declaration\nThe next quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.49 per LP Unit, is payable on June 29, 2018 to unitholders of record as at the close of business on May 31, 2018. Brookfield Renewable targets a sustainable distribution with increases targeted on average at 5% to 9% annually.\nThe regular quarterly dividends on Brookfield Renewable’s preferred shares and preferred LP units have also been declared.\nDistribution Currency Option\nThe quarterly distributions payable on the Partnership’s LP Units are declared in U.S. dollars.
