But jobs there will be, he said.\n“I see a much more dramatic impact from the computerization of the dashboard than from driverless cars,” Harker said. He did not comment on monetary policy or the economic outlook in his prepared remarks.\nReporting by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:31:10.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
