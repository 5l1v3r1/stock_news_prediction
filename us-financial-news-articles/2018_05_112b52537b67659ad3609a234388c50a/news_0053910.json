However for many companies it was a huge wakeup call because they never did their homework. They never took the data protection directive seriously.”\nActivists are already planning to leverage the right to access one’s data to turn the tables on large internet platforms whose business model relies on processing people’s personal information.\nThat means companies are having to put in place processes for dealing with such requests and educating their workforce because any non-compliance could lead to stiff sanctions.\nStudies suggest that many companies are not ready for the new rules.\nThe International Association of Privacy Professionals found that only 40 percent of companies affected by the GDPR expected to be fully compliant by May 25.\nRIGHT TO DATA PORTABILITY\nIt is unclear how many provisions of GDPR will be interpreted and enforced. A patchwork of European regulatory authorities, many of whom say they are under-funded, will oversee the new law, with a central body to resolve conflicts. Related Coverage New privacy law forces some U.S. media offline in Europe\nOne key provision of GDPR, the right to data portability, is causing particular confusion.\nLawyers and experts say it is not clear how far the right for individuals to move their data from one service provider to another will stretch.\n“I think the data portability rights are pretty significant and are going to take a while for people to figure out what the bounds of them are and how to go about complying with them,” said David Hoffman, Director of Security Policy and Global Privacy Officer at Intel.\nFor example, music streaming services like Spotify create playlists for users based on their music preferences. While a user seeking to exercise the data portability right would be able to move playlists he or she created, the situation becomes fuzzy if the playlists are created by the streaming service using algorithms.\nEU data protection authorities said individuals should be able to transfer data provided by them but not “derived data” created by the service provider such as algorithmic results.\nTanguy Van Overstraeten of Linklaters said the data portability right could raise issues of intellectual property.\n“It’s not obvious that you can necessarily migrate the data from your system to somebody else’s system,” he said.\nINCREASED LIABILITY\nOn the business side, companies are rushing to renegotiate contracts with suppliers and service providers because GDPR increases their liability if something goes wrong.\nUnder the current rules it is generally the company that determines the purposes of data collection that is directly liable for any breaches.\nGDPR changes that, and data processors which only process or store the data on behalf of their clients, for example cloud computing providers, will be directly liable for sanctions and could face lawsuits from individuals, and that needs to be reflected in contracts.\nCompanies can have hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of agreements which need to be revisited to ensure they comply with GDPR.

Am I a data controller or data processor?’” Van Eecke said.
