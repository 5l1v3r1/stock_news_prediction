One section of the motorway will have eight lanes, another six lanes and a third will have four lanes.\nThe European Union, the French Development Agency and the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) have said they could offer funding for the project in a mix of credit and grants.\nReporting by Elias Biryabarema Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:17:39.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
