REUTERS/Juan Medina However, Ciudadanos would be open to proposing a second motion of no-confidence with an independent candidate and an eye to calling an early election, Albert Rivera said in an interview with COPE radio station.\nSpanish political parties are taking advantage of Rajoy’s weak minority party and a court ruling last week that sentenced dozens of people linked to his conservative People’s Party (PP) to decades in prison in a long-running corruption trial.\nSpain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy answers a question during a cabinet control session at Parliament in Madrid, Spain, May 30, 2018.

But opposition parties are expected to continue to try to oust him even if Friday’s no-confidence vote fails.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “Even if no successful motion is passed to oust Rajoy, the risk of early elections before the end of the year has increased significantly,” said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence.\n“If an early election is held before year-end, a centrist, market-friendly and pro-European government would be the most likely result,” he added.\nFriday’s motion of no-confidence has been proposed by the Socialists, with their leader Pedro Sanchez as the alternative candidate for leader.\nHowever, without Ciudadanos, Sanchez must seek the support of small regional parties including Catalan forces seeking independence from Spain. Leftist party Podemos has said it will support the Socialist motion of no-confidence.\nRivera dismissed these potential partners on Wednesday as “separatists and populists”.\n“A strong legitimate government arising from elections will give much more stability to Spain than a ‘Frankenstein government’ with a parliamentary minority,” he said.\nAdditional reporting by Rodrigo de Miguel; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:37:21.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
