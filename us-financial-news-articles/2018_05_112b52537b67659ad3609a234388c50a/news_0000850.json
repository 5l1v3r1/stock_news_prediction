REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\nThe global mining conglomerate said in February it may accelerate expansion of its African zinc operations to take advantage of a surge in prices of the metal.\nZinc prices have rallied to their highest since 2007, boosting overall profits of Vedanta, which has zinc projects in India, South Africa and Namibia.\nThe company could invest between $700 million and $800 million at the Gamsberg refinery, Vedanta Zinc International said bit.ly/2Kxxt14.\nThe first phase of the smelter-refinery complex is expected to have a capacity of 250,000 tonnes per year of finished zinc metal, matching Gamsberg’s expected annual output by early 2019.\nThe smelting plant will make Gamsberg, one of the world’s largest undeveloped zinc resource, a fully integrated zinc production site.
