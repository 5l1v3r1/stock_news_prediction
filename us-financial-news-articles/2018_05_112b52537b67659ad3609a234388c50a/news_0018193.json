(NYSE:RGR) announced today that for the first quarter of 2018 the Company reported net sales of $131.2 million and diluted earnings of 81¢ per share, compared with net sales of $167.4 million and diluted earnings of $1.21 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company also announced today that its Board of Directors declared a dividend of 32¢ per share for the first quarter for stockholders of record as of May 22, 2018, payable on June 1, 2018. This dividend varies every quarter because the Company pays a percentage of earnings rather than a fixed amount per share. This dividend is approximately 40% of net income. The repurchase of 1.3 million shares of common stock in 2017 increased this dividend by 2¢ per share.\nChief Executive Officer Christopher J. Killoy made the following observations related to the Company’s 2018 first quarter performance:\nIn the first quarter of 2018, net sales decreased 22% and earnings per share decreased 33% from the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in earnings is attributable to the sales decline and the unfavorable de-leveraging of fixed manufacturing costs due to the decline in production volumes. Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which modified the timing of revenue recognition related to certain sales promotion activities involving the shipment of no charge firearms. Consequently, net sales in the first quarter of 2018 were reduced by $2.4 million. In addition, certain promotional expenses that had been classified as selling expenses in prior years were included in cost of products sold in 2018. As a result, the first quarter gross margin was reduced by approximately 3% and earnings per share was reduced by approximately 4¢. The reduced effective tax rate in 2018, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017, increased the quarterly diluted earnings per share by 11¢. The repurchase of 1.3 million shares of common stock in 2017 increased the quarterly diluted earnings per share by 6¢. Sales of new products, including the Pistol Caliber Carbine, the Mark IV pistol, the LCP II pistol, the EC9s pistol, the Security-9 pistol, and the Precision Rimfire Rifle, represented $37.2 million or 29% of firearm sales in the first quarter of 2018. New product sales include only major new products that were introduced in the past two years. The estimated unit sell-through of the Company’s products from the independent distributors to retailers decreased 5% in the first quarter of 2018 from the comparable prior year period. For the same periods, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System background checks (as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation) increased 1%. The decrease in estimated sell-through of the Company’s products from the independent distributors to retailers is attributable to decreased overall consumer demand in the early stages of the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by increased demand in the latter part of the quarter. Favorable distributor sell-through trends in the latter half of the quarter resulted in significant reductions of inventories at the Company and at the independent distributors. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s finished goods inventory decreased by 51,900 units and distributor inventories of the Company’s products decreased by 69,000 units. Cash generated from operations during the first quarter of 2018 was $45 million. At March 31, 2018, our cash totaled $103 million. Our current ratio is 3.0 to 1 and we have no debt. In the first quarter of 2018, capital expenditures totaled $1 million. We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to total approximately $15 million. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company returned $4 million to its shareholders through the payment of dividends. At March 31, 2018, stockholders’ equity was $238 million, which equates to a book value of $13.67 per share, of which $5.89 per share is cash.\nToday, the Company filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are attached to this press release.\nTomorrow, May 9, 2018, Sturm, Ruger will host a webcast of its Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 9:00 a.m. MST (12:00 p.m. EDT) and plans to discuss the first quarter operating results.

This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures being disclosed by other companies. In addition, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying business, as EBITDA provides information on the Company’s ability to meet its capital expenditure and working capital requirements, and is also an indicator of profitability. The Company believes that this reporting provides better transparency and comparability to its operating results. The Company uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates its EBITDA by adding the amount of interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses that have been deducted from net income back into net income, and subtracting the amount of interest income that was included in net income from net income.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation – EBITDA EBITDA\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Net income $ 14,264 $ 22,224 Income tax expense 4,637 11,967 Depreciation and amortization expense 8,172 9,326 Interest expense, net 27 34 EBITDA $ 27,100 $ 43,551\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006267/en/\nSturm, Ruger & Company, Inc.\nOne Lacey Place\nSouthport, CT 06890\nwww.ruger.com\n203-259-7843\nSource: Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51802773&newsitemid=20180508006267&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=2&md5=3551b2797d9922d6143c8ecf6ea785af", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruger.com&esheet=51802773&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ruger.com&index=4&md5=b2e0a283ae21ec7d17669562b91055d7", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006267/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruger.com%2Fcorporate&esheet=51802773&newsitemid=20180508006267&lan=en-US&anchor=Ruger.com%2Fcorporate&index=3&md5=0831ed0d4bd8d82d81e3e49efad04d47", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ruger.com%2Fcorporate&esheet=51802773&newsitemid=20180508006267&lan=en-US&anchor=Ruger.com%2Fcorporate&index=1&md5=14e4e2b1d2304d1a72b34cbecefbaf37"], "published": "2018-05-09T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T02:49:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
