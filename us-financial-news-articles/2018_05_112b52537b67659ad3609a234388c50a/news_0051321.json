(NASDAQ: JCS) (\"CSI\" or the \"Company\") , a global provider of connectivity infrastructure and services for deployments of broadband networks, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable on July 2, 2018, to shareholders of record as of June 15, 2018. This marks the 63 rd consecutive quarter that CSI has paid a dividend to its shareholders.\nThe Board has also initiated a strategic review of the Company's businesses and assets to explore opportunities for enhancing value for the Company's loyal shareholders. A Special Board Committee consisting of independent directors Richard Primuth, Randy Sampson and Steven Webster will oversee this process. The Special Committee expects to retain an investment banking firm to advise it in this process.\nCSI's Chief Executive Officer Roger H.D. Lacey commented, \"The strategic review will be a thorough process. The Company will report on its findings and conclusions at the completion of the review and does not expect to comment on the progress of the strategic review until it is completed. We will consider all reasonable options but cannot guarantee that any actions will be taken as a direct result of this review. CSI currently has several growth initiatives within our operating segments that we believe can grow our revenues and return CSI to positive cash flow. We also fully understand the challenges that these segments face and how those challenges continue to affect the price of our common stock. While it is uncertain what, if any, specific action or transaction may result from this process, we believe the timing is right for the Board to assess all potential opportunities to maximize long-term value for our loyal shareholders.\"\nAbout Communications Systems\nCommunications Systems, Inc. provides connectivity infrastructure and services for global deployments of broadband networks.
