DeVos had previously disclosed that her family was a Theranos investor in a government filing, but the size of the investment wasn’t known. “The investment was made by many members of the DeVos family,” not just DeVos, says Greg McNeilly, chief operating officer of Windquest Group, DeVos and her husband’s family holding company. “To say they’re highly disappointed in Theranos as a company and an investment is an understatement.”\nPresident Donald Trump’s education secretary is among a number of prominent figures who poured money into Theranos between 2013 and 2015 before a series of Wall Street Journal articles revealed that the company was encountering problems with its technology and misleading its investors. These investments now are essentially worthless. In an April 10 email to shareholders reviewed by the Journal, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes raised the likelihood that the company would be liquidated by August. Earlier that day, she informed most of Theranos’s remaining 125 employees they would lose their jobs and paychecks on June 12, according to people familiar with the matter.\nOther investors facing big losses include the heirs of Walmart Inc. WMT, +1.51% founder Sam Walton, members of Atlanta’s billionaire Cox family, Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, the scion of a Greek shipping fortune and members of a South African diamond dynasty, according to the documents, which Theranos provided to the lawsuit’s plaintiffs as part of the discovery phase of the case. Rarely have so many high-profile figures been known to have lost so much money on a single investment.
