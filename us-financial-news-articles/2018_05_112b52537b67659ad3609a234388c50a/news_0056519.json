Seaman later released a statement, thanking “the first responders from Noblesville and Fishers for their immediate action and care. I want to let everyone know that I was injured but am doing great. To all students, you are all wonderful and I thank you for your support. You are the reason I teach.”\nPolice said the male student gunman in Seaman’s seventh-grade class had asked to be excused before returning to the classroom with two handguns and opening fire. One student was injured.\n“Our science teacher (Jason) immediately ran at (the shooter), swatted a gun out of his hand and tackled him to the ground,” student Ethan Stonebraker told The Associated Press. “If it weren’t for him, more of us would have been injured for sure.”\n—Oregon senior linebacker Fotu Leiato was dismissed from the football team, university officials confirmed.\nLeiato has been arrested twice in 2018. Leiato recorded 14 tackles last season as a junior and was expected to be a starter in 2018.\nThe 21-year-old was arrested in late April on charges of theft, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief.
