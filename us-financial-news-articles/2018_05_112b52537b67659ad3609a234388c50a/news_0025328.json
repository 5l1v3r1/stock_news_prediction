Specific forward-looking information in this document includes, but is not limited to: the expected completion and timeline for completion of the purchase of additional 16.5% equity interest in Atlantica; expectations with respect to the timing of APUC's growth plans, earnings, cash flow and dividend amounts; and expectations with respect to regulatory orders relating to Liberty Empire wind energy generation projects. These statements are based on factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including assumptions based on historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments. Since forward-looking statements relate to future events and conditions, by their very nature they require making assumptions and involve inherent risks and uncertainties. APUC cautions that although it is believed that the assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances, these risks and uncertainties give rise to the possibility that actual results may differ materially from the expectations set out in the forward-looking statements. Material risk factors include those set out in APUC's most recent Management Discussion and Analysis and Annual Information Form. Given these risks, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of their dates. Other than as specifically required by law, APUC undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise.\n(1) Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe terms \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" are used in this press release. The terms \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" are not recognized measures under GAAP. There is no standardized measure of \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" and consequently APUC's method of calculating these measures may differ from methods used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A calculation, analysis and reconciliation to the nearest U.S. GAAP measure of \"Adjusted Net Earnings\", Adjusted EBITDA, and \"Adjusted Funds from Operations\" can be found in the Management's Discussion & Analysis for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors to compare companies on the basis of ability to generate cash from operations. APUC uses these calculations to monitor the amount of cash generated by APUC as compared to the amount of dividends paid by APUC. APUC uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating performance of APUC without the effects of (as applicable): depreciation and amortization expense, income tax expense or recoveries, acquisition costs, litigation expenses, interest expense, gain or loss on derivative financial instruments, write down of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, earnings attributable to non-controlling interests and gain or loss on foreign exchange, earnings or loss from discontinued operations, changes in value of investments carried at fair value, and other typically non-recurring items. APUC adjusts for these factors as they may be non-cash, unusual in nature and are not factors used by management for evaluating the operating performance of the Company. APUC believes that presentation of this measure will enhance an investor's understanding of APUC's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be representative of cash provided by operating activities or results of operations determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and can be impacted positively or negatively by these items.\nAdjusted Net Earnings\nAdjusted Net Earnings is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors to compare net earnings from operations without the effects of certain volatile primarily non-cash items that generally have no current economic impact or items such as acquisition expenses or litigation expenses that are viewed as not directly related to a company's operating performance. APUC uses Adjusted Net Earnings to assess its performance without the effects of (as applicable): gains or losses on foreign exchange, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, acquisition costs, one-time costs of arranging tax equity financing, litigation expenses and write down of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, earnings or loss from discontinued operations, unrealized mark-to-market revaluation impacts, changes in value of investments carried at fair value, and other typically non-recurring items as these are not reflective of the performance of the underlying business of APUC. For 2017, the one-time impact of the revaluation of U.S. non-regulated net deferred income tax assets as a result of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% enacted in December 2017 is adjusted as it is also considered a nonrecurring item not reflective of the performance of the underlying business of APUC. APUC believes that analysis and presentation of net earnings or loss on this basis will enhance an investor's understanding of the operating performance of its businesses. Adjusted Net Earnings is not intended to be representative of net earnings or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and can be impacted positively or negatively by these items.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations\nAdjusted Funds from Operations is a non-GAAP measure used by investors to compare cash flows from operating activities without the effects of certain volatile items that generally have no current economic impact or items such as acquisition expenses that are viewed as not directly related to a company's operating performance. APUC uses Adjusted Funds from Operations to assess its performance without the effects of (as applicable): changes in working capital balances, acquisition expenses, litigation expenses, cash provided by or used in discontinued operations and other typically non-recurring items affecting cash from operations as these are not reflective of the long-term performance of the underlying businesses of APUC. APUC believes that analysis and presentation of funds from operations on this basis will enhance an investor's understanding of the operating performance of its businesses. Adjusted Funds from Operations is not intended to be representative of cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP, and can be impacted positively or negatively by these items.\n releases/algonquin-power--utilities-corp-announces-2018-first-quarter-financial-results-300646774.html\nSOURCE Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.algonquinpowerandutilities.com/", "http://services.choruscall.ca/links/algonquinpower20180511.html", "http://twitter.com/@AQN_Utilities", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/algonquin-power--utilities-corp-announces-2018-first-quarter-financial-results-300646774.html"], "published": "2018-05-11T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T02:38:30.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
