REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo The new cheaper fare, which Lufthansa has been testing on some routes between Scandinavia and North America since October, allows passengers on airlines Lufthansa, SWISS, Brussels Airlines and Austrian Airlines to bring only carry-on luggage on their trip, it said.\nFor an additional fee, they can add check-in luggage or request a seat reservation.\nLufthansa did not say how much the tickets would cost. In 2015, it introduced a “Light” fare on European routes, with round-trip tickets starting at 89 euros ($105).\nBritish Airways, owned by International Airways Group ( ICAG.L ), last month unveiled a new “basic” fare, whereby a one-way ticket between London and Boston in the United States would cost from 175 pounds ($236).\nThat compares with low cost carrier Norwegian’s ( NWC.OL ) 145 pound cheapest available fare, according to its website on that same route.\nLegacy airlines are battling Norwegian and other budget carriers such as Canada’s Westjet ( WJA.TO ) and Iceland’s Wow Air, which are all stepping up expansion on routes between North America and Europe.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:05:59.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
