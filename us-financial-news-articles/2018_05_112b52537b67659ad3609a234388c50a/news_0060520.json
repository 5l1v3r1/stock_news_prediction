(NASDAQ:VDSI), a global leader in digital identity security, transaction security and business productivity, today announced it has acquired privately-held Dealflo for £41 million in cash. In a separate press release today, VASCO introduced its Trusted Identity (TID) platform and announced its name is changing to OneSpan.\nDealflo is a rapidly growing and leading provider of identity verification and end-to-end financial agreement automation solutions. Its flexible workflow management system automates the full lifecycle of customer onboarding by providing a flexible and automated application process, integration of third-party identity verification services, tailored and configurable contract generation, e-signature capture and secure vaulting. Dealflo has achieved significant success in providing onboarding solutions to the consumer and asset financing sectors primarily in the U.K.\n“The combination of two leading providers of solutions for agreement automation creates a strong offering for customer onboarding,” said Aite Group’s Retail Banking and Payments Research Director, Julie Conroy. “Financial institutions in particular have a growing demand for onboarding automation solutions and coming from OneSpan, a leading provider in the financial services industry, this will make for a very compelling offering in the market.”\nDealflo’s agreement automation platform provides a flexible API that facilities the integration of multiple third party solutions for each step of the financial transaction management process. Dealflo has partnerships with leading identity verification providers Equifax, iovation (being acquired by TransUnion), Mitek, and GB Group, as well as OneSpan Sign (formerly eSignLive). OneSpan will continue to support these relationships and plans to increase the number of e-sign partnerships as it expands Dealflo’s presence globally.\n“This acquisition will enable us to grow our subscription revenue and Dealflo’s technology will be a major differentiator for our eSignLive solution,” said VASCO CEO, Scott Clements. “In addition, Dealflo’s identity verification capabilities will allow us to accelerate the launch of our TID platform based onboarding, identity and anti-fraud solutions.”\nThere are significant synergies between the companies. Dealflo is headquartered in London with its development center in Montreal, the home of OneSpan’s largest development center. In addition, OneSpan Sign is already integrated into Dealflo’s platform and more than half of Dealflo’s customers are also OneSpan’s, including leading financial institutions and organizations such as BMW, Santander, BNP Paribas and Mercedes Benz.\n“The entire Dealflo team is thrilled that we are joining a leader in the financial services segment that can accelerate growth of our solution and expand into new regions where OneSpan is very well-established,” stated Dealflo Founder and CEO, Abe Smith. “We have a deep history with OneSpan Sign and look forward to working together and expanding our integration into OneSpan’s powerful and innovative Trusted Identity platform.”\n2018 Guidance Update\nAs a result of the transaction, OneSpan has revised its guidance for the full-year 2018 as follows:\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $201 million to $211 million; and Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $19 million.\nClements added, “While our revised guidance reflects the near-term financial impact of acquiring an early-stage technology platform, we see tremendous opportunity to leverage this strategic addition and deliver significant long-term revenue and EBITDA growth in the years to come.”\nAbout OneSpan\nOneSpan enables financial institutions and other organizations to succeed by making bold advances in their digital transformation.
