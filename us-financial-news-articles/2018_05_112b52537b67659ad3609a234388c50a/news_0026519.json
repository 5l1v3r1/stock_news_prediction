We have a further season in the Premier League,” Wagner told the BBC. Slideshow (5 Images)\n“For sure, we had our luck, for sure, Chelsea were the better team. We stole a point but we needed it.”\n“The dressing-room has shown such togetherness all season, they always believed that in football the impossible is possible and we have done it. We didn’t have to rely on other teams, we have done it on our own.\n“We love games like this, we knew what we needed, a point.”\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte was in downbeat mood with his team needing to win their final game at Newcastle and hope Liverpool lose at home to Brighton if they are to qualify for the Champions League.\n“The only hope and intention was to keep our hopes alive and win the game. We tried with all of our strength to win but the result penalised our team a lot,” Conte said.\n“For sure we had so many chances and you must be good to take them. It is not the first time that we are not clinical, there are many circumstances for this. We must accept the final result and the commitment was impressive of the players. We tried to win the game until the end.” Reporting by William Schomberg, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:33:16.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
