REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen\n“There will be tough discussions,” one official in Macron’s office said.\nMacron will hold a one-on-one meeting with Zuckerberg, during which all subjects will be raised in “very frank” discussions, the president’s office said.\nIn April, Zuckerberg fielded questions over two days from U.S. lawmakers over how it handles private data, refusing to make any promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business.\nLawmakers in Europe are demanding answers too and the European Parliament has requested Zuckerberg appear before the assembly more than once.
