Lyft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn the days following the court ruling, Lyft and San Francisco-based delivery services DoorDash and Postmates were sued in California state court by workers alleging they had been improperly classified as independent contractors.\nTuesday's subpoenas followed demands last June by the city attorney that Uber and Lyft turn over records on driving and business practices as part of an investigation to determine whether the companies had become a public nuisance. Lyft has handed over most of that information, the city attorney's office said, but Uber has appealed a court order to comply. (Additional reporting by Daniel Wiessner.
