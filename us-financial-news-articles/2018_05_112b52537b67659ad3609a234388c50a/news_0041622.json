On Wednesday, the currency dropped to its lowest levels since October 2015, last trading at 14,105 to the dollar.\n\"As U.S. rates continue to rise, that's going to put more and more pressure on the rupiah, the peso and the rupee,\" Spencer added.\nThat comes amid the broader move higher in U.S. yields: The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note surged above the 3 percent level in the last session to 3.091 percent, its highest level since 2011.\nMeanwhile, Spencer said higher inflation seen in emerging markets, notably Indonesia and the Philippines, coupled with weaker currencies would compel central banks there to raise interest rates.\nIndonesia's central bank is expected to announce its decision on interest rates on Thursday. Reuters reported that 13 out of 21 economists it polled had indicated that Bank Indonesia would raise the seven-day reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T07:49:00.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
