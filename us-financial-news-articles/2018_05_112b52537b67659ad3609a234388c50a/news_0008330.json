While the Senate bill passed with the support of 17 moderate Democrats, key members of the party, including Senator Mark Warner, have said they would withdraw support if any further changes were made.\nThat has raised fears among bank lobbyists that the House could sink the bill if it refused to approve the Senate version.\nBut McCarthy said there was a willingness on both sides to pass the bill, which said would reform, rather than repeal, Dodd-Frank.\n\"I think you are within a month of getting it ... done,\" he told the Milken economic conference in Beverly Hills, California.\n\"At the end of the day, there will be a bill at the president's desk,\" he added, pledging to deliver legislation to President Donald Trump before congressional elections in November.\nTrump said in March he would sign the bill once it had been approved by both the House and Senate\nLast week, Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was \"certainly open to other pathways\" to pass legislation aimed at helping small businesses.\nMcCarthy echoed these comments on Monday, suggesting some of the House's wish list could be included in separate legislation.\nSpeaking at the same event, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said later on Monday he was hopeful the changes, which he said were important for small lenders and community banks, would be passed soon.\n\"This should get done now. I am hopeful this gets done in the next 30 to 60 days,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne in Beverly Hills, Calif. and Katanga Johnson in Washington; Editing by Michelle Price and Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T01:41:01.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
