On Friday it fell further.\n“Markets are still uncertain about where we are going to be on the other side of the transition deal,” said Adam Cole, chief currencies strategist at RBC.\n“It is not going to immediately attach a 100 percent certainty of us remaining in the customs union,” he said, adding that the market wanted to see evidence Britain would permanently remain inside the customs union, and not just temporarily while other issues were resolved.\nSterling dropped 0.1 percent to $1.3496, not far from the $1.3452 2018 low it hit earlier this week.\nAgainst the euro the pound fell 0.2 percent to 87.475 pence per euro.\nSterling has slumped in recent weeks, particularly against a dollar enjoying a broad and rapid recovery.\nWhile risks around the sort of relationship Britain can agree with the EU for after their divorce has influenced the pound this week, the biggest reasons for sterling’s fall has been a drastic shift in market expectations for interest rate rises from the Bank of England because of economic weakness.\nMarkets are now not even pricing in a full 25 basis point hike by the end of 2018, against previous expectations of two 25 basis point rises this year.\n“We still think the risks are to the downside ... The risk is you keep on pricing out rate hikes,” Cole at RBC said.
