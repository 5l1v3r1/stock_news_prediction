One of the elevators will be used to support Tyson’s planned $300 million chicken processing plant in Humboldt, Tennessee, slated to open around late 2019. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nThe No. 1 U.S. meat processor earlier this month said it expected chicken feed costs to rise by about $100 million in fiscal 2018.\n“This acquisition ... gives us the ability to render raw materials in a region we don’t currently serve,” Doug Ramsey, group president of poultry for Tyson Foods, said in a statement on Tuesday.\nTyson will take over American Proteins’ four rendering plants located in Georgia and Alabama and 13 blending facilities throughout southeastern and midwestern U.S. states.\nRendering is a process of using animal byproducts for the production of tallow, grease and feed for animals and aquaculture.\nTyson said it expects its new business to generate adjusted net sales of more than $550 million over the next year.\nTyson said most of American Proteins’ 700 employees are expected to become Tyson’s workers.\nShares of Tyson were down 1.2 percent at $66.83 on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier low at $66.36.
