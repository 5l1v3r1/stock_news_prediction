REUTERS/Toru Hanai After meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told journalists that better relations between Asia’s two biggest economies were contributing to global stability and development.\nAbe said he wanted to establish the sort of relationship in which the leaders could easily visit each other and said earlier in the day that he plans to visit China this year.\nDiplomatic relations between the two nations have improved in recent years after deteriorating sharply in 2012, when Tokyo nationalised a cluster of disputed East China Sea islets that China also claims.\nChina’s relations with Japan have also long been poisoned by what Beijing sees as Tokyo’s failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two.\nIn a public ceremony after their meeting, Abe and Li oversaw the signing of a pact to set up a hotline for senior defence officials to communicate during incidents involving each others’ naval vessels or military aircraft.\nThe meeting came after a three-way summit between Abe, Li and South Korean President Moon Jae-in earlier in the day, the first such three-way gathering in two and a half years.\nThe top-level meetings come as tension over North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons eases ahead of what would be a historic meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka, writing by Malcolm Foster; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T14:39:44.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
