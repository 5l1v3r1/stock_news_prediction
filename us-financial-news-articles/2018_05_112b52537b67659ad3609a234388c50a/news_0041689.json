Following the incident, the party disciplined chat members and commissioned an internal report about the hardline content of the messages.\nThe 93-page report showed that members exchanged messages and pictures containing Nazi imagery, jokes about murdering migrants and foreigners, and incitement to violence, for example against German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and the NDR and WDR broadcasters reported.\nThey said the report concluded that the messages had “crossed the line of criminal content.”\n“This behavior is grossly damaging for our party and has nothing to do with the values of the Alternative for Germany”, the party’s secretary general Jan Zwerg said in a statement.\nThe AfD said it was considering expelling some chat members.\nThe anti-immigrant party was voted into the German lower house of parliament for the first time in September national elections and is the largest opposition party.
