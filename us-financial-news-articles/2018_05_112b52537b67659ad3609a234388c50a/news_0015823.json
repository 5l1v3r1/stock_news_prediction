In Germany, we can receive China Global Television network in every hotel, in every household. Why should this not be possible in China for Deutsche Welle?” he said.\nMichaelis said he welcomed news that German weekly newspaper Die Zeit would be re-opening an office in China, and said he hoped that other media would be able to do so as well.\n“We may not always have the same opinion, but less dialogue is not the right way to overcome our differences,” he said. “We need more dialogue, more cooperation, and more exchanges.”\nGuo said media organisations had an important role to play in promoting understanding, combating trade protectionism, and helping expand economic ties between the two countries.\n“In a world in which we cooperate more and more, the media are a bridge that ... connects us,” he said.\nThe minister spoke after Michaelis and did not address his comments on Deutsche Welle.\nIn October Chinese President Xi Jinping told foreign journalists to roam the country and report more, even as five global news organisations found themselves without invitations to cover a speech where Xi introduced his new leadership line-up following a once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress.
