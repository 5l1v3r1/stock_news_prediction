Syros has built a proprietary platform that is designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, Syros’ gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across a range of diseases. Syros is currently focused on cancer and monogenic diseases and is advancing a growing pipeline of gene control medicines. Syros’ lead drug candidates are SY-1425, a selective RARα agonist in a Phase 2 clinical trial for genomically defined subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and SY-1365, a selective CDK7 inhibitor in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. Led by a team with deep experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, Syros is located in Cambridge, Mass.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005239/en/\nMedia Contact:\nSyros Pharmaceuticals\nNaomi Aoki, 617-283-4298\nnaoki@syros.com\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nStern Investor Relations, Inc.\nHannah Deresiewicz, 212-362-1200\nhannahd@sternir.com\nSource: Syros Pharmaceuticals", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180503005239/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.syros.com%2F&esheet=51800252&newsitemid=20180503005239&lan=en-US&anchor=www.syros.com&index=2&md5=0f6626cc8caae811cec86931e594790c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.syros.com%2F&esheet=51800252&newsitemid=20180503005239&lan=en-US&anchor=Syros+Pharmaceuticals&index=1&md5=45a21c696fef66ab1736f76540e54e5a"], "published": "2018-05-03T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T18:08:58.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
