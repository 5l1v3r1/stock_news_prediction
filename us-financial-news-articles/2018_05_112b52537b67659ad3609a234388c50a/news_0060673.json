We don’t want to stop there but keep growing,” McDade told reporters in Accra, where he was meeting investors.\n“We’d like to go and look at the new licenses being opened, we’d look at them from a geological point of view and if we find them attractive, you’d find us bidding for them,” he said.\nTullow has given up plans to reduce its stake in its TEN field which came on stream two years ago because the need for raising capital from the sale no longer existed, McDade said.\nReporting by Kwasi Kpodo; Editing by Edmund Blair and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-31T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:08:28.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
