REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Ilustration A lower administrative court had ordered that the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology block YouTube, owned by Google, in 2013 over the video, but the case was appealed and its ruling stayed during the appeal process.\nThe ministry at the time said it would be impossible to enforce the ruling without also disrupting Google’s Internet search engine, incurring potentially huge costs and job losses in the Arab world’s most populous country.\nThe Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was not immediately available for comment. YouTube appeared to be working in Egypt on Saturday as of 1250 GMT (8.50 a.m ET).\nThe film “Innocence of Muslims”, a low-budget 13-minute video, was billed as a film trailer and made in California with private funding. It provoked a wave of anti-American unrest in Egypt and other Muslim countries when it appeared in 2012.\nMohamed Hamid Salem, a lawyer who filed the case in 2013, said the ruling also orders that all links that broadcast the film be blocked.\nThe ruling is considered final and cannot be appealed.\nReporting by Mohamed Abdellah, Haitham Ahmed, Moeman Saeed Atallah; Writing by Eric Knecht; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:03:28.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
