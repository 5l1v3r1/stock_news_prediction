REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker Petrobras, as the company is known, posted a net profit of 6.961 billion reais ($1.96 billion) on Tuesday, a 56.5 percent rise over the same period last year, helped by asset sales and a pickup in oil prices.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profit known as EBITDA, hit 25.669 billion reais, a 2 percent increase over the same period last year.\nPetrobras, which still holds the dubious title of the world’s most indebted oil company, said it generated 3.223 billion reais from the sale of stakes in assets like the Lapa field, and the Iara area in the offshore Santos basin.\nResults were helped by rising international oil prices, which increased from an average $54.04 per barrel in the fourth quarter to $60.18 per barrel in the first three months of the year, the company said.\nThe cheery figures come after a massive probe begun in 2014 showed construction companies bribed company officials and politicians to win inflated contracts from Petrobras, shaking investor confidence and sending its share price tumbling.\nOn Tuesday, Petrobras said net debt fell more than 3 percent to 270.712 billion reais ($76.23 billion) in the quarter from the previous quarter.\nFree cash flow was positive for the second quarter in a row but down 3 percent year-on-year as the result of the first payment to U.S. investors who won a class action against the company in January tied to the graft scandal.\nRevenue from sales reached 74.461 billion reais ($20.97 billion) in the quarter, up 9 percent from the same period last year.\n($1 = 3.5512 reais)\nReporting by Alexandra Alper and Roberto Samora; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T15:08:54.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
