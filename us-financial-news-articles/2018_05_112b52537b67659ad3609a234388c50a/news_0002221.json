They simply refused to decorate his cake with a pro-gay message,” he said in a statement.\n“That is their right in a free and democratic society.”\nA Supreme Court judgment is expected later this year or early next.\n($1 = 0.7344 pounds)\nReporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Katy Migiro; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts, land and property rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, gender equality, climate change and resilience.
