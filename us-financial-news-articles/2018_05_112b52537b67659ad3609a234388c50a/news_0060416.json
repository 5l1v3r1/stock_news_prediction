(NYSE:BURL), a nationally recognized off-price retailer of high-quality, branded apparel at everyday low prices, today announced its first quarter results for the thirteen weeks ended May 5, 2018, which compare to the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017.\nTom Kingsbury, CEO, stated, “We are very pleased to kick off Fiscal 2018 with strong first quarter results, driven by a 4.8% comparable store sales increase. Our overall 12.8% sales growth, along with our 70 basis point Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement, enabled the Company to drive a 59% increase in Adjusted EPS in the first quarter, well ahead of our guidance. I would like to thank our store, supply chain and corporate teams for contributing to these strong results.”\nFiscal 2018 First Quarter Operating Results:\nTotal sales for the 13 week period ended May 5, 2018 increased 12.8% over the 13 week period ended April 29, 2017 to $1,518 million. New and non-comparable stores contributed an incremental $82 million in sales during the quarter. Accounting for the calendar shift from the 53 rd week in Fiscal 2017, comparable store sales increased 4.8% for the 13 weeks ended May 5, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended May 6, 2017.\nGross margin expanded by approximately 35 basis points over last year’s levels to 41.2% driven primarily by increased merchandise margin, which was slightly offset by higher freight costs. Product sourcing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), were approximately 5 basis points higher as a percentage of sales versus the Fiscal 2017 first quarter.\nSG&A, less product sourcing costs, as a percentage of sales was 26.1%, representing an approximately 45 basis point improvement compared with the Fiscal 2017 first quarter. This improvement was driven by leverage in store occupancy and other store related costs as a result of the strong comparable store sales increase during the quarter.\nThe effective tax rate improved 1,300 basis points to 17.4%, driven by the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017 (“2017 Tax Reform”), and the accounting for stock based compensation.\nNet income increased 58% over the prior year period to $83 million, or $1.20 per share vs. $0.73 last year, and Adjusted Net Income increased 54% to $87 million, or $1.26 per share, vs. $0.79 last year. These improvements were driven primarily by top line growth, expense leverage, share repurchases since the end of the first quarter last year, and lower tax rates.\nFully diluted shares outstanding amounted to 69.0 million at the end of the quarter compared with 71.5 million at the end of last year’s first quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of share repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase program, discussed in more detail below. Since the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, and through the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 3 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 21%, or $28 million above the prior year period, to $165 million. The 70 basis point expansion in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by expense leverage and gross margin expansion. Adjusted EBIT increased 26%, or $25 million above the prior year period, to $120 million. The 85 basis point expansion in Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the same factors driving Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion.\nInventory\nMerchandise inventories were $787 million vs. $726 million last year. The increase was primarily due to inventory related to 51 net new stores opened since the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, and an increase in pack and hold inventory, which was 27% of total inventory at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 compared to 26% at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. Comparable store inventory turnover improved 12%, and comparable store inventory was down 7% at the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2018.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nDuring the first quarter, the Company invested $64 million of cash to repurchase 488,468 shares of its common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the Company had $153 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 and Second Quarter 2018 Outlook\nFor the full Fiscal Year 2018 (the 52-weeks ending February 2, 2019), the Company now expects:\nTotal sales to increase in the range of 9.7% to 10.5%, excluding the 53 rd week impact in 2017; this assumes shifted comparable store sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3% for the balance of Fiscal 2018, resulting in a full year shifted comparable store sales increase of 2.6% to 3.4% on top of the 3.4% increase during Fiscal 2017;\nAdjusted EBITDA margin to increase 30 to 40 basis points;\nDepreciation and amortization, exclusive of favorable lease amortization, to be approximately $200 million;\nAdjusted EBIT margin to increase 20 to 30 basis points;\nInterest expense of approximately $60 million;\nAn effective tax rate of 22% to 23%;\nTo open 35 to 40 net new stores, and invest Net Capital Expenditures of approximately $250 million;\nAdjusted EPS in the range of $5.90 to $6.00, utilizing a fully diluted share count of approximately 68.9 million. This guidance compares to the previous outlook for Adjusted EPS of $5.73-$5.83; and\nAdjusted EPS, excluding the estimated impact of 2017 Tax Reform and the accounting for stock based compensation, to be in the range of $4.82 to $4.92 as compared with the comparable 52 week Adjusted EPS of $4.14 in Fiscal 2017. This represents growth of 16% to 19%.\nFor the second quarter of Fiscal 2018 (the 13 weeks ending August 4, 2018), the Company expects:\nTotal sales to increase in the range of 8% to 9%;\nShifted comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ended August 4, 2018 compared to the 13 weeks ended August 5, 2017 to increase in the range of 2% to 3% on top of a 3.5% increase during the second quarter of Fiscal 2017; and\nAdjusted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.95, which assumes a fully diluted share count of approximately 68.8 million shares, as compared to $0.72 last year.\nThe Company has not presented a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures set out above to their most comparable GAAP financial measures because it would require the Company to create estimated ranges on a GAAP basis, which would entail unreasonable effort. Adjustments required to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty but may include, among others, costs related to debt amendments, loss on extinguishment of debt, and impairment charges, as well as the tax effect of such items. Some or all of those adjustments could be significant.\nNote regarding Non-GAAP financial measures\nThe foregoing discussion of the Company’s operating results includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share (or Adjusted EPS) and Adjusted EBIT. The Company believes these measures are useful in evaluating the operating performance of the business and for comparing its historical results to that of other retailers. These non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure later in this document.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, May 31, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s first quarter results.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) net favorable lease amortization, (ii) costs related to debt amendments, (iii) stock option modification expense, (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt, (v) impairment charges and (vi) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains, all of which are tax effected to arrive at Adjusted Net Income.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as defined in the table below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) net interest expense, (ii) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (iii) costs related to debt amendments, (iv) stock option modification expense, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) impairment charges, (vii) income tax expense and (viii) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains.\nAdjusted EBIT (or Adjusted Operating Margin) is defined as net income, exclusive of the following items, if applicable: (i) net interest expense, (ii) net favorable lease amortization, (iii) loss on the extinguishment of debt, (iv) costs related to debt amendments, (v) stock option modification expense, (vi) impairment charges, (vii) income tax expense and (viii) other unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary expenses, losses, charges or gains.\nThe Company presents Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT, because it believes they are useful supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of the Company’s business and provide greater transparency into the results of operations. In particular, the Company believes that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from what the Company considers to be its core operating results are useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the Company’s ability to generate earnings and leverage sales, and to more readily compare core operating results between past and future periods.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide investors helpful information with respect to the Company’s operations and financial condition. Other companies in the retail industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently such that the Company’s calculation may not be directly comparable.\nThe following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS for the periods indicated:\n(unaudited) (in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended May 5, April 29, 2018 2017 Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income: Net income $ 82,588 $ 52,368 Net favorable lease amortization (a) 5,325 6,009 Stock option modification expense (b) — 63 Tax effect (c) (927 ) (1,848 ) Adjusted Net Income $ 86,986 $ 56,592 Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding (d) 68,970 71,505 Adjusted Earnings per Share $ 1.26 $ 0.79 The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: (unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended May 5, April 29, 2018 2017 Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA: Net income $ 82,588 $ 52,368 Interest expense 14,521 13,514 Interest income (80 ) (35 ) Stock option modification expense (b) — 63 Depreciation and amortization 50,509 48,012 Income tax expense 17,411 22,916 Adjusted EBITDA $ 164,949 $ 136,838 The following table shows the Company’s reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBIT for the periods indicated: (unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended May 5, April 29, 2018 2017 Reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBIT: Net income $ 82,588 $ 52,368 Interest expense 14,521 13,514 Interest income (80 ) (35 ) Net favorable lease amortization (a) 5,325 6,009 Stock option modification expense (b) — 63 Income tax expense 17,411 22,916 Adjusted EBIT $ 119,765 $ 94,835 (a) Net favorable lease amortization represents the non-cash amortization expense associated with favorable and unfavorable leases that were recorded as a result of purchase accounting related to the April 13, 2006 Bain Capital acquisition of Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation, and are recorded in the line item “Depreciation and amortization” in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\n(b) Represents expenses incurred as a result of our May 2013 stock option modification, which became fully vested during Fiscal 2017.\n(c) Tax effect is calculated based on the effective tax rates (before discrete items) for the respective periods for the tax impact of items (a) and (b).\n(d) Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding starts with basic shares outstanding and adds back any potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding is equal to basic shares outstanding if the Company is in an Adjusted Net Loss position.\nSource:Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yQi7xY0cN4DnM9l6cqEjAquRtcbNrr2lCYdi6QeeDvu2yCqvubL1zqyUADtBpxu-2noo-my9cGn8bNhtBfGrLuo6a_0hmJlFJFrviqUKuICihlzRZaw28ATySKVjWghqveZnwAXT_z-SV4X_5XiXMOmfaPpqbpGwLMDaAgERMmgzjvp8PZgaF9RKjTJDHX4QtroE6rHw6_gV0s1MqyQvD44cxog5CmUtgbl-EGNi5Uw6E_VHXLSw7zastES0Ukg3X3mkZ1DZZT4WnS05sMZh0YYrcsbnBcrMHqNm9WhJWbaMPnGF3Bno6mGNbRsDiW_zf43F5SP-PRkCzqdLiadfcA7gjXDEpoG5Ul9BtZDKw70=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yQi7xY0cN4DnM9l6cqEjAqh9SDK6Dl3MK7V4ntMjhYcTRb3fcZDVqFumE3E2vGMgC2np0uPVklfjI3oBX9FnCElzAVpti2pz0Y467O0_LV9Wx3NkwlLk-H2d17buLtdv", "https://www.facebook.com/BurlingtonCoatFactory/", "https://twitter.com/burlington", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IVOo70s84UF-p-wGlT_QBfCKzlePK1AeDYsqsSmUKZ5ayu2gRnvLU0H0DEn0HFCOUu2OsvBfBYPkiXPiiDSGxBeS4X267CHu28fAfSZF-Me5d6xk2bJwSDXQyrrcEpaQaeamFDt0ipYN-_rhu9lG7yXCdYsYFrwcHVepVFqc21I=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IVOo70s84UF-p-wGlT_QBVO2DYFzvhAHZTMS3EYqh_albl4YiDAS4DpFa0OOkLxdZ2UuRFOMR0tPPz-3wzHDqcB0Bm4A7blTe5_1IvwU5f4hOdhvlYXcFP5pJNhKwI53", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yQi7xY0cN4DnM9l6cqEjAqh9SDK6Dl3MK7V4ntMjhYcbyPVSkI1ctPGbMTJG6wRvuk0N2-GMlTVPEL61YfaMnIn-P69QE5n5LVMusoFSbG5-c7CS-wujl4Bncx91DnhP", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c861ece1-f980-4f39-8846-5ffdb4ad86bf", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=yQi7xY0cN4DnM9l6cqEjAqh9SDK6Dl3MK7V4ntMjhYePBdg-y9gJOPWbTSIe9YOeH68Ae0bQWPL3HeYIWFa3AHsQTYXxL-p70rKuA9kj4lKzb_AQLOcPVG34jZFvBQgP", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ChmrTVOjIvMcz4mdNmAwvhKEi39Lknl5-wqI16LU_uUkER_AYVWE9vAHoypi6SRgf1oO4GsQu_jeMgx0icjjMhWuEX0ApqaPYHiTni-JZBEueuyfWmBCHu0CP0ehnhvh"], "published": "2018-05-31T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T16:52:52.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
