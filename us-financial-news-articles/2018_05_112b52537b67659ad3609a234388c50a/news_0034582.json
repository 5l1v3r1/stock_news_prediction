It does not reflect the thinking of the Argentine Football Association (AFA), nor its president Claudio Tapia, nor any of its directors,” the association said in a statement.\nTapia visited Russia House, a cultural institute, in Buenos Aires on Wednesday to personally apologize for the gaffe.\nNews reports said the information had been presented to players, AFA staff and media earlier this week at a special forum on how to prepare for the World Cup.\nMore than 40,000 Argentines have bought tickets for matches in the tournament that kicks off in Moscow on June 14.\nTwo-time winners of the World Cup, Argentina have been drawn to play Iceland, Nigeria and Croatia.\nWriting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Ian Ransom\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T06:34:37.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
