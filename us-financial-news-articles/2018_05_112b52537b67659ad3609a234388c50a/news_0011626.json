The Cordis business includes catheters and stents and other equipment used in cardiology and endovascular procedures.\nCardinal Health said on the conference call it expects Cordis will be on “a path to profitable growth” by the end of 2019.\nCardinal also said that a fall in generic drug prices moderated sequentially and year-over-year, but not to the extent it had previously estimated.\nAnalysts have noted that even though stubbornly low, generic drug prices continue to pose a headwind to drug distributors, the rate at which the prices of generic drugs are falling seems to be stabilizing.\nContributions from the company’s Red Oak joint venture with CVS Health Corp ( CVS.N ) were not enough to counter the low prices, Cardinal said.\nSegment profit at the company’s pharmaceutical division, which distributes generic drugs, fell 3 percent to $596 million. However, sales climbed 5 percent to $29.7 billion, surpassing consensus estimates.\nExcluding items, Cardinal earned $1.39 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.51 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company cut its fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.85-$4.95 per share from $5.25-$5.50 per share, reflecting a negative tax rate and Cordis’s performance.\nNet earnings attributable to the company fell 33 percent to $255 million, or $0.81 per share, in the quarter.\nRevenue rose 5.7 percent to $33.63 billion.
