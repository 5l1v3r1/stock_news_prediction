May 3, 2018; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) talks to forward J.R. Smith (5) against the Toronto Raptors in game two of the second round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Air Canada Centre. The Cavaliers beat the Raptors 128-110.

May 3, 2018; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James (23) drives to the basket against Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam (43) in game two of the second round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Air Canada Centre. The Cavaliers beat the Raptors 128-110. Mandatory Credit: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sports\nIt was an all-too familiar script for a Toronto team that has been eliminated from the NBA playoffs the last two years at the hands of James and the Cavaliers, including a four-game sweep in last season’s conference semi-finals.\nThis Toronto team had higher hopes of overcoming their previous playoff shortcomings, though, after changing their approach this season with a more balanced attack and an effective bench that helped them finish top seed in the Eastern Conference.\nToronto now face a tall order in Cleveland, where they are 0-5 in postseason appearances and will be desperate for a win on Saturday as no NBA team has successfully recovered from being down 0-3 in a best-of-seven playoff series.

We came to play some good basketball up here and we look forward to more of a challenge.” Reporting by Frank Pingue, editing by Nick Mulvenney", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T08:22:01.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
