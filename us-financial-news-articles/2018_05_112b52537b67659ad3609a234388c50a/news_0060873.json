Their only success came against Spain in the quarter-finals of the European championships in 1996.\n“Behind the scenes we are doing a lot of work to get preparation for how we would want to go about it,” Pickford told British media.\n“There are a lot of good penalty takers here and we’ve been practising the last couple of days... it’s been hard to save them,” the 24-year-old, who has two caps for England, added.\nPickford is one of three keepers in Gareth Southgate’s squad with the manager omitting the experienced but out-of-form Joe Hart for the June 14-July 15 tournament in Russia.

Me, Popey and Butland. We are all working hard and pushing each other, so it is all competition.”\nEngland open their World Cup campaign with a Group G match against Tunisia in Volgograd on June 18.
