The announcement was made today by Joe Meyer, Founder and CEO of ExecThread.\nDoug Stone has been named Head of Data. He was most recently on the Maps Team at Apple where he designed and implemented algorithms to support and oversee the data management function for Apple’s public transit feature. Prior to Apple, Stone was the Director of Data Management & Analytics at HopStop, of which Meyer was also CEO. Stone’s deep experience in data operations, and in normalizing and optimizing large streams of structured and unstructured data, will enable ExecThread to further leverage its proprietary candidate intent and qualifications data to dynamically match ExecThread members to the executive-level job requirements of hiring companies in real-time. Stone is a graduate of Cornell University with a BA in Economics.\nArmand Saramount has been named Head of Growth Marketing. Prior to joining ExecThread, he worked in leadership positions at high-growth startups, most recently at Saige at which he was Head of Growth; and Hirewire where he led all growth and retention initiatives. He has also held field marketing positions focused on user growth at Lyft and Yik Yak. With Saramount’s experience in community-building and scaling the user bases of startups, ExecThread is taking next steps to accelerate the growth of its vetted membership base. Saramount attended Georgia State University at which he pursued a degree in Business & Entrepreneurship.\n“We’re very fortunate to have Doug Stone and Armand Saramount join our leadership team,” said Meyer. “I’m thrilled Doug will be working with me again after his successful stint at Apple. His expertise in optimizing and analyzing data will make our real-time candidate matching platform that much more intelligent and dynamic; and having Armand’s strategic input and growth marketing capabilities will enable us to tactfully scale our membership while still keeping the quality of the ExecThread network very high.”\nExecThread recently unveiled a new talent-matching service to vastly improve the executive hiring process, for both candidates and employers. The new hiring platform enables hiring managers, talent acquisition professionals and human resource leaders to rapidly identify top-tier executive talent. In addition to connecting employers with top-tier talent in a highly targeted manner, the matching platform brings high quality candidates to the interview stage in less than 72 hours. ExecThread’s proprietary matching engine connects ExecThread members in real-time to career-advancing opportunities that match their specific skills and interests.\nAbout ExecThread, Inc.\nFounded in 2015 by Joe Meyer (former CEO of HopStop [acquired by Apple] and former executive at AOL and GM at eBay), and headquartered in New York City, ExecThread, Inc. is a venture capital backed start-up and premium network of highly qualified and carefully vetted executives and aspiring executives who discreetly share career opportunities with each other.
