We cannot talk to anyone... they are trying to sabotage the electoral system to deny a PH win,\" said Lim Guan Eng, a senior opposition leader.\n\"The telcos must do something. We can complain to the authorities, but what can they do now?\" Lim said.\nA minister in Najib's government said his phone had also received multiple calls from unknown numbers from the United States, the U.K. and Malaysia, while another ruling coalition leader posted a video on twitter showing a phone receiving call after call.\nThe Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), the country's communications regulator, did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\nAzmin Ali, the chief minister of the opposition-held state of Selangor, said he left his mobile phone in his car when he went out to vote as he was getting continuous calls and junk emails.\n\"They are desperate, so they are using all sorts of tactics to jam us. But at the end of the day, it's people's power,\" he told reporters after casting his vote.\nKhairy Jamaluddin, the sports minister and youth wing leader of the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), which leads the ruling coalition, was among the leaders from the government side that said they had been targeted too.\n\"My phone seems to be under some sort of spam attack this morning,\" said Khairy, displaying on his Twitter account a screenshot of a list of calls received. \"Strange.\" Abdul Rahman Dahlan, a ruling coalition leader, posted a video showing a phone receiving endless calls.\n\"Calls from overseas keep coming in every few seconds! To prevent us from communicating with our machinery. This is dirty trick!\" he said in a Twitter post.\nReuters reported in April that automated accounts known as bots were flooding Twitter with tens of thousands of pro-government and anti-opposition messages, just weeks before the general election.\nA survey by independent pollster Merdeka Center showed BN has seen a drop in its share of the popular vote, but was still expected to win enough parliamentary seats to retain power.\nshow chapters Low voter turnout 'favors' the Malaysian government: Control Risks 4 Hours Ago | 02:26", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T08:14:18.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
