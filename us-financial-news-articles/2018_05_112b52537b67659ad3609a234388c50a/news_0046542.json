(OTCQB: INIS) (the \"Company\") announces its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased approximately 53% as compared to the same period in 2017. This increase in revenue was the result of revenue increases in three of the Company's four major business segments.\nThe Company's cost of sales increased approximately 41% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, and gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased approximately 68% compared to the same period in 2017. Operating expense decreased approximately 19% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 largely due to a decrease in General, Administrative and Consulting costs.\nThe Company had a net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $34,404, compared to a net loss of $786,266, for the same period in 2017. This is an increase in net income of $820,670, and is the result of increased sales, reduced production costs, and a reduction in operating cost for the period. The following provides some additional detail on the business performance of each of the Company's business segments.\nRevenue from the Company's radiological services segment increased approximately 360% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared the same period in 2017. The increase in revenue was expected by the Company and attributed to an increase in field service work the Company performed for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). While the Company notes that it expects to continue to see some significant contract opportunities in this segment, these contracts are awarded randomly over time and thus are expected to create fluctuations in the period-to-period comparisons within the radiological services segment.\nThe Company's revenue from the sale of cobalt products for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased approximately 49% compared to the same period in 2017. Sales within this segment are highly dependent on production of bulk cobalt from the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) reactor in Idaho. Cobalt production from the reactor is on track to resume later in 2018, and in the meantime, the Company has been able to secure an alternate supply of cobalt to help resume production and sales within the segment.\nRevenue from nuclear medicine products by the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased approximately 24% compared to the same period in 2017. The 24% increase in revenue was largely attributed to the start of consolidated reporting of RadQual LLC (RadQual) within this segment due to the change in member ownership of RadQual, beginning in August 2017. The Company expects continued growth in sales of new and existing products in the nuclear medicine segment going forward as a result of the change in RadQual management and control.\nRevenue from the sale of radiochemical products for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased approximately 5% compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in revenue for the period-to-period comparison was largely the result of an interruption in material supply caused by a regulatory shutdown of one of the Company's major isotope suppliers. The Company reports that the supplier has resumed full production operations and the Company has taken steps to secure alternate supplies of product which should reduce the risks and vulnerabilities caused by relying upon a single producer.\nSteve Laflin, President and CEO of the Company, said, \"The strong performance by most of our business segments in the first quarter has resulted in the first net profit reported for a quarter period in more than a decade. While we are likely to continue to see some fluctuations in segment performance over the coming year, we believe the Company is on a clear path towards increased revenue and future profitability. We believe that the combination of continued significant contract opportunities within the field services segment, the resumption of normal bulk cobalt production in the DOE reactor, the change in ownership and management control of RadQual, and the prospects for new generic drug products, all collectively lead us to expect continued improvement in the future financial performance of the Company.\"\nInternational Isotopes Inc.\nThree Months Ended March 31 ,\n2018\n2017\nSales of Product\n$2,801,026\n$1,834,208\nGross Profit\n$1,358,618\n$810,240\nTotal Operating Expenses\n$1,209,013\n$1,492,653\nOperating (Loss)\n($682,413)\n($682,413)\nTotal Other Income (Expense)\n($51,365)\n($109,805)\nNet income (Loss)\n$34,404\n($786,266)\nNet income (Loss) Per Common Share\n$0.00\n$0.00\nbasic and diluted\nWeighted Av.
