Previously, he had run and sold two successful start-ups, one of which was acquired by Pfizer for $5.2 billion. Indigo Ag had 14 employees when he came on board. Today the company employs 250 people and has expanded operations to three other countries — Argentina, Australia and Brazil. Indigo Ag's last funding round closed in December and raised $203 million from Investment Corp of Dubai, Activant Capital and Baillie Gifford, bringing its total to around $400 million. ‹", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:35:26.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
