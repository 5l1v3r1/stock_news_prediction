GOCOVRI is a high-dose 274 mg amantadine (340 mg amantadine hydrochloride) taken once-daily at bedtime, which delivers high levels of amantadine upon waking and throughout the day. Data from two pivotal, placebo-controlled clinical studies in approximately 200 patients demonstrated statistically significant reduction in dyskinesia, as well as a secondary benefit in OFF time in patients dosed with GOCOVRI. The most commonly observed adverse reactions with GOCOVRI were hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, peripheral edema, constipation, fall and orthostatic hypotension. For more information about GOCOVRI, including complete safety information, please see the U.S. Prescribing Information at www.gocovri.com .\nAbout ADS-4101\nADS-4101 is an investigational drug in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. Derived from Adamas’ validated time-dependent biology approach to drug development, ADS-4101 is a potential high-dose, once-daily at bedtime lacosamide therapy, with a drug profile that provides high concentrations of lacosamide during the day to match the time when seizures occur most often. Lacosamide is an anti-epilepsy active ingredient previously approved by the FDA and currently marketed as VIMPAT ® (lacosamide).\nAbout Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAdamas’ goal is to create and commercialize a new generation of medicines intended to lessen the burden of chronic neurologic diseases on patients, caregivers and society using its deep understanding of time-dependent biology. The company is focused on the commercial launch of GOCOVRI™ (amantadine) extended release capsules (previously ADS-5102), the first and only FDA-approved medicine for the treatment of dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson’s disease receiving levodopa-based therapy, with or without concomitant dopaminergic medications, and delivering on its pipeline of differentiated investigational programs. Those programs include: ADS-5102 in development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis walking impairment; and ADS-4101, a high-dose, modified release lacosamide in development for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy.
