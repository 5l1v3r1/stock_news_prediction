(NASDAQ:EEFT), a leading global electronic payments provider, announces the acquisition of approximately 400 Easycash branded ATMs in Ireland, from Ulster Bank.\nThe Easycash ATMs are deployed nationwide in prime retail locations and will be a substantial addition to Euronet’s Irish market presence.
