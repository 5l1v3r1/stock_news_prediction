(NASDAQ:SLGL) (“Sol-Gel” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its clinical development programs.\n“We are continuing to make progress with our pipeline in our lead indications of acne vulgaris and subtype II rosacea as we prepare to initiate pivotal clinical trials for both programs this year,” stated Dr. Alon Seri-Levy, Sol-Gel Technologies’ Chief Executive Officer. “With our successful IPO earlier this year, we expect our current cash position to be sufficient to fund the completion of the planned Phase III clinical programs for TWIN and Epsolay ® (formerly VERED) while also advancing the development of SIRS-T and our generic product candidates.”\nCorporate Highlights and Recent Developments\nIn February 2018, Sol-Gel presented TWIN Phase II data for the treatment of acne vulgaris and Epsolay Phase II data for the treatment of subtype II rosacea at the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting.\nIn February 2018, Sol-Gel completed an initial public offering (IPO) generating aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $86.3 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nIn January 2018, Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: TASE: PRGO) was granted a tentative approval from the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ivermectin cream, 1%, the active ingredient in Soolantra ® , indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. Perrigo and Sol-Gel shared development costs and will share the gross profit 50/50.\nClinical Program Update\nSol-Gel recently held an end-of-phase II meeting with the FDA regarding TWIN and expects to commence the pivotal Phase III trials in acne vulgaris in the second half of 2018 as planned.\nSol-Gel has submitted a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) request with the FDA regarding Epsolay and expects to commence the pivotal Phase III trials in subtype II rosacea in the first half of 2018 as planned.\nSol-Gel plans to commence bioequivalence study for a generic drug candidate in 2018.\nFinancial Results\nFirst quarter 2018 Financial Results\nResearch and development expenses were $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.0 million during the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $1.6 million in clinical trial expenses, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in share-based compensation expenses and an increase of $0.2 million in salary expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.6 million during the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.3 million in salary expenses and an increase of $0.2 million in share-based compensation expenses.\nSol-Gel reported a loss of $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a loss of $5.6 million for the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Sol-Gel had $79.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $5.0 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAbout Sol-Gel Technologies\nSol-Gel is a clinical-stage dermatology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing branded and generic topical drug products for the treatment of skin diseases. Sol-Gel’s current product candidate pipeline consists of late-stage branded product candidates that leverage our proprietary, silica-based microencapsulation technology platform, and several generic product candidates across multiple indications.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
