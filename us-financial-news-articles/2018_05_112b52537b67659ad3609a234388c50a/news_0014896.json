Recently SABIC has held talks with ONGC officials about a stake purchase,” the second source said.\nONGC and SABIC did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.\nIndia and Saudi Arabia want to strengthen their trade ties. Saudi Aramco recently signed an initial deal with India to buy a 50 percent stake in a planned 1.2 million barrels per day west coast refinery and petrochemical project.\nTo expand its footprint in the world’s third-biggest oil importer, Saudi Arabia is also scouting for a stake in existing major refineries, its energy minister Khalid al-Falih has said.\nThe first source said OPaL made an operating profit for the first time in 2017/18, increasing its appeal to prospective investors. “There are enough green shoots in the company,” the source said.\nIndia’s per capita consumption of synthetic polymers, used to make various grades of plastics, is just 10 kg (22 lbs) a year, compared with a global average of about 32 kg.\nThe country’s per capita consumption of petrochemicals will rise with its expanding middle class, growing income levels and increasing urbanisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in March last year.\nThe second source said OPaL operated the project at about 65 percent capacity in the March quarter and it aimed to operate the plant at about 80 percent capacity in 2018/19.\n($1 = 67.2600 Indian rupees)\nAdditional reporting by Promit Mukherjee in MUMBAI; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T19:40:11.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
