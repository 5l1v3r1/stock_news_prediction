China’s Xie Zhenye came third in 10.17 with Gatlin trailing in seventh (10.20).\n“When I saw the rain tonight I thought ‘yes’. I train in these conditions all the time in the East Midlands. It suits me,” said Prescod who was 0.01 seconds shy of his personal best.\n“My expectation going in was I knew I had it in me as long as I executed my race. It is definitely the happiest moment in my time on the Diamond League circuit,” he said.
