The Lions are a good team and they put pressure on us in that last 10 minutes of that first half,” Highlanders captain Ben Smith said in a post-match interview.\n“They’ve got a pretty good lineout and some big physical forwards that took us on.”\nThe Lions’ trip to Australia and New Zealand finished on a sour note with their third successive loss following defeats to the Wellington Hurricanes and Queensland Reds.\nThey retain top spot in the South Africa conference, seven points ahead of Argentina’s second-placed Jaguares, but queries remain over their title credentials as their struggles against New Zealand sides continue.\nThe Lions were upset 25-17 in the title decider at their Ellis Park home last year by the Canterbury Crusaders and have not tasted victory against a New Zealand team since.
