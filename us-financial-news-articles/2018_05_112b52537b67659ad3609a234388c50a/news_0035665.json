(NASDAQ:AIPT) (“Precision” or “the Company”), a company focused on applying artificial intelligence to personalized medicine and drug discovery, announced today financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provided a business update.\nHighlights of the first quarter of 2018 and recent weeks include:\n• Changed corporate name from Skyline Medical to Precision Therapeutics and changed its NASDAQ Capital Market ticker symbol from 'SKLN' to ‘AIPT'\n• Signed an LOI to increase the Company’s equity stake in Helomics Corporation® from 25% to 100%\n• Precision Therapeutics, Helomics Corporation and GLG Pharma formed a partnership to use their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients\n• Formed TumorGenesis Inc. subsidiary to develop the next generation of patient derived tumor models for precision cancer therapy and drug development, with a focus on Multiple Myeloma, Triple-Negative Breast cancer (TNBC) and Ovarian cancers\nAppointed Mark Collins as President of TumorGenesis Secured license agreements with SyntArray LLC, 48Hour Discovery and CellBridge Incorporated to advance this strategy Engaged Richard Gabriel as a consultant to lead the external business development strategy for TumorGenesis\n• Raised $3.0 million in net proceeds in a public offering and the over-allotment option exercise by the underwriter\n• Appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as Precision Therapeutics' independent auditors\nHighlights from Skyline Medical, a division of Precision Therapeutics\n• Sold 16 STREAMWAY® Systems in the first three months of 2018, compared with three STREAMWAY Systems in Q1 2017, bringing the total number of STREAMWAY Systems sold to 123\n• Expanded sales team with the appointment of Kevin Hungerford as Global Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Skyline Medical\n• Opened new European headquarters in Belgium and appointed Jean-Paul Rasschaert as Vice President of International Sales\nManagement Commentary\nDr. Carl Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Precision Therapeutics, commented, “The first quarter of 2018 was a transitional time for Precision Therapeutics as we made rapid progress repositioning the Company as a leader in precision oncology through the formation of our TumorGenesis subsidiary and our 25% investment in Helomics Corporation. Subsequent to the quarter end, we were pleased to sign an LOI to purchase the remaining 75% of Helomics. This transaction, when completed, will cement our competitive edge in this market by giving us complete ownership of Helomics’ one-of-a-kind tumor data bank which has been developed over 15 years of clinical testing. This data contains the drug response profiles of over 149,000 patient tumors. We believe this data has the potential to revolutionize the effectiveness of clinical trials, and are excited by the opportunity to monetize this asset to grow revenues at Precision Therapeutics.\n“To complement and enhance this offering in the precision oncology space, we formed TumorGenesis to pioneer a powerful, new approach to growing tumors in the laboratory. This approach will ‘fool’ the cancer cells into thinking they are still in the patient’s body and is expected to provide a more relevant patient tumor model for the testing of drugs for personalized therapy and for the development of new drugs. Together, Helomics’ dataset and TumorGenesis’ tumor model will offer the most advanced technologies on the market to advance the clinical testing of new personalized cancer therapies. This is truly a unique offering, combining artificial intelligence with personalized oncology, and we have put together a formidable team of scientists to drive these efforts,” continued Dr. Schwartz.\n“Our Skyline Medical division is going from strength to strength, as evidenced by the record 16 STREAMWAY Systems sold this quarter. This very strong sales growth was the result of our expanded U.S.-based sales force, which led to an increase in sales to both existing customers and new customers. During the quarter, we opened our new European Headquarters and are pleased with their progress educating the market about the benefits of the STREAMWAY System. Europe is a major untapped market and we anticipate meaningful growth in this market in the second half of 2018 as our sales and marketing initiatives gain traction,” concluded Dr. Schwartz.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $411,593, compared with $175,166 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenue was derived from the sales of sixteen STREAMWAY Systems and the sale of STREAMWAY disposable products during the first quarter of 2018.\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $294,250 or 71.5% of revenue, compared with $138,174 or 78.9% of revenue for the same period in 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2.1 million, compared with $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily the result of higher sales and marketing costs associated with the expansion of our sales force.\nNet loss available to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1.8 million or $0.15 per share. This compares with a net loss available to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $1.3 million or $0.21 per share.\nThe Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $766,189 as of December 31, 2017. The increase in cash was the result of a public offering and the over-allotment option exercise by the underwriter that generated $3.0 million in net proceeds.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will also hold a conference call to discuss the financial results and provide a general business update. The conference call is scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

This business has launched with Precision Therapeutics' investment in Helomics Corporation, a precision diagnostic company and integrated clinical contract research organization whose mission is to improve patient care by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to bring innovative clinical products and technologies to the marketplace. In addition to its proprietary precision diagnostics for oncology, Helomics offers boutique CRO services that leverage our patient-derived tumor models, coupled to a wide range of multi-omics assays (genomics, proteomics and biochemical), and a proprietary bioinformatics platform (D-CHIP) to provide a tailored solution to our client's specific needs. Helomics is 25% owned by Precision Therapeutics. Helomics® is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the company maintains state-of-the-art, CLIA-certified, clinical and research laboratories. For more information, please visit www.Helomics.com .\nPrecision Therapeutics has also announced the formation of a subsidiary, TumorGenesis to pursue a new rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient. Precision Therapeutics and Helomics have also announced a proposed joint venture with GLG Pharma focused on using their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients, especially those who present with ascites fluid (over one-third of patients). The growth strategy in this business includes securing new partnerships and considering acquisitions in the precision medicine space.\nSold through the Skyline Medical business of Precision Therapeutics, The STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical's STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement, and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with OSHA and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room, and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the U.S. For additional information, please visit http://www.precisiontherapeutics.com/ .\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain of the matters discussed in this announcement contain forward-looking statements that involve material risks to and uncertainties in the Company's business that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made herein.
