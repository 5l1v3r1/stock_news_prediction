These services include loan production for commercial, industrial, consumer and real estate lending, as well as corporate cash management, credit cards, merchant processing, and business and private personal banking, all leveraging the bank’s proven high-tech, high-touch, single-point-of-contact model.\n“Our success in major urban markets supports our belief that private and commercial customers are increasingly demanding tailored product and service choices that reflect their needs – which are heavily driven by evolving local market conditions and trends,” said Jay Sidhu, Chairman and CEO of Customers Bank. “While we’ll continue to provide best-in-class technology solutions that permit customers to bank how they want, when they want, having a local office gives our growing customer base in D.C. the flexibility to work with banking professionals that they know and trust. Our customers work directly with their relationship bankers through a single-point-of-contact.”\nBanking veteran Travis L. Gray was appointed Senior Vice President and Banking Group Head of the first Washington, D.C. banking group. Prior to joining Customers Bank, Gray served as Senior Vice President and National Sales Executive at Bank of America Global Commercial and Investment Bank, where he built and oversaw the management and growth of a $1.1 billion asset finance business.\nRonald K. Hobson will join Gray’s D.C. banking group as Senior Vice President and Client Manager. Hobson is a veteran banker with over 30 years of commercial banking experience, most recently serving as Senior Vice President at Main Street Bank. He worked in the Clinton Administration as the Associate Deputy Administrator for Government Contracting and Minority Enterprise Development at the U.S. Small Business Administration, where he oversaw the nation’s $6 billion SBA business development program, and later served as Associate Director at the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization at the Department of Defense. Hobson is widely known in the Washington, D.C. market as an advocate for promoting and developing small business entrepreneurs. He has also served at the Pentagon as a non-commissioned officer in U.S. Army Intelligence. Hobson actively supports numerous community-based organizations, including a role as member and Chairman of the Board, respectively, of the Northern Virginia Urban League.\n\"Travis Gray and his group are amongst the most skilled and highly regarded veteran bankers in the District’s Metro area and they will help lead our entry into our Nation’s capital,” said George Maroulis, Managing Director, Executive Vice President and Head of Customers Bank’s Private and Commercial Banking Division. \"Customers Bank is dedicated to providing exceptional customer service and the products and services that businesses need. We look forward to partnering with local community groups to help bolster their missions and expand their outreach, as active corporate citizens of the broader communities in which we serve,” added Maroulis.\nAbout Customers Bank\nCustomers Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company located in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania engaged in banking and related businesses through its bank subsidiary, Customers Bank.
