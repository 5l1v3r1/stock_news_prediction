The company is preparing for a $2 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong. A company spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nGEM, which is based in Shenzhen, also makes battery materials and has a cobalt brand deliverable against the London Metal Exchange’s cobalt contract. The company did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
