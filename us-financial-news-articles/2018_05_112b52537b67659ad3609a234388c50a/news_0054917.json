It raised a $700 million 10-year loan late last year with a partial guarantee from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a unit of the World Bank.\nIt was once again in the market earlier this year for a $450 million one-year loan led by Credit Suisse and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.
