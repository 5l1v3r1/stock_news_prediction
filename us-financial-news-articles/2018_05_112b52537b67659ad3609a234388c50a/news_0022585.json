(\"Kingsway\" or the \"Company\") today announced it has entered into a letter of intent to sell its non-standard automobile insurance companies.\nManagement Comments\nLarry G. Swets, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"After significant debate, we pursued and executed a letter of intent to sell our non-standard auto business. It was a tough decision, but we will now be able to focus our time and resources on growing our Extended Warranty segment. The sale at statutory book value will allow us the liquidity to purchase a portfolio of investments from the insurance company so they can be utilized to fund future warranty acquisitions or merchant banking activity.\n\"We remain pleased with the trajectory of our Extended Warranty companies. We like warranty businesses and will continue to look for opportunities to grow this segment.\"\nLetter of Intent for Insurance Underwriting Segment\nThe letter of intent to sell the non-standard auto business (or the Insurance Underwriting Segment) remains subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements as well as the receipt of regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter, at which time the Company would record a loss on disposal of discontinued operations that it currently estimates to be approximately $8.5 million before actual and contingent expenses related to the transaction.\nAbout the Company\nKingsway is a holding company functioning as a merchant bank with a focus on long-term value-creation. The Company owns or controls subsidiaries primarily in the insurance, extended warranty, asset management and real estate industries and pursues non-control investments and other opportunities acting as an advisor, an investor and a financier.
