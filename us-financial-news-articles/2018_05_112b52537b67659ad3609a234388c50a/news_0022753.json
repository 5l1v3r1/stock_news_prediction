(\"Lazydays\")(NASDAQCM: LAZY) announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results and Highlights:\nLazy Days' R.V. Center, Inc. and Andina Acquisition Corp. II closed their business combination on March 15, 2018. The business combination was approved at Andina's extraordinary general meeting of shareholders. In connection with the consummation of the business combination, the combined company was renamed Lazydays Holdings, Inc. On March 16, 2018, the combined company's common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the financial information presented below and in the accompanying tables represents the combined operating results of Lazydays Holdings, Inc. (labeled as \"Successor\" in the accompanying tables) for the period from March 15, 2018 to March 31, 2018 with the operating results of Lazy Days' R.V. Center, Inc. (labeled as \"Predecessor\" in the accompanying tables) for the period from January 1, 2018 to March 14, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the financial information below represents the operating results of Lazy Days' R.V. Center, Inc. Revenues increased by $7.8 million, or 4.6%, from $170.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to $177.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Sales of recreational vehicles increased by $7.5 million, or 4.9%, from $150.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $158.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 driven by strong customer demand for new recreational vehicles. Gross margins increased by $3.2 million, or 9.2%, from $35.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to $38.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Increases in margins were primarily driven by an 8.8% increase in the average retail selling price per unit driven by a favorable sales mix and customer demand. Excluding transaction costs, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million or 6.5%. This was primarily driven by increases in salaries and compensation costs which increased primarily as a result of increased margins. Selling, general, and administrative expenses excluding transactions costs were 74.0% and 75.8% of gross margins for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $3.2 million in transaction costs as a result of the merger with Andina for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased by 15.4% from $10.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to $11.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 primarily driven by increases in gross margins described above. Cash increased to approximately $33.1 million, primarily as a result of the $94.8 million PIPE investment which took place in conjunction with the merger described above and approximately $11.2 million in incremental cash as a result of an increase in term loans. These financing cash inflows were offset by the $86.7 million purchase price payment in the merger between Lazy Days' R.V. Center, Inc. and Andina Acquisition Corp. II.\n\"We are pleased to be making our first earnings announcement following our merger with Andina Acquisition Corp. II. It was a transformative period for Lazydays as we became a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market,\" stated Mr. William Murnane, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lazydays. \"I'm very proud that our team was able to maintain its focus on business growth and operating improvements while we completed the merger.\"\nConference Call Information:\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call at 11:00AM Eastern Time on May 10, 2018 that will also be broadcast live over the internet.

We utilize these financial measures to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and believe that they are useful measures of performance. We believe that these measures are commonly used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance, in addition to the standard GAAP-based financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOur use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to other companies within the industry due to different methods of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and EBITDA Margin as only one of several measures for evaluating our business performance. In addition, capital expenditures, which impact depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income tax expense, are reviewed separately by management. We may incur expenses in the future that are the same or similar to some of those adjusted in this presentation.\nEBITDA is defined as net income excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, and income tax expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income excluding depreciation and amortization, non-floor plan interest expense, income tax expense, stock-based compensation, transaction costs and other supplemental adjustments which for the periods presented includes LIFO adjustments, and gain or loss on sale of property and equipment.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total net revenues.\nReconciliations from Net Income per the Consolidated Statements of Income to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are shown in the tables below.\nCombined Successor\nand Predecessor\nPredecessor\nThree Months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months\nended March\n31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n($ in thousands)\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income\n$ 3,027\n$ 3,975\nInterest expense, net\n2,704\n2,162\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment\n1,327\n1,347\nAmortization of intangible assets\n286\n187\nIncome tax expense\n1,167\n2,445\nSubtotal EBITDA\n8,511\n10,116\nFloor plan interest expense\n(1,031)\n(892)\nLIFO adjustment\n148\n576\nTransaction costs\n3,244\n46\nGain on sale of property and equipment\n(1)\n-\nStock-based compensation\n625\n119\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 11,496\n$ 9,965\nCombined Successor\nand Predecessor\nPredecessor\nThree Months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months\nended March\n31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(as percentage of total revenue)\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin\nNet income margin\n1.7%\n2.3%\nInterest expense, net\n1.5%\n1.3%\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment\n0.7%\n0.8%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n0.2%\n0.1%\nIncome tax expense\n0.7%\n1.4%\nSubtotal EBITDA margin\n4.8%\n6.0%\nFloor plan interest expense\n(0.6%)\n(0.5%)\nLIFO adjustment\n0.1%\n0.3%\nTransaction costs\n1.8%\n0.0%\nGain on sale of property and equipment\n(0.0%)\n0.0%\nStock-based compensation\n0.4%\n0.1%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n6.5%\n5.9%\nNote: Figures in table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.\nNews Contact :\n+1 (813) 204-4099\ninvestors@lazydays.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lazydays-holdings-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300646025.html\nSOURCE Lazydays", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lazydays-holdings-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300646025.html", "https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1662691/DD8C70C8AA9CE9667EED879398D613B9", "https://www.lazydays.com/investor-relations"], "published": "2018-05-10T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:10:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
