REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin/File Photo\nMalaysia is in the middle of intense campaigning for an election on May 9 that pits Prime Minister Najib Razak against 92-year-old former premier Mahathir.\nCritics say the new fake news law is aimed at curbing free speech and criticism of Najib, who is grappling with a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and popular anger over rising living costs.\n“I’m going to be charged under the new fake news law... Go ahead and charge me,” Mahathir said at an opposition rally in the administrative capital of Putrajaya on Thursday.\n“On May 9, we will take down this kleptocratic government led by one who is named Najib Razak,” he told thousands of cheering supporters.\nMahathir said last week that he suspected sabotage of a private plane that was to fly him from Kuala Lumpur to Langkawi, where he was to file his candidacy, after the pilot discovered some damage to the aircraft just before take-off.\nThe government ordered an investigation, following which the Civil Aviation Authority said the inquiry found no indication of sabotage. Its chairman said it was wrong to make such “wild and false” claims for political gain.\nMalaysia is among the first few countries to legislate policing of fake news. A Danish national was prosecuted last week under the law for inaccurate criticism of police on social media.\nMahathir and Najib have been targeting each other’s vote base in a fierce campaign. Najib is expected to retain power, but analysts are predicting a close contest.\nNajib, who chaired 1MDB’s advisory board, has consistently denied any wrongdoing over the billions of dollars that were allegedly siphoned off from the state fund. A Department of Justice investigation is under way into 1MDB in the United States, along with probes in other countries, including Singapore and Switzerland.\nThe opposition has claimed the election will be unfair - a plan to redraw electoral boundaries was rushed through parliament just days before Najib called for polls.\nSix opposition candidates were barred from contesting for either submitting incomplete documents or due to previous convictions or for being bankrupt.\nElectoral watchdogs also said there were alarming discrepancies in the voting list that could bring into question the legitimacy of the whole process.
