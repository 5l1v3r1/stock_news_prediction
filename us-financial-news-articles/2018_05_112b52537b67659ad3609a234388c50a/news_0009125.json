Qatar denies those charges.\nThe countries have been fighting in Yemen since 2015 against the Iran-allied Houthis, on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. A representative of the Saudi-led military alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Qatari’s arrest.
