The move came at a time when many retail companies are concerned about the dominance of the e-commerce giant.\nBut Broader said working together is a strategic business move.\n\"Finding alternative channels to introduce our products to new customers is what 2018 is all about for us,\" said Broader, who took over as CEO of the company in December 2015 and who also serves on the company's board of directors. \"When you have so many Prime members — we all know the number now — who better to partner with ... to gain those new customers for us?\"\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos revealed in an April letter to shareholders that the company has exceeded 100 million paid Amazon Prime members globally.\nChico's FAS stock has fallen on hard times recently, with share prices dropping from around $13 last May to lows of about $9 on Tuesday.\nSelect Chico's items are available now on Amazon through the partnership, but Broader said other products and brands may be available on the platform at a later date.
