The EU has dismissed both proposals.\n“The prime minister asked officials to take forward that work as a priority,” her spokesman told reporters after her so-called Brexit war cabinet failed to come to an agreement on which plan to pursue at a meeting last week.\nRelated Coverage Work on customs plans as a priority, May tells officials “Following last week’s cabinet sub-committee meeting, it was agreed that there are unresolved issues in relation to both models and further work is needed.”\nBrexit campaigners have criticised the customs partnership and believed it had been shelved until business minister Greg Clark again made the case for the proposal on Sunday. Johnson’s words were seen as a reaction to that.\n“It’s totally untried and would make it very, very difficult to do free trade deals,” Johnson said in an interview published in Tuesday’s Daily Mail.\n“If you have the new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting the tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier.”\nFILE PHOTO - Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrives to vote in local government elections in London, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay May’s spokesman said the prime minister had full confidence in her foreign secretary.\nThe prime minister has to tread a fine line, mindful of fears that any new customs infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland could reignite sectarian violence that has not been seen for decades.\nReporting by Michael Holden, Elizabeth Piper and William James, Editing by Kate Holton and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T11:54:18.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
