It hit a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday.\nThe rally followed remarks by Italian Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli on Wednesday that possibilities had emerged \"for the birth of a political government,\" suggesting politicians, rather than technocrats like himself, might be able to steer the country out of deadlock.\nThat eased fears of a snap election that some say would effectively be a referendum on Italy's euro membership.\nEuro zone inflation jumped far more than expected in May on higher energy costs, data showed on Thursday, bringing some relief to the European Central Bank after market turbulence that has jeopardized its planned exit from its crisis-era stimulus program.\nAn economic slowdown in Europe has pushed the euro lower since mid-April and reduced expectations for an early rate hike from the ECB. Thursday's inflation data could help put an ECB hike and unwinding back in play.\nThe inflation data had minimal immediate impact on the euro. But combined with Wednesday's hawkish message from the Bank of Canada, which strengthened the loonie as much as 1.4 percent against the dollar, it left the U.S. dollar vulnerable. This hurts the greenback more broadly \"because it reinforces the theme that the rest of the G10 is normalizing rates and the ( Federal Reserve ) is no longer a unique central bank,\" said Katzive.\nFollowing the President Trump's announcement of tariffs on Canadian, Mexican and the European Union steel and aluminum, the dollar gained 0.84 percent against the Canadian dollar at 1.2981.\nThe dollar gained 1.42 percent at 20.0022 against the Mexican peso.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the tariffs \"totally unacceptable\" during an announcement on Thursday. He introduced dollar-for-dollar tariffs he said would remain until U.S. leadership came to its senses.\n\"That Canada could be considered a national security threat to the United States is inconceivable,\" he added.\nThe dollar shed 0.25 percent to 108.63 yen , edging back toward Tuesday's five-week low of 108.10 yen.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 0.08 percent at 94.08 after having dipped as much as 0.4 percent on the day to 93.717.\nshow chapters Trading Nation: Fade the dollar rally? 3:26 PM ET Wed, 30 May 2018 | 02:19 --CNBC's Chloe Aiello contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T06:21:57.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
