(The government program also provides coverage to about 9 million younger people with permanent disabilities.)\nHow health care spending changes later in life Expense Medicare households Share of spending Non-Medicare households Share of spending Health care $5,355 14% $3,809 6% Transportation $5,231 14% $9,547 16% Food $5,687 15% $8,557 15% Housing $13,580 36% $19,078 32% Other $8,109 21% $17,819 30% Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, based on 2016 data Like Social Security, it's a benefit that you've been funding for years as a working taxpayer.\nAnd as long as your work history (or your spouse's) spans at least 10 years, you'll pay nothing for Medicare's Part A (hospital coverage) and an income-based amount for Part B (doctor's visits).\nYou should make sure to sign up during your initial enrollment window, which opens three months before your birthday month and ends three months after it.\nIf you sign up after that, you could end up paying late-enrollment penalties unless you meet an exclusion (i.e., you still have health insurance through work).\nYet even for those who sign up as soon as they can, unanticipated costs and coverage gaps can catch them flat-footed.\nWatch the above video to find out what Medicare does and does not cover and how to prepare for extra costs.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nYour retirement finances might not be as bad as you think, survey finds", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:02:03.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
