After Axon announced in 2017 that it would give free body cameras to every U.S. police officer, enforcement agencies signed up for field trials to test its equipment.\nFollowing the trials, Axon won nearly every major deal that was proposed, Smith told Cramer.\n\"When it comes to cameras, it's really the software ecosystem,\" the CEO said. \"We're running the geekiest office in Seattle. We're up there playing with the big guys. We're bringing in talent. Our head of AI came from Uber. Our head of software engineering came from Microsoft and from Amazon . So we're bringing a lot of talent and that's building a great system.\"\nSmith also nodded to a 2016 Cambridge University study that showed the efficacy of body cameras in law enforcement. The survey of seven U.S.- and U.K.-based police departments revealed that complaints dropped 93 percent when police wore cameras.\n\"Much like I'm probably not going to do anything too bad in front of a million people here on camera, you put a camera on and police behave more professionally and the people that they deal with also behave better,\" the CEO said.\n\"Police sitting and typing up reports all day doesn't make sense when you can record this stuff and actually know what happened,\" Smith continued. \"This is a phenomenon that we believe is going to go global.\"\nWatch Cramer's full interview with Rick Smith here: show chapters 'We're running the geekiest office in Seattle.'
