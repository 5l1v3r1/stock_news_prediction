Elliott took a 9.2% stake in Athenahealth last year and is now making a $160-per-share, $6.5 billion all-cash offer to snap up the company outright, CNBC reports .\nThat’s a premium of nearly 30% to Athenahealth’s closing price on Friday (and Athena shares promptly jumped 16% in Monday trading following reports of the deal). The question now is whether or not Bush and his board of directors are game for the M&A.\nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations.\nElliott, for its part, wasn’t exactly gentle in explaining a rationale for the deal: “It is clear to us and becoming clear to many others that Athenahealth’s potential will never be realized without the kind of operational change that the company seems unable to deliver,” wrote the firm in a letter announcing the offer, adding that Elliott and others had approached Athenahealth last year but been rebuffed.\nIt’s unclear what path Athenahealth will take (the company issued a boilerplate missive about reviewing the unsolicited proposal on Monday). One key factor, other than Bush, may be the company’s recently-appointed, high-profile chairman : former GE CEO Jeff Immelt.", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/paul-singers-elliott-to-make-all-cash-offer-for-athenahealth-of-155-160-a-share-sources.html", "https://www.axios.com/paul-singer-hedge-fund-buyout-athenahealth-1525700539-605639ad-9061-4d69-8694-3448791a263a.html"], "published": "2018-05-08T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T00:56:48.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
