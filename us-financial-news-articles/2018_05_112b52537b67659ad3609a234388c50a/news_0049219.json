Total software license revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 2% compared to the previous fiscal year, due to decreases in both annuity/maintenance license revenue and perpetual license revenue.\nCMG’s annuity/maintenance license revenue increased by 7% during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to increases in all geographic areas except for Canada.\nCMG’s annuity/maintenance license revenue decreased by 1% during the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to the previous fiscal year, due to decreases in Canada and South America, partially offset by increases in the United States and the Eastern Hemisphere.\nOur annuity/maintenance license revenue can be significantly impacted by the variability of the amounts recorded from a long-standing customer and its affiliates for whom revenue recognition criteria are fulfilled only at the time of the receipt of funds. The timing of such payments may skew the comparison of annuity/maintenance license revenue between periods. To provide a normalized comparison, if we remove this revenue from the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we note that the annuity/maintenance license revenue increased by 4% instead of decreasing by 1%. No payments were received from these customers during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Due to the economic conditions in the country where this customer and its affiliates are located, revenue from this customer and its affiliates will continue to be recognized on a cash basis, which may result in fluctuations in our annuity/maintenance license revenue. This normalized increase of 4% was due to increased licensing to existing and new customers in all of the regions except for Canada.\nPerpetual license revenue decreased by 32% and 16% for the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, due to fewer perpetual sales having been realized in most geographic areas. Software licensing under perpetual sales may fluctuate significantly between periods due to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the location where sales are generated. For this reason, even though we expect to achieve a certain level of aggregate perpetual sales on an annual basis, we expect to observe fluctuations in the quarterly perpetual revenue amounts throughout the fiscal year.\nSoftware Revenue by Geographic Segment\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change ($ thousands) Annuity/maintenance license revenue Canada 3,748 4,211 (463 ) -11% United States 4,565 4,318 247 6% South America 2,142 1,723 419 24% Eastern Hemisphere (1) 5,209 4,361 848 19% 15,664 14,613 1,051 7% Perpetual license revenue Canada - - - 0% United States 107 164 (57 ) -35% South America - 508 (508 ) -100% Eastern Hemisphere 1,946 2,364 (418 ) -18% 2,053 3,036 (983 ) -32% Total software license revenue Canada 3,748 4,211 (463 ) -11% United States 4,672 4,482 190 4% South America 2,142 2,231 (89 ) -4% Eastern Hemisphere 7,155 6,725 430 6% 17,717 17,649 68 0%\nYear ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change ($ thousands) Annuity/maintenance license revenue Canada 16,754 18,561 (1,807 ) -10% United States 18,519 16,460 2,059 13% South America 9,009 10,900 (1,891 ) -17% Eastern Hemisphere (1) 20,397 19,342 1,055 5% 64,679 65,263 (584 ) -1% Perpetual license revenue Canada - 114 (114 ) -100% United States 262 244 18 7% South America 394 1,070 (676 ) -63% Eastern Hemisphere 3,508 3,543 (35 ) -1% 4,164 4,971 (807 ) -16% Total software license revenue Canada 16,754 18,675 (1,921 ) -10% United States 18,781 16,704 2,077 12% South America 9,403 11,970 (2,567 ) -21% Eastern Hemisphere 23,905 22,885 1,020 4% 68,843 70,234 (1,391 ) -2%\n(1) Includes Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, on a geographic basis, total software license revenue remained consistent compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year as increases in the United States and the Eastern Hemisphere were offset by decreases in Canada and South America.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, on a geographic basis, total software license sales decreased in Canada and South America, partially offset by increases in the United States and the Eastern Hemisphere, as compared to the previous fiscal year.\nThe Canadian market (representing 24% of total annual software license revenue) experienced decreases of 11% and 10% in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, due to a reduction in licensing by some customers. No perpetual sales were recorded in Canada during the three months and year ended March 31, 2018.\nThe United States market (representing 27% of total annual software license revenue) experienced increases of 6% and 13% in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to increased licensing by existing customers. Perpetual license revenue for the three months and year ended March 31, 2018 was comparable to the same periods of the previous fiscal year.\nSouth America (representing 14% of total annual software license revenue) experienced an increase of 24% in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to reactivation of maintenance on perpetual licenses. Annuity/maintenance license revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 17%, compared to the previous fiscal year. Our revenue in South America can be significantly impacted by the variability of the amounts recorded from a long-standing customer and its affiliates for whom revenue is recognized only when cash is received. No payments were received from these customers during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, but we did receive payments from them earlier in fiscal 2018 and 2017. To provide a normalized comparison, if we remove this revenue from the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we note that the annuity/maintenance license revenue in South America increased by 22% instead of decreasing by 17%. This increase was mainly due to reactivation of maintenance on perpetual licenses.\nSouth American perpetual sales were down during the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, resulting in decreases of 100% and 63%, respectively.\nThe Eastern Hemisphere (representing 35% of total annual software license revenue) experienced increases of 19% and 5% in annuity/maintenance license revenue during the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to increased licensing to existing customers in Asia. The Eastern Hemisphere experienced an 18% decrease in perpetual license revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to realizing fewer perpetual sales. Eastern Hemisphere perpetual revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018 was comparable to the previous fiscal year, with a minor decrease of 1%.\nDeferred Revenue\nFiscal Fiscal 2018 2017 $ change % change ($ thousands) Deferred revenue at: Q1 (June 30) 31,551 (2 ) 26,154 5,397 21% Q2 (September 30) 23,686 (3 ) 20,787 2,899 14% Q3 (December 31) 17,785 18,916 (1,131 ) -6% Q4 (March 31) 34,362 (4 ) 38,232 (1 ) (3,870 ) -10% (1) Includes current deferred revenue of $36.3 million and long-term deferred revenue of $1.9 million.\n(2) Includes current deferred revenue of $30.3 million and long-term deferred revenue of $1.3 million.\n(3) Includes current deferred revenue of $23.0 million and long-term deferred revenue of $0.6 million.\n(4) Includes current deferred revenue of $33.4 million and long-term deferred revenue of $1.0 million.\nCMG’s deferred revenue consists primarily of amounts for pre-sold licenses. Our annuity/maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis or according to usage over the life of the related license period, which is generally one year or less. Amounts are deferred for licenses that have been provided and revenue recognition reflects the passage of time.\nThe above table illustrates the normal trend in the deferred revenue balance from the beginning of the calendar year (which corresponds with Q4 of our fiscal year), when most renewals occur, to the end of the calendar year (which corresponds with Q3 of our fiscal year). Our fourth quarter corresponds with the beginning of the fiscal year for most oil and gas companies, representing a time when they enter a new budget year and sign/renew their contracts.\nDeferred revenue as at Q4 of fiscal 2018 decreased by 10% compared to Q4 of fiscal 2017. The decrease is mostly due to the fact that the deferred revenue balance at March 31, 2017 included a number of contracts that were not included in the deferred revenue balance at March 31, 2018, because those contracts were finalized and invoiced subsequent to March 31, 2018, whereas in the previous fiscal year those contracts were finalized and invoiced prior to year end. After adjusting for these timing differences, deferred revenue decreased slightly as at Q4 of fiscal 2018, compared to Q4 of fiscal 2017.\nExpenses\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change ($ thousands) Sales, marketing and professional services 5,068 5,259 (191 ) -4% Research and development 5,171 4,587 584 13% General and administrative 1,626 1,582 44 3% Total operating expenses 11,865 11,428 437 4% Direct employee costs (1) 8,877 9,096 (219 ) -2% Other corporate costs 2,988 2,332 656 28% 11,865 11,428 437 4%\nYear ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ change % change ($ thousands) Sales, marketing and professional services 19,535 19,353 182 1% Research and development 20,371 16,423 3,948 24% General and administrative 6,744 6,000 744 12% Total operating expenses 46,650 41,776 4,874 12% Direct employee costs (1) 33,959 33,214 745 2% Other corporate costs 12,691 8,562 4,129 48% 46,650 41,776 4,874 12%\n(1) Includes salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, commissions, and professional development. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures”.\nCMG’s total operating expenses increased by 4% and 12% for the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to an increase in other corporate costs.\nDirect Employee Costs\nAs a technology company, CMG’s largest area of expenditure is its people. Approximately 73% of the total operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2018 related to direct employee costs. Staffing levels in the current fiscal year were lower compared to the previous fiscal year. At March 31, 2018, CMG’s full-time equivalent staff complement was 189 employees and consultants, down from 197 full-time equivalent employees and consultants at March 31, 2017. Direct employee costs decreased by 2% during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, mainly due to the reduced headcount. Direct employee costs increased by 2% during the year ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year, due to CMG recording a larger share of CoFlow salaries as a result of the new agreement with Shell.\nOther Corporate Costs\nOther corporate costs increased by 28% and 48% during the three months and year ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods of the previous fiscal year, due to higher office costs and depreciation related to moving into our new headquarters. The year ended March 31, 2018 includes $0.6 million of non-recurring charges related to the move, which were incurred in the first quarter of the fiscal year.\nOutlook\nDuring fiscal 2018, annuity and maintenance license revenue decreased by 1% due to higher receipts in the comparative fiscal year from South American customers for whom revenue is recognized only when cash is received, thus skewing the comparison between the periods. If we normalize revenue by removing the impact of receipts from these customers, annuity and maintenance revenue increased by 4%.\nAll geographic regions contributed to this normalized increase of 4%, with the exception of Canada, where sales continued to be affected by economic uncertainty. Double-digit growth in the United States is supported by continued interest in modelling of hydraulic fractures and other enhanced oil recovery processes in shale and tight reservoirs. The South American region, on an adjusted basis, also grew annuity/maintenance revenue at double digits, driven by reinstatement of maintenance contracts on perpetual licenses.\nAs the price of oil rose to the US$60-$70 per barrel range in fiscal 2018, for most of the regions we are more optimistic about our customers starting to increase their spending and reducing their focus on cost cutting, resulting in increased licensing of our software, as well as reinstatement of maintenance contracts on perpetual licenses.\nPerpetual license sales were $4.2 million during fiscal 2018. Although this is a $0.8 million decrease compared to fiscal 2017, it was in line with our expectations for the year.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we moved into our new headquarters in Calgary, which we will lease for the next 20 years. The new building features training facilities for customers and brings together our entire team in one location. We invested just under $16 million into the new building infrastructure over the past four fiscal years. Now that the new headquarters is complete, our capital expenditures are expected to return to their normal levels of a couple of million dollars a year.\nMainly due to costs associated with the new headquarters, our total operating expenses increased by 12% for fiscal 2018, compared to the previous fiscal year. The other factor contributing to the increase in operating expenses was the new agreement with our CoFlow partner Shell, under which CMG is responsible for a larger share of CoFlow costs starting January 1, 2017. At the same time, during 2018, our headcount decreased due to natural attrition, and we continue to exercise financial prudence and cost control.\nCMG’s research and development team continues to deliver new features and enhancements to our product suite. During fiscal 2018, we implemented several performance enhancement technologies, one of which is using artificial intelligence to preselect and optimize the numerical parameters of simulation models, resulting in a significant increase in the speed of simulation runs. During the year, we continued to enhance cloud-based solutions for our simulators, allowing customers to submit and run simulation jobs on a public cloud. The cloud solution gives customers flexibility and economies of scale with the “pay as you go\" model for hardware and CMG software, allowing them to improve operational efficiencies.\nCoFlow, our newest product that will provide a one-vendor solution for integrated asset modelling by combining reservoir, production networks and geomechanics in one environment, is in early marketing and trial modelling stages. Shell has been deploying and using the software on its selected assets, and we continue identifying potential customers and performing trial modelling for them using CoFlow.\nWe ended the year with a strong balance sheet, no debt and $63.7 million in cash. During fiscal 2018, we paid dividends of $0.40 per share. CMG’s Board of Directors has confirmed our commitment to shareholder returns by maintaining a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on June 15, 2018.\nOn May 23, 2018, CMG announced Ken Dedeluk’s retirement as President and CEO following the Annual General Meeting on July 12, 2018. Ryan Schneider, COO, will succeed Mr. Dedeluk as President and CEO. Mr. Schneider has been a key member of CMG’s executive and leadership team since 2011. He has served as the Company’s COO since 2015 and has played an active role in helping guide the Company’s strategic direction.\nFor further details on the results, please refer to CMG’s Management Discussion and Analysis and Consolidated Financial Statements, which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on CMG’s website www.cmgl.ca .\nForward-looking Information\nCertain information included in this press release is forward-looking. Forward-looking information includes statements that are not statements of historical fact and which address activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including such things as investment objectives and strategy, the development plans and status of the Company’s software development projects, the Company’s intentions, results of operations, levels of activity, future capital and other expenditures (including the amount, nature and sources of funding thereof), business prospects and opportunities, research and development timetable, and future growth and performance. When used in this press release, statements to the effect that the Company or its management “believes”, “expects”, “expected”, “plans”, “may”, “will”, “projects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “would”, “could”, “should”, “endeavours”, “seeks”, “predicts” or “intends” or similar statements, including “potential”, “opportunity”, “target” or other variations thereof that are not statements of historical fact should be construed as forward-looking information. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs with respect to future events and are based on information currently available to management of the Company. The Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking information are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking information should not be unduly relied upon.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain measures that have not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, such as “EBITDA”, “direct employee costs”, “other corporate costs” and “funds flow from operations”. Since these measures do not have a standard meaning prescribed by IFRS, they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that these indicators nevertheless provide useful measures in evaluating the Company’s performance.\n“Direct employee costs” include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits, commission expenses, and professional development. “Other corporate costs” include facility-related expenses, corporate reporting, professional services, marketing and promotion, computer expenses, travel, and other office-related expenses. Direct employee costs and other corporate costs should not be considered an alternative to total operating expenses as determined in accordance with IFRS. People-related costs represent the Company’s largest area of expenditure; hence, management considers highlighting separately corporate and people-related costs to be important in evaluating the quantitative impact of cost management of these two major expenditure pools. See “Expenses” heading for a reconciliation of direct employee costs and other corporate costs to total operating expenses.\n“EBITDA” refers to net income before adjusting for depreciation expense, finance income, finance costs, and income and other taxes. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income as determined by IFRS. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful supplemental information as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s main business activities prior to consideration of how those activities are amortized, financed or taxed. See “EBITDA” heading for a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income.\n“Funds flow from operations” is a non-IFRS financial measure that represents net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, deferred tax expense (recovery) and deferred rent. The Company considers funds flow from operations a useful measure as it represents the cash generated during the period, regardless of the timing of collection of receivables and payment of payables, and demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth and dividend payments. Funds flow from operations may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nCorporate Profile\nCMG is a computer software technology company serving the oil and gas industry.
