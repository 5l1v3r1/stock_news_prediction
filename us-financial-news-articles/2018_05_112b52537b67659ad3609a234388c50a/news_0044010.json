Maybe, I haven’t earned that at Madrid. There I don’t have the confidence that a footballer needs.”\nWith Isco let off the leash away from Madrid, Lopetegui has a dangerous weapon who could drag the 2010 champions to more World Cup glory.\nWriting by Rik Sharma; Editing by Ian Chadband\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:18:53.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
