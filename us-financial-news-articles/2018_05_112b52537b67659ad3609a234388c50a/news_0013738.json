The 30-year-old Lynn held the White Sox to two runs on eight hits, no walks and seven strikeouts in six innings.\nMinnesota has won back-to-back games and three of four.\nShortstop Tim Anderson went 3-for-4 with a double and two solo home runs to lead the White Sox, who have lost six of seven.\nWhite Sox left-hander Hector Santiago (0-1) was hammered hard in his second start of the season. He gave up eight runs on six hits and six walks in 3 1/3 innings. He struck out two.\nMinnesota quickly seized a 3-0 lead in the top of the first inning. Eduardo Escobar, Rosario and Mitch Garver drove in one run apiece as five of the Twins’ first six hitters reached base.\nThe White Sox shaved the deficit to 3-1 on a run-scoring single by Jose Abreu before Minnesota struck again.\nThe Twins added three runs in the third to pull ahead 6-1. Rosario belted a two-run shot to right field for his sixth homer of the season and his third in the past five games. Ehire Adrianza drove in the third run of the inning with a double.\nRosario continued his monster night with a two-run double in the fourth to push Minnesota’s lead to 8-1.\nAnderson doubled and scored in the fifth for Chicago’s second run. He followed with a solo homer to left field to cut the deficit to 8-3 in the seventh.\nAnderson clubbed another solo home run in the ninth to finish the scoring.\nThe White Sox played their first game without second baseman Yoan Moncada, who was put on the 10-day disabled list earlier in the day with left hamstring tightness. Moncada is hitting .263 with six home runs and 15 RBIs in 29 games.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-06T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T16:23:45.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
