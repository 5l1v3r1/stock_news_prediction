This resulted in a 264 million euro hit to first-quarter sales, which were down 4 percent.\n$1 = 0.8436 euros Editing by Maria Sheahan and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:17:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
