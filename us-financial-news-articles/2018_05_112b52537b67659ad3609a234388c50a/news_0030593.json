The International Monetary Fund has said Lebanon’s debt trajectory is unsustainable and needs urgent reform.\n“Lebanon always has the red flags flying because of its debt ratios, and now they are fluttering more aggressively because of the geopolitics and people are very nervous about that,” said Timothy Ash, senior Emerging Markets strategist at BlueBay Asset Management.\nLebanon held its first parliamentary election since 2009 on May 6. Iran-backed Shi’ite Muslim movement Hezbollah, together with parties and politicians aligned to it, won more than half the 128 seats in parliament.\nDifficult negotiations are expected over the division of positions in the new government after the current parliament’s term expires on May 20.\n“The Lebanon story was very challenging anyway with its public debt ratio and twin deficits, and it was a vulnerable credit in an environment of U.S. interest rates going higher,” said Ash.\n“The double whammy now is geopolitics - end of the Iran deal, concern about Israeli air strikes into Syria and Lebanon, concern about another Israel-Syria war, and Israel-Lebanon-Hezbollah keeps going on,” he said.
