(OTC:ECIA), a medical device company owning patented surgical technology that prevents dangerous stray electrosurgical burns in minimally invasive surgery, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter that ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company posted quarterly net revenue of $2.04 million for a quarterly net loss of $18 thousand, or $0.00 per diluted share. These results compare to net revenue of $2.21 million for a quarterly net loss of $115 thousand, or $(0.01) per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue for the current quarter included net revenue of $68 thousand from an order for non-AEM product. Gross margin on net revenue was 57% in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and 52% in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter. Gross margin on net revenue was higher in the current quarter as a result of product mix. Gross margin on net revenue was lowered further in last year's fourth quarter by applying overhead costs to faster turnover inventory.\nThe Company posted twelve months net revenue of $8.75 million for a twelve months net income of $336 thousand, or $0.03 per diluted share. These results compare to net revenue of $8.87 million for a twelve months net loss of $729 thousand, or $(0.07) per diluted share, in the year-ago twelve months. Net revenue for the current twelve months included net revenue of $492 thousand from an order for non-AEM product. Gross margin on net revenue was 57% in the fiscal 2018 twelve months and 50% in the fiscal 2017 twelve months. Gross margin on net revenue was higher in the current twelve months as a result of product mix. Gross margin on net revenue was lowered further in the fiscal 2017 twelve months by higher slow moving and obsolete inventory costs and applying overhead costs to faster turnover inventory.\nNet cash of $420 thousand was generated by operating activities in the current twelve months compared to $23 thousand of cash generated by operating activities in last year's twelve months.\n\"This past year has been a turning point for Encision,\" said Greg Trudel, President and CEO of Encision. \"We delivered new levels of operational excellence, launched new products and delivered black ink on the bottom line for the first time in recent history.
