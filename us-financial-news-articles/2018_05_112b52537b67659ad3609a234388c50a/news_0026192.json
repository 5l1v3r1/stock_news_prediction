We have a firm grip on our position,” added Thomas.\nAirbus, which won a bumper order with IranAir along with Boeing, said it needed time to study the impact of Trump’s decision on Iran.\nOn May 8, President Trump pulled the United States out of the international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.\nFrance, which has had close business ties with Iran since before the fall of the Shah in 1979,has sought to deepen trade ties since sanctions against Iran were lifted in 2016.\nMajor French companies operating in Iran include PSA, rival carmaker Renault and oil major Total.\nTrump’s decision could scupper Total’s multibillion-dollar gas project in the country unless it can secure a waiver.\nShares in Renault, PSA and Airbus all fell on Wednesday, although Total’s share price climbed higher, as oil prices rose in the wake of Trump’s move to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear agreement deal.
