Here's what Part D coverage costs The Trump administration wants to let Medicare Part D prescription drug plans more easily negotiate prices with manufacturers. Officials also want to require plans to pass on a portion of any drugmaker rebates they get to their enrollees. Among the 10 most-utilized standalone plans, the average premium ranges from $20.21 to $83.68 per month, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Published 25 Mins Ago CNBC.com\nWith President Trump expected to unveil his plan Friday to lower prescription drug prices for Medicare recipients, you might wonder if it means other costs related to your coverage will come down.\nDon't count on it.\nAs it stands, exactly what Medicare beneficiaries pay for prescription drug coverage depends on the specifics of the plan they choose and their income. And while some drugs could cost less under Trump's plan — which is expected to echo proposals already floated in the administration's proposed fiscal year 2019 budget — there's a chance insurers could react to any reduced revenue by eyeing their customers' wallets.\n\"They might shift costs to plan enrollees through higher premiums and deductibles, or shifting drugs to higher [cost] tiers,\" said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst for The Senior Citizens League.

Medicare itself cannot negotiate drug prices, and apparently Trump's plan wouldn't change that.\nTrump also is expected to propose requiring plans to pass on part of the savings they yield through drug manufacturer rebates. The administration's proposed 2019 budget also included this point, pushing for plans to share at least one-third of those discounts.\n\"That's good, but it also would codify in law that [insurers] are allowed to pocket two-thirds of the rebates as profits,\" Johnson said.\nHere's what people already pay for Part D coverage. The basics\nGetting prescription drug coverage through Medicare is optional. You choose to get it as a standalone Part D plan that serves as a supplement to original Medicare (Parts A and B) or as part of a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C).\nHowever, if you fail to sign up when you first qualify for coverage and change your mind later, you'll face a life-lasting penalty unless you meet certain exclusions (i.e., you receive acceptable coverage through a union or employer).\nIf you have Original Medicare and are looking for a standalone drug plan, the average monthly premium paid for 2018 is an estimated $43.48, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nThis is a 9 percent increase from the $39.90 in 2017, and a 68 percent increase from $25.89 in 2006. Exactly how much you pay depends partly on the plan you choose and your income. Higher earners pay a surcharge in addition to their plan's premium (see chart).
