The key ones were: a steep increase in regional automotive content requirements, a demand for half the value of North American vehicles to originate in the United States and a requirement to renegotiate the pact every five years.\nAll remain unresolved, despite nearly eight weeks of marathon negotiations in Washington in April and May, focused mainly on autos.\nCanada and Mexico had their role in running down the clock. It has taken Ottawa and Mexico three months to produce counterproposals, drawing criticism from Lighthizer they were failing to \"engage.\"\nCanadian and Mexican negotiators argued they needed time to understand the logic of U.S. demands because they came without customary backup evidence and analysis. U.S. negotiators said it was the consequence of the extremely tight timetable.\nBut U.S. chief negotiator John Melle privately complained to U.S. colleagues that Ottawa was deliberately wasting time on less essential matters, such as proposed new chapters on women's and indigenous people's rights, a U.S. source close to the talks said. Canadian officials deny trying to drag out negotiations.\nSpeaking at a business event early this year, Canada's veteran chief negotiator, Steve Verheul, described the talks as the \"most unusual negotiation\" he had ever been involved in, because of Washington's winner-takes-all approach.\n\"They are looking to strengthen the U.S. and by doing that weaken Canada and Mexico.\"\nWhich Lighthizer? Trump's threats to quit NAFTA and Washington's uncompromising stance made some involved in the talks wonder whether its goal was to blow up the pact or improve it.\n\"My boss thinks 40 percent of Lighthizer wants a deal, 60 percent doesn't, and you see both Lighthizers, sometimes in the same conversation,\" one NAFTA diplomat told Reuters.\nLighthizer frequently told reporters and lawmakers that he was negotiating for \"an audience of one,\" and it was ultimately Trump's call whether to accept or reject a deal.\nTalks seemed to gain some momentum in early April, when U.S. negotiators toned down their automotive demands - cutting the proposed regional content threshold by 10 percentage points to 75 percent, but with a $16 minimum wage component for 40 percent of autos. Mexico responded with 70 percent and 20 percent, respectively, though Guajardo on Friday still put chances of a deal before July 1 at about 40 percent.\nHowever, with Washington waging trade battles on other fronts it has been hard to sustain that momentum.\nFor example, when the United States threatened to hit Chinese imports with tariffs because of intellectual property concerns and talks reached a critical phase in late April, a trade mission to Beijing took Lighthizer away from NAFTA for a week.\nAnd last week, his office launched a national security investigation that could lead to tariffs on vehicle and auto parts imports from North America, Europe, and Asia. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Reuters on Thursday the move was intended to pressure Canada and Mexico in the NAFTA talks.\nWhether they will yield to that pressure is another matter and in the meantime, the probe could end tying up Lighthizer's stretched resources.\nEven with a deal on autos, it could take time to work out other issues, such as intellectual property safeguards for drugmakers, said former U.S. trade negotiator Wendy Cutler.\n\"Sometimes there's just not enough time to come up with creative solutions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:10:19.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
