REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser The event also attracted banks ready to offer financing for women buyers.\n“Anything related to cars these days is attracting Saudi Arabian women. I want to know more about cars and prices,” said Shaimaa al-Fadl as she climbed into a car at the exhibition and adjusted the rear-view mirror.\nThe royal decree will end a conservative tradition seen by activists as an emblem of the Muslim kingdom’s repression of women.\nA Saudi woman tries a car simulator during women car show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia May 13, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser The decision could change the lifestyles of millions of women. About 10 million women over the age of 20 live in Saudi Arabia, a number that includes foreigners, though it may take years for women drivers to be a major presence on roads.\n“I need a car every day for work,” government employee Maha Adel Rahman said. “Add to that the trips I need to make for my family. Moreover, transportation costs here are high. The decision to drive will save me a lot of money.”\nWhile the decree could save families money and encourage women to seek jobs, it could also be bad for one class of employee - the chauffeurs who traditionally ferry women around town.\nWriting by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by Angus MacSwan; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:37:44.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
