It’s going to be a great atmosphere.”\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens echoed that sentiment.\n“It’s a best two of three to go to the NBA Finals. It doesn’t get much better than that,” Stevens said in his postgame press conference. “Ultimately, anybody that didn’t think this was going to be tough — I mean, everything is tough.
