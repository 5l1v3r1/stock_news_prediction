The result beat the 725.3 billion yen average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.\nJapanese banks have been suffering diminishing returns from loans to both retail and corporate customers due in part to the Bank of Japan’s five-year-old economic stimulus programme, under which the central bank charges for some excess reserves private lenders deposit with it. That effectively forces banks to increase lending, raising competition and pushing down loan interest rates.\nAt SMFG’s core banking unit, net interest income from domestic operations - or profit from lending - fell 22 percent to 707.3 billion yen.\nHelping SMFG’s earnings was a decline in costs to cover delinquent loans and gains booked from sale of equity holdings.\nFor the year ending March 2019, SMFG forecast profit of 700 billion yen, down 4.7 percent from the just-ended year. That compared with an average analyst estimate of 704.3 billion yen.
