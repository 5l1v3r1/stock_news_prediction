He says he has a mining and exploration licence and is considering his options for raising $72 million to get the mine into production.\nLawson bought the Segilola project in 2016 for $3.1 million in cash plus 6 million Thor shares.\nHe promises rapid payback on the investment once production starts. Thor Exploration’s stock has climbed 50 percent this year while gold prices have only risen around 1 percent.\nThe World Bank has provided around $150 million to the Nigerian government to kickstart non-oil sectors after the economy was hit by a fall in oil prices, which are now recovering.\nThe Bank’s funding is meant to help the government formalise the artisanal mining sector, improve environmental practices and support infrastructure improvements for larger scale mines.\nMining provides only around 0.5 percent of GDP, according to World Bank figures, as the sector has struggled to attract foreign investment and to meet domestic needs, forcing costly imports.\nThe oil sector accounts for an estimated 8.7 percent of GDP and is critical for foreign exchange and fiscal revenue.\nThe World Bank in emailed comments said gold “offers good prospects” although many miners say other metals, such as iron ore, are more useful.\nMartin Wood, CEO of Australian-listed Kogi Iron, would not put a date on when the company could begin production in Nigeria, but said it was looking for investors to provide around $350 million.\nThe company plans to build a steel plant using local iron ore and coal.\nWhile a project in land-locked Kogi state, is not well-positioned to export, it has the infrastructure to sell domestically and could envisage 100 percent profit margins, while reducing Nigeria’s import dependency, Wood said.
