He shuttered his fund last year and is now focusing on teaching the next generation.\nLast year dedicated short-sellers lost an average 10 percent as other hedge funds gained 6.6 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research data. The S&P 500 meanwhile gained 22 percent.\nBut short-sellers may have regained an edge after a burst of market volatility earlier this year fueled by fears of rising U.S. interest rates and the Trump administration’s tough talk on trade.\n“We were the canaries in the coal mine,” Tilson said about investors including Einhorn, who bet that Lehman Brothers would crash months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy in 2008.\nTilson himself shorted Lumber Liquidators in 2015, accusing it of selling flooring laced with cancer-causing materials.\nWhile there are loud critics who wage public campaigns against companies they short, many other short-sellers had long kept positions secret for fear of losing access to corporate management or retribution from rival Wall Street investors through a so-called short squeeze.\n“Now more than ever I want to hear ideas on the short side and the younger managers are more willing to talk,” Tilson said.\nAdrangi, whose Kerrisdale Capital often announces short bets, said publicity can help create buzz around an idea and that shorting is essential for well-balanced portfolios.\n“The reason investors are paying hedge fund fees are to uncover alpha and shorting can help with that,” he said.
