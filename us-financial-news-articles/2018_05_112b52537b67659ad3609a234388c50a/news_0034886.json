in 2017, this would have equated to a 35 million to 46 million pound in revenue impact, representing 2-2.6 pct of group revenue\n- Says potential mitigation factors on profitability include reduced direct variable costs, product development, substitution to other betting products and market consolidation\n- Does not expect the proposed change to have a material impact on company’s UK retail strategy\n** CEO Peter Jackson: “...the wider gambling industry has suffered reputational damage as a result of the widespread unease over stake limits on gaming machines. We welcome, therefore, the significant intervention by the Government today, and believe this is a positive development for the long-term sustainability of the industry.”\nSKY BETTING & GAMING - Company says increasing the tax burden will impact its plans to create new jobs in the north of England in the years to come\n** “Sky Betting & Gaming doesn’t have any FOBTs but now we - and Yorkshire’s economy - risk being punished because of them. Any increase in Remote Gaming Duty is a tax on hi-tech Yorkshire jobs,” the UK-based company, which Canadian bookmaker The Stars Group ( TSGI.TO ) has agreed to buy\n“Rather than punishing a UK-based jobs creator, the government should focus on getting a fairer tax contribution from other tech companies who, unlike us, don’t already pay sufficient taxes on their UK activities.”\nReporting by Tenzin Pema in Bengaluru; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:35:33.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
