No tenders submitted after the Expiration Date will be valid. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, holders of Notes that are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 4, 2018 (such date and time, as it may be extended, the \" Early Tender Deadline \") and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be eligible to receive the Total Consideration set forth in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment set forth in the table above. Holders of Notes tendering their Notes after the Early Tender Deadline and prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the Tender Offer Consideration set forth in the table above, which is the Total Consideration less the Early Tender Payment.\nIn addition, holders of all Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes to, but not including, the applicable Settlement Date (as such term is defined in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement).\nThe consummation of the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation are subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement, including, among others, Chemours consummating the New Debt Financing (as defined in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement) on terms satisfactory to it, and having funds available therefrom that will allow it to purchase the Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer.\nIn order for the Proposed Amendments to be adopted, Consents must be received in respect of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (excluding Notes held by Chemours or its affiliates) (the \" Requisite Consents \").

Any Notes validly tendered and related Consents validly delivered on or prior to the Early Tender Deadline that are not validly withdrawn or revoked prior to the Early Tender Deadline may not be withdrawn or revoked thereafter, except as required by law. In addition, any Notes validly tendered and related consents validly delivered after the Early Tender Deadline may not be withdrawn or revoked, except as required by law.\nSubject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Tender Offer, Chemours expects to accept for purchase any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline on the Early Settlement Date (as defined in the Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement), which is currently expected to be June 6, 2018.

Such redemption is being made in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, which provides for a redemption price equal to 104.594% plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security.
