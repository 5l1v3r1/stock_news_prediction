Inflation rose 4.46 percent in the 12 months through the first-half of May, the national statistics agency said, above a Reuters poll forecast for 4.40 percent, but down from 4.69 percent seen in the first-half of April. Mexican inflation has fallen back toward the central bank's 3 percent target after spiking to a 16-1/2 year high close to 7 percent late last year. Last week, the central bank held its key interest rate at a nine-year high of 7.50 percent but policymakers warned they could act if a weaker peso fans inflation pressures. Mexican consumer prices fell 0.29 percent during the first half of May, compared to forecasts for a 0.32 percent dip as summer electricity subsidies kick in for northern Mexico. The closely watched core price index , which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.13 percent in early May compared to estimates for a 0.12 percent increase.
