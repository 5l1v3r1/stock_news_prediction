Reasons for the Revision of Year-end Dividends Forecast\nThe Square Enix group (the \"Group\") recognizes the return of profits to shareholders as one of its most important management tasks. The Group attaches continued importance to the shareholder returns, primarily by means of cash dividends, in an optimal balance between the performance-based payout and the stable returns. The amount of dividends is determined by setting a consolidated payout ratio target of approximately 30%, paying attention to stable payment of dividends.\nBased on the results of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, the Company has revised the year-end dividends forecast for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 from the previously announced amount to 55 yen per share (together with the interim dividends of 10 yen per share paid in the last December, the amount of annual dividends will be 65 yen per share). The Company's Board of Directors' Meeting to be held on May 17, 2018 will pass a resolution to pay the year-end dividends accordingly.\n(EOF)\nCompany: SQUARE ENIX HOLDINGS CO., LTD.\n(Code: 9684, Tokyo Stock Exchange)\nRepresentative: Yosuke Matsuda, President and Representative Director\nContact: Kazuharu Watanabe, Chief Financial Officer\nTel.
