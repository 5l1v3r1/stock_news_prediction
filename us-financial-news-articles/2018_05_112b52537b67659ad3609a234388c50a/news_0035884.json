He said he would support the government led by Mahathir and Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who is Anwar’s wife.\n“I’ve told Tun Mahathir, I don’t need to serve in the cabinet for now,” Anwar said, using an honorific for the prime minister.\nAnwar has been in hospital for some months, for surgery on a shoulder. But he looked in fine fettle as he walked free for the first time in three years, dressed in a black suit and tie, his hair neatly swept back.\nSupporters chanted “Reformasi” (Reform), the movement he launched two decades ago to challenge diverse Malaysia’s race- and patronage-based politics.\nAnwar was sentenced in 2015 to a five-year term for sodomy, a charge he says was trumped up by the government of ousted Prime Minister Najib Razak.\nMahathir, with whom Anwar joined forces to win last Wednesday’s election, greeted him at the palace where they both met the king.\nAnwar was Mahathir’s deputy in the 1990s but fell out with his mentor during the Asian financial crisis.\nHe was sacked from the ruling party and founded the Reformasi movement, challenging Mahathir’s government. Within weeks, he was arrested and jailed on charges of sodomy and corruption.\nImages at the time of a goateed, bespectacled Anwar in court with a black eye and bruises brought condemnation of Mahathir from around the world.

Both times, he and his supporters have said the charges were politically motivated.\nAnwar later told a news conference at his home he had forgiven the veteran leader, who was a pugnacious, uncompromising prime minister for 22 years from 1981.\n“I and Mahathir have buried the hatchet already, it was a long time ago,” Anwar said as he sat at a table under a marquee set up in the driveway of his home, his tie and jacket off and sleeves rolled up, after returning from the palace.\n“I have forgiven him, he has proved his mettle. Why should I harbor any malice toward him?” Anwar said, speaking above supporters sounding their car horns and a tropical downpour.\nThe pardon, which enables Anwar to re-enter politics immediately, was granted on the grounds that there had been a miscarriage of justice. ‘FIGHT NOT OVER’\nUnder a pre-election pact, Mahathir, 92, had vowed to enable Anwar’s release and eventually step aside for him to become prime minister.\nOn Tuesday, Mahathir said he expected to be prime minister for one or two more years, setting off talk of fresh differences between the two.

But Mahathir may be reluctant to hand over to his former nemesis, and if he drags his feet other scenarios could come into play,” said Peter Mumford of the Eurasia Group in a research note.\nMahathir is also racing ahead with an investigation into graft at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund founded by the ousted premier Najib that is sunk in a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal.\nMahathir has replaced the attorney-general and officials at the anti-graft agency, in what appears to be a purge of people seen as close to the former premier.\nNajib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have been barred from leaving the country. Najib denies wrongdoing.\n“It looks very likely that Najib will face the full force of the law,” said Adib Zalkapli, a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst with risk consultancy Vriens & Partners.\n“Just last week nobody would have thought that this posh boarding school boy would be rear ended by his old political headmaster,” he said.
