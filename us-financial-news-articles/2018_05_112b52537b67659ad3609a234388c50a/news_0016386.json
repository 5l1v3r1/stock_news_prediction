German policemen carry items collected after a raid on illegal immigrant workers in Hamburg, Germany, May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer\nThe officers, including special forces, seized large amounts of cash, gold, fake documents and computers from flats and offices in Hamburg, Bremen and the states of Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony. They also discovered at least 35 foreigners residing in Germany illegally.\nIn a statement, police said they arrested two Germans and one Russian suspected of facilitating the unlawful entry of the mainly Moldovan citizens, as well as providing them with illegal employment in security and other sectors.

The domestic intelligence service estimates the movement has several thousand members.
