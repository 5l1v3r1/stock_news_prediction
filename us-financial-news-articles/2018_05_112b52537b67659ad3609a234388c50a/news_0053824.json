Police apprehended him in the classroom.\nThey did not provide further details on the incident or release the names of anyone who was involved.\n“We do know the situation resolved extremely quickly,” Noblesville Police Chief Kevin Jowitt told reporters about the shooting at the school, which has about 1,350 students.\nThe incident occurred a week after a 17-year-old high school student in Santa Fe, Texas, near Houston shot and killed eight classmates and two teachers.\nLocal media said the Noblesville student who was shot was a 13-year-old girl.\nThe teacher was identified as Jason Seaman by the Indianapolis Star and other local media. Seaman’s mother said on Facebook her son was shot through the abdomen, in the hip and in the forearm, and was undergoing surgery.\n“Please pray for my son Jason,” Kristi Seaman wrote.\nPolice is seen near Noblesville West Middle School in Noblesville, Indiana, U.S., May 25, 2018 in this still image obtained from social media video.

The killing of 17 teens and educators there sparked a youth-led movement calling for new restrictions on gun ownership.\nPolice is seen near Noblesville West Middle School in Noblesville, Indiana, U.S., May 25, 2018 in this still image obtained from social media video.
