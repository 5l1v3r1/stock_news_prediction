Twilio, a provider of communications software for clients including Airbnb and Intuit, rose $9.12, or 21 percent, to $53.49.\nBoth companies have more than doubled in value in the past year by sticking with the subscription software playbook: Land big customers and then get them to buy more stuff.

The company, once heavily reliant on Uber and WhatsApp, has been diversifying its customer base. Those two companies now make up 4 percent and 7 percent of total revenue, respectively.\nTwilio CEO Jeff Lawson said the company recorded a net expansion rate of 132 percent as customers move more contact center software to the cloud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T19:57:29.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
