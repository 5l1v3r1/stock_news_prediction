Officials mention an initial figure of 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres)affected out of a total 70,000 hectares. They had also been damaged by frosts last year.\n“The figures...which will have to be refined, show that between 500 and more than 1,000 wine growers have been affected with a area hit of 1,000 hectares in the Medoc, between 4,000 and 5,000 hectares for Cote de Blaye and Cote de Bourg and about 1,000 hectares in the vicinity of Gensac”, Farges told Reuters.\nSome winemakers lost 100 percent of their harvest, he said.\nThere are 112,000 hectares of vines in the entire Bordeaux vineyard, the second-largest wine producing region in France after Languedoc Roussillon.\nChampagne, in northern France, has also been hit by hail and storms in recent weeks.\n“We already think more than 300 hectares were destroyed and that is without counting the storm we had a few days ago and the one forecast tonight,” said Brigitte Batonnet of Champagne producers’ group CIVC.\nLast year France’s total production had fallen to a record low due to a series of poor weather incidents including spring frosts, drought and storms that affected most of the main growing regions including Bordeaux and Champagne.\nFrench wine prices rose 6 percent in the first six months of the 2017/18 season, with Bordeaux posting a 16 percent price increase, farm ministry data released in March showed.
