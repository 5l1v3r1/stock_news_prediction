(Nasdaq: NTRI), a leading provider of weight management products and services including Nutrisystem® and South Beach Diet® brands, today reported financial results for the first quarter .\nDawn Zier, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We’re pleased first quarter 2018 revenue and earnings per share exceeded our expectations, driven by better than expected results in Nutrisystem’s direct-to-consumer business. As anticipated, South Beach Diet revenues increased significantly year-over-year, and we remain excited about the long-term opportunity it represents.”\nMs. Zier added, “Our multi-brand strategy, supported by our strong ecommerce and supply chain platforms, has us well positioned in our growing category. Key metrics for both of our brands are sound and continuing to improve, reinforcing our confidence in delivering meaningful growth in 2019.”\nThe following are key financial highlights for the period. Reconciliations of certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures are provided later in this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017\nRevenue was $210.9 million compared to $212.7 million.

The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable May 21, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 10, 2018.\nMike Monahan, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We are raising our full year 2018 guidance and continue to generate strong cash flows. The strength of our balance sheet has supported key capital allocation actions such as the recent increase of our dividend, the repurchasing of our stock, and continued funding of internal investments.”\nSecond Quarter and Updated Full Year 2018 Guidance\nThe Company’s second quarter and updated full year 2018 guidance is outlined below. Reconciliations of certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures are provided later in this press release.\nSecond quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $186 to $191 million, net income between $23.5 and $25.0 million, diluted income per common share between $0.78 and $0.83, and adjusted EBITDA between $38.4 and $40.4 million.

EBITDA is defined as net income excluding interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding non-cash employee compensation expense. The Company excludes non-cash employee compensation expense because it is a non-cash expense that is not reflective of the ongoing operations of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is provided so that investors have the same financial data that management uses to assess the Company’s operating results with the belief that it will assist the investment community in properly assessing the ongoing performance of the Company for the periods being reported and future periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nInformation provided and statements contained in this press release that are not purely historical, such as second quarter and updated full year 2018 guidance, and the Company’s financial and operational outlook, are within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
