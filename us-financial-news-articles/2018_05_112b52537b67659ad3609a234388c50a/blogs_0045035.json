A consulting firm had set up a website.\nJames Roser, Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance's chief information officer Photo: Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance\nGiven the opportunity to start fresh, he decided partnerships, not a massive build out, could deliver better value. “I didn’t want to go hire infrastructure people, hire people to build a data center,” said Mr. Roser, who came from insurance firm Markel Corporation, where he was IT head of global insurance, global reinsurance and associated infrastructure.\nMr. Roser, BHSI’s chief information officer, chose Duck Creek Technologies, a provider of property-casualty insurance software, to handle the firm’s underwriting and claims business. SunGard, now part of Fidelity National Information Services Inc., provided general ledger and accounts payable technology.\nThe emergence of cloud computing services influenced his decision to work with partners. Rather than making upgrades to a home-grown IT architecture, cloud-based technologies allowed BHSI to more quickly make changes as systems and business needs evolved.\nMr. Roser takes a cloud-first approach, but some applications still run on-premise. Catastrophe modeling tools run in-house partly because vendors weren’t ready for a shift to cloud, Mr. Roser said. BHSI also built an on-premise customer relationship management tool that it hosts in-house.\nAs BHSI expanded, Mr. Roser committed to using a single underwriting and claims platform globally, a decision he says is rare in the insurance industry. Many insurers set up separate systems in individual markets to handle the specific needs of each area.\n“The challenge we’ve had is how to deliver a single global claims platform,” Mr. Roser said. BHSI has worked closely with Duck Creek to adapt the platform to each market’s needs.\nOne early test: time zones. In the original version of the platform, a claim booked by an employee in Australia would go through servers in the United States and receive a time stamp from the US. So while a claim may have been booked on Tuesday morning in Australia, the time stamp would say Monday afternoon. Getting that fixed “was huge to the business from an audit perspective,” Mr. Roser said.\nBHSI now is working to automate and streamline much of the claims process. Connecting its policy administration system to more of its insurance products, for example, has helped reduce the time it takes to set up a claim from 30 minutes to five.\nThis year, BHSI rolled out an enterprise data warehousethat aggregates insurance policy and claims data, and is beginning to expand analytics capabilities across the firm. Over the next three months, Mr. Roser says he plans to set up meetings with business segment leaders to teach them about the new tools and think about how to answer specific questions, such as the profitability of products or specific coverages.\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: ANALYTICS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INSURANCE JAMIE ROSER Previous The Morning Download: Microsoft Azure Cloud Wins Intelligence Agency Deal", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:45:16.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
