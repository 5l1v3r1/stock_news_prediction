(NASDAQ:BURG) (“Chanticleer,” or the “Company”), owner, operator and franchisor of multiple branded restaurants in the U.S. and abroad, today announced its first quarter financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial and Operational Highlights\nTotal revenue of $10.0 million increased 1.4% compared to the same period last year. Growth in our Better Burger and Hooters businesses were offset by lower traffic in our Just Fresh business and the closure of underperforming locations.\nG&A decreased 13.2% to $1.2 million compared with $1.4 million in the prior year.\nNet loss attributable to Common Shareholders was $2.6 million, $(0.83) per share, compared to $1.8 million, $(0.79) per share in the prior year. Excluding the non-cash impairment charges, net loss attributable to Common Shareholders would have been approximately $1.0 million or $(0.30) per share.\nNon-Gaap Restaurant EBITDA improved to $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-Gaap Adjusted EBITDA improved to $0.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to a loss of $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCash from operating activities was positive $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to negative $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nOpened one company store and one franchise stores - Purchased one previously franchised store\nEntered into partnership with NASCAR superstar Denny Hamlin for Little Big Burger with option on nine additional stores.\nMike Pruitt, Chairman and CEO of Chanticleer commented, “We’re pleased with our Q1 2018 financial results. All of our core operating units exceeded our internal budgets. As indicated previously, we continue to believe the Company has reached an inflection point as we accelerate growth of our Little Big Burger concept with new locations generating above average unit economics and many outperforming our expectations. This growth phase consists of a robust pipeline of locations to support future growth, currently expecting to open 8-12 new Little Big Burger stores annually going forward, with upside to those expectations as new franchisees come on line.”\nPruitt continued, “Todays results are tangible progress towards the execution of our evolving and narrowing our strategic focus and allocation of resources to the domestic better burger segment where we generate the highest margins and rates of return. As we continue to increase focus on the domestic burger business, we are continuing to evaluate the potential sale of our domestic non-burger and international operations which would streamline the Company’s operations and significantly increase operating margins going forward.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Monday May 14, 2018 at 4:30 PM ET/1:30 PM PT\nTo access the call, dial 1-877-407-0784 approximately five minutes prior to the scheduled start time.

In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant EBITDA, which differ from the term EBITDA as it is commonly used. In addition to adjusting net income (loss) from continuing operations to exclude taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes pre-opening and closing costs for our restaurants, non-cash expenses, transaction and severance related expenses, change in fair value of derivative liability and other income and expenses.\nIn addition, Restaurant EBITDA also excludes management fee income, franchise revenue and general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and restaurant EBITDA are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, adjusted EBITDA and restaurant EBITDA are used internally in planning and evaluating the company's operating performance and by the Company’s creditors. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of these metrics offers investors, bankers and other stakeholders an additional view of the company's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Restaurant EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net loss or to net cash used in operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the company's performance. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant EBITDA is included in the accompanying financial schedules.\nFor further information, please refer to Chanticleer’s Annual Report on Form 10-Q to be filed with the SEC on or about May 14, 2018, available online at www.sec.gov .\nAbout Chanticleer Holdings, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Charlotte, NC, Chanticleer Holdings (BURG), owns, operates and franchises fast casual and full-service restaurant brands, including American Burger Company, BGR – Burgers Grilled Right, Little Big Burger, Just Fresh and Hooters.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
