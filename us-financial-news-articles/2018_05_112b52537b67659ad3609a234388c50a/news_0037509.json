REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed “There is no harm in Arab states collectively recalling their ambassadors in Washington to their capitals for consultations,” Maliki said in live televised remarks at the Arab League in Cairo.\nThe United States opened its new Israel embassy in Jerusalem on Monday in a controversial move to the holy city from Tel Aviv that has brought wide condemnation. Israeli soldiers killed dozens of Palestinians who protested in the Gaza Strip while the embassy opened.\nMaliki also said members of the Arab League, whose foreign ministers gathered in Cairo on Thursday for an extraordinary meeting to discuss the issue, should summon U.S. ambassadors “to remind them of the Arab rejection of the U.S. embassy’s transfer to Jerusalem.”\nHe said Arab states had agreed at previous summit meetings that they would cut ties with any country that moves its embassy to Jerusalem.\nLebanon’s delegation said its foreign ministry had sent a letter to the International Criminal Court demanding it “undertake measures” to hold to account those responsible for the killings of Palestinians. It did not specify what those measures should be.\nIt was unclear what the response would be to Maliki’s suggestion. Several Arab countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia enjoy strong ties with the administration of President Donald Trump.\nMost countries say the status of Jerusalem - a sacred city to Jews, Muslims and Christians - should be determined in a final peace settlement and that moving their embassies now would prejudge any such deal.\nPalestinian want Arab East Jerusalem, which was captured in the 1967 Middle East war, as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\nReporting by Sami Aboudi and Ali Abdelaty; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:50:06.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
