That compared with a 0.1 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.\nSamsonite's shares hit a record high of HK$38.60 on April 4 on strong sales of Tumi-branded goods and market expectations of further improvement in the luxury retail sector.\nAmong 14 analysts that cover Samsonite, the current average recommendation on the shares was \"buy,\" Thomson Reuters data showed. The breakdown was nine \"strong buy\" or \"buy,\" three \"hold\" and two \"sell\" or \"strong sell.\" The mean price target was HK$38.07.\nBlue Orca was launched earlier this month by Soren Aandahl, a Texas-based short-seller who previously co-founded Glaucus Research, which attracted attention for its attacks on several targets in Asia-Pacific.\nGlaucus' most recent target was Australia-listed fund manager Blue Sky Alternative Investments, whose shares have fallen 76 percent since Glaucus claimed in late March that Blue Sky had over-valued assets and exaggerated its performance. Blue Sky said the claims were incorrect and misleading.\nLast week, Samsonite posted an 18.6 percent year-on-year increase in profit at $43.9 million for the January-March quarter, with net sales rising 21.1 percent to $888.2 million.\nSamsonite said its gross profit margin was 56.5 percent at the end of March, from 55.3 percent a year earlier, due to a higher proportion of net sales coming from the direct-to-consumer channel and increased sales of Tumi-branded goods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:33:22.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
