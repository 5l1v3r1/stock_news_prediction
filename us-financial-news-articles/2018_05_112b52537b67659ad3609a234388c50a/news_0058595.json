REUTERS/Edgard Garrido The sanctions were in response to Venezuela’s “illegitimate and anti-democratic presidential elections,” it said in a statement.\nEarlier this month, Maduro won a new six-year term in an election that was denounced by a string of countries as unfair, triggering fresh sanctions from the United States.\nThe new Canadian sanctions include freezing the assets of the officials and prohibiting Canadians from having property or financial dealings with them.\n“These sanctions send a clear message that the Maduro regime’s anti-democratic behavior has consequences,” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said.\nLast September, Canada imposed sanctions against 40 Venezuelan senior officials, including Maduro.\nCritics say Maduro has plunged the nation into its worst-ever economic crisis.\nCanada is a member of the 12-nation Lima Group, which is trying to address the crisis.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:24:40.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
