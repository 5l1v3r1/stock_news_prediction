(\"CannTrust\" or the \"Company\" | TSX: TRST), a licensed producer of medical cannabis under the Health Canada Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulation (\"ACMPR\") program, today announced financial and operating results for the three months ending March 31, 2018. All amounts expressed are in Canadian dollars.\nRevenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was $7,839,847 compared to $3,033,245 in the comparable 2017 period. Net Income for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was $11,442,110 compared to a net loss of ($777,904) in the comparable 2017 period. Earnings per share for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was $0.12 compared to a loss per share of ($0.01) in the comparable 2017 period. During our most recent quarter a number of regular grow rooms at our Langstaff Facility were used to harvest Mother Plants for Phase 1 of the Niagara Greenhouse Facility. As a result, the Company used third party product purchases during the quarter as a temporary harvest replacement and bridge to meet the demand for the Company's products. Multiple harvests have now been completed at the Niagara Greenhouse Facility and these temporary third party product purchases have now been replaced with home grown product. Earnings were also impacted by one-time start-up costs at the Niagara Greenhouse Facility. The higher cost of these short-term third party purchases and start-up costs negatively impacted earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018 by approximately $2.9 million.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights\nRecord Revenues of $7.8M in Q1 2018, a 158% increase from the comparable prior year period Positive Net Income for the third consecutive quarter Active patients increased to more than 40,000, a 186% increase from the comparable prior year period Closed a $15 million mortgage financing on the Niagara Greenhouse Facility Executed a long-term agreement with Envest Corp. to provide cogen derived heat and power at the Niagara Greenhouse Facility.
