Profit of $42.5 million (Q1 2017: $23.4 million) and Earnings per share of $0.21 (1) (Q1 2017: $0.08) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. • Record quarterly EBITDA (2) of $95.9 million (Q1 2017: $89.1 million) and Adjusted EBITDA (2) of $95.5 million (Q1 2017: $89.3 million). Adjusted Profit (2) of $25.3 million (Q1 2017: $21.9 million) and Adjusted Loss per share (2) of $0.01 (1) (Q1 2017: Adjusted Earnings per share of $0.06) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. • 7.1% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share payable on May 24, 2018. • Delivery of the GasLog Houston on January 8, 2018 and, post quarter-end, completion of a short-term time charter agreement with a major LNG producer. The vessel is scheduled to commence a multi-year time charter with a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc (“Shell”) in December 2018. • Delivery of the GasLog Hong Kong on March 20, 2018 and the GasLog Genoa on March 29, 2018, two 174,000 cubic meters (“cbm”) LNG carriers with low pressure dual-fuel two-stroke engine propulsion (“LP-2S”) and commencement of their time charter agreements with Total Gas & Power Chartering Limited (“Total”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Total S.A., and Shell, respectively. • Ordered two 180,000 cbm newbuild LNG carriers from Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) with LP-2S propulsion, with scheduled delivery in the second quarter of 2020. • Announced and, post quarter-end, completed the sale of the GasLog Gibraltar to GasLog Partners LP (“GasLog Partners” or the “Partnership”) for $207.0 million. Part of the consideration was satisfied by the private issuance of $45.0 million of common units in GasLog Partners to GasLog. • On February 23, 2018, GasLog signed the Operation and Maintenance (“O&M”) agreement for the provision of related services to the Alexandroupolis floating storage and regasification unit (“FSRU”) project (the “Alexandroupolis Project”). • GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 8.200% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the “Series B Preference Units”), raising gross proceeds of $115.0 million and net proceeds of $111.2 million. (1) Earnings/(loss) per share (“EPS”) and Adjusted EPS are net of the profit attributable to the non-controlling interests of $23.2 million and the dividend on preferred stock of $2.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($14.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017).\n(2) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Profit and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for GasLog’s financial results presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). For the definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please refer to Exhibit II at the end of this press release.\nCEO Statement\nPaul Wogan, Chief Executive Officer, stated: “I am pleased to report another record quarter of revenues and EBITDA for GasLog, driven by the initial contribution of our 2018 newbuild deliveries and the stronger performance of the vessels operating in the LNG carrier pooling arrangement (the “Cool Pool”). On the back of our improving financial performance, our strong balance sheet and our confidence in the long-term prospects for the company, I am delighted to announce a 7.1% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to execute on our business plan, taking delivery of three newbuilds, the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Genoa and the GasLog Hong Kong , all on time and on budget. Due to their fuel efficient engines and low boil-off rate, these vessels will have highly competitive unit freight costs. We also continued to execute on our long-term growth strategy, recycling capital through the drop-down of the GasLog Gibraltar to GasLog Partners and ordering two newbuild LNG carriers for delivery in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, GasLog Partners announced two charter agreements with a new customer, simultaneously meeting key objectives of increasing the Partnership’s contracted revenues and diversifying its customer base.\nDuring the quarter, global LNG supply continued to increase, with Wood Mackenzie forecasting 9% growth in volumes during 2018. Although no new supply projects have yet taken a final investment decision (“FID”) in 2018, several major projects continue to make progress and we remain confident that additional liquefaction capacity will be sanctioned in 2018 and 2019.\nAs expected, LNG carrier spot rates experienced a seasonal decline from the multi-year highs of Q4 2017. However, headline spot rates remain higher year-on-year, and there are signs that rates have bottomed out as buyers now look to source supply for cooling demand in the Northern Hemisphere summer and heating demand in the Southern Hemisphere winter. We expect rates to strengthen in the second half of this year.\nThe Alexandroupolis Project continues to make good progress and we signed the O&M agreement during the quarter. Negotiations with the Greek national gas utility, DEPA, and Bulgarian Energy Holding (\"BEH\") regarding equity participation in Gastrade S.A. (“Gastrade”) are ongoing and, as noted in the Press Release of May 3, 2018 issued by Gastrade and DEPA, the Managing Directors of DEPA and Gastrade reached agreement regarding the future reservation of capacity in the terminal by DEPA. In addition, BEH confirmed its intention to speed up the respective negotiations for the completion of its own participation in the project. FID is still expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.\"\nLNG Market Update and Outlook\nGlobal LNG production continued to grow in Q1 2018, registering a 10% year-on-year increase and a 2% increase over Q4 2017 as measured by Wood Mackenzie. The ramp-up of the Yamal project in Russia has outperformed expectations, the first commercial cargo from Cove Point in the United States was exported in April and legacy liquefaction capacity operated at high utilization to take advantage of the high prices caused by strong demand growth partly driven by the cold Northern Hemisphere winter. However, new supply growth was partly offset by several plant outages, principally at PNG LNG following an earthquake in late February, and shorter outages of other projects in Malaysia, Russia and Peru.\nWhile a number of projects expected onstream in 2018 have experienced delays, Wood Mackenzie currently expects that some 29 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of capacity will enter commercial service between Q2 and Q4 2018, underpinning the forecasted 2018 supply of 325 mtpa, or 9% growth over 2017. Among the projects which Wood Mackenzie expects onstream in 2018 are Wheatstone Train 2 (Q2), Ichthys (Q3) and Prelude (Q4) in Australia, Cameroon floating LNG (Q2) and the second train at Yamal (Q4). A further 51 mtpa is forecast by Wood Mackenzie to come onstream over the 2019-2021 period. These estimates reflect recent news flow on the expected commissioning dates of the Ichthys, Freeport and Prelude projects.\nAccording to Wood Mackenzie, in Q1 2018, 10 mtpa of long-term supply contracts were agreed, bringing the total volume of long-term supply contracts signed since the beginning of 2017 to 37 mtpa, demonstrating strengthening interest from LNG buyers and potential support for sanctioning of further liquefaction capacity. Also during the first quarter, a number of potential new projects continued to make good progress towards FID, including projects in the United States such as Corpus Christi Train 3, in Canada (boosted by British Columbia tax relief proposals) and in Mozambique (the Area 1 project), as well as the announcement by the PNG LNG partners of reaching an agreement on plans to double exports from Papua New Guinea’s LNG facility to 16 mtpa.\nLNG market participants continue to forecast significant growth in LNG demand. Consensus compound annual growth rate in LNG demand of 6% is forecast over the 2017-2025 period. Based upon Wood Mackenzie’s forecasts of supply either onstream or under construction, this suggests the market may be short of LNG as soon as 2020, reiterating the need for further LNG supply projects to be sanctioned in the near-term. LNG continues to be seen as an attractive way to diversify energy imports, with Germany being the most recent country to articulate plans to develop LNG import infrastructure.\nAs measured by Poten, tonne miles in Q1 2018 were 18% higher year on year, continuing the significant growth trend seen in 2017. Structural changes in the LNG market, such as fragmentation of market participants, the increasing market share of portfolio suppliers such as Shell, Total and BP plc and commodity traders, and a move away from destination clauses in supply contracts are all increasing the amount of LNG traded and bode well for further increases in tonne miles.\nHeadline spot TFDE LNG shipping rates as reported by Clarksons have exhibited seasonal weakness in recent months, declining to $38,000 per day in late April from approximately $80,000 per day at the beginning of the year. The decline has been more rapid than expected and exacerbated by a number of one-off factors, including the unplanned downtime at LNG facilities mentioned above, delays in the commissioning of new liquefaction supply and the delivery of 18 newbuild LNG carriers during the first quarter of 2018. Nonetheless, current spot rates of $42,000 are 40% ahead of levels from a year ago. While the market may continue to be affected by seasonal factors driving LNG supply and demand, and there may be further delays to the commissioning of new liquefaction projects currently under construction, we remain optimistic that a tightening shipping market, driven by the positive outlook for LNG demand growth and the evolving LNG shipping market, will result in spot rates improving from current levels over time.\nThis positive outlook and the perceived requirement for new ships have resulted in 18 firm newbuild LNG carrier orders so far in 2018, of which two are GasLog vessels. Based on our analysis of expected LNG demand, between 35 and 62 additional LNG carriers will be needed by the end of 2022 and potentially as many as 117 vessels by 2025 to satisfy projected market growth.\nNew Charter Agreements\nGasLog Partners entered into agreements with a new customer for two new charters plus options for an additional two charters, exercisable by the charterer. The agreements include an approximately three-and-a-half-year charter for the GasLog Santiago , a 155,000 cbm tri-fuel diesel electric (“TFDE”) LNG carrier built in 2013, commencing in either August or September 2018 at the Partnership’s option, and a one-year charter for a 145,000 cbm steam-powered (“Steam”) vessel (either the 2006-built Methane Jane Elizabeth or the 2007-built Methane Alison Victoria as nominated by the Partnership) commencing in either November or December 2019 at the Partnership’s option. The charterer has options to extend the first charter for up to an additional seven years and the second charter for up to an additional four years, both at escalating rates.\nDelivery of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa\nOn January 8, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Houston , a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (“Hyundai”). The vessel completed a short-term charter to a major LNG producer and is currently available in the spot market until the commencement of her multi-year charter party with a subsidiary of Shell, from the end of 2018 until April 2028.\nOn March 20, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Hong Kong , a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Hyundai. The vessel was originally scheduled to commence a multi-year charter with Total in December 2018 ending in 2025. However, the commencement of the charter was brought forward to delivery from the yard, thus increasing the period of the charter to Total. Whilst the charter hire rate for this additional initial period is lower than that which GasLog will enjoy for the period from December 2018 to 2025, delivery of the vessel straight into charter from the yard together with the additional charter hire resulted in significant operational efficiencies for GasLog.\nOn March 29, 2018, GasLog took delivery of the GasLog Genoa , a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with LP-2S propulsion constructed by Samsung. The vessel commenced her charter party agreement with Shell upon delivery until 2027.\nAdditional Vessels\nOn January 12, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2213) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020. This vessel will now be the vessel to be chartered to Pioneer Shipping Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica plc (“Centrica”), for an initial period of approximately seven years, as previously announced on October 20, 2016. The 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2212) to be delivered in the third quarter of 2019 is currently without charter.\nOn March 9, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for the construction of a 180,000 cbm GTT Mark III Flex Plus LNG Carrier with LP-2S propulsion (Hull No. 2274) that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020 and is currently without charter.\nGasLog Partners’ Issuance of Series B Preference Units\nOn January 17, 2018, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 4,600,000 8.200% Series B Preference Units (including 600,000 units issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Series B Preference Units), liquidation preference $25.00 per unit, at a price to the public of $25.00 per preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were $111.2 million. The Series B Preference Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GLOP PR B”.\nSale of the GasLog Gibraltar\nOn April 16, 2018, GasLog entered into a share purchase agreement for the sale to GasLog Partners of 100% of the ownership interest in GAS-fourteen Ltd., the entity that owns the GasLog Gibraltar , for an aggregate purchase price of $207.0 million, which includes $1.0 million for positive net working capital balances transferred with the entity. GasLog Partners financed the acquisition with cash on hand, $45.0 million of new privately placed common units issued to GasLog (1,858,975 common units at a price of $24.21 per unit), and the assumption of the GasLog Gibraltar ’s outstanding indebtedness of $143.6 million. The sale closed on April 26, 2018.\nAlexandroupolis Project update\nOn February 23, 2018, GasLog entered into an agreement to provide O&M services to the Alexandroupolis Project. In addition, Gastrade is currently in discussions with a number of additional potential investors, including DEPA, the Greek state-owned gas company, and BEH, the holding company of the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy, and targets to take FID by the end of 2018 with the FSRU currently scheduled to be operational by the end of 2020. Following a trilateral meeting between DEPA, BEH and Gastrade, the Managing Directors of DEPA and Gastrade reached agreement regarding the future reservation of capacity in the terminal by DEPA. In addition, BEH confirmed its intention to speed up the respective negotiations for the completion of its own participation in the project.\nGasLog Partners’ At-the-Market Common Units Equity Offering Programme (the “ATM Programme”)\nOn May 16, 2017, GasLog Partners commenced an ATM Programme under which the Partnership may, from time to time, raise equity through the issuance and sale of new common units having an aggregate offering value of up to $100.0 million in accordance with the terms of an equity distribution agreement entered into on the same date. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC agreed to act as sales agents. On November 3, 2017, the size of the ATM Programme was increased to $144.0 million and UBS Securities LLC was included as a sales agent.\nSince the commencement of the ATM Programme through March 31, 2018, GasLog Partners has issued and received payment for a total of 2,737,405 common units, with cumulative gross proceeds of $62.9 million at a weighted average price of $22.97 per unit, representing a discount of 0.5% to the volume weighted average trading price of GasLog Partners’ common units on the days on which new common units were issued. No issuances of common units were made under the ATM Programme in the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the cumulative net proceeds were $61.2 million.\nDividend Declaration\nOn March 8, 2018, the board of directors declared a dividend on the Series A Preference Shares of $0.546875 per share, or $2.5 million in the aggregate, payable on April 2, 2018 to holders of record as of March 29, 2018. GasLog paid the declared dividend to the transfer agent on March 29, 2018.\nOn May 3, 2018, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, or $12.1 million in the aggregate, payable on May 24, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018.\nFinancial Summary\nIn thousands of U.S. dollars except per share data For the three months ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Revenues $ 128,285 $ 138,478 EBITDA (1) $ 89,069 $ 95,880 Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 89,338 $ 95,526 Profit for the period $ 23,392 $ 42,541 Adjusted Profit (1) $ 21,922 $ 25,289 Profit attributable to the owners of GasLog $ 8,752 $ 19,304 EPS, basic $ 0.08 $ 0.21 Adjusted EPS (1) $ 0.06 $ (0.01 ) (1) Adjusted Profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures, and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for GasLog’s financial results presented in accordance with IFRS. For definitions and reconciliations of these measurements to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS, please refer to Exhibit II at the end of this press release.\nThere were 2,163 operating days for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 2,070 operating days for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in operating days resulted mainly from the deliveries of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively.\nRevenues were $138.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($128.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase was mainly driven by the increased revenues from vessels operating in the spot market and the new deliveries in our fleet (the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa ).\nNet pool allocation was $8.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($0.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase was attributable to the movement in allocation of the net pool results in accordance with the applicable profit sharing terms. GasLog recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of $13.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively, from the operation of its vessels in the Cool Pool during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (March 31, 2017: $7.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively). The increase in GasLog’s total net pool performance was driven by higher spot rates and higher utilization achieved by all vessels trading in the Cool Pool. GasLog’s total net pool performance is presented below:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars Pool gross revenues (included in Revenues) 7,355 13,405 Pool gross voyage expenses and commissions (included in Voyage expenses and commissions) (1,380 ) (3,538 ) GasLog’s adjustment for net pool allocation (included in Net pool allocation) 828 8,653 GasLog’s Total net pool performance 6,803 18,520 Vessel operating and supervision costs were $34.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($27.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase was mainly attributable to the deliveries of the GasLog Houston , the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa , as well as increased scheduled technical maintenance costs related to engine maintenance, intermediate surveys and certifications and crew wages, all of which were affected by the unfavorable movement of the Euro (“EUR”)/U.S. dollar (“USD”) exchange rate (we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge part of this exposure and the associated realized gains are recorded in Gain on swaps, which is discussed below).\nVoyage expenses and commissions were $5.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($2.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase resulted from the increased bunkers consumption of the vessels operating in the spot market and the higher cost of bunkers as a result of the increase in oil prices.\nDepreciation was $35.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($33.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase resulted from the deliveries of the GasLog Houston , the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $12.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($10.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase is mainly attributable to an increase in employee costs, which were mainly affected by the unfavorable movement of the USD against the EUR and the British pound (“GBP”) (we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge part of this exposure and the associated realized gains are recorded in Gain on swaps, which is discussed below).\nFinancial costs were $36.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($32.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase was mainly attributable to the increased weighted average interest rate deriving from the upward movement of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) rates. An analysis of the financial costs is set forth below.\n( All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars ) For the three months ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Financial costs Amortization of deferred loan issuance costs and premium $ (3,459 ) $ (2,912 ) Interest expense on loans (22,482 ) (23,197 ) Interest expense on bonds and realized loss on cross-currency swaps (3,520 ) (7,473 ) Finance lease charge (2,714 ) (2,628 ) Other financial costs (349 ) (387 ) Total $ (32,524 ) $ (36,597 ) Gain on swaps was $17.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($0.2 million gain for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase in gain on swaps in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, is mainly attributable to an increase of $14.9 million in gain from mark-to-market valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss, an increase of $1.5 million in realized gain on forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading and a decrease of $1.5 million in realized loss on interest rate swaps held for trading. The $16.3 million gain from mark-to-market valuation of our interest rate swaps in the first quarter of 2018 was attributable to the fact that the LIBOR yield curve, which was used to estimate the present value of the estimated future cash flows, was higher than the contracted fixed interest rates resulting in a decrease in derivative liabilities from interest rate swaps held for trading as compared to December 31, 2017. An analysis of gain on swaps is set forth below.\n( All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars ) For the three months ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Gain on swaps Realized loss on interest rate swaps held for trading $ (2,151 ) $ (613 ) Realized gain on forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading — 1,486 Unrealized gain on derivative financial instruments held for trading 2,315 17,161 Ineffective portion of cash flow hedges — (263 ) Total $ 164 $ 17,771 Profit was $42.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($23.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). This increase in profit is mainly attributable to the positive movement in mark-to-market valuations of our derivative financial instruments in the first quarter of 2018, the increased profit from operations mainly due to the higher number of operating days due to the vessels’ deliveries in the first quarter of 2018 and the increased contribution of our vessels operating in the spot market, partially offset by the increase in finance costs.\nAdjusted Profit (1) was $25.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($21.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017) adjusted for the effects of the non-cash gain on swaps and the net foreign exchange gains/losses.\nProfit attributable to the owners of GasLog was $19.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($8.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase in profit attributable to the owners of GasLog resulted mainly from the respective movements in profit mentioned above, partially offset by the increased amount allocated to third parties as a result of the GasLog Partners’ equity offerings in January 2017, its ATM Programme initiated in May 2017, the issuances of the Series A Preference Units in May 2017 and the Series B Preference Units in January 2018, and the sale of three vessels.\nEBITDA (1) was $95.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($89.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase in EBITDA was driven by the increases in revenues and the increase in the net pool allocation, partially offset by the increases in vessel operating expenses and in the general and administrative expenses as discussed above.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) was $95.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($89.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017).\nEPS was $0.21 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($0.08 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017). The increase in earnings per share is mainly attributable to the respective movements in profit attributable to the owners of GasLog discussed above.\nAdjusted EPS (1) was a loss of $0.01 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (earnings of $0.06 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017), adjusted for the effects of the non-cash gain on swaps and the net foreign exchange gains/losses.\n(1) Adjusted Profit, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for GasLog’s financial results presented in accordance with IFRS.
