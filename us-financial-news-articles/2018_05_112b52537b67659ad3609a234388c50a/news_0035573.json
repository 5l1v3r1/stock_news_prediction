It is now making history in terms of land prices.\nChina’s HNA Group sent shockwaves in the property-obsessed city in late 2016 when it outbid local and mainland developers at nearly double the market forecast in its first land purchase in Hong Kong. It later bought three more land parcels in the same district.\nThe acquisition helped fuel the city’s infamously expensive property market - a government index on housing prices has been breaking records month after month since November 2016, when HNA made its first purchase.\nBut the aviation-to-financial services conglomerate has sold three out of its four Kai Tak sites to local developers this year.\nSun Hung Kai Properties is “very happy” about Tuesday’s victory and expects to invest a total of HK$40 billion in the project, said Deputy Managing Director Victor Lui.\n“The conditions are outstanding. It can be built into a landmark residential project that includes a mall. The government will also invest a lot of resources into the Kai Tak district,” he said in a text message. “The prospect is glorious.”\nSHKP’s bid also marked the most expensive price per square foot paid for land in Kai Tak, at HK$17,777. The site has a maximum gross floor area of 131,495 square metres (1.4 million sq ft)\nBut future land prices in Kai Tak could keep climbing, according to property consultancy Knight Frank’s Senior Director, Thomas Lam.\nThere are at least four more sites with full views of the Victoria Harbour that are yet to be sold, Lam said, and when asked if they could potentially break Tuesday’s record, Lam responded, “I think so.” ($1 = 7.8499 Hong Kong dollars) (Reporting by Venus Wu; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath and Subhranshu Sahu)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
