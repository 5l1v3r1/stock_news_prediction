Hyundai Motor Chairman Chung Mong-koo and the group's affiliates own a total 30 percent stake in Mobis, which will put the spin-off plan to a shareholder vote. The state-run National Pension Service holds a nearly 10 percent stake in Hyundai Mobis.\nElliott, which disclosed in April that it holds more than $1 billion worth of shares in three key affiliates of Hyundai Motor, previously called on the company to adopt a holding company strategy and appoint more independent board members.\nIt is Elliott's latest challenge to South Korea's powerful family-run conglomerates after it forced Samsung Electronics to increase shareholder returns in 2017, and comes amid a government campaign to boost investors' power in a country where shareholder activism is rare.\nIn 2015, Elliott narrowly lost a battle to block the merger of two Samsung affiliates. The deal was later implicated in a corruption scandal which led to the jailing of the country's former president and bribery charges against Samsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee, who denies any wrongdoing.\nElliott is seeking compensation from the government of no less than $670 million as part of an ongoing legal dispute over the 2015 merger, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\nHyundai Motor said in late April it would cancel $890 million worth of treasury shares, its first stock cancellation in 14 years. Hyundai Mobis said earlier this month it would cancel about 600 billion won ($562 million) in treasury shares from next year, and pay dividends in more installments.\nShares in Hyundai Motor were 0.3 percent higher, compared to the wider market's 0.5 percent rise as of 0124 GMT. Hyundai Mobis were up 1.3 percent, while Kia Motors was up 0.5 percent.\n\"Elliott's stakes in Hyundai Motor Group companies are known to be small. The move was expected,\" said Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung Securities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:38:20.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
