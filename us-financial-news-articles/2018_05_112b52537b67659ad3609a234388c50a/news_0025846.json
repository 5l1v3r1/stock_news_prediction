It last stood at $0.6966.\nThe British pound had less luck, falling to $1.3460 on Thursday, its lowest levels in four months, after the Bank of England reduced its growth and inflation outlook for 2018 and 2019 while keeping rates steady as expected.\nIt was last fetching $1.3518.\nThe dollar’s retreat should take the heat off some of emerging market currencies, which have been hit by worries about capital outflows to U.S, where yields are increasingly becoming attractive.\nThe Turkish lira stood at 4.2374 to the dollar, off its record low of 4.3780 hit on Wednesday.\nThe Malaysian ringgit steadied at around 4.0600 per dollar in offshore forward market, off near six-month low of 4.1350 touched on Thursday. The initial ringgit losses came amid some uncertainty after Mahathir Mohamad scored a stunning election win, defeating the coalition that has ruled the nation for six decades since independence from Britain.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:43:40.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
