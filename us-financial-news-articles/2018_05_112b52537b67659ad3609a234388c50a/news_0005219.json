They were allowed to return on Friday.\nOne person was hospitalized due to the explosion.\nZoeller said the board’s understanding of the accident came from descriptions by employees and contractors at the refinery preparing to shut the entire plant for an overhaul.\nThe cause of the FCCU explosion was unknown, he said.\nHusky spokeswoman Kim Guttormson said the refinery was not operating as the company begins investigating the cause of the explosion in coordination with government agencies.\nThe CSB’s four investigators at the Superior refinery have not been able to inspect the site of the blast because refining units are considered too unstable to walk around.\n“Husky said the cranes have started arriving and we expect to get in by the end of next week,” Zoeller said.\nHusky shut down production at the refinery after the explosion.\nThe CSB, which has no regulatory or enforcement authority, may send parts from the FCCU and other refinery units for metallurgical testing, Zoeller said. Most board investigations take about a year to complete.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T07:07:41.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
