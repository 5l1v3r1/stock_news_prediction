Britain’s Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox and Tencent Senior Executive Vice President Seng Yee Lau announced the deal at an event in London on Wednesday.\n“The next few years offer a golden opportunity for the UK to work with companies such as Tencent to drive innovation and shape the future of global trade,” Fox said at the ceremony. “We look forward to turning this ambition into a reality.\nLau told Reuters in an interview the British government trade deal gives Tencent a “landing pad” into Europe, starting with its planned creative industry partnerships while also leading to further commercial and investment prospects in time. “BUBBLING WITH IDEAS”\n“This is a land bubbling with ideas, its traditions offer appealing cultural content. It is a land of opportunities”.\nSo far, Tencent’s international expansion strategy has consisted of making it easier for Chinese tourists to use its services when travelling overseas, rather than creating localised versions of its apps for non-Chinese audiences, said Raj Rajgopal, president of digital strategy consultant Virtusa.\nThe popularity of Tencent’s WeChat app stems from how it melds messaging, social networking, e-commerce, media and gaming features in one place that a billion Chinese consumers use on their smartphones from morning to night.\nOutside of China, Tencent has made scores of international investments in ecommerce, payments and gaming firms. Its biggest move in Europe has been to acquire majority control of Finnish mobile games site Supercell in an $8.6 billion deal in 2016.\nIn 2017, Tencent Video, a Netflix-like streaming video service in China, jointly produced the blockbuster nature documentary “Blue Planet 2” with the BBC. It has reached more than 220 million viewers worldwide since it was first broadcast.\nThe MoU features a three-year deal between the BBC and Tencent Penguin Pictures for joint production, content development, commercial licensing, promotion and distribution of documentary films.\nWorking with Visit Britain, Tencent plans to create a new version of its “QQ Speed” racing game for mobile phone users with British characters, costumes and music. It also will work with Oxford University to host games and courses designed to promote the development of the e-sports industry, it said.\nTencent said it will become the exclusive strategic partner of the British Fashion Council working with fashion designers, supplying technology and hosting fashion events online.\nIn an earlier Britain-China trade deal announced in late 2017, Tencent said it was working with the Royal Opera House on joint performances and technology.
