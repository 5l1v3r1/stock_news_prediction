Trump suggested that having the summit at Peace House would carry a symbolic value that having it in a third country would not.\nBut the U.S. president also has said the two sides were considering other places as a possible site for the summit, including Singapore.\n“People never thought you were going to have a situation where we’re having serious and positive communications with North Korea. And we are,” Trump told reporters as his top diplomat was en route home from North Korea, where he was given three U.S. citizens who had been detained there.\n“What happens? Who knows,” Trump said. “We have a chance at something very great for the world.”\nNorth Korea released three American prisoners and handed them over to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday, clearing a major obstacle to the summit.\nReporting by Jim Oliphant; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Tim Ahmann and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T22:00:55.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
