Soy contracts are priced in dollars.\nBrazilian farmers also stand to gain from a drought in Argentina, the world’s third largest producer, and China’s slowing purchases of U.S. soy as the two countries trade threats over tariffs, he said.\nThe fresh figures indicate Brazil is on track to remain the world’s most prominent soybean exporter and China’s largest supplier of the oilseed.\nThis year, the country is likely to sell 70 million tonnes of soybeans overseas, a new all-time high, according to consultancy INTL FC Stone.\nThe South American country will receive an estimated $36 billion in export revenue from the so-called soy complex of soybeans, soy oil and soymeal this year, data from soy crusher association Abiove show.\nOn Wednesday, the government said Brazilian soybean shipments totaled 10.26 million tonnes in April, close to a record of 10.96 million tonnes exported in May 2017.\nAnec data differs from numbers released by the government because they are compiled under different methodologies, Mendes said. The government’s foreign trade agency Secex compiles the figures based on reported amounts, while Anec export figures reflect actual shipment data.\nFor the first four months of the year, Brazil’s soy exports rose by 5.4 percent to 29.2 million tonnes, the strongest Jan-April reading in history, Anec said.\nThe government measure released on Wednesday indicated that Brazilian soybean exports were 23.5 million tonnes over the period.
