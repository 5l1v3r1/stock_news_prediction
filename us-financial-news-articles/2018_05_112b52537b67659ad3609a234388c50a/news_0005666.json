(NYSE:TDOC) today announced the pricing of its offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The size of the offering was increased by $25 million from the previously announced offering size of $225 million. In connection with the offering of the Notes, Teladoc granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of Notes on the same terms and conditions solely to cover over-allotments. The sale of the Notes is scheduled to close on May 8, 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nTeladoc estimates that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $242.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by Teladoc, and assuming no exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional Notes solely to cover over-allotments. Teladoc intends to use the proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the pursuit of strategic acquisitions should they arise, and to pay fees, commissions and expenses related to the offering.\nThe Notes will mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.375% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2018. The Notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of Teladoc. Teladoc may not redeem the Notes prior to May 22, 2022. On or after May 22, 2022, Teladoc may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes if the last reported sale price of its common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading days. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, including additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require Teladoc to repurchase their Notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Notes will be convertible, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, at an initial conversion rate of 18.6621 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $53.58 per share, and will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The initial conversion price represents a conversion premium of approximately 28.5% over the last reported sale price of $41.70 per share of Teladoc’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 3, 2018. Teladoc will settle conversions of the Notes by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election.\nThe offering is being made to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Neither the Notes nor any shares of Teladoc’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have been or will be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.\nAbout Teladoc, Inc.\nTeladoc, Inc.
