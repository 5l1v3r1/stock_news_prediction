Brewer III, a Dallas-based lawyer who represents the group.\nThe settlement follows decisions by numerous companies to sever corporate partnerships the NRA.\nNational debate has heated up over the issue of gun control, and the NRA’s role in opposing it, since Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.\nIn addition to the fine, Illinois Union agreed not to participate in the Carry Guard insurance program, or any similar program in New York, nor to provide Carry Guard or similar policies to New York residents, regardless of where they are written, the DFS said.\nIllinois Union is also not allowed to issue policies for New York residents that provide legal services coverage in a civil or criminal proceeding.\nOn May 2, the New York regulator fined insurance broker Lockton Cos LLC $7 million for serving as the “Carry Guard” program administrator.\nIn February, Chubb Ltd said it had given notice to the NRA late last year of its plan stop underwriting the “Carry Guard” program.\nLockton said in February it would no longer sell NRA-endorsed products.\nThe NRA, on Monday, sued Lockton in a U.S. trial court in Alexandria, Virginia, saying it had breached its contract with the group.\nA Lockton spokesman declined to comment.
