Pollock hit three homers, Nick Ahmed added a homer, and Zack Greinke had his first 10-strikeout game of the season as the Diamondbacks held off the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-5 at Chase Field on Monday.\nEarlier in the day, the Dodgers learned shortstop Corey Seager will undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery on Friday.\nPollock hit bases-empty homers in the second and fifth innings to help Arizona grab a 5-0 lead. He added a third solo homer in the eighth as the Diamondbacks (20-8) equaled the best start in franchise history. They did not lose back-to-back games in April, a franchise record for any month.\nAhmed had three hits, including a bases-empty homer in the fourth inning, and Greinke (3-2) gave up two runs on four hits and one walk in six innings. He had double-digit strikeouts for the first time since fanning 12 Chicago White Sox batters on May 22, 2017.\nYasmani Grandal had three hits and an RBI, Joc Pederson had a triple and two RBIs, and Max Muncy homered for the Dodgers (12-16). Los Angeles has lost six of seven.\nPollock has six homers in the past 10 games, and he hit nine in April, a career best for any month. It was his first career three-homer game.\nDaniel Descalso, Jeff Mathis and Greinke had two hits apiece. Greinke’s RBI single capped a three-run second inning off right-hander Ross Stripling (0-1), who started when the Dodgers used a bullpen day after Rich Hill was unable to go because of an infected finger.\nAhmed homered with two outs in the fourth for a 4-0 lead before Pollock made it 5-0 in the fifth.\nGrandal singled in a run and scored on Pederson’s triple in the sixth, and Muncy homered in the seventh to make it 5-3. Arizona then used a single, two walks, a hit batter and an infield error to score two in the bottom of the seventh for a 7-3 lead.\nGrandal doubled and scored on Pederson’s sacrifice fly in the eighth inning before Matt Kemp singled in a run.\nChris Taylor started at shortstop for the Dodgers and will be the regular there, manager Dave Roberts said. Taylor had played 27 games in center field this season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T16:20:02.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
