State forensics experts are being asked to identify the remains through DNA analysis, and the beach area was being searched on Thursday, the statement said.\nThe foot was found about a mile north of where six black children are thought to have died when their adoptive white mother, Jennifer Hart, 38, of Woodland, Washington, drove their sport-utility vehicle off a seaside cliff.\nHer wife, Sarah Hart, 38, who was also white, died in the crash about 200 miles north of San Francisco. It was discovered by a motorist on March 26.\nTwo of the children - Devonte Hart, 15, and Hannah Hart, 16 - are still missing. The children who have been confirmed dead ranged in age from 12 to 19.\nDevonte Hart gained international attention in 2014 when he was photographed hugging a white police officer at a rally to protest the shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.\nJennifer Hart is thought to have driven the car off the cliff three days after child protective services in Washington state opened an investigation into allegations she and her partner potentially neglected or abused the children.\nThree children have tested positive for an ingredient commonly found in the allergy drug Benadryl, which can make people sleepy, the sheriff’s statement said, without giving further details. One child had no toxicological finding.\nA police autopsy has shown that Jennifer Hart was legally drunk at the time of the crash.\nAuthorities have said Sarah Hart also tested positive for the Benadryl ingredient.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T01:50:47.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
