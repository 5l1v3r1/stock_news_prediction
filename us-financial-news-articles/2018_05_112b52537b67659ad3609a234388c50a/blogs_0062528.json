The inequality is particularly stark in San Francisco.\nMark Farrell, the city's mayor, said in April that there would be an \"aggressive\" push to clear tent encampments out of the Mission District.\nIn addition to banners and chants, the protesters used a pile of electric scooters, largely from the startup Lime, as a roadblock. Critics in San Francisco say the recent deluge of electric scooters has led to cluttered walkways and sidewalks.\n\"It's absurd scooters have more rights than the homeless do,\" one protest participant said to the Examiner .\nThe city is requiring the three major scooter companies — Lime, Bird, and Spin — to remove their devices from sidewalks on June 4 until they've been issued permits.\nGoogle and Lime didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nHere are some photos and videos from the protest:\nTweet\nTweet\nTweet", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FitzTheReporter/status/1002221576366911488", "https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/SF-mayor-vows-to-clear-out-homeless-tent-camps-12852701.php", "https://missionlocal.org/2018/05/protesters-say-no-to-techsploitation-block-buses-with-scooters/", "http://sfist.com/2017/06/26/2017_san_francisco_homeless_census.php"], "published": "2018-05-31T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:44:30.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
