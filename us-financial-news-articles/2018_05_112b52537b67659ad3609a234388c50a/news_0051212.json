Earlier this month, the United Arab Emirates agreed to a similar deal with the Trump administration. Bastian credited the administration for allowing the airline to restart the service to India. The three Persian Gulf carriers involved in the dispute with their U.S. competitors offer frequent service from their hubs to India.\n\"This move will mark a return to India for Delta, which was forced to exit the market after subsidized state-owned airlines made service economically unviable,\" the company said in its announcement\nThe service requires government approval, Delta said, adding that it plans to also expand its code-sharing agreement with local partner Jet Airways to carry passengers to other destinations in India.\nUnited Airlines is the only U.S. airline that currently flies nonstop to India from the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:45:22.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
