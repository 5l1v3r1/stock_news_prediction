Marzo said he was told by a USGS geologist there was much more to come from Kilauea.\n“What has been coming out is just a small fraction of what was in the volcano,” he said he was told.\nThough lava destruction from the volcano is confined to a roughly 10-square-mile (26-sq-km) area, the eruption is hurting the island’s tourist-driven economy as potential visitors fear ashfall or volcanic smog belching from Kilauea’s summit.\nA 4.4 magnitude earthquake at the volcano’s summit on Friday prompted County of Hawaii Civil Defense to reassure the island’s 200,000 residents that there was no risk of a tsunami.\nYear-to date 2018 visitor numbers to the Connecticut-sized island are “trending a little bit lower” than 2017, with the cancellation of some port visits by cruise ships expected to have a $3 million impact, said Ross Birch, head of the island’s tourism board on a conference call.
