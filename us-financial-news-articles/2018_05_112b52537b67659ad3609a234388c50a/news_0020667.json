Furthermore, we continued to closely manage operating expenses, which were again below the low-end of our expected range, contributing to our fourth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA.\n“During the quarter, we continued to make solid progress on expanding our design win pipeline, which has served as a key catalyst in driving our current and future revenue growth. Designs in the industrial market led the way and included wins for not only our DataFlash products, but also other product families. We also secured a number of design wins with new customers in the smart home market with our newly-released DataFlash-L family. Additionally, we had a number of design wins with leading tier 1 OEMs across consumer and communications end markets.”\nMr. Derhacobian further commented, “We are also pleased to announce today our agreement to acquire S3 Semiconductors, a Dublin-based global supplier of mixed-signal and RF ASICs to the industrial IoT and communications markets. This transaction represents a meaningful step for Adesto as we broaden our line of innovative semiconductor products, expand our addressable markets and drive accelerating revenue growth as well as margin and earnings expansion in the quarters and years ahead.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was up 35.3% to $15.3 million from $11.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, and sequentially down 5.3% from $16.2 million in the previous quarter.\nGross margin in the first quarter was 46.9%, compared to 49.1% in the first quarter of 2017 and 47.9% in the previous quarter.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our past financial performance and future results. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our business strategies and assess operational efficiencies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments based on the following items:\nStock-based compensation expenses: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures. Although stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees’ compensation affecting their performance, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is a non-cash expense, and it is not part of our core operations. Investors should note that the use of acquisition-related intangible assets contributed to revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to future period revenues as well.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are described as follows:\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is GAAP net loss as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by weighted average shares outstanding and, if dilutive, incremental shares based upon the conversion of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and warrants. Non-GAAP operating expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses are GAAP operating expenses as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA is GAAP net loss as reported on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of the same items excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) as well as interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and our provision for income taxes.\nFor reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nAbout Adesto Technologies\nAdesto Technologies (NASDAQ:IOTS) is a leading provider of innovative application-specific semiconductors for the IoT era.
