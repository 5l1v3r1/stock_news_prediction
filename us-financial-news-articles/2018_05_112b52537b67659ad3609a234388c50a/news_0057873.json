As an analogy, it’s as if a fraudster got access to the clearing records of a stock exchange and falsified a series of share transfers.\nThis is basically what happened to Bitcoin Gold. According to the website Bitcoinist , the records of a digital wallet show hackers made a series of fraudulent deposits in which the money never ended up with the recipient exchange:\n“The attacker sends a particular number of BTG tokens to an exchange, trades them for another coin and makes a withdrawal. The hacker then returns those same coins in his/her wallet, hence the double-spending problem. Thus, the attacker can spend and hold the same coins at the same time. Looking at the image above, if all 76 transactions were indeed part of the hack, then the hacker has stolen about $18 million based on the current BTG price.”\nThe Bitcoin Gold network still appears vulnerable to further such attacks. The hacker has yet to strike again, however, possibly because further attacks could trigger a massive sell-off as Bitcoin Gold holders lose faith in the integrity of the network.\nThe price of Bitcoin Gold fell slightly on news of the attack but so far there has been no sign of panic selling.\nOn Tuesday morning, a Bitcoin Gold developer acknowledged the ongoing risk in a blog post , and added there are plans to introduce a software update known as a “hard fork” that will decentralize the mining power on the network. (The blog post doesn’t state if the hard fork will restore the coins swindled from the exchanges).\nAs Quartz notes, the crisis at Bitcoin Gold represents the “ nightmare scenario ” for any cryptocurrency, and could theoretically happen to numerous other currency networks.\nWhile the threat has existed for years, the chances of it materializing appeared to diminish as more and more people joined cryptocurrency networks—which in theory makes it harder to obtain control of over half the network. But the rise of massive mining conglomerates that deploy specialized computer equipment has seen a growing centralization of mining in recent years.\nFor now, there appears to be no imminent threat of a 51% attack on Bitcoin itself—in large part because of the size of the network—but other smaller networks could be more exposed.
