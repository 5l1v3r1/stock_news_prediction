Issuing additional debt could weigh on the company's credit profile, while supplying more stock or convertible bonds would dilute current shareholders.\nTesla declined to comment for this story.\nDespite the forecast for additional capital requirements and a sell rating from Goldman, Musk insisted as recently as May 2 he has no intention of raising new money.\nAsked earlier this month if he's mulling a capital raise, Musk simply said \"no.\"\n\"I specifically don't want to,\" he said on a conference call after Tesla posted first-quarter earnings that beat expectations.\nTesla finished the quarter with roughly $2.7 billion in the bank, down from a balance of $3.4 billion at the end of 2017. The persistent cash burn has kept analysts like Tamberrino unconvinced that the Palo Alto, California-based company can keep going at this pace without a larger financial cushion while short sellers keep the heat on the company's equity.\nTesla shares are down 8 percent this year and closed Wednesday at $286.48, giving the automaker a market value of $48.6 billion.\nTamberrino believes the stock price will fall to $195 over the next six months, a 31 percent decline. The stock was trading slightly higher Thursday morning, at $286.59.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T16:31:43.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
