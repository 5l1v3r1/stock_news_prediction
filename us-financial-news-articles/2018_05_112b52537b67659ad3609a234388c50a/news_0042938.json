It handed control of those crossings late last year to its rival, the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, in a reconciliation deal signed in Cairo.\nEgypt closed the border for long periods after attacks on Egyptian security forces in the Sinai Peninsula that increased in 2013, with Egyptian officials blaming Palestinian militants from Gaza for some of them.\nshow chapters The economy of Ramadan 5 Hours Ago | 01:24", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:22:28.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
