China’s stainless prices have flatlined since mid-January at around 15,500 yuan a tonne.\nStainless producers beyond China are also concerned.\nFinland’s Outokumpu reported first quarter profits more than halving on falling prices and expects more of the same this quarter. Spain’s Acerinox reported a drop of 40 percent in first quarter earnings, buffeted somewhat by solid U.S. earnings.\nIn December, Handelsbanken downgraded Outokumpu citing the “tremendously negative” impact from low-cost capacity in Indonesia while Jefferies says weak Asian stainless markets are weighing on Acerinox in Europe and Africa.\nThe weakness in the stainless market is also a worry for nickel producers.\nTwo-thirds of nickel demand comes from stainless mills. Benchmark London Metal Exchange nickel (LME) prices rose 27 percent last year amid a ramp up in global stainless output and they are up some 10 percent this year at around $14,000.\nHowever, should stainless price weakness persist, mills, particularly those that are loss-making, could cut production.\nING said, even before operating costs are accounted for, Chinese mills are in the red as stainless prices since December have fallen below nickel prices.\nThe global nickel market is tight, explaining some of the price strength in nickel.\nThe International Nickel Study Group last week nearly doubled its global nickel deficit forecast for 2018 to 117,000 tonnes.\nLME nickel stocks MNI-STOCKS, at their lowest since mid-2014 and Shanghai Futures Exchange nickel stocks near their lowest since November 2015, also illustrate the tightness. SNI-TOTAL-W\nHowever, Chinese media reports say stainless mills are scrambling to combat the supply glut by bringing forward maintenance schedules or switching from stainless to carbon steelmaking.\n“Nickel is our preferred short at these levels, we’re forecasting below $13,000 by year-end,” said ING analyst Oliver Nugent.\n“While respecting the tightness, the price is up about 25 percent since December while stainless is dead flat, pointing at concerns that prices can’t be passed onto the end consumer.”\nAdditional reporting by Eric Onstad Editing by Pratima Desai and David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:10:20.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
