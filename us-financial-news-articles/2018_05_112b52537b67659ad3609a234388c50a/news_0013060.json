Those approaches were largely spurned by his predecessor, Pope Benedict, a German whose conservative stance generally didn’t sit well with his compatriots.\nIn the most recent example, Vatican officials on Thursday indicated that Pope Francis wouldn’t move to block a proposal by German bishops to allow some Protestant spouses of Catholics to receive Communion in Catholic churches, asking them to agree among themselves on the matter. The initiative has met with resistance within Germany and drawn conservative protests abroad.\nCardinal Reinhard Marx is one of several liberal German church leaders who have gained influence in the Vatican of Pope Francis.

That influence has reached a recent high point under the current pope.\n“As far as national bodies of bishops go, the Germans are the key internal allies of Pope Francis in shaping and carrying out his vision for the church,” said John Allen, president of Crux Catholic Media and author of numerous books on the Vatican. “To a striking degree, the Germans are the protagonists of the drama of this papacy.”\nThe German church is one of the richest in Catholicism, owing to the country’s state-collected church tax, which put €6.1 billion ($7.3 billion) into the church’s coffers in 2016 alone. In 2015, the German Catholic church gave more than €450 million in charitable aid to Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. Along with their counterparts in the U.S., German bishops have long been the most reliable financial supporters of the Vatican and of churches in the developing world.\nMore\nSex-Abuse Victims Accept Pope’s Apology, Now Urge Him to Act (May 2) Australian Cardinal George Pell’s Sex-Abuse Case to Go to Trial (May 1) Canada Lawmakers Seek Papal Apology Over Indigenous Schools (May 1) For 35 years, however, the German bishops’ conference’s liberal majority stood at odds with the Vatican. Ironically, they found little favor under Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the German theologian who carried out a conservative line during the long papacy of John Paul II and who continued that line as Pope Benedict XVI.\nNow the German church is asserting itself under the first developing-world pope. Since becoming pontiff in 2013, Pope Francis has turned to German cardinals as two of his top advisers, including Cardinal Walter Kasper, who has for decades advocated giving Communion to divorced Catholics who remarry without annulling their first marriages, prohibited under traditional teaching. In 2016, Pope Francis issued a document indirectly supporting the liberal position .\nCardinal Walter Kasper, shown in January, is a close ally of Pope Francis. Photo: bilan/EPA/Shutterstock “Under the last two pontificates, Kasper and his allies were forced to proceed behind the scenes, but with this pope they have come out into the open,” said Sandro Magister, a Vatican expert who writes for Italy’s L’Espresso magazine.\nCardinal Reinhard Marx, head of the German bishops’ conference and another of the pope’s top advisers, also called for a more conciliatory approach to gay Catholics. “We can’t say that because you are a homosexual, you can’t experience the gospel,” he said. “That is not possible for me…We can’t divide people into first-class and second-class Christians.”\nThe debates over divorce and homosexuality have exposed tensions between bishops in Germany and their more conservative peers in Africa . Supporters of the latter stress that Africa is the continent where the church is growing fastest; according to Vatican statistics, Africa’s Catholic population rose by 19.4%, from 186 million to 222 million, between 2010 and 2015. In Germany, by contrast, an average of 167,000 Catholics formally left the church every year between 2010 and 2015, leaving 23.6 million registered Catholics in the country today.\nThe German push to allow Protestant spouses to receive Communion—something German bishops have long advocated and tacitly permitted—is facing internal resistance at home, and warnings that it could inspire similar moves elsewhere.\n“Is the German hierarchy, not content with having driven hundreds of thousands of Catholics out of the Church in their own land, now seeking to export their model of failed leadership?” conservative commentator Phil Lawler wrote this week on the website Catholic Culture.\nAfter the German bishops’ conference voted in February to publish guidelines permitting the practice “in certain cases,” a minority of seven opposing bishops led by Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki of Cologne appealed to the Vatican for a ruling, on the grounds that access to the Eucharist is too central a question to let local churches decide on their own.\nOn Thursday, top German bishops—including Cardinals Marx and Woelki—were in Rome to make their cases to the Vatican’s offices for doctrine, ecumenism and church law.\nThey were told the pope wanted them to go back and agree unanimously on a policy, indicating that the pope thinks the matter is for German bishops, not Rome, to decide.\nWrite to Francis X.
