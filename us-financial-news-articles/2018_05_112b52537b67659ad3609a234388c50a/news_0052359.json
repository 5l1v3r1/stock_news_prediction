It valued Samsonite at HK$17.59 a share, 43 percent below its last traded price of HK$30.70.\n“The company is of the view that the allegations in the report are one-sided and misleading, and accordingly, the conclusions drawn in the report are incorrect,” Samsonite said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nSamsonite said Blue Orca’s opinions might not be aligned with those of shareholders and might be intended to undermine confidence in the firm and its management.\n“We intend to draw a line under this matter as quickly as possible, and move on to focus on what is important – the future growth of our business,” Chairman Timothy Parker said in a separate statement.\nThe luggage group said it would provide additional information in due course.
