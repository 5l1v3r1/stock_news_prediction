Miguel Gomez followed with an RBI single, completing a three-run inning while increasing the San Francisco lead to 4-2.\nThe Rockies hung within 5-4 before McCutchen doubled in a pair of runs in the fifth inning to give the Giants a three-run cushion.\nCrawford then smacked his fourth homer of the season, a two-run shot, in the seventh, putting the Giants in a commanding position at 9-4. He finished 3-for-5, raising his batting average in May to .449 (31-for-69).\nRight-hander Chris Stratton (5-3) got the win despite allowing four runs (three earned) and eight hits in five innings. He walked two and struck out one. Four Giants relievers combined to blank the Rockies the rest of the way.\nRight-hander Jon Gray (4-6) took the loss. He was roughed up for five runs and nine hits in 3 2/3 innings, walking one and striking out four. Along the way, Gray recorded his 400th career strikeout.\nCrawford finished with four RBIs for the Giants, who snapped a three-game losing streak and improved to 3-3 on a seven-game homestand that ends Sunday.\nPosey, Belt, Gomez and Evan Longoria added two hits apiece for the Giants.\nCharlie Blackmon and Gerardo Parra had two hits each, and Ian Desmond scored twice for the Rockies, who fell to 3-2 on their nine-game trip.\nBlackmon also scored a pair of runs, while Parra had Colorado’s only extra-base hit in the game, a double.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-20T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:20:10.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
