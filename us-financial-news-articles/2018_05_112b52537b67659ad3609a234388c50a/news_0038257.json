The 10 percent spike through December and January has allowed the consolidation over the last 90 days to build a longer-term bull-flag.\nAt its highs, gold was overbought and the long trade was overcrowded. This minor correction has relieved both of these technical indicators.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nI watch the CFTC Commitment of Traders closely to understand if there is room for buyers. If everyone has already bought, this means a market is less likely to see fresh buying.\nThe net-long positioning in gold has dropped by 80 percent from its peak in January and is now at the lowest level since July when gold began a 13 percent rally into September.\nLast Thursday, gold convincingly closed back above its 200-day moving average for the first time in two weeks, a level that provides tremendous long-term value.\nI like being long gold until a close below the psychological $1,300 mark. If it can get out above resistance at $1,327, I imagine those buyers will quickly come back to the table.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:59:42.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
