The shot made a winner out of Rafael Iglesias (1-0), who tossed two perfect innings.\nThe Reds won the final two games against the Mets to win their first series at home since they swept the Pittsburgh Pirates last Sept. 15-17.\nThe Mets lost for the 16th time in 23 games on an afternoon “highlighted” by a first inning in which a double by Asdrubal Cabrera was nullified because they were batting out of order.\nAfter Cabrera’s two-out double, Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman visited the umpires. After a short conference, it was determined the Mets and rookie manager Mickey Callaway were using a different lineup than the one submitted to the Reds and the umpire crew. That lineup had Cabrera batting second and Wilmer Flores, who actually batted second, batting third.\nPer Rule 6.03, Cabrera’s double was nullified and the out was credited to Jay Bruce, the fourth-place batter, because he was the next “proper batter.” The catcher received the putout for Bruce’s out. Cabrera did not record an official plate appearance.\nCabrera’s first official plate appearance in the third inning resulted in the Mets’ only run, with his grounder scoring Brandon Nimmo, who led off the inning with a triple.\nMets right-hander Zack Wheeler retired 12 straight batters before the Reds tied the score in the sixth. Jesse Winker drew a leadoff walk, went to second on a bunt single by Jose Peraza and scored on Joey Votto’s single.\nWheeler and Reds right-hander Sal Romano produced similar lines over six innings. Wheeler allowed one run on four hits and three walks while striking out seven. Romano gave up a run on four hits and one walk while striking out seven.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:22:10.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
