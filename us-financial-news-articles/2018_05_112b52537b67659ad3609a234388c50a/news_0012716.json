REUTERS/Rebecca Naden\nBritain has also introduced pension “freedoms” which allow people to cash in their pension pots.\nThe FSCS said there will be a higher levy to pay claims against operators of Self-Invested Personal Pensions or SIPPs.\nThe increased budget will also help pay for claims expected against Beaufort Securities, an insolvent UK broker, the FSCS said.\n“The levies announced today provide for the steady increase in claims and compensation costs related to retirement saving,” said Mark Neale, chief executive of the FSCS.\n“Many claims reflect bad advice to transfer pension savings from occupational schemes into Self-Invested Personal Pensions, usually with a view to invest in illiquid and risky unregulated products,” Neale said.
