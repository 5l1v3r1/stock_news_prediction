Additionally, the new Amazon feature provides users with information on how many stops their driver has left to make before reaching their doorstep.\nFor now, Amazon Map Tracker is unavailable to packages shipped out by UPS , FedEX, or USPS. However, if your package is delivered by Amazon’s logistics, you are in luck.\n“The Amazon Map Tracking feature is another delivery innovation we are working on to improve convenience for our customers and provide them greater visibility into their deliveries,” Amazon spokesperson Alana Broadbent told CNET on Wednesday.\nOf course, this is not the first time this year that the e-commerce company has attempted to improve its user’s delivery experience through the introduction of innovative features.
