(NYSE: RLGY), the largest full-service residential real estate services company in the United States, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, including the following highlights:\nRevenue was $1.2 billion, an increase of 2% compared with the first quarter in 2017, driven by increases in homesale transaction volume (transaction sides multiplied by average sale price). The Company's combined homesale transaction volume increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2017, consisting of a 5% volume gain at RFG and a 2% volume gain at NRT. For reference, the National Association of Realtors reported an annual industry volume increase of 2% in the first quarter of 2018. Operating EBITDA was $34 million, consistent with our guidance for the first quarter of 2018.\n(See Table 4) 2 Net loss was $67 million compared with net loss of $28 million in the first quarter of 2017. Basic loss per share was $0.51 compared with basic loss per share of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2017. The Net Loss was driven by lower Operating EBITDA and includes a $30 million restructuring charge. Adjusted net loss per share was $0.38 compared with adjusted net loss per share of $0.16 in the first quarter of 2017. (See Table 1a) 1 Free Cash Flow for the first quarter of 2018 was negative $166 million compared with negative $72 million for the first quarter of 2017. In addition to the change in Operating EBITDA, the results reflected greater seasonal working capital adjustments than last year. (See Table 6) 3 In the first quarter of 2018, Realogy returned $111 million of capital to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends.\n\"I continue to be incredibly excited by Realogy's strengths. We grew both revenue and transaction volume in an intensely competitive market in the first quarter. To improve our business performance, we must enhance our value proposition to agents by leveraging our market leadership, geographic reach, and data and technology scale,\" said Ryan Schneider, Realogy's chief executive officer and president. \"While our results trajectory will not change overnight, we are committed to demonstrating a fast pace of change, returning capital to shareholders and improving profitability over time.\"\n\"Operating EBITDA for the quarter was $34 million, about half of Q1 2017, consistent with our guidance,\" said Anthony E. Hull, Realogy's executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer. \"The year-over-year decline of $27 million was largely due to a $24 million decline at NRT, which was primarily a result of greater agent commission costs and softness in the New York City market.\"\nIn the first quarter of 2018, RFG and NRT's 190,800 U.S.-based affiliated sales agents helped consumers with 290,087 homesale transactions. In aggregate, Realogy achieved homesale transaction volume of approximately $100 billion, an increase of 4% compared with the first quarter of 2017. NRT average homesale price increased 3% and homesale transaction sides decreased 1%, while RFG reported an average homesale price increase of 6% and a homesale transaction sides decrease of 1%.\nIn the title and settlement services sector, TRG was involved in the closing of approximately 37,000 transactions in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a 1% increase in purchase units. Refinance closing volume fell 37% compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the relocation segment, Cartus initiations were up 4% and referrals were up 5%. Cartus continues to be an important part of the Company's value proposition, generating highly qualified leads for its network of affiliated agents and helping them to build their businesses. Cartus generated referral opportunities to agents that resulted in approximately 76,000 in-network homesale closings for Realogy and its brands in 2017.\nLooking Ahead\nFor the second quarter of 2018, Realogy expects that combined home sale transaction volume will increase in the range of 2% to 5% year-over-year with sides contributing between -2% to flat and 4% to 5% coming from price. Broken down by business unit, we expect 3 to 5% transaction volume growth at RFG and 1 to 3% growth at NRT.\nBased on what we know today and subject to macro uncertainty, we continue to expect the aggregate second quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2018 Operating EBITDA to be in line with or better than the same period in 2017.\nThis year, we continue to expect to see conversion from Operating EBITDA to Free Cash Flow at a rate of approximately 60%.\nCapital Allocation\nSince the share repurchase program's inception in February 2016, the Company has repurchased approximately 20.2 million shares through March 31, 2018 at an average price of $28.36 for $574 million. As a result, Realogy had approximately 129 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $182 million. Total long-term corporate debt, including the short-term portion, net of cash and cash equivalents (net corporate debt), totaled $3.4 billion at March 31, 2018. The Company's net debt leverage ratio 4 was 4.3 times at March 31, 2018.\nA consolidated balance sheet is included as Table 2 of this press release.\nInvestor Conference Call\nToday, May 3, at 8:30 a.m. (EDT), Realogy will hold a conference call via webcast to review its Q1 2018 results.

We present Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted earnings (loss) per share because we believe these measures are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provides greater transparency into our operating results.\nOperating EBITDA is defined by us as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net (other than relocation services interest for securitization assets and securitization obligations), income taxes, and other items that are not core to the operating activities of the Company such as restructuring charges, former parent legacy items, losses on the early extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, gains or losses on discontinued operations and gains or losses on the sale of investments or other assets. Operating EBITDA is our primary non-GAAP measure.\nWe present Operating EBITDA because we believe it is useful as a supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operating businesses and provides greater transparency into our results of operations. Our management, including our chief operating decision maker, uses Operating EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of our business. Operating EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe Operating EBITDA facilitates company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net interest expense), taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the amortization of intangibles, as well as other items that are not core to the operating activities of the Company such as restructuring charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt, former parent legacy items, asset impairments, gains or losses on discontinued operations and gains or losses on the sale of investments or other assets, which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. We further believe that Operating EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies, many of which present an Operating EBITDA measure when reporting their results.\nOperating EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider Operating EBITDA either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthis measure does not reflect changes in, or cash required for, our working capital needs; this measure does not reflect our interest expense (except for interest related to our securitization obligations), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; this measure does not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; this measure does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often require replacement in the future, and this measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies may calculate this measure differently so they may not be comparable.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Realogy before income tax expense (benefit), net of payments, interest expense, net, cash interest payments, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, restructuring costs and former parent legacy costs (benefits), net of payments, loss on the early extinguishment of debt, working capital adjustments and relocation assets, net of change in securitization obligations. We use Free Cash Flow in our internal evaluation of operating effectiveness and decisions regarding the allocation of resources, as well as measuring the Company's ability to generate cash. Since Free Cash Flow can be viewed as both a performance measure and a cash flow measure, the Company has provided a reconciliation to both net income attributable to Realogy Holdings and net cash provided by operating activities. Free Cash Flow is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or liquidity. Free Cash Flow may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/realogy-reports-financial-results-for-first-quarter-2018-300641635.html\nSOURCE Realogy Holdings Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/realogy-reports-financial-results-for-first-quarter-2018-300641635.html"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:53:27.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
