The drop was due in part to gains from the sale investments during the same quarter in 2017, the company said. The company posted 61.9 billion yuan ($9.73 billion) in revenue for January-March, versus an average estimate of 58.9 billion yuan from 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nMarch quarter sales are seasonally slow for Alibaba following its bumper sale event, Singles' Day, in November. Sales for the period were also affected by fewer working days due to the Chinese New Year holidays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:16:12.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
