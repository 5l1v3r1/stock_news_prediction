The others are very much new for me,” said Rodchenkov.\nIt was not clear whether Rodchenkov, whose video link was sometimes of poor quality, was speaking about someone in the squad cleared by FIFA or on an earlier list of potential players.\nRodchenkov’s revelations about doping at the 2014 Sochi Olympics led to the suspension of Russia’s anti-doping agency RUSADA, the country’s athletics federation and Paralympic Committee.\nA report commissioned by WADA and compiled by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren in 2016 highlighted a conspiracy to conceal positive drug tests over a five-year period. Soccer was among more than 30 sports involved.\nRodchenkov said samples from 34 footballers from all levels had been highlighted by McLaren and sent to FIFA, who had sent him a list of some 60 questions which he had answered.\nRussia has acknowledged some findings of the McLaren report but has denied the existence of a state-sponsored doping program.\nRodchenkov suggested the role of agents and others whose livelihoods depended on highly-paid players made doping less likely in soccer.\n“I knew that they try to keep them clean because they are afraid any doping case will ruin the career of the entourage of a particular player,” he said.\n“In contrast to an (Olympic) athlete, any positive case and the entourage survived and continued their bad work.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T19:43:39.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
