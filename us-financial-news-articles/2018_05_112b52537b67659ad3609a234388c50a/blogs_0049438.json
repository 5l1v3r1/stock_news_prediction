Once the vehicle has stopped, drivers must put it in park in order to cancel the cruise-control engagement.\nThe automaker is planning to fix the defect with a software update. FCA says it will soon start notifying owners when they should bring their vehicles into dealerships for the repair.\nThe following models are affected:\n2015-17 Chrysler 200 sedan 2014-18 Chrysler 300 sedan 2017-18 Chrysler Pacifica minivan 2015-18 Dodge Challenger coupe 2014-18 Dodge Charger sedan 2014-18 Dodge Journey CUV 2014-18 Dodge Durango SUV 2014-18 Jeep Cherokee SUV 2014-18 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV 2018 Jeep Wrangler 2014-19 Ram 1500 pickup 2014-18 Ram 2500 pickup 2014-18 Ram 3500 pickup 2014-18 Ram 3500 cab chassis\n(Correction: The recall covers 15 Jeep, Ram, Chrysler and Dodge models built between 2014 and 2018.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:57:25.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
