I’m really looking forward to good support,” Babbel told a news conference.\n“I am ready for a new experience and I thank you for the trust, I will give 100 percent to bring our vision nearer and nearer.”\nBabbel takes over from Spaniard Josep Gombau, who was sacked when Wanderers failed to secure a spot in the playoffs at the end of last season.\nWanderers have become one of the most fanatically followed clubs in Australia over their first six seasons and the club is clearly keen to get back among the frontrunners before their new 30,000-seater stadium is finished next year.\n“Today we have made a statement about our future,” said club chairman Paul Lederer.\n“In the next 18-months we will have our new training facility finished, our new stadium open and our club ready to take another giant (leap).\n“Having a coach like Markus involved with this club will make us a force in this league as we strive to win trophies, return to the AFC Champions League and make a statement not only in Australia but internationally as a football club.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T10:46:04.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
