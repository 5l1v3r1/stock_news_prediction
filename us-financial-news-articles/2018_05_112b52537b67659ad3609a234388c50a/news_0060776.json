(TSX:RME, and hereinafter \" RME \"), Canada's largest agriculture equipment dealer and the largest Case-IH dealer in North America, today launched its five-year growth plan. Unless otherwise specified, all financial figures are expressed in Canadian dollars.\n“We have spent the last five years protecting and strengthening our foundations while our industry contracted, and the last three years integrating the 19 acquisitions that drove our revenues to the billion-dollar level,\" said Garrett Ganden, President & Chief Executive Officer of RME. \"Now that the industry has normalized, and after integrating our previous acquisitions, we are now ready to turn our attention to accretive growth armed with a sound integration framework. But our growth will not just be driven through acquisitions; the strong market of the Canadian Prairies is expected to add $200 million organically through our current geographic footprint and assets.”\nRME anticipates that it will grow revenues from $959 million in 2017 to at least $1.5 billion in 2023. It intends to do this through a combination of revenue sources including:\n$200 million in organic growth through RME’s present geographic foot print; $200 million in acquired top-line revenue in Canada and the United States (“US”); and $100 million in revenue synergies on assets that are acquired through this plan.\nWhile Canadian acquisition efforts will be focused in Saskatchewan, acquisitions of Case New Holland (“CNH”) branded dealers in Alberta and Manitoba should also be expected. US acquisitions will be focused in the Western US in areas with healthy crop receipts, a similar crop and equipment profile to the Canadian Prairies, and a healthy balance between crop and livestock production to balance exposure to any one type of customer.\nAn acquisition in the US would be transformational and help RME mitigate a number of risks including currency, crop, weather, political, transportation and tariffs through risk diversification. However, to give RME further growth opportunities in the US market, RME seeks to find, retain or assemble a strong management team and back-office to serve as a platform for future growth. As a result, the first US acquisition will be a scope acquisition and RME does not expect to achieve the same synergies as would be expected of subsequent acquisitions.\nThere are a number of criteria that must be met before entering the US including:\n1) Approval from CNH;\n2) A well-run operation with a strong management team; and\n3) A large enough revenue base (approximately USD $100 million) to serve as a growth platform in the United States.\nGrowth will be funded from RME’s balance sheet and a mixture of debt and equity. RME anticipates continued stability or modest growth in its dividend through this process.\nInvestor & Analyst Event\nRME will hold an investor and analyst event to launch its five-year growth plan today, Wednesday, May 30th, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Mountain Time (\"MT\") (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time (\"ET\")).\nTo listen to the live webcast and watch the presentation please use the following link:\nhttp://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1673028-1/CE388F1198197D7CF12D038E0EF5C7AF\nWithin 24 hours of the event, the webcast will be available for replay at the link above until May 29, 2019.\nThose interested in participating in the question and answer portion of the event by phone may do so by calling 1-866-521-4909 (toll free) or (647) 427-2311.\nCaution regarding forward-looking statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking information and statements (collectively, “forward-looking statements”) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of RME or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, events, expectations, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
