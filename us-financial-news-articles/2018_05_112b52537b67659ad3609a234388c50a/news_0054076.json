If Saudi Aramco still doesn't reduce prices next month and ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) follows, we will increase our U.S. crude purchases,\" a Southeast Asian oil buyer said.\nCHINA BUYS AMERICAN\nIn Asia, China - led by Sinopec, the region's largest refiner - is the biggest lifter of U.S. crude. The company, after cutting Saudi imports, has bought a record 16 million barrels (533,000 bpd) of U.S. crude, to load in June, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.\nIndia and South Korea are the next biggest buyers in Asia, each lifting 6 million to 7 million barrels in June, sources tracking U.S. crude sales to Asia said. Indian Oil Corp bought 3 million barrels earlier this month via a tender, while Reliance Industries purchased up to 8 million barrels, the sources said, although it wasn't clear if Reliance's cargoes would all load in June.\nThe sources declined to be named due to company policies.\nSouth Korea's purchases are driven by its top refiners SK Energy and GS Caltex.\nTaiwanese state refiner CPC Corp has also snapped up 7 million barrels to be lifted in June and July.\nU.S. exports to Thailand will increase to at least 2 million barrels. State oil company PTT PCL is 1 million barrels of WTI Midland, while Thai Oil and Esso Thailand bought at least 500,000 barrels of Bakken crude each, said traders with knowledge of the country's crude deals.\nReliance declined to comment. PTT, Thai Oil and Esso Thailand all did not respond to requests for comment.\nBut even if Asia and Europe are keen to take more U.S. crude, the record volumes are straining export infrastructure in the United States, limiting its ability to pump and ship more oil.\n\"Tight (shale) oil's been eating OPEC's lunch for the last few years. The lack of infrastructure will temporarily cede market share back to OPEC,\" R.T. Dukes, head of U.S. Lower 48 oil supply at Wood Mackenzie said in a note last week.\n(Reporting by Florence Tan; Additional reporting by Jessica Jaganathan in SINGAPORE, Promit Mukherjee in MUMBAI and Chayut Setboonsarng in THAILAND; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "external_links": ["https://tmsnrt.rs/2xk67ZR"], "published": "2018-05-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T06:11:29.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
