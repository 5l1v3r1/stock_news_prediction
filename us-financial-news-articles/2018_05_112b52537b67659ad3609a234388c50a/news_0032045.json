The source could not be identified in line with federal police rules.\nPNB declined to comment. The bank has been conducting a separate internal investigation into the fraud and has already suspended at least 21 officials.\nIndian authorities have arrested at least 20 people and a court has issued non-bailable warrants against accused jewellers Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. The duo have denied the allegations against them, and authorities said they both left the country before the fraud was uncovered.\nAfter the fraud - the biggest in Indian banking history - was reported, the government criticised inadequate oversight by auditors and regulators in the country.\nReporting by Aditya Kalra, Abhirup Roy, Krishna Das; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T13:44:10.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
