Operating costs in the first three months rose 13%, or 8% after one-off provisions, outpacing a 3% adjusted revenue rise. Net profit was $3.09 billion, slightly down from $3.13 billion in first-quarter 2017.\nIn an interview, Mr. Flint said the expense rise was the result of investments in areas such as digital banking, and that HSBC is still on track to grow revenue faster than costs over the full year. He said the increase had been built into the bank’s internal plans for the year even though it came as a surprise to analysts.\n“Given the state of the world at the moment and the opportunities in front of us, there are opportunities for us to invest in growth,” Mr. Flint said. “The fact we’re investing in the business is a sign of strength.”\nMr. Flint, with HSBC since college, became CEO in February after previously heading the bank’s retail division and holding other top roles. Under former CEO Stuart Gulliver HSBC went through a radical restructuring to improve profits , exiting dozens of businesses and entire parts of the globe. It is still one of the world’s largest banks with $2.7 trillion in assets.\nThe appointment of Mr. Flint by Chairman Mark Tucker, also new to the job since October, was seen as a safe choice, signaling continuity in the bank’s direction.\nOn Friday, Mr. Flint said HSBC’s current strategy is working but that some tweaks will be announced at or before first-half results in August. Analysts expect HSBC to grow its insurance and asset-management arms, possibly through acquisitions or joint ventures, and exit retail operations in more countries over time.\nMeeting with reporters last week after an investor meeting, Mr. Flint said the bank can’t realistically set any aggressive new financial targets until it meets current ones such as reaching a 10% return on equity. In 2017, the return was 5.9%. It improved in the first quarter to 7.5%.\nNo changes are expected to the bank’s pursuit of greater revenue growth from China, where HSBC has been investing in retail banking and a new securities business.\nThe bank on Friday said it would buy back another $2 billion in shares, adding to buybacks last year. The announcement disappointed some analysts though since HSBC said it was likely to be the only one this year. UBS analysts said they had expected $4 billion in buybacks this year.\n—Kenan Machado and Chester Yung contributed to this article.\nWrite to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T11:07:17.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
