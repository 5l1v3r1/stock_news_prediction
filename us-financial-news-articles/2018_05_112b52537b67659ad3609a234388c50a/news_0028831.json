Usually set up by banks, they enjoyed a cosy relationship with them as customers but had little funds at their disposal to invest in technology.\nAs well as investing in innovation, payments companies now also need scale to navigate increasing regulatory complexity.\nSmaller companies like SIA ( IPO-SIA.MI ) in Italy or Germany’s Concardis could be among the targets for larger industry players, while banks could be tempted to sell off their payments services to raise cash, analysts say.\nPotential targets could include the payment services arms of France’s Credit Mutuel, Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) and Nataxis ( CNAT.PA ), or Spain’s Bankia ( BKIA.MC ), BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) or Sabadell ( SABE.MC ), according to analysts.\n“They can hand it over to specialists with companies like Worldline who are particularly well positioned to make these acquisitions because of the flexibility they offer,” said Bob Liao at Macquarie.\n“They can say to the bank: ‘We know this business is your baby and you don’t really want to give it up, but you cannot invest in it, so why not a joint venture or a shared ownership deal?’”\nOther industry bidders could include France’s Ingenico ( INGC.PA ), while Denmark’s Nets ( NTTSY.PK ), owned by U.S. buyout fund Hellman & Friedman, could also enter future auctions.\nNets was one of the bidders that lost out to Worldline in the auction for SIX’s payment services business.\nWorldline, which is 51 percent owned by Atos ( ATOS.PA ), will pay 283 million euros in cash on top of the new shares to acquire the business.\nEditing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:03:23.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
