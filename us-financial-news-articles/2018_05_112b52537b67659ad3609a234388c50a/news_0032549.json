The scheme is expected to make private hospitals, such as those run by Manipal and Fortis, accessible to millions of poor families.\nManipal said in a statement on Monday it would offer Fortis 180 rupees a share, valuing the company at 94.03 billion rupees ($1.39 billion).\nThe new offer is significantly better than any other offer or bid that Fortis has received to date, including the one by Hero and Burman, Manipal said in its statement, urging Fortis’ board of directors to refer the offer to its shareholders.\n“This is a real offer,” a major shareholder in Fortis told Reuters. “This is getting in the territory of a fair bid.”\n“Given (Manipal) already runs a large hospital chain they are probably in the best position to ring out synergies,” said the investor, adding Fortis had not yet entered into a binding bid and could change its recommendation to shareholders.\nFortis had initially agreed to a deal with the Manipal-TPG consortium, but shareholder objections and competing offers scuttled that deal.\nIt had also received an offer of investment from Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare Bhd, peer Radiant Life Care with global private equity firm by KKR & Co, and a non-binding offer of investment from China’s Fosun International.\n“It’s the first serious deal from Manipal that deserves full consideration,” said another major shareholder in Fortis. $1 = 67.5500 Indian rupees Reporting by Aditi Shah in New Delhi and Alasdair Pal in London, additional reporting by Vishal Sridhar, Editing by Euan Rocha, Mark Potter and Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T07:56:16.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
