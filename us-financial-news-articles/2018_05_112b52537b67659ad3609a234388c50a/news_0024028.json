He added that \"the real issue everyone will be listening for is when will the Fed cut them loose.\"\nWells Fargo executives have said they plan to provide a dollar range for 2019 expenses, set an efficiency ratio target for the next couple of years and be transparent about various revenue drivers at this year's investor day.\nLast month Wells Fargo agreed to pay $1 billion to settle with U.S. regulators who said it wrongly layered insurance on hundreds of thousands of drivers and hit homebuyers with excessive fees. It also has paid millions after admitting it opened sham accounts for customers, a practice that likely ensnared millions.\nWells Fargo has revamped its leadership since the scandal erupted in 2016 and got a boost on April 24 when directors including Chief Executive Tim Sloan and Chair Elizabeth Duke handily won shareholder support. Michael Kon, director of research for Golub Group of San Mateo, California, said it sold its Wells Fargo position last summer but holds stakes in other banks and will keep an eye on Wells Fargo's outlook.\n\"We will be watching loan growth commentary for any signs of a slowdown,\" Kon said. \"Any update on the regulatory issues will also be helpful,\" he said.
