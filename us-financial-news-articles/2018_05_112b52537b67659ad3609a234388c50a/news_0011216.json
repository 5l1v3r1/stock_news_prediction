And I think this moves it in the right direction.\n“What I’m really encouraged by is that Formula One came together and recognized it was necessary,” he added, speaking after a lunch at London’s Royal Automobile Club to award the Segrave Trophy to 2017 Dakar winner Sam Sunderland.\nBrawn said a collision between Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen in Sunday’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix showed how hard it was to follow a car and make a move.\nRicciardo ran into the back of Verstappen, with both retiring.\n“I think we had a demonstration in a very extreme sense with Ricciardo and Verstappen that the moment Verstappen moved in front of Ricciardo, Ricciardo lost all the downforce and couldn’t stop,” he explained.\n“There was no way he was going to stop that car once Verstappen took his air away from him.”\nThe changes will see a front wing with a larger span, winglets removed from front brake ducts and a wider and deeper rear wing.\nApproved and ratified on the last day before unanimous agreement was required, the measures followed research carried out by most teams and backed by commercial rights holders Liberty Media.\nBrawn confirmed there had been some dissenters, however.\n“I guess it’s a healthy situation that you have debate about these things,” he said. “There were some teams that felt we should have waited until 2021 and done the complete package.\n“But certainly enough of the teams felt it was going in the right direction.”\nFormula One’s current agreements expire after 2020, and the sport needs to decide what kind of engine and rules should be introduced after that.\nLiberty wants a more level playing field, reduced costs and more equal distribution of the revenues.\nOnly three of the 10 teams — Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull — have won races in the V6 turbo hybrid era that started in 2014 and Mercedes have won every championship.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Amlan Chakraborty and Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:38:51.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
