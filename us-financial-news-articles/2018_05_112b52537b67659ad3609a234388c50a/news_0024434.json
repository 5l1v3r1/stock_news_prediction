Both steps are backdated to May 1 and will last for 26 months.\n“These were hard and tough negotiations that were on the verge of failure several times,” said Uwe Nostitz from the ZDB industry association.\nThe deal was reached after 19 hours of mediation by former Economy Minister Wolfgang Clement.\nThe agreement also includes one-off payments for workers in West Germany of 250 euros (220.49 pounds) in November 2018, 600 euros in June 2019 and a further 250 euros in November 2019. Workers in the East will get a one-off payment of 250 euros in November 2019.\nConstruction workers, including apprentices, also receive an additional monthly salary that can vary from region to region.\nThe labour union had initially demanded an increase of 6 percent over 12 months while employers had offered 4.2 percent over 22 months and a one-off payment of 400 euros.\nStill, IG BAU head Robert Feiger said he was satisfied with the result.\n“That’s the highest wage deal sealed nationwide this year,” Feiger said, adding that the result ensured workers finally got their fair share of the economic boom.\nThe German economy is enjoying an unusually prolonged upswing, now in its ninth year, expanding by 2.2 percent in 2017. With employment at record highs, construction companies in particular are struggling with massive labour shortages.\nGerman public sector unions in April reached a three-stage pay hike deal for a 3.2 percent pay rise backdated to March 1, a 3.1 percent increase from April 2019 and a 1 percent hike from March 2020.\nIn the industrial sector, the 3.9 million workers and their employers agreed in February on a deal for roughly 4 percent annual rises for 2018 and 2019.\nThe German wage deals are likely to bolster the European Central Bank’s confidence that salaries in the bloc’s largest economy are finally picking up, paving the way for a long-awaited recovery in inflation.
