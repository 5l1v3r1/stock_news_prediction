The U.S. can now take steps to establish the level of sanctions it can impose on European exports under WTO rules.\nThe ruling comes at a tense time for trans-Atlantic trade relations. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on EU exports of steel and aluminum. He pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last week despite European allies who are parties to the accord.\nRelated\nNew U.S.-Europe Strains Thrust Old Fight Over Planes to Fore (May 11) Europe File: Don’t Rule Out an EU-U.S. Trade War (April 18) There’s a Boom in Airline Travel, and Jet Makers Are Making the Most of It (Feb. 15) French President Emmanuel Macron during a visit to Washington last month told a joint session of Congress that the WTO remained the best forum to deal with trade imbalances. Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond last month criticized a U.S. move to resort to tariffs to address problems in global trade.\nThe U.S. was quick to embrace the WTO ruling in the airliner-subsidy case. “President Trump has been clear that we will use every available tool to ensure free and fair trade benefits American workers,” Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. Trade Representative, said in a statement. The U.S. would move forward with “countermeasures,” he said, unless the EU comes into compliance with trade rules.\nMr. Lighthizer previously criticized the WTO for “losing its essential focus” and becoming a “litigation-centered organization.”\nThe EU, in a statement, said the WTO had rejected many U.S. claims and that it would “now take swift action to ensure it is fully in line with the WTO’s final decision in this case.”\nAirbus Chief Executive Tom Enders earlier this year blasted the Trump administration’s “America First” trade stance and accused Boeing of supporting the policy. He said Tuesday that “the current geopolitical climate for trade is worrying, and industry players should not fuel it with unproductive disputes.” Airbus said it would move to comply with the WTO rules.\nThe WTO ruling provides ammunition to U.S. to browbeat Europe with global trade rules that Europe promotes. Still, the EU played down Washington’s legal victory and said the ruling proved the multilateral system works.\nThe Geneva-based WTO in the coming months is expected to issue a ruling on an EU case against the U.S. over subsidies provided to Boeing.\nThat, European and Airbus officials argue, will rebalance the case. EU officials argue that “massive and persistent” U.S. support to Boeing including state funding, tax breaks and export subsidies caused as much as $12 billion in annual economic damages to the bloc. European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said “we look forward to the upcoming ruling … on U.S. compliance.”\nThe airliner battle predates the recent trade tensions. The U.S. challenged European financing of Airbus at the WTO in 2004. The Europeans soon after filed their countercase. Through various rulings and appeals, the WTO determined both plane makers benefited from state aid that violated global trade rules.\nThe U.S. Trade Representative and Boeing in the current case have argued that European countries provided $22 billion in illegal subsidies over decades. Without the backing, they argue, Airbus wouldn’t have become the rival to Boeing it is today.\nPenalties in the airliner-subsidy case would likely be imposed against goods and services unrelated to the making of planes. The level of retaliation the U.S. can extract are based on the harm done to Boeing, rather than the level of subsidies provided to Airbus. The two sides are expected to squabble before the WTO over that amount.\nBoeing said the harm done from the roughly $9 billion in subsidies Europe provided on the A350 and A380 planes would run into billions of dollars. Airbus said any potential sanctions would be “minor.”\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have said they are open to talks to resolve the dispute. The U.S. has said, though, such talks can start only once the European side has come into compliance with WTO rules.\nWrite to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com and Emre Peker at emre.peker@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T05:17:11.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
