(NASDAQ: HDNG), a leading international provider of advanced metal-cutting solutions and accessories, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSales, Orders and Backlog for First Quarter\nSales for the first quarter of 2018 increased 24% to $79.9 million driven by higher demand in all regions. Orders of $90.4 million were up 24%. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $4.2 million on sales and $5.0 million on orders, sales and orders both increased 17%.\nAmericas: Sales grew 10% to $21.5 million primarily from increased demand for workholding products. Orders for the region were $24.5 million, up 4% in the quarter, and have fluctuated from quarter to quarter as a result of changes being implemented with sales channel partners.\nEurope: Sales in Europe of $21.2 million were up 20% from favorable mix of more complex grinding machines. Orders in the region were up 55% due to strengthening industrial conditions driving higher demand across all product lines. Excluding favorable foreign currency translation of $1.7 million on sales and $2.7 million on orders, sales increased 10% and orders increased 43%.\nAsia: Sales of $37.2 million for the quarter were up 36% as strong demand in China was supplemented by high demand in other parts of Asia. Orders of $32.9 million increased 18%. Excluding favorable foreign currency impact of $2.5 million and $2.3 million on sales and orders, respectively, sales were up 27% and orders were up 9%.\nConsolidated backlog: Backlog at March 31, 2018 was $144.3 million, up 14% from March 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter Operating Review\nGross profit was $28.1 million, an increase of $7.0 million, or 33% from higher sales volume and improved margins. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 35.2%, a 2.4 point improvement over the prior year quarter due to favorable mix. Excluding professional services fees of $0.9 million in the current year and $0.1 million of other unusual costs in the prior year, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $2.0 million in the quarter due to higher commissions of $1.0 million related to increased volume, and unfavorable foreign currency translation of $1.0 million. Operating income of $2.6 million increased $4.2 million as a result of higher volume partially offset by unusual costs in the current year. Operating margin expanded 5.6 points to 3.3% of sales. Adjusted Non-GAAP operating income (1) was $4.9 million in the quarter, up significantly from $0.1 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating margin was 6.2%, a 6.1 point expansion. Net income was $1.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, up from a $2.0 million loss, or $(0.16) per diluted share in the prior-year period. Adjusted Non-GAAP net income (1) was $4.1 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, a significant increase over last year’s adjusted net loss in the quarter.\n(1) Management believes that the use of non-GAAP measures helps in the understanding of the Company's operating performance. See page 8 of this release for the reconciliation tables between reported amounts and non-GAAP measures discussed in this document.\nRecent Merger Announcement\nOn February 12, 2018, Hardinge announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of Privet Fund Management LLC (“Privet”) under which Privet has agreed to acquire Hardinge for $18.50 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million, subject to approval of Hardinge shareholders and other customary closing conditions.\nIn light of the announcement, Hardinge will not hold a conference call to discuss these financial results.
