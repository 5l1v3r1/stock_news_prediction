(NASDAQ:SITO) (“SITO” or the “Company”), the Consumer Behavior and Location Sciences™ company, announced today that Gabriel Sandoval has been named Chief Data Protection Officer. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) set to take effect on May 25, 2018, businesses falling under certain criteria are required to hire a Data Protection Officer to establish compliance with the GDPR protocols. SITO, in support of its commitment to data privacy, has made the decision to make such an appointment. In this role, Mr. Sandoval, who has been working with the Company on these matters, will help shape SITO’s privacy strategy and guide the Company and its clients in preparation for GDPR compliance and anticipated future regulations worldwide.\n“With so many businesses not yet prepared for GDPR, it is a pleasure to be working with a company that prioritizes compliance,” said Gabriel Sandoval, SITO’s Chief Data Privacy Officer. “We all believe that all businesses should make the necessary steps to ensure compliance with GDPR. SITO has already taken several proactive steps to ensure compliance and the overall protection of the consumer’s right to privacy. I take immense pride in working alongside my colleagues at SITO to implement the proper procedures and protocols to ensure compliance.”\nAccording to Gartner , less than 50% of the companies that will be affected by GDPR will be in full compliance by the deadline of May 25 th of this year. SITO has made strides as a leader in this area, by developing privacy and compliance certification educational programs.\n“Data privacy is a mission-critical issue, and, with Gabriel in place, we are now fully prepared for the impending GDPR compliance, along with any similar regulations that may be passed in the United States,” said Tom Pallack, SITO’s Chief Executive Officer. “Privacy compliance is a core tenet of SITO’s data and service offerings, and we will work to ensure the provenance and privacy of our data supply-chain to honor and protect the consumer’s right to privacy.”\nMr. Sandoval is an experienced technology legal and business executive, having overseen legal counsel at Oracle, Ariba, and most recently at Deem, Inc. where he served as their Chief Legal Officer.\nAbout SITO Mobile, Ltd.\nSITO is a leading mobile data technology company that provides brands customized, data-driven solutions spanning strategic insights and media campaign delivery services.
