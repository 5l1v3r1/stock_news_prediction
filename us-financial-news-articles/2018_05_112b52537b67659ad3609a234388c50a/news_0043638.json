So whatever, I’m going to win or lose,” she said.\nIt is the first time since 1991 that the season has gone so long without a repeat champion, according to the LPGA Tour.\nFormer world number one Ariya became the second Thai winner on the LPGA Tour this year after her older sister Moriya claimed the L.A. Open in April.\nSouth Korean remains the dominant nation on the LPGA circuit with four wins this season, while three have been claimed by Americans.
