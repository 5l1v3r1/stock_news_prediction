Heredia then doubled into the gap in right-center field, with Segura sliding home just before catcher Jonathan Lucroy could apply the tag.\nNick Vincent (3-1) pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings for the victory, and Edwin Diaz worked the 10th for his American League-leading 16th save.\nTrailing 2-0, the Mariners tied it in the seventh on Mike Zunino’s two-run homer. With one out, Daniel Vogelbach walked and advanced to second on a wild pitch by Oakland starter Trevor Cahill. Zunino then lined a 3-2 pitch over the left field wall for his seventh homer of the season.\nThe A’s broke a scoreless tie in the bottom of the fourth inning. Marcus Semien led off with a single and advanced to second when Jed Lowrie was safe on Seattle starter Mike Leake’s throwing error. Matt Olson singled to center to load the bases. Semien scored as Matt Chapman grounded into a double play.\nOakland extended the lead to 2-0 in the fifth. Mark Canha was hit by a two-out Leake pitch. Matt Joyce lined a single to right field, sending Canha to third. Semien grounded the next pitch into right field to score the run.\nLeake allowed two runs (one earned) on six hits in 6 2/3 innings, with no walks and three strikeouts. Cahill went seven innings, yielding two runs on four hits with two walks and three strikeouts.\nSeattle’s Mitch Haniger was hit by a pitch in the right elbow leading off the fourth inning. Haniger was replaced in right field by Andrew Romine an inning later. The Mariners later announced X-rays on Haniger’s elbow were negative.\nIt was the latest injury for the Mariners, who placed second baseman Dee Gordon on the disabled list earlier in the day due to a broken right big toe. In addition, designated hitter Nelson Cruz didn’t play Tuesday after getting hit by a pitch in the left elbow over the weekend.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:43:09.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
