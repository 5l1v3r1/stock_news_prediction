(\"Synacor\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: SYNC) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased or otherwise Synacor securities between May 4, 2016 and March 15, 2018, both dates inclusive. Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/sync .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Synacor was unlikely to receive significant revenues from the AT&T Contract until 2018; (2) as such, the Company's revenue forecasts issued during the Class Period were materially false and misleading; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, Synacor shares traded at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period.\nOn August 9, 2017, post-market, Synacor issued a press release entitled \"Synacor Exceeds Second-Quarter 2017 Financial Guidance; Remains on Path to '3/30/300,'\" announcing its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The press release stated in relevant part: \"[T]he joint AT&T-Synacor team has made the strategic decision to prioritize portal engagement right now over monetization. We are seeing the results of this focus in deeper engagement metrics. We are already generating revenue from this new consumer experience, but we expect that additional monetization tactics will be turned on at a more deliberate pace, which will result in a longer ramp to full monetization. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue that we were expecting in Q3 and Q4 this year is delayed to 2018, and we are adjusting our financial guidance for 2017 accordingly. We believe that this engagement-focused strategy ultimately leads to a stronger, more sustainable business,\" concluded Bhise. On this news, Synacor's share price fell $1.15, or 32.39%, to close at $2.40 on August 10, 2017.\nOn March 15, 2018, post-market, Synacor held a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss the Company's fourth-quarter earnings. During the call, Defendant Bhise discussed the shortcomings of the AT&T contract. On this news, Synacor's share price fell $0.30, or 14.63%, to close at $1.75 on March 16, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
