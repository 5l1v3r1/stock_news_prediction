In the first quarter of 2018, Tangelo recorded $8.61 M in revenue – slightly down but actually up on a daily average revenue basis.\n\"We attribute this to our continuous efforts to improve the cadence and quality of our customer relationship management as well as our mix of promotions and content. Monthly average paying users were approximately 56,000 for the fourth quarter, and 52,000 for the first quarter. Promisingly, paying users for Tangelo Israel are now growing year over year and were up by 18% in the first quarter of 2018 from the year before, with the majority of this growth coming through reactivating former customers from the Company’s large database of historical customers.\n\"New product development is essential to the longer-term growth of revenue. With the migration at Tangelo Spain coming to an end in 2018, we will be able to accelerate new product delivery. Games representing the majority of our revenue will be fully migrated to Unity by July, with the majority of our remaining games migrated through the rest of the year. Best Jackpot, our new English language app, is in final beta testing and we expect it to be widely released in the coming weeks. A revitalized Spanish-language Bingo Rider app will be released in May. The Mundijuegos app release has been pushed to July in order to ensure that we maximize the range of content available to users.\n\"In the fourth quarter, the Company registered an impairment charge, incurring a net loss of $34.27 M, up from $9.59 M in the fourth quarter of 2016. Tangelo delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $2.86 M in the fourth quarter, up 41% from the third quarter and down 9% year over year.\"\nAs previously discussed, management has pursued a number of potential strategic alternatives with a view to improving its capital structure and unlocking value for all stakeholders. While the Company cannot offer any assurances that these discussions will result in a successful transaction, they are ongoing. The Company will, obviously, update the market when or if a material development arises.\nFinancial Results and Non-IFRS Measures\nThe Company has included certain Non-IFRS performance measures, namely EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and working capital, within this press release. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, we and certain investors and securities analysts use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash, profits and meet financial commitments. These Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These Non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nEBITDA is defined as “Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization”. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBTIDA for due diligence and transaction costs and restructure and severance expenses as these are generally non-recurring. The Company removes stock-based compensation in calculating Adjusted EBITDA as it is a non-cash expense that can vary significantly depending on the timing of option grants. EBITDA does not include the discontinued operations of Vast and Tech Channel. The following table provides a reconciliation to Operating Loss/Income on the Statements of Consolidated Income and Comprehensive Loss for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as reported in the Company’s audited annual consolidated financial statements.\nFor the Quarters Ended For the Years Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating loss, in 000,000's $ (31.69 ) $ (3.10 ) $ (33.95 ) $ (4.55 ) Add back: Transaction costs 0.08 0.17 0.45 0.53 Severance and restructure costs 0.03 0.03 0.20 0.83 Depreciation of equipment 0.03 0.03 0.11 0.11 Amortization of intangibles 2.81 2.87 11.31 11.45 Stock-based compensation 0.01 0.05 0.09 0.40 Impairment of goodwill 31.59 3.09 31.59 3.09 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2.86 $ 3.14 $ 9.80 $ 11.86 About Tangelo\nTangelo Gaming Corp., the parent company of Tangelo Israel and Tangelo Spain, is a developer of social and mobile gaming for desktop, iOS and Android platforms.
