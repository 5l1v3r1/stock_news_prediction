I think that’s our best performance in a final because of the effort the players put in.”\nExeter coach Rob Baxter had no complaints.\n“I don’t think it was our best performance, but it would be churlish to focus on that as today was more about Saracens and the pressure they created that we didn’t really deal with,” he said.

But they looked weary in the strength-sapping conditions and the Saracens players exchanged high-fives after preventing almost any forward progress through a 20-phase assault.\nStraight away Saracens went into attack mode and looked sharper, keener and more aggressive than their opponents, eventually working the ball through the hands to Wyles to cap his dream finale with a second try, taking his tally to four in three finals – all victories.\nAt 19-3 down after 50 minutes, Baxter took radical action, making five changes in one hit.\nThe new men brought some much-needed energy and the next 10 minutes saw a monumental contest between Exeter’s relentless pick and go attack and Saracens’ peerless defence.\nEventually, with Saracens down to 14 after a yellow card for replacement hooker Schalk Brits, Exeter finally moved the ball through the backs and Steenson crossed in the corner.\nSaracens, however, went straight down the other end and earned the key penalty that Spencer slotted, before Earle’s try put the icing on the cake.\nThe victory was a fitting farewell for Wyles and Brits, who is returning to South Africa, and also a landmark for scrumhalf Richard Wigglesworth, who is now the first player to win five Premiership titles – four with Saracens and one with Sale back in 2006.
