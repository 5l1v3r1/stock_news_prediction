Thank you,” Mnuchin told Reuters at his hotel when asked if he expected progress. He made no other comments.\nAs Mnuchin arrived, Trump tweeted: “Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!”\nIt was not clear when Trump and Xi might meet again next, though both will likely attend some of the same multilateral summits this year, including those of the G20 and APEC.\nThroughout his 2016 election campaign, Trump routinely threatened to impose a 45 percent across-the-board tariff on Chinese goods as a way to level the playing field for American workers. At the time, he was also accusing China of manipulating its currency to gain an export advantage, a claim that his administration has since dropped.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the U.S. delegation planned to meet Chinese officials on both days, in addition to U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad, before leaving on Friday evening.

REUTERS/Jason Lee\nThe official China Daily said in an editorial that China would “stand up to the U.S.’ bullying as necessary.”\n“The U.S. wants greater access to China’s market, but it should not use trade actions as a battering ram to force China to open its doors. It is already in the process of opening them wider,” the English-language newspaper said.\nIn doing so, China expected Washington to reciprocate and open its market to Chinese investment and competition, it said. U.S. TARIFFS READY IN JUNE\nThe first round of threatened tariffs under the U.S. government’s “Section 301” intellectual property probe focused heavily on technology products benefiting from a “Made in China 2025” program to upgrade China’s domestic manufacturing base with more advanced products.\nThe U.S. tariffs could go into effect in June following the completion of a 60-day consultation period.\nU.S.-based trade experts said they expected Beijing to offer Trump’s team a package of policy changes that may include some previously announced moves, such as a phase-out of joint venture requirements for some sectors, auto tariff reductions and increased purchases of U.S. goods.\nTrump has demanded a $100 billion annual reduction in the $375 billion U.S. goods trade deficit with China.
