(“Trevi”), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing Nalbuphine ® ER for chronic pruritic conditions, announced today that it has named Christopher J. Seiter as its Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Seiter will join Trevi’s senior management team and will be responsible for the finance, treasury and accounting functions of the Company.\n“I am excited to welcome Chris to the executive leadership team at Trevi,” said Jennifer L. Good, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Chris’ extensive experience in corporate finance within the industry will be valuable at this important time of growth for the Company as we move our lead indication forward and expand our pipeline.”\nMr. Seiter has over two decades of experience in the healthcare industry. He most recently served as Chief Financial Officer of Millendo Therapeutics from October 2016 to April 2018. Prior to transitioning to an operational role, Mr. Seiter spent 23 years as an investment banker, most recently as a Managing Director and Head of Life Sciences Investment Banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. Seiter also served in the U.S. Navy as a Nuclear Submarine Officer for five years.\n“I am very excited to be joining Trevi at such an important time and look forward to leveraging my financial and operational expertise as the Company continues to pursue development of Nalbuphine ER in chronic pruritic conditions,” said Mr. Seiter. “One of the key factors in my decision to join Trevi was the opportunity to work with experienced biopharmaceutical executives such as Jennifer and the Trevi team in pursuing these significant unmet needs.”\nAbout Trevi Therapeutics, Inc.\nTrevi Therapeutics, Inc. is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing Nalbuphine® ER for chronic pruritic conditions. Pruritus develops in various dermatologic, metabolic, hematologic and neuropathic conditions. The Company is pursuing several pruritic conditions for clinical development, including its lead indication of prurigo nodularis. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic pruritic dermatologic condition characterized by the presence of pruriginous lesions (excoriative/ulcerative papules and nodules) on the skin. There are no approved therapies in the US or EU for this condition.\nNalbuphine ER is an oral extended release synthetic opioid with a dual mechanism of action, mu receptor antagonist and kappa receptor agonist, both of which have been shown in research to be effective in abolishing itch. Because of Nalbuphine ER’s unique dual mechanism of action, which has shown efficacy in addressing pruritus in human clinical trials, the Company believes Nalbuphine ER can have broad utility in treating chronic pruritus.\nFounded in 2011, Trevi is headquartered in New Haven, CT.
