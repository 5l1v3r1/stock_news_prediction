REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The investment bank’s current forecast is for Brent crude to hit $82.50 a barrel by the summer; it is currently trading around $77 a barrel. The harsher approach by the United States could result in an initial loss of about 500,000 barrels a day (bpd) in Iran’s output, which is currently 3.8 million bpd.\nSuch a loss would boost oil prices by about $6.20 per barrel, Goldman said. “Such elevated oil geopolitical risks exacerbate the upside risks to Brent forecasts and reinforce our view that oil price volatility will continue to increase,” they wrote.\nReporting by David Gaffen; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:44:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
