This is a big deal,” said Patterson.\nThe convergence of different technologies means BT has faced growing competition from nimble young rivals including Sky ( SKYB.L ) which has expanded from being a pay TV company to offer a range of broadband services. UNDER PRESSURE\nOne top-50 investor said there was no question Patterson was under pressure, but it was not clear how replacing the chief executive would change the dynamics.\n“Any growth option they pursue is potentially going to have no return on it because the regulator just wants to regulate your returns away from you,” the shareholder said.\n“Pretty much the only thing you can do is to attack your cost base.”\nUnder Patterson’s leadership, BT has had a fractious relationship with the regulator Ofcom.\nPatterson, who previously worked at consumer goods group P&G and cable TV company Telewest, said the hit from regulation would double from about 500 million pounds to 1 billion pounds a year as new controls on its faster wholesale broadband kick in.\n“My biggest concern is more that they need to clear the air with the regulator,” the investor said.\nBT faces caps on how much it charges rivals to use its fast broadband service as Ofcom seeks to promote the development of new networks. THROW OF THE DICE\nThe job cuts, the highest number by the former monopoly since 2008, will cost 800 million pounds to implement.\nSome of the proceeds from the savings will go towards increasing capital expenditure on new fibre fixed-line connections and 4G and next generation 5G mobile networks to about 3.7 billion pounds over the next two years.\nThe new strategy is the latest throw of the dice from Patterson who won early plaudits from investors when he moved BT into sports TV and mobile.\nThat goodwill evaporated when the group delivered a major profit warning in January 2017 due to problems at its multi-national Global Services division and the discovery of the Italian scandal. The shares are down 30 percent in a year.\nPatterson gained some breathing space on BT’s pension, which had a deficit of 11.3 billion pounds at the end of June, on Thursday by agreeing a 13-year funding plan.\nIt will pay 2.1 billion pounds into the scheme by 2020 and a further 2 billion pounds will be funded by bonds.\nBT said its outlook for the current financial year, to end-March, would see a 2 percent drop in underlying revenue, while adjusted core earnings would be in the range 7.3 billion-7.4 billion pounds, down from 7.5 billion pounds in the last year.
