Analysts say the actions will likely slow these banks’ growth into overseas markets.\nICBC has been clearing and settling clients’ equity transactions through its financial services unit in the United States since 2012. FINRA said ICBC cleared and settled 33 billion of penny stock shares for customers between January 2013 and September 2015.\nFINRA, the self-regulator for the U.S. securities industry, said the bank’s anti-money laundering system was ineffective and lacked the means to monitor suspicious penny stock liquidations or to detect or investigate red flags.\n“Firms that engage in high-risk activities such as penny stock clearing are the gatekeepers to the market and must establish a reasonable supervisory system to detect and report suspicious trading activity,” Susan Schroeder, FINRA’s executive vice president for the department of enforcement, said in a statement.\nICBC did not admit or deny the FINRA charges.\nThe SEC’s claims stemmed from the liquidation of 12.5 billion penny stock shares that ICBC’s financial services unit cleared between October 2013 and June 2014.\nThe SEC said the bank violated record-keeping and reporting rules because it did not file suspicious activity reports to regulators despite clear warning signs.\n“The failure to file (suspicious activity reports) in the face of numerous red flags is unacceptable,” said Marc Berger, director of the SEC’s New York regional office.\nICBC also did not admit or deny the SEC charges.\nReporting By Elizabeth Dilts; editing by Bill Berkrot\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:41:08.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
