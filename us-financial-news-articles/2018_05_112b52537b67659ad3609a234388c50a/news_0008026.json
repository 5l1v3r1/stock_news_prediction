(OTC:ITRO), a diversified zinc fertilizer and silver producing green technology Company, today announced that it has acquired an exclusive 6 month option (which can be extended 6 months if needed) to purchase a manufacturing facility located at Wabuska, Nevada. \"This is a long term strategic site acquisition for commercial expansion of Itronics' unique portfolio of 'Zero Waste Technologies,'\" said Dr. John Whitney, President.\nPrimary among these technologies are the new hydrometallurgical processes for leaching iron (FeLix Process), zinc (ZinLix Process), and sulfur (SuLix Process) for use in production of GOLD’n GRO micronutrient fertilizers, and high silver content concentrates for e-scrap refining. The Company does not have enough room at its Reno manufacturing facility to set up and operate complete prototype processing circuits to develop engineering data to support construction of commercial scale operating units. The Wabuska location provides adequate space to expand and continue developing these technologies to large commercial scale.\nA high priority for Itronics is to perform the pilot scale testing using the ZinLix process to convert zinc flue dust to provide a low cost source of zinc for GOLD’n GRO zinc micronutrient fertilizer manufacturing, the ability to ship these fertilizers in bulk by rail throughout the United States, and to produce zinc and byproduct metals including silver and gold. The other application that will be high priority is to expand the FeLix and SuLix processes to handle large quantities of precious metal bearing precipitates that will be produced by commercial use of the KAM-Thio technology at silver/gold mine sites. The silver recovered from these precipitates will be used to support expansion of e-scrap refining. The Wabuska site is suitable for installation of a large commercial scale e-scrap processing operation and for installation of operations to refine precious metals and base metals recovered, at a scale required by the processing and recycling operations.\nThe site is already zoned for fertilizer manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, and foundry operations and special use permits will be required for specific operations. The facility is on 48 acres, has five buildings with 54,000 square feet under roof, has six dry product silos and two vertical liquid tanks, and is adjacent to a rail siding. Zinc flue dusts are fine powders and can be delivered in rail hopper cars and stored in the product silos. The product silos are fully equipped, including a conveyor system to transport the zinc flue dust powder into one of the existing buildings on site.\nThe exclusive purchase option also includes more than eight acre feet of water rights. There are two water wells on the site along with a lined fresh water pond, and a lined process water pond for which the permits are active. Site infrastructure includes electric power and natural gas.\nThe Wabuska site, located about 75 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada, is about 12 miles north of Yerington, Nevada on the north side of the Yerington copper mining district with its large undeveloped copper deposits, and is about 10 miles east of the Company’s Fulstone copper, zinc, silver, gold, iron, and industrial mineral exploration property.\n“The Wabuska site is strategically located and is already configured and zoned for uses that are a perfect fit for expansion of Itronics breakthrough 'Zero Waste' technologies at commercial scale,” said Dr. Whitney. \"We are pleased that the seller has been willing to work with Itronics to make this $1.6 million purchase option possible. We are also pleased and excited to be able to expand our technology operations at commercial scale at a highly desirable strategic location in northern Nevada.”\nItronics plans to use the exclusive option period to complete validation of water rights, special use permit requirements, and other regulatory issues that will need to be assumed with purchase of the property. The Company will also begin detailed planning for occupying the property within a period that will be defined in part by special use permit requirements and the elapsed time required to obtain such permits.\nAbout Itronics\nHeadquartered in Reno, Nevada, Itronics Inc. is a “Creative Green Technology” Company which produces GOLD’n GRO specialty liquid fertilizers, silver bullion, and silver-bearing glass. The Company’s goal is to achieve profitable green technology driven organic growth in specialty GOLD’n GRO fertilizers, silver, zinc, and minerals.
