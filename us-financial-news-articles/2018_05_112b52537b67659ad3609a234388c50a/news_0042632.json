I always say that. I owe him a lot because he brought me here, I will always remember that,” Fabregas told reporters at Chelsea’s training ground this week.\n“My first year here, (former Arsenal manager) Arsene (Wenger) had always treated me like a son. But the closest anyone has been to him was Jose.\n“The way he treated me, the way he made me feel, how he let me be a leader of the team from day one. This was fantastic and in all the four years since I joined Chelsea now they will always stay with me.\n“This experience is thanks to him.”\nYet Fabregas has spent a large part of his career in opposition to Mourinho — as he will do again at Wembley on Saturday when Chelsea hope to make up for finishing fifth in the Premier League with a first FA Cup win since 2012.\nThe early years of Fabregas’s stint at Arsenal coincided with Mourinho’s arrival as manager of Chelsea, while he was also part of a Barcelona side that was vying for Spanish supremacy with Mourinho’s Real Madrid.

Barcelona with him Real Madrid. We were confronting each other, but then we humbled ourselves and started a good relationship.\n“This is very nice but hopefully it will not be his day (on Saturday) and Chelsea can win.”\nApart from Fabregas, several other players from the 2014-15 title-winning team including Gary Cahill, Willian and Eden Hazard will be involved on Saturday.\nWhile they will all be familiar with Mourinho’s methods, Fabregas knows their old manager will conjure something new for a one-off game that means so much to both teams.\n“In the last two years we played many games against them and he has changed the system many times,” Fabregas said.\n“I am sure he will change something again on Saturday. You can expect that. We just need to prepare our game and focus on ourselves. We don’t need to be thinking too much about what they are going to do and we have to do what we do.”\nUnited finished runners-up in the Premier League and are favourites against a Chelsea side who ended the league season with a 3-0 defeat by Newcastle United.\nFabregas said last season’s final when Chelsea lost to Arsenal after winning the Premier League title showed why the Wembley showpiece is so hard to call.\n“Anything can happen really,” he said. “Last year everyone was saying Chelsea will win it and we played one of our worst games of last season. Mourinho prepares finals very well and I am sure Antonio (Conte) will do the same.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:10:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
