REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\nNegotiators for several trucker groups agreed late on Thursday to suspend the mobilizations for 15 days after the government vowed to subsidize and stabilize diesel prices, which may cost 5 billion reais ($1.4 billion) this year.\nTo win over truckers, who began the blockades on Monday to protest high fuel prices, the government also promised to extend for 30 days a 10 percent diesel price cut announced by state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.\nShares of Petrobras, as the company is known, rose more than 2 percent in early trading after plunging 19 percent in the prior two days, as news of government subsidies softened the blow of political interference in the firm’s fuel pricing.

Private port operator Codesp SA said there was nearly no activity at Santos, the busiest port in Latin America.\nGas stations remained short of fuel and grocers’ aisles were understocked in many areas. Public transport and trash collection were reduced in major cities due to fuel shortages.\nFibria SA, the world’s largest producer of eucalyptus pulp, said the protests were affecting its production and transportation.\nAuto production in Brazil, which contributes about a quarter of industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday, according to carmakers association Anfavea, in the latest blow to a fragile economic recovery following the worst downturn in decades.\nThe truckers’ protest has weakened Brazil’s unpopular government, whose market-friendly reform agenda had already stalled ahead of a wide-open October election.\nRaul Jungmann, minister of public security, said the government will investigate if trucking companies were prohibiting employees from working, breaking “lockout” laws.
