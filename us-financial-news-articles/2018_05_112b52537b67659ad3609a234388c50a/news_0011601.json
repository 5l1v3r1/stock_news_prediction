Aid workers say they have had no access to humanitarian aid for more than three weeks.\nFears of a delay in delivering aid should not compel the government to give unconditional humanitarian support to those trapped in Aung Lawt, said Zaw Htay.\n“The security forces have concerns. We are trying our best to work out the two situations,” he said.\nKIA spokesman Colonel Naw Bu denied the government’s allegation and said the screening would “make things more difficult” for the displaced people.\nMyanmar’s military did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe fighting has put a spotlight on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s stuttering efforts to bring peace to the diverse, Buddhist-majority country that has seen near-perpetual war since its independence from Britain in 1949.\nThe conflict has sent more than 1,000 people fleeing to the village of Tanghpre, where a church has been distributing food and proving shelter for displaced villagers, mostly from Kachin’s eastern township of Injangyang.\n“I’d like to urge both sides to make sure that the fighting will not spread into this area as there are more than 1,000 people taking shelter in this village,” said Stephen Supma Sut Awng, a priest at the Queen of Heaven Catholic Church.\n“My biggest concern for them is education for the children because there is no government facility in Tanghpre,” he said.\nThousands of people rallied in Kachin this week to demand humanitarian access for villagers trapped by fighting.\nFighting between government forces and ethnic minority Kachin and other insurgents has been eclipsed in media coverage by the plight of nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last August.\n(This story replaces term “refugees” with “displaced people” throughout.)
