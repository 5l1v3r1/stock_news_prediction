Photo: Sergey Nivens/Shutterstock.com\nGood morning. Specialists in emerging technology, cybersecurity and risk-and-scenario modeling are going to be among the most sought-after employees in the next three years, according to a survey of 400 U.S.-based chief executives by KPMG LLP . Three-quarters said they are prioritizing hiring in these areas to support growth, while 52% said they think more jobs will be created by artificial intelligence than will be lost.\nIt’s no surprise these specialists are in high demand, given companies’ need to protect themselves against increasing regulatory, strategic, operational and emerging risks, said Kelly Watson, national service group leader for risk consulting at the professional-services firm. Most companies have a wealth of data but often struggle to tap it for insights that will help them avoid trouble. Modeling specialists help organizations to be more agile in their risk management and compliance efforts, he said.\n“By leveraging forward-looking insights from the data they can better plan for and respond to emerging risks, including regulatory shifts, changes in the geopolitical landscape and risks created by disruptive technologies,” said Ms. Watson. “CEOs have come to appreciate the importance of scenario planning, and understand that to effectively manage the organization it’s key to anticipate change.”\nWhile 89% of CEOs said protecting customer data is one of their most important personal responsibilities, just 15% said having a strong cybersecurity strategy was important for building trust with stakeholders, the survey found.\nWhy the disparity? It may be that while CEOs view customer data protection as one of their most important personal responsibilities, they are less sure about the role of a strong cyber strategy in building trust, said Tony Buffomante, U.S. leader of cybersecurity services at KPMG.\n“They understand that more than just a sound cyber strategy is needed to engender customer and stakeholder trust,” he said. Also key is being able to properly respond to breaches, including timely and accurate communication to consumers and other stakeholders, said Mr. Buffomante.\n“While an overarching and high-level strategy is important to set the stage for cyber risk management, those more mature organizations in the U.S. have moved beyond just strategy to focus on deploying detailed tactics to fortify trust with their customers and other stakeholders,” he said.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nBumble Bee Foods Chief Executive Christopher Lischewski is taking a leave of absence to fight charges he colluded to fix tuna prices, the company said Friday.

That makes a significant difference in the way senior executives and boards should think about extended enterprise risk management (EERM), with one approach being to think of third parties as teaming with the business to help create value. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to EERM, managing third-party risk from both a revenue and cost perspective can provide significant opportunity to drive additional business value, create efficiencies, and build resilience.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
