The 4.4 metres (14 feet) high bronze statue of Karl Marx, created by Chinese artist Wu Weishan and donated by China to mark the 200th birth anniversary of the German philosopher, is seen in his hometown Trier, Germany May 5, 2018.

We don’t have to hide him.”\nThe city council voted to accept the gift from the Chinese government by 42 members to seven in March 2017.\nWhile some see it as recognition of Trier’s most famous son, others argue that accepting the gift from China is not compatible with criticising human rights abuses there.\nSince 2015, China’s President Xi Jinping has presided over a widespread crackdown on human rights activists.\nThe statue depicts a thoughtful Marx, holding a book in one hand.\n“Yes, we stand by the child of our city. And we deal with Karl Marx in a constructive and active way,” said Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, to which Trier belongs. “We are glad to receive this present, this gesture of friendship.” Reporting by Reuters TV; Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Kevin Liffey", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T18:05:36.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
