Therefore, we have also stopped taking new orders in Iran,” a spokeswoman told Reuters.\nTorm operates 79 oil product tankers worldwide.\nThe United States last week withdrew from an international nuclear accord with Iran and announced renewed sanctions against the country.\nWhile it is still unclear how U.S. sanctions will affect output from the third-largest OPEC producer, the move has helped oil prices rise.\nReporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:42:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
