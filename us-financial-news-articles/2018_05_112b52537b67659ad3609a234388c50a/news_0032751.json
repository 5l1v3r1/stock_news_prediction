(Nasdaq:AMRS), the industrial bioscience company, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We continue to execute well on our business plan and to lead the industry in growing our top line revenue while significantly expanding our gross margin,” said John Melo, Amyris President & CEO. “We are on track for another record year and continue to perform extremely well in both our consumer and our ingredient businesses. Biossance, our Clean Beauty brand, grew at over 400% in the first quarter and we expect to continue performing well as one of the fastest growing skin care brands in the U.S., also available now in Brazil and Canada.”\nKey Highlights\nOther key recent operating and development highlights included:\nSignificant reduction in cost of products sold ($5.3 million for Q1 2018, compared with $12.8 million for same quarter a year ago) due to sale of Brotas 1 plant and ceasing production of farnesene for lower margin product applications.\nOur product related royalty revenue (previously referred to as value share) delivered $11.4 million of 100% gross margin related revenue.\nSuccessful launch of Biossance™ into SEPHORA’s Brasil market quickly becoming one of the top three skin care brands in Sephora Brasil.\nCompleted successful collaboration with Firmenich to develop and commercialize a disruptive bio-based fragrance ingredient.\nShipped new sweetener product to collaboration partner for distribution to its customers for sampling and formulation testing. Amyris expects to begin ramping commercial scale production of the sweetener in the August/September 2018 timeframe.\nSuccessfully increased Chevron’s role as key strategic partner and shareholder of Novvi, our renewable lubricants joint venture company with leading technology for automotive base oils.\nFinancial Performance (preliminary unaudited)\nFirst Quarter 2018\nGAAP revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $23.0 million, compared with $13.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Licenses and royalties revenues contributed $11.4 million and were up from $255,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Product sales were $5.2 million for first-quarter 2018 compared with $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decline was attributable to the assignment of certain farnesene supply agreements to DSM and discontinuing low margin product sales, partially offset by continued strong Biossance growth and demand for the company’s Aprinnova joint venture’s skin care ingredients products. Grants and collaborations revenue was $6.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $4.7 million for the year-ago period.\nSales, general and administrative expenses were $18.8 million for first-quarter 2018 compared with $12.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting faster than expected ramp-up and increased headcount, costs associated with a new employee bonus plan of approximately $2.0 million, professional services costs, and costs related to the Amyris Brasil Ltda. transaction. Research and development expenses of $18.8 million for the quarter were up from $14.8 million for first-quarter 2017 due to increased headcount, lab supplies and DARPA/DOE project reimbursable consulting fees. In addition, included in research and development expenses for Q1 2018 were initial development costs for some of the company’s newer products.\nGAAP net loss attributable to Amyris common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $91.9 million, or $1.79 per basic and diluted share, compared with a GAAP net loss attributable to Amyris common stockholders for first-quarter 2017 of $37.4 million, or $1.93 per basic and diluted share. The net loss calculation included a non-cash loss from changes in the fair value of derivatives of $63.9 million connected to outstanding debt and warrants.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $26.3 million, or $0.52 per basic and diluted share. This excluded loss from change in fair value of derivative instruments, stock-based compensation expense and cumulative dividends on preferred stock. This compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $38.2 million, or $1.97 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION\nTo supplement our financial results and guidance presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures that we believe are helpful in understanding our results.
