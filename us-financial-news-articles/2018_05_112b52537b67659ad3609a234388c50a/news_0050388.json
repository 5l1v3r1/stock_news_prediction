Nobody had done that for a sporting event and for us that was a first milestone which we crossed early in the tournament.\n“Tuesday was quite significant because... this is really establishing a new global benchmark in terms of the number of simultaneous users for an online event on video.”\nAustrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner’s leap in 2012 into the stratosphere from a balloon near the edge of space 24 miles (39 km) above Earth was watched by a record audience of more than 8 million people live on YouTube.\nHotstar, which exclusively streams HBO’s hit “Game of Thrones” show in India, could see even bigger audience with Sunday’s IPL final.\nTwenty-First Century Fox-backed Star India, which runs the Hotstar streaming service, paid a staggering 163.48 billion rupees ($2.39 billion) last September for the television and digital rights of the IPL for five years.\nHowever, for Hotstar the ongoing IPL is the fifth season of streaming the popular Twenty20 tournament in the country of 1.2 billion people obsessed with cricket.\nStar invested 12.33 billion rupees after winning the IPL rights and that has bore fruit with their technology being resilient enough to address and serve a scale that other streaming platforms across the globe has not seen.\n“We genuinely believe that we can bring people online in India,” Mohan told Reuters. “We have hit a certain scale that has really allowed us to take off. We added 150 million users in April.\n“We have invested dramatically in building technology capabilities. We have now built a platform that can take that sort of scale. A five million scale would be difficult to support on most video platforms even today.”\nIntroducing features such as Watch’NPlay, a virtual play-along game associated with live sports, ahead of the IPL season has also helped.\n“You are watching the match and it also allows you to play a game at the same time. For me, that’s made a huge difference,” Mohan added. “It has provided us a very clear differentiator for why people should come and watch the match on Hotstar.\n“It has also attracted a whole bunch of casual cricket followers. It’s expanding the universe of cricket followers and IPL. Casual gaming can be very powerful in a country with young demographics like India.”\n($1 = 68.3600 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:13:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
