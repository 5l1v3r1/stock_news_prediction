Salah will be in the World Cup, God willing, and won’t be absent for more than three weeks,” it said on Twitter without giving further details.\nEgypt begin their World Cup campaign against Uruguay on June 15, before facing hosts Russia on June 19 and Saudi Arabia on June 25.

Your love and support will give me the strength I need.”\nEgypt reached the tournament after Salah scored a 95th- minute penalty to help them beat Congo 2-1 in October.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Liverpool physiotherapist Ruben Pons was quoted by the Spanish sports paper Marca as saying that Salah would be out for up to four weeks.\n“He is sad about what happened but is totally focused on recovery, seeing when he can be ready,” he said.\n“In principle it will be between three and four weeks but we will try to reduce those dates, that’s the big goal,” Pons added.\nSalah, who scored 44 goals in a sensational first season for Liverpool after joining from AS Roma, was voted Player of the Year by the Football Writers’ Association this month, completing a sweep of England’s individual prizes and becoming the first African player to win the prestigious award.
