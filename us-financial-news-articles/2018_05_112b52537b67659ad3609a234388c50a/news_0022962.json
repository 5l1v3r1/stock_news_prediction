I don’t think anybody could have foreseen what was ahead,” Moore told reporters on Friday. “We’ve come together. We can all agree that we’ve finished on a positive note.\n“Momentum is very, very important. It’s good to finish the season on a high, which I think we have done. We want to keep the positive mentality here.”\nWest Brom’s unbeaten record under Moore helped the former defender clinch the Premier League Manager of the Month award on Tuesday but the Baggies’ relegation was confirmed hours later following Southampton’s win over Swansea City.\nMoore backed Burnley’s Sean Dyche to win the Premier League Manager of the Year award, over title-winning Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, after leading the Lancashire outfit to a seventh-placed finish and sealing Europa League qualification.\n“Sean’s done superbly — he really has been superb,” he added. “It’s hard to pinpoint one particular manager because there have been so many highs for so many managers in the Premier League.\n“If I had to pick one, I’d have to say Sean, for getting to the Europa League. He’s done a fantastic job. He’s been consistent with his ways, his views.”\nWest Brom will be travelling with an almost fully fit squad, with the exception of long-term absentees Gareth Barry and James Morrison, for Sunday’s last league match at Crystal Palace.
