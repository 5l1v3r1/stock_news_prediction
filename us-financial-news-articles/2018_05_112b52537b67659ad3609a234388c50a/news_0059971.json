Forward-looking information is often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “seek”, “anticipate”, “plan”, “continue”, “planned”, “expect”, “project”, “predict”, “potential”, “targeting”, “intends”, “believe”, “potential”, and similar expressions, or describes a “goal”, or a variation of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.\nForward-looking information is subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking information, including, without limitation, the list of risk factors identified in Avante’s Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A), Annual Information Form (AIF) and other continuous disclosure, which list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of Avante’s forward-looking information. In connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this and subsequent press releases, Avante has made certain assumptions about its business and the industry in which it operates and has also assumed that no significant events occur outside of Avante’s normal course of business. Although management believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date the statements are made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and, accordingly, undue reliance should not be put on such statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. Avante’s forward-looking information is based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management on the date the statements are made, and Avante does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by applicable law. For the reasons set forth above, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource:Avante Logixx Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=E6kijeJl5ts5kMSU47I9co2r8rHuBmFdD4yJzPAdwp9hP6mn_9fofPmH0b3VyAik3vGTUkGcEUJzPXflYKlQCqO4WPfb41cP015jeh32lSU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=K1fnFGyf3aMX1xKrFDIX4tY4TyRGFpwNp6bPQ51VMj5DJUFG8uZ98Nq67USa3CCq8FA8voPkkQfhmqNeVsvdchZqAOfuogfm4k_LaYo4-uA="], "published": "2018-05-30T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:17:51.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
