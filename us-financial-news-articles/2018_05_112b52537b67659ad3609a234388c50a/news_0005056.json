A final decision is still expected this year.\nRead, whose previous attempts at huge acquisitions of AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ) and Allergan ( AGN.N ) were thwarted, said the company does not need a megamerger to drive future growth.\n“I don’t see that we need a transformative deal or see one at an appropriate value,” Read said, adding that drugs in development and newer medicines will be able to drive future growth.\nHe said the company has 15 potential blockbuster medicines in the pipeline that could be launched by 2022.\nPfizer also sees opportunities to significantly expand sales of prostate cancer drug Xtandi for treating less advanced patients, and arthritis drug Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis. U.S. regulatory decisions on the expanded uses are expected later this year.\nPfizer posted adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share that topped analysts’ average expectations by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, on lower taxes and cost of goods sold. It did not raise its full-year earnings or revenue forecasts.\nDespite strong growth, sales of oral rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz and blockbuster breast cancer treatment Ibrance missed expectations largely due to inventory stocking issues but are likely to rebound, analysts said.\nFILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Injected arthritis drug Enbrel was hit by competition from cheaper biosimilars outside the United States. Vaccines and other older drugs, such as Lyrica, Premarin and Celebrex all fell short of analysts’ estimates.\nIbrance sales rose 37.4 percent to $933 million, while analysts looked for $956.6 million. Xeljanz sales totaled $326 million, missing the Wall Street outlook by about $72 million.\nTotal revenue rose 1 percent to $12.91 billion, while analysts expected $13.13 billion.\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said he expected stronger international sales, given favorable foreign exchange rates.\n“If you remove the FX tailwind it would have been a much more substantial miss,” he said, adding that it was disappointing Pfizer did not raise its 2018 forecasts after rivals, such as Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) and AbbVie ( ABBV.N ), raised their outlooks after reporting first-quarter results.\nPfizer still expects adjusted full-year earnings of $2.90 to $3.00 per share on revenue of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.\nNet profit rose to $3.56 billion, or 59 cents per share, for the quarter, from $3.12 billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier.\nPfizer shares fell $1.87 to $34.74.\nReporting by Bill Berkrot in New York and Akankshita Mukhopadhyay in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar, Anil D'Silva and JS Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:06:42.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
