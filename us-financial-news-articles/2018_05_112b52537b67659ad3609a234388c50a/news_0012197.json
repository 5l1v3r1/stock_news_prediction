Trump has broken the goal into three pillars: well-being, social media use, and opioid abuse.\nThe focus of the first pillar is on “teaching positive skills and decision making,” Trump said. “Let us teach our children the difference between right and wrong and encourage them to be best in their unique paths in life.”\nPillar two, social media, is dedicated to preventing cyberbullying. Back in March, the first lady met with top tech executives and Internet safety-focused nonprofits at the White House; she said she intends to keep in close contact with those executives to work towards a safer social media environment.\nAs part of the third and final pillar, opioid abuse, Trump says she intends to support programs that are helping opioid-addicted parents and their children recover.\nSpeaking after his wife, President Donald Trump proclaimed May 7th as “Be Best Day”—a day on which “we pledge to be best for our families and our community.”\nFor more, subscribe to the Broadsheet , Fortune’s newsletter on the world’s most powerful women.
