The company is a successful player in the smart building industry, bringing an advanced digital sensory system to market. Both parties have agreed not to disclose financial details. Closing is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Enlighted will be managed as an independent legal entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Siemens Industry, Inc.\n“Enlighted has a strong footprint in revolutionizing building intelligence by developing a multi-sensor-based IoT platform, using the power of data,” said Matthias Rebellius, CEO of Siemens Building Technologies. “With this move we are demonstrating our commitment to drive digitalization in the smart building industry.”\nEnlighted achieved its technological leadership with a world-class IoT platform for commercial real estate. The platform consists of multi-function sensors, distributed computing, its own network, and software applications. The beating heart of Enlighted’s platform are smart sensors, securely streaming data to the cloud. In addition, the platform enables reduced energy use, improved space utilization, better environmental management and greater asset utilization.\n“With Siemens as a global partner, we will both accelerate innovation and market adoption of our smart building technologies on an international scale,” said Joe Costello, Chairman and CEO of Enlighted Inc.\nEnlighted analyzes and visualizes the collected sensor data to drive down operating costs and improve the inner life of a building. These sensors can be installed in every light fixture with the ability to collect data 65 times per second to detect environmental and occupancy changes and react to lighting and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) needs in real-time. Based on an advanced smart lighting control application, today, the Enlighted platform can lower lighting costs of a building up to 85 percent when combined with advanced LED fixtures. In addition, the platform is able to locate people and assets within a building and analyze the occupancy of floors and rooms. Finally, in combination with Siemens solutions, the Enlighted platform can optimize the energy efficiency of HVAC systems.\nThe interaction between buildings and humans is crucial to increase productivity, energy efficiency and comfort in a building. From its inception, Enlighted has been focused on understanding how buildings can be made more efficient and the people who work in them more productive. Enlighted’s smart IoT platform with a digital sensory system applicable in any light fixture is a core element of revolutionizing building intelligence by enhancing the dialogue between humans and buildings.\nAbout Siemens\nThe Siemens Building Technologies Division (Buffalo Grove, Ill.) is the North American market leader for safe and secure, energy-efficient and environment-friendly buildings and infrastructures.
