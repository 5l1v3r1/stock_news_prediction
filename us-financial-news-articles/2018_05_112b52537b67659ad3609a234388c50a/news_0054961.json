(NYSE: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, will acquire a minority interest in a partnership that intends to construct a five-star ultra-luxury Manhattan hotel development, investing alongside venerable New York real estate development companies, Mactaggart Family & Partners LP (“Sponsor”), and Caspi Development.\nTo maximize long-term predictable cash flow for DPW, the investment will be made in a project with consistently strong luxury hospitality fundamentals, unique location advantages, and on terms pari-passu with top-tier New York City real estate investors.\nDPW expects the property to form a long-term anchor of its hospitality assets. The Sponsor has signed a long-term contract with a 106-year, premier European hospitality group, which will share its flagship hotel’s name, sophistication and exclusive service with the 96 room Tribeca hotel. They are among the largest operators of 5-star luxury hotels and casinos in Europe.\nThe Sponsor expects to reveal the group as part of a branding effort that will commence in the fall of 2018.\nThe Sponsor has engaged AECOM Tishman Construction Corp. (“Tishman”) for the hotel’s construction which broke ground in December 2017 and is expected to be completed during the summer of 2020, with the opening anticipated to be immediately thereafter.\nBased on a projected average daily rate (“ADR”) of $983 upon stabilization in 2021 (as compared to the competitive set’s May 2016 ADR of $1,060), the project is expected to produce a stable, unlevered yield on cost of 10%. A refinancing, three years after opening, is projected to return 50% of the invested equity and should generate cash-on-cash returns of 18% thereafter.\nThe 94,000 square foot hotel, located one block east of the Hudson River, in the heart of the TriBeCa North Historic District, will feature 96 opulently appointed rooms and suites, a lavish full-service spa and six first-class food and beverage venues, all exclusively designed by renowned designers Martin Brudnizki Design Studio and Stephen B. Jacobs Group.\nA record-number Michelin star restaurateur is also contracted to oversee dining in the Hotel, including the New York manifestation of an iconic European institution in operation since the 1800’s.\nLondon-based Mactaggart Family & Partners, LP has been operating in New York City since 1985. Its experience spans over 35 years of high-end office and residential development including 589 Fifth Avenue, 590 Fifth Avenue, 183 Madison Avenue, and 576 Fifth Avenue.\nFamily-run Caspi Development represents decades of real estate pedigree, which along with a comprehensive hands-on approach, has led to an unparalleled reputation for perfection in design, construction and project completion. With a track record of both metropolitan and suburban achievements, Caspi thrives in the competitive Westchester and New York City landscapes. Bringing three generations of experience to the table, Caspi taps into its knowledgeable site selection and financial entrepreneurship to succeed in a variety of markets.\n“This is a unique opportunity to establish a firm foundation of predictable cash-flow at terms obtained by the leading real estate investors in New York City,” commented Milton “Todd” Ault III, DPW’s CEO and Chairman. “The asset itself is completely unique and will capitalize on the exploding business and residential growth of Lower Manhattan and this exclusive neighborhood.” For more information regarding the hotel project, please use this link where a live video feed is also featured streaming during the day, https://DPWHoldings.com/456luxhotelnyc/ .\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.\nHeadquartered in Newport Beach, CA, DPW Holdings, Inc., www.DPWHoldings.com , is a diversified holding company with a growth strategy of acquiring undervalued assets, disruptive technologies, sustainable solutions, and exciting ventures for incubation and development to their full potential for long-term growth and investor returns.
