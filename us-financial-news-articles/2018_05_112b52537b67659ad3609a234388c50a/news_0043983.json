It has declined nearly 1.2 percent versus the dollar this week and fallen sharply against the Swiss franc, which typically attracts capital in times of uncertainty.\n“The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence ... at this point a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance [in Italy] does seem likely,” said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.\nA founding member of the EU and the euro, Italy accounts for 15.4 percent of Eurozone GDP and the parties’ hostility toward the European Union stance is the biggest challenge to the bloc since Britain voted to leave two years ago.\nStill, some investors have played down the broader impact on the euro and questioned whether the Italian parties will really follow through on such plans.\nOnly five percent of Italian government bonds are held by non-EU residents, making the chances of a massive flight of capital unlikely.\nA powerful rally by the dollar is also hurting the euro.\nOn Friday the greenback edged higher against the yen and set a fresh four-month high, buoyed by a further rise in U.S. Treasury yields that suggests an upbeat outlook for the world’s largest economy.\nThe dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 93.570 and briefly surpassed a five-month high of 93.632 set earlier this week.\nThe dollar has risen 5 percent since mid-February and investors are betting that U.S. interest rates will need to rise further to curb inflation.\nThat has forced investors who took big positions against the dollar anticipating it would fall in 2018 to rush to unwind and cover their positions, pushing the greenback even higher.\n“We continue to anticipate dollar gains,” Hans Redeker, global head of currency strategy at Morgan Stanley in London, said in a note.\n“Global growth divergence is continuing, with US retail sales and industrial production contrasting with growth weakness in Europe and Japan,” he said.\nIn a note to clients, strategists at Citibank also said the dollar rally would not last long.\nThe U.S. budget deficit, which is projected to balloon to more than $1 trillion in 2019, they said, would contribute to a drop of 5 percent in the dollar index over the next 12 months.
