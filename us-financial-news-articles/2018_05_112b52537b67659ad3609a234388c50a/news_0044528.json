(NASDAQ:FORD), a leading product design and development company and distributor of custom carry and protective solutions today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. Included in the second quarter results are the financial results from our new subsidiary, Intelligent Product Solutions (IPS), which we acquired on January 18, 2018.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenues were $9 million compared to $4.5 million from the second quarter of 2017. An increase of 98%.\nIncome from Operations was $232 thousand compared to a loss of $237 thousand in the second quarter of 2017.\nGross profit percentage increased to 20% compared to 15.8% in the second quarter of 2017.\nNet income was $948 thousand (inclusive of a non-cash tax benefit of $747 thousand) compared to net loss of $238 thousand in the second quarter of 2017.\nNet income per share was $0.10 per share compared to a loss of $0.03 per share for the second quarter of 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $3.3 million at March 31, 2018.\nTerry Wise, Chief Executive Officer of Forward Industries, stated, “We are delighted with the strong set of results for this quarter. Clearly, the enhanced group following our recent acquisition of Intelligent Product Solutions have delivered a significant improvement in the Company’s performance. It is pleasing to see that the organic Forward business grew this quarter relative to the previous equivalent fiscal quarter but I have no doubt that we will continue to face challenges in the diabetic sector of our business. The Company will continue to safeguard our existing top tier customers, but as a priority, the business will focus on leveraging cross selling opportunities between organic Forward and the design and development capability of IPS. This is a very exciting time for Forward and I am hopeful of a promising future for the Company.”\nThe tables below are derived from the Company’s unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 18, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please refer to the Form 10-K for complete financial statements and further information regarding the Company’s results of operations and financial condition relating to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.

Forward has tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as “may”, “should,” “expect,” “hope,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Company and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause its actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. These risks include the inability to expand our customer base, pricing pressures, lack of success of new sales people and unanticipated issues with our affiliated sourcing agent, failure to take advantage of synergies between IPS and Forward and issues integrating with IPS. No assurance can be given that the actual results will be consistent with the forward-looking statements. Investors should read carefully the factors described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017 for information regarding risk factors that could affect the Company’s results. Except as otherwise required by Federal securities laws, Forward undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason.\nAbout Forward Industries\nIncorporated in 1962, and headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida, Forward Industries is a global designer and distributor of mobile device cases and accessories.
