Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Villarreal vs Real Madrid - Estadio de la Ceramica, Villarreal, Spain - May 19, 2018 Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos in action with Villarreal's Samu Castillejo REUTERS/Heino Kalis\nGareth Bale continued his bid for a starting berth in the Kiev final by scoring his fourth goal in three league games to fire Real ahead in the 11th minute, and Cristiano Ronaldo headed in a cross from Marcelo to make it 2-0. Related Coverage Zidane lauds resurgent Bale but gives no clues ahead of final\nZinedine Zidane fielded an almost full-strength team, leaving out only Karim Benzema and goalkeeper Keylor Navas, with the French coach handing a debut to his 20-year-old son, Luca Zidane, in goal.

Second-placed Atletico, on 78, host Eibar.\nReal can make amends by winning a 13th European Cup next week if they beat Liverpool and become the first team since 1976 to win the trophy three years in a row.\n“We played very well in the first half and in the second half we were thinking about the final and managing the game, and when you do that your opponent can cause you problems,” Real coach Zidane told reporters.\n“The league campaign started badly for us but we have ended it well and now we’ve got the most beautiful thing, which is the final. We’re ready for the final and we don’t have any injuries. That’s the most important thing.”\nThe point was enough to ensure Villarreal finished fifth in the standings on 61 points, one above sixth-placed Real Betis, who lost 3-2 to Leganes, although both sides were already assured of automatic places in next season’s Europa League.
