We look forward to working with the Olympus team,” he said.\nOlympus, in a statement, said it would “continue to hold an active dialogue (with ValueAct) as one of many shareholders and foster mutual understanding over our growth strategy”.\nAn Olympus spokesman declined to comment any further when contacted by Reuters.\nOlympus shares closed at 3,860 yen on Thursday.\nValueAct’s stake nearly matches the 5.05 percent stake owned as of the end of March by Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), which was Olympus’ third-largest shareholder at the time.\nThe filing shows ValueAct has been gradually building up its stake in Olympus over the past two months, reaching a mandatory public disclosure of ownership of over 5 percent.
