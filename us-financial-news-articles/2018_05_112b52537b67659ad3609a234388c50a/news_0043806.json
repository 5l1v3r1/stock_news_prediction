He succeeded Stuart Weitzman, the brand’s founder and now its chairman. Stuart Weitzman is the smallest of Tapestry’s three businesses by sales.\nMorelli’s departure comes just months after another high profile designer, Guess Inc ( GES.N ) co-founder Paul Marciano, was relieved of his day-to-day responsibilities pending the completion of a probe into accusations of improper conduct.\nTapestry shares were unchanged in extended trading on Monday.
