(\"AgroFresh\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: AGFS), a global leader in produce freshness solutions, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, ended March 31, 2018.\nJordi Ferre, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Fiscal 2018 is off to a solid start. Revenue continues to grow driven by the expansion of the AgroFresh franchise and the acquisition of Tecnidex. I am particularly pleased that we were able to achieve organic revenue growth despite this year’s weak apple harvest in Latin America and a year ago first quarter that benefitted from an early harvest. Tecnidex also had a solid quarter, with double digit revenue growth versus the first quarter of 2017 in Spain and Africa/Middle East. We are making significant progress with the Tecnidex integration and remain on pace to achieve the synergies contemplated in this acquisition. The expansion of our franchise continues as we penetrate new markets and broaden the services we provide our customers.\n“We were able to compensate for an overall weaker apple crop size across the Southern Hemisphere by increasing penetration of SmartFresh and further diversifying into other crops, such as pears, plums, melons and avocados. Growers are confident we will provide them with crop protection solutions and new technologies that enable them to improve crop management. One of these is our Harvista solution that has helped us grow share in a very competitive market environment in Argentina. Another is our RipeLock offering, which we are preparing to roll out across the entire store system of a major US retailer, representing what we expect will be a turning point in the trajectory of this product line.”\n(1) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the information under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a description of EBITDA and the tables at the end of this press release for a reconciliation of this Non-GAAP financial measure to GAAP results.\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $38 million, up 17 percent versus the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the contribution from Tecnidex as well as increased SmartFresh penetration in traditional and new crops. The Company adopted a new accounting standard, ASC 606, in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in approximately $0.8 million of revenue being deferred that would otherwise have been recognized in the quarter if we had utilized the same accounting conventions utilized in the first quarter a year ago. For the quarter, Tecnidex revenues were almost $6 million.\nConsolidated gross margins in the quarter were 72 percent. Margins in the quarter reflect a shift in our core product mix, the effect of a full quarter of Tecnidex, as well as the impact of the deferral of revenue under ASC 606.\nResearch and development costs of $3 million were down slightly versus the first quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $16 million were down slightly from a year ago as the addition of the SG&A from Tecnidex was offset by a reduction in operating expenses in the core business. Expenses also continue to include elevated legal and related expenses arising from both ongoing litigation and acquisition activity.\nInterest expense of $8 million was down approximately $2 million from the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower accretion of contingent consideration.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nThe company continues to generate strong cash flow, with cash from operations of $3 million in the quarter. At March 31, 2018, the company had cash on hand of $57 million. In the first quarter, the Company used cash of $10 million to make a contractual payment to Dow and $15 million in cash interest expense with 2 payments falling in the quarter.\nKatherine Harper, Chief Financial Officer, said, “Results for the first quarter demonstrate that our investment in strengthening the SmartFresh Quality System and in complementary acquisitions is generating attractive returns. We adopted ASC 606 this quarter, deferring approximately $0.8 million of revenue that would have been recognized in the quarter under our previous revenue recognition policies, with the concomitant impact on revenue and profitability metrics. The effect was to reduce organic revenues by about 3% and gross margins by about 300 basis points. Driving down operating expenses remains a priority. Though cash at quarter end was down from previous quarters, our model is asset-light and we expect strong operating cash flow for the year, providing us with the liquidity and financial resources to fund both our internal and other growth initiatives. Global demand for better stewardship of limited resources is leading to rapid development of the highly fragmented food preservation and waste reduction space. This provides multiple growth opportunities, including organic growth in existing markets, the creation of new markets through new product innovation, and strategic acquisitions, partnerships and other creative arrangements that can accelerate our growth trajectory, all of which are important elements of our long-term growth strategy.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 10, 2018.
