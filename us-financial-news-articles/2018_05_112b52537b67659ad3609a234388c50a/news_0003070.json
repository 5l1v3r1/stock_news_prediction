(NYSE:ORN) (the “Company”), a leading specialty construction company, today reported net income of $4.1 million, ($0.14 diluted earnings per share) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. These results compare to net loss of $1.8 million, ($0.07 diluted loss per share) for the same period a year ago.\n“During the first quarter, we had solid execution with continued strong market drivers,” said Mark Stauffer, Orion Group Holding's President and Chief Executive Officer. “While weather patterns impacted production in our Concrete segment, our Marine segment experienced solid execution. Overall, we remain pleased with the end market drivers across our business, and continue to expect 2018 will see improvements over 2017.”\nConsolidated Results for First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017\nContract revenues were $136.8 million, a decrease of 1.4%, as compared to revenues of $138.8 million. The slight decrease is attributed to the timing and mix of projects, including weather pattern disruptions in the Concrete segment.\nGross profit was $15.8 million, as compared to gross profit of $13.0 million. Gross profit margin was 11.6% as compared to 9.4%. This increase is primarily attributed to solid operational performance.\nSelling, General and Administrative expenses were $15.0 million, as compared to $15.0 million.\nOperating income was $7.1 million, as compared to an operating loss of $1.5 million.\nEBITDA was $13.8 million, representing a 10.1% EBITDA margin, as compared to EBITDA of $6.1 million, or 4.4% EBITDA margin.\nSegment Results for First Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017\nMarine Segment\nContract revenues were $62.8 million, a decrease of 6.5%, as compared to $67.2 million. The decrease is primarily attributed to the timing and mix of projects.\nOperating income was $6.3 million, as compared to an operating loss of $7.7 million.\nEBITDA was $13.3 million, representing a 21.2% EBITDA margin as compared to $(0.6) million EBITDA and a (0.9)% EBITDA margin.\nConcrete Segment\nContract revenues were $74.1 million, an increase of 3.5%, as compared to $71.6 million. The increase is primarily attributed to the expansion into the Central Texas market, partially offset by weather patterns that impacted production.\nOperating income was $0.8 million, as compared to operating income of $6.2 million. The decrease is primarily attributed to unfavorable weather patterns, the timing and mix of projects and competitive pressure in the Houston market.\nEBITDA was $0.5 million, representing a 0.7% EBITDA margin, as compared to $6.7 million EBITDA and a 9.4% EBITDA margin.\nBacklog\nBacklog of work under contract as of March 31, 2018 was $355.3 million, which compares with backlog under contract at March 31, 2017 of $394.8 million, a decrease of 10.0%. Of the March 31, 2018 backlog, $182.1 million was attributable to the Marine segment, while $173.2 million was attributable to the Concrete segment. The change in backlog is due to the timing and mix of project awards.\n\"During the first quarter, we bid on approximately $747 million and were successful on approximately $132 million,\" said Chris DeAlmeida, Orion Group Holding's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"This resulted in a 0.96 times book-to-bill ratio and a win rate of 17.7%. In the Marine segment, we bid on approximately $293 million during the first quarter 2018 and were successful on $68 million, which translated into a 1.08 times book-to-bill ratio and a win rate of 23.2%. The Concrete segment bid on approximately $453 million in work while being awarded approximately $64 million. This yielded a 0.86 times book-to-bill ratio and a win rate of 14.1%.\"\nBacklog consists of projects under contract that have either (a) not been started, or (b) are in progress and not yet complete, and the Company cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in its backlog will be realized, or, if realized, will result in earnings. Backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and execution of contracts. Given the typical duration of the Company's projects, which generally range from three to nine months, the Company's backlog at any point in time usually represents only a portion of the revenue it expects to realize during a twelve-month period.\nBusiness Sector Overviews\nThe infrastructure sector, which consists of the Marine segment, provides both public and private opportunities to maintain and expand marine facilities on and over U.S. waterways. The Company’s market fundamentals continue to provide good opportunities for future jobs. Specifically, expansion of private sector waterside facilities continues, with solid demand from private recreational customers, including bid opportunities for cruise infrastructure related to new destinations or refurbishment of existing facilities. Additionally, opportunities continue from a variety of governmental agencies.\nThe building sector, which consists of the Concrete segment, continues to see solid demand as its three major metropolitan markets continuously retain their positions as leading centers for population growth and business expansion. Population growth is driving new distribution centers, office expansion, retail and grocery establishments, multi-family housing units, educational facilities and medical facilities. In Houston, the Company continues to experience competitive pressure in the market, but expects to maintain market share. The Company continues to focus on expanding its market share in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, including adding structural opportunities. Finally, solid growth opportunities are expected in the Central Texas market as the Company continues to see fundamentally strong end market drivers.\nIn the industrial sector, the Company continues its greenfield expansion by combining talent and resources from the Marine segment and Concrete segment to execute and pursue concrete foundation work inside the industrial environment. Currently, the Company is executing two industrial related projects with several additional bids and bid opportunities developing. The Company continues to expect the massive, long-term petrochemical driven opportunities along the Gulf Coast to provide significant project opportunities with outpaced growth in the petrochemical industry.\nOutlook\n“We are pleased with the start to 2018 and remain comfortable with our 2018 outlook,” stated Mr. Stauffer. “As we look ahead, we expect to see continued strong demand for our services across the Company. We remain focused on delivering high quality projects to our customers with continued service expansion across our operating segments and areas. As a result, we expect bottom line improvement in 2018 with improved EBITDA margins, and expect this improvement to expand more significantly in 2019 and beyond as we continue to execute our strategy.”\nConference Call Details\nOrion Group Holdings will host a conference call to discuss results for the first quarter 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time/9:00 a.m. Central Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018.

The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. By reporting such non-GAAP financial information, the Company does not intend to give such information greater prominence than comparable and other GAAP financial information, which information is of equal or greater importance.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common stockholders or earnings per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share exclude certain items that management believes affect the comparability of operating results. The company believes these adjusted financial measures are a useful adjunct to earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP because management uses adjusted net income available to common stockholders to evaluate the company's operational trends and performance relative to other companies. Items excluded, generally are one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, any guidance provided by the company generally excludes information regarding these types of items.\nOrion Group Holdings defines EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA for the period by contract revenues for the period. The GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to EBITDA is net income, while the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to EBITDA margin is operating margin, which represents operating income divided by contract revenues. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are used internally to evaluate current operating expense, operating efficiency, and operating profitability on a variable cost basis, by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, and net interest and tax expenses. Additionally, EBITDA and EBITDA margin provide useful information regarding the Company's ability to meet future debt repayment requirements and working capital requirements while providing an overall evaluation of the Company's financial condition. In addition, EBITDA is used internally for incentive compensation purposes. The Company includes EBITDA and EBITDA margin to provide transparency to investors as they are commonly used by investors and others in assessing performance. EBITDA and EBITDA margin have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as a substitute for operating margin, net income, cash flows, or other data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe matters discussed in this press release may constitute or include projections or other within the meaning of the Private 1995, the provisions of which the Company is availing itself.
