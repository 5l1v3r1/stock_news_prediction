He gave up one run on seven hits while walking just one and striking out seven.\nA trio of relievers followed, including Shane Greene, who recorded his fifth save. Greene gave up three ninth-inning runs to the Rays in a 3-2 loss on Monday.\nMartin had two hits, as did Jeimer Candelario, who scored a run. Nicholas Castellanos added Detroit’s other RBI.\nChris Archer (2-2) was the hard-luck loser. He also lasted six innings, allowing two runs on six hits with a walk and six strikeouts.\nMatt Duffy drove in the only run for the Rays, who had won nine of their last 10.\nDetroit first baseman Miguel Cabrera sat out for the second straight game with a left bicep injury.\nThe Tigers broke through with a run in the third. Candelario reached on a two-out, infield single. Castellanos then ripped a double to left to bring in Candelario but was thrown out trying to advance to third.\nThe Rays threatend in the fourth with a pair of two-out singles. Boyd then finished the inning just like the previous three, recording a swinging strikeout, victimizing Mallex Smith on this occasion.\nTampa Bay tied it in the fourth. Adeiny Hechavarria smacked a one-out single and advanced to third on C.J. Cron’s soft single. Duffy recorded the RBI on a fielder’s choice grounder.\nThe Tigers came right back with a run in the bottom of the inning to take a 2-1 lead. James McCann led off with a single and advanced on Dixon Machado’s one-out single. Martin followed with a double to bring home McCann.\nDetroit left two runners stranded in scoring position in the eighth. It didn’t matter, as Greene retired the side in order in the ninth, including a pair of strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T16:02:49.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
