Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 barely budged.\nWall Street had wobbled on Wednesday as the threat of U.S. restrictions on Chinese telecom companies fuelled investor concerns about worsening trade relations.\nThe Dow ended down 0.72 percent. The S&P 500 also lost 0.72 percent and the Nasdaq 0.42 percent.\nThe Fed policy meeting ended with no change, as expected, while the central bank expressed confidence a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.\n“The statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,” said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke.\nYet the Fed also emphasised the inflation target was “symmetric”, suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans.\n“The Fed sees little reason to be concerned with inflation marginally above its 2.0 percent target, particularly after such a long period of underperformance,” Clarke said.\nWestpac, like the market, expects two more hikes this year.\nTRUMP TO END IRAN DEAL? The Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had wagered on and caused a dip in the dollar, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher while those in Europe and Japan lagged far behind.\nThe euro was last at $1.1979 having hit a 15-week trough at $1.1936 on Wednesday, uncomfortably close to the low for the year at $1.1915.\nThe dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05 overnight, before edging back to 109.66.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar index was trading at 92.542, after reaching the highest since late December at 92.834.\nIn the Treasury market, yields dipped slightly as a quarterly refunding programme of $73 billion came in short of expectations, reducing the pressure on prices from the torrent of supply.\nOil prices slipped on swelling U.S. crude inventories and as investors remained cautious ahead of the May 12 deadline for the U.S. to ratify the Iran nuclear deal.\nReuters reported President Donald Trump has all but decided to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord but exactly how he will do so remains unclear.\nBrent crude futures fell 16 cents to $73.20 a barrel, while U.S. crude dropped 9 cents to $67.84.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:26:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
