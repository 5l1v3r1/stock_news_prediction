But there’s reason to believe the declines are blips. The rate has dropped steadily since the recession and has bounced around the 62.0%-63.0% range since 2014. Analysts say the rate’s sideways movement signals a balance between the improving economy and retiring Americans. “As baby boomers move into retirement years, the percentage of the population above 65 is growing, and they are much less prone to work,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. This is “being almost exactly offset by cyclical tightening in the labor market.” To be sure, the rate for prime-age workers, 25-54-year-olds, also declined, but the “employment to population ratio of prime aged workers between 25-54 held steady at 79.2 percent which is a cyclical high,” RSM’s Chief Economist Joseph Brusuelas noted.

Analysts at Exane note that RBS’s major rivals, Lloyds Bank and Barclays, have increased their consumer-credit exposure by 25% over the same period, and have more than twice as much capital consumed by unsecured credit.
