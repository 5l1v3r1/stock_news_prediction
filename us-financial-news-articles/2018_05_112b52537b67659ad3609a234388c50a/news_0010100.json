REUTERS/Andres Stapff “We’re having some potentially fruitful discussions about an overall reduction in trade tensions,” Ross said in a CNBC interview. “I don’t think we have any intention to grant protracted extensions, that defeats the whole purpose.”\nU.S. President Donald Trump has invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China.\nIn March, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports. Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the EU, Australia and Argentina were granted temporary exemptions at that time.\nRelated Coverage White House says expects to complete tariff talks during 30-day exemption period U.S.-China trade dispute to be resolved by deal or tariffs: Ross Canada pushes for permanent tariff exemption; industry worried On Monday, hours before the exemptions were due to expire, the White House announced it would postpone tariffs on Canada, the EU and Mexico until June 1. Officials said Washington reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil.\nThe tariffs have increased frictions with U.S. trading partners and prompted several challenges before the World Trade Organization.\nBut countries granted exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs will still be subject to a quota system for imports, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Tuesday.\n“We will have quotas and other restrictions to make sure that we defend our industries in the interest of national security,” Navarro told steel industry executives, adding that the approach also would apply to entities “like Europe.”\nReporting by Lisa Lambert, David Lawder and Jason Lange; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T18:10:14.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
