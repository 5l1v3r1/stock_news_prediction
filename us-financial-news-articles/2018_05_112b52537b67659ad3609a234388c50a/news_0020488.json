However, major indexes have seen multiple dips into correction territory so far in 2018, and allocations to bonds have been rising as government yields have hit multiyear highs.\nLoeb's major funds at Third Point posted losses for the first quarter. The Offshore Fund lost 0.6 percent and the levered Ultra Fund was off 1.5 percent, according to a letter he sent last week to clients.\nThe firm posted an 18.1 percent return for 2017, which was below the S&P 500's total gain of 21.8 percent.\nIn addition, he disclosed during the conference call that the reinsurance company's portfolio was off 0.2 percent for the first quarter, actually outperforming the S&P 500 , which declined about 0.8 percent.\nHowever, he said an equity short allocation returned 2.4 percent, \"and we intend to further increase short exposure to fundamental single names and quantitative-derived baskets in 2018, and less on market hedges to dampen volatility and reduce net exposure.\"\nStock pickers such as Loeb generally like periods of market volatility as it presents pricing opportunities.\n\"Looking ahead, we still see S&P growth in the U.S. supported by fiscal stimulus in 2018,\" he said. \"We remain focused on maintaining a portfolio that can deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns across market cycles and will opportunistically adjust the portfolio across expected further waves of volatility.\"\nLoeb said the firm also is watching the economy \"to see if a recession, which we don't think is close, might be getting closer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:47:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
