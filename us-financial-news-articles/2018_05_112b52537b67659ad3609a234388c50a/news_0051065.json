South Africa’s rand , Russia’s rouble and Mexico’s peso all weakened 0.5 percent against a perky dollar.\nSentiment soured after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not pleased with recent trade talks between the Washington and Beijing.\nHis comments sparked fresh concerns about trade relations between the world’s top two economies after investors had taken heart from comments made over the weekend by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the “trade war” was “on hold”.\nMSCI’s emerging stocks index fell 0.6 percent with bourses in Russia, Turkey and central Europe tumbling more than 1 percent.\nStocks in Asia chalked up hefty losses, with Hong Kong’s index posting its biggest intraday fall in seven weeks and mainland China stocks closing 1.4 percent lower, pulled down by energy shares which slumped after Beijing intervened to cool the red-hot coal market.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see\nReporting and graphic by Karin Strohecker Additional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-23T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T12:39:55.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
