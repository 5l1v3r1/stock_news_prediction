His plea seemed to be falling on deaf ears.\nIn a dozen interviews, Banesco clients told Reuters they feared the government was expropriating the bank and that their money would disappear.\n“I’m taking cash out now. And I’ve been transferring to my other account, not at Banesco, just in case,” said Wilmer Sanchez, 47, who works as a security supervisor at a clinic, as he stood in a line of a dozen people.\n“This is malice. They’ve been wanting to take over Banesco for a while,” he said.\nREMITTANCES IN FOCUS The economic crisis prompted nearly a million Venezuelans to emigrate between 2015 and 2017, according to U.N. figures, as rising malnutrition and growing incidence of preventable diseases has left many believing they have no other choice.\nThat has turned remittances into a crucial lifeline for those who stay behind, given that salaried professionals rarely make more than several dollars per month.\n“They keep impoverishing us, and now they’re messing with what our children send us from abroad to live,” said Mireya Gomez, 71, a homemaker, at a Banesco branch in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz. Gomez has a son in Germany.\nEscotet said in his letter that of the 900 accounts that the government had reported as having suspicious activities, most held less than the equivalent of $1,000.\nHe suggested the move was meant to distract from an upcoming currency overhaul to remove 3 digits from prices and introduce a new set of bills - an effort economists say is unlikely to be completed by June as Maduro has promised.\nThe takeover comes after last month’s shock arrests of two Venezuelan executives working for U.S. oil major Chevron Corp\nMaduro has repeatedly balked at carrying out basic reforms that economists say would allow Venezuela’s economy to function again. Most agree that the most important measure is to lift exchange controls, which put state authorities at the center of legal foreign currency operations.\nHyperinflation has turned the country’s once-powerful banks into warehouses of useless cash that are worth a total of only $40 million, according to a Reuters analysis of regulatory data.
