REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen/File Photo Metro’s shares tumbled last month when it lowered its earnings and sales outlook, citing a poor performance at its Russian operations and the impact of the failure to reach a new wage agreement for employees at its Real hypermarkets.\nOn Tuesday, Metro reiterated the adjusted outlook it gave for the group’s fiscal year that runs to Sept. 31, but gave a more negative forecast for Russia, with sales “considerably below” the prior year and a “strong decrease” in earnings.\nShares in Metro were down 3.3 percent at 0921 GMT, the second-biggest faller on the German mid-cap index .MDAX.\n“Given ongoing uncertainties, and a particularly challenged third quarter, a discount valuation is likely to persist,” said Jefferies analyst James Grzinic, who rates the stock a “hold”.\nChief Executive Olaf Koch said he was optimistic that a new management team and pricing policy in Russia could turn the business around, predicting more pain in the third quarter of the fiscal year, but a recovery in the fourth.\n“We are convinced that with a refocused strategy, we will stabilize the country towards the end of the year,” Koch said.\nMetro wants its 91 Russian stores to target more independent traders, hotels and restaurants rather than competing for ordinary shoppers with the likes of X5 ( PJPq.L ) and Magnit ( MGNT.MM ), which are engaged in a fierce price war.\nTo that end, it is introducing a new “buy more, pay less” concept for about a third of the goods it sells, a strategy that helped revive sales in Romania and Ukraine, but that analysts said looks set to weigh on profitability.\nThe Russia business was long a major contributor to profits and Metro had planned to separately list the unit until the Ukraine crisis and sanctions on Moscow dampened the economy.\nMetro wants independent traders, hotels and restaurants to account for more than 60 percent of sales in the medium term, up from about 50 percent now, with Koch noting that the total market is worth about 90 billion euros ($107.30 billion).\nQuarterly sales for Russia fell 21 percent, while the unit’s earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) halved to 35 million euros.\nEarlier this month, Metro removed chief operating officer Pieter Boone, who was responsible for Russia. Koch set out other management changes in Russia, and said that Rafael Gasset, the new regional manager, has previously turned around the business in Poland and Romania.\nKoch said Russian stores trialling the new prices are already showing a 3-7 percent rise in sales, predicting that it will take four to five months to ramp up the new approach.\nMetro has also been hit by a wage dispute at its Real hypermarkets, although structural changes mean it should now be able to pay new hires less from the summer onwards, eventually leading to savings.\nReporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Louise Heavens\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
