Both were sentenced to probation and received industry bans.\nThe administrative law judge, Christopher McNeil, concluded that Jiampietro breached duties he owed to Goldman by ignoring “red flags” and failing to determine the confidential nature of documents originating from the Fed.\nIn Wednesday’s filing, Jiampietro’s lawyer Adam Ford said his client had no chance to properly defend himself after the Fed changed its theory on the case.\nFord said the Fed had abandoned its theory that Jiampietro directed Bansal’s theft, and had instead argued that he merely failed to detect it, yet deserved the same punishment.\n“The Reserve Board has a tremendous opportunity to fix a terrible injustice,” Ford said in an email.\nGoldman paid $86.3 million (£65 million) in penalties to the Fed and New York State’s Department of Financial Services in connection with the leaking. It fired Jiampietro and Bansal in 2014. Goldman, Bansal and Gross are not defendants in Wednesday’s lawsuit.\nThe case is Jiampietro v Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-04769.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T01:13:20.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
