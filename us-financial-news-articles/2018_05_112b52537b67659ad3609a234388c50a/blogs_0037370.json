Purdue in February announced a halt to its promotion of opioids to physicians after widespread criticism of the ways drugmakers market addictive painkillers.\nPurdue, based in Stamford, Connecticut, issued a statement in which it denied the accusations and that its drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and accounted for only 2 percent of all opioid prescriptions.\n\"We are disappointed that after months of good faith negotiations working toward a meaningful resolution to help these states address the opioid crisis, this group of attorneys general have unilaterally decided to pursue a costly and protracted litigation process,\" Purdue said.\nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, the last year for which data was available, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSeparate litigation involving at least 433 lawsuits by U.S. cities and counties has been consolidated in a federal court in Cleveland, Ohio. The defendants include opioid manufacturers Purdue Pharma LP, J&J, Teva, Endo International Plc and drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp.\nThe action accused the drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and drug distributors of ignoring indications that the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses.\nThe federal judge overseeing the consolidated litigation, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster, has been pushing for a global settlement and has invited state attorneys general with state court cases not before him to participate in those talks.\nDespite filing separate lawsuits, the six attorneys general on Tuesday said they would continue to engage in settlement discussions with Purdue and other companies.\n\"You always want to settle and prevent a prolonged litigation, but we're sending a message that we're fully prepared to go to war,\" Florida's Bondi said.\nWATCH: NH sues OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma show chapters New Hampshire sues OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma 6:34 PM ET Wed, 4 Oct 2017 | 00:48", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:52:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
