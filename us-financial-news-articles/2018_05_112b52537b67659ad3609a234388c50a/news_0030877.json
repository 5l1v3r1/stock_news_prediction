He blamed Tehran, which manoeuvred Maliki into power.\nOn that occasion, Tehran overplayed its hand.\nCritics said Maliki pursued a sectarian agenda which alienated Sunnis and created conditions which enabled Islamic State to seize one third of the country.\nBlocking Sadr would also carry grave risks. His campaign resonated with millions of impoverished Iraqis, especially in his strongholds in Baghdad and Shi’ite heartlands.\nSadr derives legitimacy from a dynasty of Shi’ite religious scholars. He made his name leading two violent uprisings against U.S. troops following the invasion in 2003, while in 2016, he mobilised tens of thousands of supporters to storm Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone.\nFILE PHOTO: Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr attends to cast his vote at a polling station during the parliamentary election in Najaf, Iraq May 12, 2018. REUTERS/Alaa al-Marjani/File Photo NO FOREIGN INTERFERENCE Lawmaker Dhiaa al-Asadi, who heads Sadr’s bloc in the outgoing parliament, said they would seek alliances to counter any Iranian interference in attempts to form a government, and ruled out deals with Amiri or Maliki.\n“We don’t conceal our fear that there will be some intervention and meddling either by internal or external powers, and Iran is one of them,” he said.\nHe hoped political leaders had learned not to let Iranian interference dictate the election’s outcome.\nAsadi said Sadr’s bloc would exert pressure through legal and democratic channels rather than in popular protests should Tehran try to influence the make-up of the government.\nThere is already bad blood between Sadr and Maliki, who as prime minister in 2008 cracked down on Sadr’s Mehdi Army militia in the southern city of Basra in a violent Shi’ite feud. More than 200 people were killed.\nSadr had pulled out of Maliki’s government the year before when the prime minister refused to set a deadline for U.S. troop withdrawals.\nRenad Mansour, research fellow at Chatham House, said Iran would try to maintain its influence by working behind the scenes though allies such as Maliki and Amiri.\nIran may rely more heavily on Amiri, who spent two decades in Iran in opposition to Saddam and speaks Farsi. Through his Badr organisation, he controls key positions in the interior ministry and security forces.\nSadr is likely to try and loosen the grip of Iran’s allies on the security services and other government institutions and seek a major government role.\nPortraying himself as an Iraqi nationalist, Sadr has long opposed foreign interference, whether by American invaders or Iranian proxies.\nStrife could be avoided if Sadr enters into an alliance with Iranian-backed parties which would offer him a cabinet post, former foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari said.\n“He might be given a major ministry, like interior or foreign, in return for stepping back. Sadr would meanwhile form an opposition bloc in parliament,” Zebari said.\nBut that seems unlikely and it is unclear how Sadr will use his election victory.\nAlways unpredictable, he opposed Iranian influence but went into self-imposed exile there. Then in 2003, he appeared out of the blue and assembled a militia to fight the Americans.\nSlideshow (3 Images) A Western diplomat described him as “very hard to read”.\nReporting by Michael Georgy and John Davison; Editing by Giles Elgood\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:38:02.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
