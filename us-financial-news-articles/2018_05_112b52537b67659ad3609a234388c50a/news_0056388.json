Saudi Arabia issued $11 billion of international bonds in April.\nRiyadh would need oil prices to average $85-$87 a barrel this year to balance its state budget, an International Monetary Fund official told Reuters this month.\nThe vast majority of the reserves are believed to be denominated in U.S. dollars. The April data showed the central bank boosting its deposits with banks abroad by $8.6 billion and its investment in foreign securities by $3.7 billion.\nThe data also showed Saudi bank lending to the private sector rising from a year earlier in April, by 0.7 percent, after falling for 13 straight months.\nIf it continues, the rebound in bank lending could indicate the beginning of a recovery in the economy, which has been slumping because of new taxes, fees and other government austerity measures designed to cut the budget deficit.
