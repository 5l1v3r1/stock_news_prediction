PAPERWORK\nDobbs and lawyer Peter Carter have hired 5 more lawyers to handle the paperwork disclosed by Lloyds, which has risen from an initial estimate of 50,000 documents to around 500,000, the source told Reuters.\nThe pair had been hoping to finish the review by the end of this year.\nThe work involves sifting through the documents to build a picture of what Lloyds’ senior executives knew about the fraud, what they did about it and when.\nLawmakers have in recent weeks increased scrutiny of Lloyds’ conduct in the years following the crisis, after the leak of an internal report, adding to gathering political concerns over the treatment of small and vulnerable business customers by banks including HBOS.\nThe Turnbull report, which was cited in Parliament by lawmakers, alleges that senior HBOS bankers tried to cover up the fraud and has prompted questions over who within Lloyds had seen it, given the bank said it knew nothing of the fraud until the criminal case last year.\nThe source familiar with the Dobbs review said the Turnbull report was one of the hundreds of thousands of documents received, and that efforts were now being made to establish in what context it was written, who was made aware of it and what was done about it.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority said in April last year it is conducting its own review into the discovery and reporting of the HBOS fraud, focused on the period before its acquisition by Lloyds, whereas the Dobbs review centres on the time afterwards.\nBritain’s National Crime Agency has also widened a review into the fraud at HBOS to look into allegations that fell outside of the initial criminal investigation.
