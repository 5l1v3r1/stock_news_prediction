the Iran nuclear deal is a worrying development that will also \"destroy U.S. credibility.\"\nIbrahim Kalin, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that the decision could lead to new tensions and clashes in the region.\nKalin said that \"our position is for this agreement to continue the way it is.\"\nHe added, however, that Turkey didn't want nuclear weapons in the region, saying

President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\nThe UAE says the agreement didn't guarantee Iran would refrain from pursuing a nuclear weapon in the future.\nBahrain, which

confront Iran's \"continuous attempts to spread terrorism in the region.\"\nSaudi Arabia— one of Iran's staunchest regional foes— earlier rushed to express its support for Trump's decision, saying

parties\" from making the Iran deal work.\n4:20 p.m.\nThe head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog says that Iran is fulfilling its commitments under the nuclear deal with world powers.\nIn a brief statement
