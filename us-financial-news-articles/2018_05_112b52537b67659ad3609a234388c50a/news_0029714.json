Gaining traction in the United States is crucial for Mercari’s global success, its chief executive told Reuters last month. [nL4N1RE09P]\nMercari’s U.S. business is headed by former Facebook Inc ( FB.O ) executive John Lagerling, who was hired last year. The app has been downloaded over 30 million times in the United States, versus 60 million in Japan.\nReporting by Chris Gallagher and Thomas Wilson; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:47:40.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
