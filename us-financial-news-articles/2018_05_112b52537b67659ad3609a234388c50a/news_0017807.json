It was the mine’s strongest quake going back to 1989.\nTwo miners were rescued on Saturday after the tremor caused part of the tunnel where they worked to collapse.\nPeople wait outside the JSW mine where coal miners are missing underground after a strong quake hit a mine in Jastrzebie Zdroj, Poland May 5, 2018.

Earlier estimates by state mining supervisor WUG put its magnitude at 3.4.\nThe two rescued miners were taken to a hospital in the city of Jastrzebie-Zdroj. They were in “relatively good condition” and could walk unaided, Ozon told reporters on Saturday.\nAbout 250 people were working in the mine at the time of the quake, JSW said. The missing miners were from a team of 11 that was drilling a new tunnel. Four escaped by themselves.\nRescue operations was hampered by high levels of methane, which reached a concentration of up to 58 percent.\nPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who reached the mine on Saturday evening, said the rescue operation was difficult and that he hoped the remaining miners would be saved. President Andrzej Duda reached the mine on Sunday noon.\nThe state mining supervisor said the quake was a type that can occur in coal mines deposits are removed.\nReporting by Marcin Goettig and Pawel Sobczak; editing by Adrian Croft, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-06T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:47:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
