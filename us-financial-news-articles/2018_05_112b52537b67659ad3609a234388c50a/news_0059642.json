The United States had wanted China’s trade surplus with America to shrink by $200 billion in two years, a figure seen as fanciful by most economists and trade experts.\nThere is room to increase exports to China by selling more agricultural commodities and energy products and China has agreed in principle to import more, but the two sides do not have a firm agreement.\nEconomists estimate that U.S. exports could rise by up to $90 billion over a period of years.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Doina Chiacu, David Chance and Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:11:37.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
