(TSX VENTURE:KALY) (OTCQB:KALTF) (the \" Company \" or \" Kalytera \") today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. (All dollars U.S. unless otherwise noted.)\nThe Company recorded a net loss of approximately $1.9 million ($0.01 per Common Share) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of approximately $1.6 million ($0.02 per Common Share) in the first quarter of 2017. The increase of approximately $295,000 in net loss was attributable mainly to an increase in research and development expenditures of approximately $883,000; an increase of approximately $4.2 million in the fair-value recognized for contingent liabilities related to the Company’s acquisition of Talent Biotechs, Ltd. in 2017; and an increase of approximately $210,000 in other financial expenses, offset by approximately $4.6 million of financial income recorded in the quarter in connection with equity and debt instruments issued to investors in December 2017; and a decrease of approximately $411,000 in general and administration expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased to approximately $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $404,000 in the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to an increase in subcontracted research and development costs; costs incurred relating to the advancement of the Company’s patented cannabidiol (\"CBD\") drug into a Phase 2 clinical study in prevention of graft versus host disease (\"GVHD\"); and the addition of research and development employees in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2018 to approximately $798,000 from approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to reductions in consulting and management fees, legal and professional expenses, office and other expenses and travel. These decreases resulted primarily from a change in the Company’s operations as the Company is relying less on external consultants and more on in-house personnel.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.9 million, which is sufficient to fund operating costs through year-end 2018. However, in order to fund other costs including the $4 million milestone payments currently due to former shareholders of Talent Biotechs, Ltd., the Company plans to raise additional capital to fund the milestone payments and its working capital requirements beyond year-end 2018, including expenses for the clinical development of its lead product program, CBD in the treatment and prevention of GVHD.\nAbout Kalytera Therapeutics\nKalytera Therapeutics, Inc. is pioneering the development of CBD therapeutics. Through its proven leadership, drug development expertise, and intellectual property portfolio, Kalytera seeks to establish a leading position in the development of CBD medicines for a range of important unmet medical needs, with an initial focus on GVHD and treatment of acute and chronic pain.\nWebsite Home: https://kalytera.co/ News and Insights: https://kalytera.co/news/ Investors: https://kalytera.co/investors/\nCautionary Statements\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThis press release may contain certain forward-looking information and statements (\"forward-looking information\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, that are not based on historical fact, including without limitation in respect of its product candidate pipeline, planned clinical trials, regulatory approval prospects, intellectual property objectives and other statements containing the words \"believes\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"intends\", \"will\", \"should\", \"expects\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"forecasts\" and other similar expressions.
