So much so that “Bird hunting” is now a thing (we don’t mean actually hunting down bird animals) and people are becoming wildly protective of their scooters.\nAs the hype builds, so does the capital.

The company had only raised little more than $11 million in venture funding from investors including Menlo Ventures, SOSV, and SineWave Ventures. It wouldn’t be a stretch to think that Jump will likely get into e-scooters as well.\nFlush with cash, below are the top e-scooter players competing for investor dollars.\nBird Total funding: $115 million , but it’s reportedly in the middle of raising another $200 million in new capital.\nInvestors include: Index Ventures, Tusk Ventures, Upfront Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Craft Ventures, Goldcrest Capital, and Lead Edge Capital.\nLimeBike Total funding: $132 million , but it’s reportedly in the middle of raising up to $500 million in new funding.\nInvestors include: Andreessen Horowitz, Fifth Wall Ventures, GGV Capital, Section 32, Rainbow Technologies, Coatue Management, IMO Ventures, DCM Ventures, Decent Capital, IDG Ventures, 7 Seas Ventures, and DHVC\nSpin Total funding: $8 million\nInvestors include: Grishin Robotics, CRCM Ventures, and Exponent\nSkip Total funding: $6 million\nInvestors include: Initialized Capital, SV Angel, A.Capital Ventures, and Fifty Years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:03:00.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
