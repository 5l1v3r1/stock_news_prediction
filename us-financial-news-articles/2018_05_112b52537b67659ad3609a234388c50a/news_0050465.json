We will continue to execute our strategies set for all three business lines to further solidify our industry leadership and achieve sustainable growth.\"\n\"Our first quarter results show a strong start to 2018 with loan originations increasing by 65% year-over-year, particularly the continuing momentum of our online channel business\" commented Mr. Dennis Cong, Chief Financial Officer of Yirendai. \"We have delivered a solid net revenue growth of 56% on a year-over-year basis amid a challenging regulatory and credit environment. With delinquency rates showing clear recovery and with our proven capabilities of customer acquisition and risk management, we believe that we are on a solid footing and well-positioned to capture the increased market opportunities during the industry consolidation period.\"\nAccounting Policy Change\nEffective January 1, 2018, Yirendai adopted the new revenue recognition policy, ASC 606- Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method in accordance with US GAAP. As a result of adopting ASC 606, the Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment of RMB1.7 billion to the opening balance of retained earnings. This adjustment primarily arose from the timing of revenue recognition for transaction fees that are collected on monthly basis, which under the new revenue standard are recognized at the time of billing instead of upon collection.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal amount of loans facilitated in the first quarter of 2018, was RMB11,956.7 million (US$1,906.2 million), increased by 65% from RMB7,246.1 million in the same period last year, reflecting strong demand for our products and services, especially from customers acquired from online channels. As of March 31, 2018, Yirendai had facilitated approximately RMB85.9 billion (US$13.7 billion) in loan principal since its inception.\nTotal net revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB1,592.7 million (US$253.9 million), increased by 56% from RMB1,021.6 million in the same period last year. The increase of total net revenue was mainly attributable to the growth of loan origination volume as well as the increase in the total asset under management.\nSales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB781.7 million (US$124.6 million), compared to RMB469.4 million in the same period last year. Sales and marketing expenses in the first quarter of 2018 accounted for 6.5% of amount of loans facilitated, and remained stable as compared to 6.5% in the same period last year.\nOrigination and servicing costs in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB142.7 million (US$22.8 million), compared to RMB58.8 million in the same period last year. Origination and servicing costs in the first quarter of 2018 accounted for 1.2% of amount of loans facilitated, increased from 0.8% in the same period last year mainly due to increased collection efforts this quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB338.0 million (US$53.9 million), compared to RMB100.5 million in the same period last year. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 accounted for 21.2% of total net revenue, compared to 9.8% in the same period last year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an expense of RMB209.4 million (US$33.4 million) related to the quality assurance program. Excluding an expense of RMB209.4 million related to the quality assurance program, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were RMB 128.6 million, or 8.1% of total net revenue.\nIncome tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB83.6 million (US$13.3 million). Since the first quarter of 2017, Yi Ren Heng Ye Technology Development (Beijing) Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, enjoyed a favorable enterprise income tax rate of 12.5% as a software enterprise which qualification was confirmed by local tax bureau in the third quarter of 2016. This makes it eligible for an exemption of enterprise income tax for 2015 and 2016 and a favorable enterprise income tax rate of 12.5% for 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB278.9 million (US$44.5 million), decreased by 21% from RMB350.9 million in the same period last year.\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB668.5 million (US$106.6 million), increased by 91% from RMB350.9 million in the same period last year. For the first quarter of 2018, the previously mentioned RMB1.7 billion adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings would positively impact net income by RMB389.6 million if ASC 606 was not adopted, generated from loans facilitated prior to 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB879.7 million (US$140.2 million), increased by 120% from RMB400.3 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin [1] (non-GAAP) in the first quarter of 2018 was 55.2%, compared to 39.2% in the same period last year. For the first quarter of 2018, adjusted EBITDA includes RMB519.4 million adjustment on pre-tax income earned from loans facilitated prior to 2018, if ASC 606 was not adopted.\n[1] Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenue.\nBasic income per ADS in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB4.60 (US$0.73), decreased from RMB5.87 in the same period last year.\nAdjusted basic income per ADS in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB11.02 (US$1.76). Adjusted basic income per ADS includes RMB389.6 adjustment on income earned from loans facilitated prior to 2018, if ASC 606 was not adopted.\nDiluted income per ADS in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB4.51 (US$0.72), decreased from RMB5.81 in the same period last year.\nAdjusted diluted income per ADS in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB10.80 (US$1.72). Adjusted diluted income per ADS includes RMB389.6 adjustment on income earned from loans facilitated prior to 2018, if ASC 606 was not adopted.\nNet cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was RMB337.7 million (US$53.8million), compared to net cash generated from operating activities of RMB564.5 million in the same period last year. The decrease in net cash generated from operating activities is mainly due to an increase in loans with a monthly fee collection schedule as well as increased payouts of principal and accrued interest on default loans from the quality assurance program this quarter.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents was RMB1,666.9 million (US$265.7 million), compared to RMB1,857.2 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, balance of held-to-maturity investments was RMB9.7 million (US$1.5 million), compared to RMB9.9 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, balance of available-for-sale investments was RMB990.9 million (US$158.0 million), compared to RMB969.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nQuality Assurance Program and Guarantee. As a result of the short-term volatility of borrower credit performance, in the first quarter of 2018, Yirendai accrued liabilities from quality assurance program and guarantee of RMB948.6 million (US$151.2 million), which is equal to approximately 11% of the loans facilitated through its marketplace covered by the quality assurance program during the period. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company released liabilities of RMB1,206.4 million (US$192.3 million) to pay out the outstanding principal and accrued interest of default loans. During the quarter, the Company recognized an additional contingent liability of RMB209.4 million (US$33.4 million) after evaluating future payouts. As of March 31, 2018, liabilities from quality assurance program and guarantee were RMB2,745.5 million (US$437.7 million).\nDelinquency rates. As of March 31, 2018, the delinquency rates for loans that are past due for 15-29 days, 30-59 days and 60-89 days were 0.8%, 1.6% and 1.3%, compared to 0.8%, 0.9% and 0.7%, as of December 31, 2017. The delinquency rates for loans that are past due for 30-89 days has increased as compared to prior quarter due to a short-term volatility of borrower credit performance since December 2017.\nCumulative M3+ net charge - off rates. As of March 31, 2018, the cumulative M3+ net charge-off rate for loans originated in 2015 was 9.7%, compared to 9.3% as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the cumulative M3+ net charge-off rate for loans originated in 2016 was 7.4%, compared to 5.9% as of December 31, 2017. As the 2015 and 2016 vintage loans continue to mature, the charge off level is broadly consistent with our risk performance expectation.\nOther Operating Metrics and Business Results\nAs of March 31, 2018, remaining principal of performing loans totaled RMB43.8 billion (US$7.0 billion), increased by 8% from RMB40.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 82% from RMB24.0 billion as of March 31, 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, Grade I, II, III, IV and V loans represented 8.8%, 25.4%, 25.5%, 28.1% and 12.2% of the Company's product portfolio, respectively.\nOther Developments\nChange in Quality Assurance Program\nTo ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, for loans facilitated subsequent to May 2018, they will no longer be covered by Yirendai's quality assurance program. Loans facilitated through Yirendai's online marketplace with a 12-month term and with an amount not exceeding RMB200,000 will be covered through PICC's surety insurance program. All other loans will be covered by third-party guarantee companies and the guarantee companies will charge borrowers a guarantee fee for the guarantee services.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on the information available as of the date of this press release, Yirendai provides the following outlook, which reflects the Company's current and preliminary view and is subject to change.\nFull year 2018\nTotal loans facilitated will be in the range of RMB48 billion to RMB52 billion.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses several non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted basic income per ADS and adjusted diluted income per ADS as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in our financial and operational decision-making. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Other companies, including peer companies in the industry, may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. See \"Operating Highlights and Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures\" at the end of this press release.\nCurrency Conversion\nThis announcement contains currency conversions of certain RMB amounts into US$ at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.
