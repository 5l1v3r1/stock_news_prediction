GOP candidates promised to repeal the ACA starting with its passage in 2010, but even with Republican control of Washington repeal fell short in the Senate.\nRelated Trump’s Plan to Cut Drug Prices Leaves Industry Relieved (May 11) Health Law Is Back as Campaign Issue—This Time for Democrats (May 11) Trump Administration Allows States to Narrow ACA Coverage (April 9) Republicans Who Opposed Obama’s Health Law Now Work to Keep Premiums Down (Feb.15) Red and Blue States Move Further Apart on Health Policy (Feb. 28) Some Republicans fear another contentious and possibly unsuccessful effort would muddy their message on health—that despite Democratic obstructionism in blocking repeal, the GOP has done its best to chip away at the ACA in smaller ways. Others say it is important to face voters having accomplished repeal, or at least having tried again, given that polls show many voters hold Republicans responsible for health care.\n“Democrats are using health care to beat Republicans, and we have nothing,” said former Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Rick Santorum, who is championing the effort. “The idea we can go into the election where we have some premiums going up 91%, and there’s something we could have done, is stupid politics.”\nA group of think tanks—including policy experts from the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, Galen Institute and Manhattan Institute—plan to release a proposal in June. Representatives of the organizations, who have formed a coalition called the Health Policy Consensus Group, have been meeting weekly, working with state officials and reaching out to groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The plan has support from the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. The White House didn’t return a message seeking comment.\nThe nascent proposal would end the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid and funnel money to states in the form of block grants. It would likely include some current ACA consumer protections, such as financial assistance to some people who can’t afford coverage, as well as an expansion of health savings accounts.\nRelated Video Republicans are scrambling to repeal and replace Obamacare with a new health care bill known as Graham-Cassidy.

Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R., La.), by the end of August.\n“I’m completely supportive of what the outside groups are doing. I will absolutely be a real champion to put that forward,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), adding that he has yet to see the groups’ proposal. “I think it’s about honoring our promise and fighting hard to do it.”\nMr. Graham is also continuing to pursue a repeal of the ACA, an effort parallel to the work of Mr. Santorum, said Kevin Bishop, a spokesman for Mr. Graham.\nIt is a formidable goal. Many Republicans facing tough re-election fights have sought to leave the failed repeal effort behind them, focusing instead on regulatory steps they say will chop away at the ACA and lower costs. Another repeal push, some said, could garble that message.\n“I don’t see how it would be positive,” said Rep. Ryan Costello (R., Pa.). “It would rile up the left, who’s tripled down on protecting all the positive elements of [the ACA], and it probably would be a reminder to those frustrated on the right that we didn’t get it done.”\nDemocrats face their own divisions over health care. Some Democratic candidates want to focus on fixing the ACA. Others advocate a new, sweeping single-payer system.\nSen. Patty Murray (D., Wash.) said voters oppose an ACA repeal and Republicans should let it drop. “I certainly hope Republicans don’t try yet again to jam legislation through Congress that raises families’ health costs, takes coverage away, guts Medicaid, and more,” she said. “Patients and families have been abundantly clear that they reject Republican attacks on their health care.”\nRepublicans’ previous repeal effort failed to garner enough votes in the Senate, and there is little to suggest the path would be easier now. Democrats have an additional senator with Doug Jones’s victory in Alabama, leaving the GOP with only a 51-49 edge, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is showing no interest in a new repeal battle so far.\n“We have a lot of work to do all summer, and the only way I would go back to an issue like that is if I thought we had the votes to actually make a law,” Mr. McConnell said. He wouldn’t want to repeat a failed effort earlier this year on immigration, he added, “where you just sort of grind up a whole week and at the end of it you haven’t done anything.”\nMr. Graham’s partner in sponsoring last year’s bill, Mr. Cassidy, agreed there is a long road ahead.\n“We don’t have the votes. Graham-Cassidy is dead,” said Mr. Cassidy, in a statement. “My focus is on developing new ideas to lower health care costs. I’ll be ready when the votes are there in support of making health care affordable again.”\nTo repeal the ACA with a simple majority—rather than the 60 votes usually needed for major legislation—Republicans would need to use a budget-related parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation, a move that itself could meet resistance.\nIn a further reflection of the divisions on the right, a second coalition of conservative groups released a statement this week suggesting Mr. Santorum’s plan was too centrist and proposing a fuller ACA repeal.\n“There is an enthusiasm out there with voters to do something on health care, but this is not it,” said Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, one of the groups. “We applaud Santorum, but there are concerns.”\n—Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:26:11.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
