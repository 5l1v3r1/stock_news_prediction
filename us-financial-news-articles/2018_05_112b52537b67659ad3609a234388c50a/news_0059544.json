Dr. Rafaeli has over 25 years of experience in the healthcare, medical device, consumer and industrial services fields. Prior to STRATA, he served as CEO of PhotoMedex, the company that founded the XTRAC business, and served on its Board from 2006 to 2017. It was under his leadership that PhotoMedex achieved sales growth from $19 million to over $300 million, driven by increases in brand portfolio, distribution channels and M&A transactions. During his tenure, the XTRAC business grew by 335%, and the XTRAC business gross margins grew from 39% to 68%.\nDr. Rafaeli stated, “I am thrilled to lead STRATA at this extraordinary time. The XTRAC device is a best-in-class UV technology for the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo and other skin conditions. Our business model is differentiated by a combination of clinical superiority, unique value-added services – including a direct-to-patient engine that accelerates awareness and drives consigned XTRAC device utilization – and a reimbursement support team that confirms insurance benefits, thereby expediting the patient experience.”\n“Our immediate priority is to execute a comprehensive turnaround strategy to restore the growth potential of the business. The initial steps will include: 1) rebuilding the XTRAC business’ value creation proposition for our physician partner accounts, 2) improving patient retention through improved clinical outcomes and protocol compliance, and 3) re-engaging our proven direct-to-consumer, end-to-end patient acquisition strategy to drive more patients into the dermatology practices,” Dr. Rafaeli added, “We believe that stricter adherence to protocol compliance will lead to better clinical outcomes for patients, resulting in a higher patient retention rate for physicians. We also believe that our Optimal Therapeutic Dose (OTD) technology for XTRAC, currently in development, will jump start adherence to the preferred protocol, once deployed.”\n“Our nationwide network of XTRAC partner clinics offers a significant opportunity to increase market penetration in psoriasis and to broaden our market penetration with other approved indications, including vitiligo and atopic dermatitis (eczema).” Dr. Rafaeli concluded, “Lastly, we are formulating a strategy that is expected to drive revenue growth outside the U.S., where we currently enjoy significant market penetration in such markets as China, South Korea and the Middle East, to name a few.”\nThe Company also announced the appointment of Matthew C. Hill as Chief Financial Officer, effective as of May 15, 2018. Mr. Hill brings to STRATA over two decades of experience in the medtech industry, having previously served as CFO of two publicly traded companies, Velcera, Inc. and EP Medystems Inc.\n“I am thrilled to join STRATA at this exciting time and believe that the Company’s portfolio of skin science technologies has enormous potential,” said Matthew Hill, STRATA’s Chief Financial Officer. “I look forward to growing with the Company and working with the management team to help STRATA become one of the leaders in the dermatology space.”\nConference Call & Webcast\nThe management of STRATA will hold a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, May 30, 2018 at 8:30 am Eastern Time to discuss the financing, the turnaround strategy, and the management and Board changes.
