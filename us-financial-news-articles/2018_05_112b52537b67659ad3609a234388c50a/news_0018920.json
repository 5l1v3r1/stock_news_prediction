Last month Chief Executive Tex Gunning said an IPO would not happen until after the summer.\nLeasePlan, valued at roughly 6 billion euros, was sold by Volkswagen in 2015 to a group of investors led by TDR Capital and Dutch pension fund PGGM.\nImpairments in the first quarter amounted to 30 million euros as LeasePlan had to take into account the steep depreciation of the Turkish lira and loss-making contracts in Germany.
