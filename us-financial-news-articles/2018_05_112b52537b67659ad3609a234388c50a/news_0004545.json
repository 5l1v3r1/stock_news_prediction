When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures and additional non-GAAP information included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nAdjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nTotal Revenues, less transaction- based expenses $ 1,225 $ 1,166 Operating Expenses 575 584 Less: Interactive Data transaction and integration costs 12 12 Less: Accruals relating to investigations and inquiries — 10 Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 69 65 Adjusted operating expenses $ 494 $ 497 Operating income $ 650 $ 582 Adjusted operating income $ 731 $ 669 Operating margin 53 % 50 % Adjusted operating margin 60 % 57 % Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet income attributable to ICE $ 464 $ 503 Add: Interactive Data transaction and integration costs 12 12 Add: Adjustment to reduce net gain on Trayport divestiture 1 — Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 69 65 Add: Accruals relating to investigations and inquiries — 10 Less: Cetip investment gain — (176 ) Add / (Less): Income tax effect for the above items (21 ) 28 Adjusted net income attributable to ICE $ 525 $ 442 Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE $ 0.79 $ 0.84 Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE $ 0.90 $ 0.74 About Intercontinental Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE) is a Fortune 500 and Fortune Future 50 company formed in the year 2000 to modernize markets.
