Working out.\nBillionaire and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson says that he routinely wakes up at 5 a.m. to be able to squeeze in some exercise.\n\"Getting up and at it early gives me time to get on top of things, and chart my day effectively,\" Branson writes in a blog post .\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also touts the value of physical fitness, and says, \"doing anything well requires energy,\" and notes that you have a lot more energy when you're fit.\nIn a 2015 Facebook Q&A, Zuckerberg shared a glimpse into his workout routine.\n\"I make sure I work out at least three times a week — usually first thing when I wake up. I also try to take my dog running whenever I can, which has the added bonus of being hilarious because that basically like seeing a mop run,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\nHaving a day off from work gives you plenty of time to hit the gym, park or an exercise class, and can prep you physically and mentally for the upcoming work week. show chapters 1:08 PM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 | 02:19\nMeal prep for the week ahead\nPreparing your meals for the week ahead is not only a way to ensure you'll max out your productivity at meal time, and it can also serve as a way to save some serious money. The average American household spend up to $3,008 per year on restaurant meals and takeout, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .\nInstead of forking over all that cash during the week on food, use your day off to whip up a few meals for the week ahead, whether it's a tasty, chicken tikka masala dish or a simple pasta bake .\nDecompress\nDon't forget to indulge in a little self-care with your day off! Wrapping up — or kicking off — your day off with some decompression time can boost your mood, ultimately leading to a more productive week. Take the time to do something that decompresses you, whether it's taking a bubble bath, cracking open a book or going for a walk.\nCEO of LinkedIn Jeff Weiner emphasizes the importance of \"scheduling nothing\" in a LinkedIn post .\n\"Use that buffer time to think big, catch up on the latest industry news, get out from under that pile of unread emails, or just take a walk,\" Weiner writes. \"Whatever you do, just make sure you make that time for yourself — everyday and in a systematic way — and don't leave unscheduled moments to chance. The buffer is the best investment you can make in yourself and the single most important productivity tool I use.\"\nMany successful leaders, including Oprah Winfrey and Arianna Huffington, also swear by meditation, which studies have shown can help ease psychological stresses such as anxiety, depression and pain.\n\"That outside world is constantly trying to convince you you're not enough,\" Winfrey writes in a blog post . \"But you don't have to take the bait. Meditation, in whatever form you choose, helps you resist.\"\nThis is an updated version of a previously published article .
