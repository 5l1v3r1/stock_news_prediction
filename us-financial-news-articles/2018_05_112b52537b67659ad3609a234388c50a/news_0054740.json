Matt Bertram said early Friday that police are seeking two men who entered the restaurant with their faces partially covered and allegedly detonated an explosive device around 10:30 p.m. before fleeing the scene.\nHe said police are pursuing the suspects and their motive remains unclear. “We’ve got nothing to indicate at this time that this was a terrorist attack,” Sgt. Bertram said.\nThe restaurant, the Bombay Bhel, is located in the city of Mississauga, west of Toronto.\nThe injured were taken to local hospitals, he said. Three people who were earlier in critical condition have been upgraded to stable, while most of the other 12 have been treated for minor injuries and released, he said.
