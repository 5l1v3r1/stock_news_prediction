Fish as Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Fish’s appointment follows Thomas D. Miller’s decision to retire from Quorum Health as President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company.\n“Since its spin-off in 2016, Quorum Health has made considerable progress to position itself for the future by addressing legacy challenges by among other things, divesting non-core assets to refine its portfolio and reduce debt,” said Terry Allison Rappuhn, Chair of the Quorum Health Board. “As Quorum Health continues to support hospitals and healthcare professionals to better serve patients and deliver quality care, we believe that now is the right time to transition leadership as we focus on strengthening our portfolio and driving operational excellence. With more than 30 years of industry and leadership experience, Bob has a deep understanding of hospitals and is uniquely positioned to help Quorum Health execute our strategy to refine our owned portfolio, while helping hospitals to improve margins and maintain focus on quality, service and community engagement. I have known Bob for more than 15 years and worked with him two previous times. He is a seasoned healthcare executive with a successful track record and the Board is confident that the Company will benefit greatly from having someone of his caliber as Interim CEO.”\nMs. Rappuhn continued, “On behalf of the Board and everyone at Quorum Health, I want to thank Tom and recognize him for his leadership and years of service during a challenging period for the Company following the spin-off from Community Health Systems. Throughout his career, Tom has demonstrated a passion for patient care, physician relationships and treating people the right way. He has much to be proud of, including helping to grow and expand networks and improving the health of the communities he served. We appreciate Tom’s dedication to Quorum Health’s employees and patients and we wish him all the best in the future.”\n“I have great respect for Quorum Health as a premier non-urban healthcare provider and for the important role it plays in supporting local hospitals that are often the sole or primary provider of healthcare services in their communities,” said Mr. Fish. “I look forward to working with the Board and management team as we empower healthcare professionals to serve patients and improve our operational execution to enhance shareholder value.”\n“It has been a privilege to lead Quorum and I am proud of all that we have accomplished since the spin-off,” said Mr. Miller. “Quorum has a deep bench of talented employees and I look forward to seeing what they can achieve as they continue the Company’s commitment to improving patient safety and quality of care.”\nAbout Robert H.
