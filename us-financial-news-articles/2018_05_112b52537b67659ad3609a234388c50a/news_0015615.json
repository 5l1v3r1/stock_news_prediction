It gave no reason why Fedorko, 73, was leaving the job.\nLimbaugh said last month on his radio show that he had received a special rush-hour police escort from Newark Liberty International Airport to a Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation gala in New York where Limbaugh was to speak.\n“So they sent the superintendent of the Port Authority to Newark to meet me for lights and sirens into Manhattan to make sure I got there in time,” Limbaugh said on his show.\nThe New York Daily News and CNBC reported that the Port Authority was carrying out an internal investigation of Limbaugh’s claims.\nFedorko could not immediately be reached through the Port Authority, and an agency spokesman was not available to comment on whether an internal investigation was underway.\nThe Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation’s website lists Fedorko, a former Marine, as a vice president.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey runs the region’s major airports, the tunnels and bridges to New York and its seaport.\nDeputy Superintendent Edward Cetnar will replace Fedorko as acting superintendent, the port authority statement said.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\nOur ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T06:04:43.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
