(TSX:MBX) (Microbix®), an innovator of biological products and technologies, reports financial results for its second quarter of fiscal 2018, the three-month period ending March 31, 2018 (“Q2”), with record sales and progress toward its operational goals.\nSecond Quarter Financial Results\nTotal Q2 revenue was $3,000,193, an increase of 13% compared to 2017 – on target with management’s goal of double-digit percentage sales growth. Revenues were dominated by antigen sales, but included a significant amount of laboratory proficiency-testing (quality assessment) product sales. Sales growth was driven by increased orders from longstanding customers, with growth across multiple antigen products.\nGross margin for Q2 was 38%, down from 53% in 2017, with the decline due to a recently-emerged yield-control issue with the conventionally-produced viral antigen intended to be replaced with bioreactor product now that upgrades to facilities are complete. While steps are being taken to correct the yield-control issue with the old process, still tighter controls will be implemented as most production of that antigen moves to bioreactors. Therefore the financial benefits of the move to bioreactors and of the reallocation of conventional antigen production capacity remained unrealized for Q2.\nBottom-line results showed a net comprehensive loss of $342,502 for Q2, as compared to an income of $257,649 in 2017. The Q2 loss was due largely to the aforementioned yield-control issue, which cost an estimated $353,000 in margin. A further one-time charge of $128,901 was recorded in Q2 relating to director compensation via warrant re-pricing – while that action reduced dilution, its charge had to be entirely expensed in Q2, versus spread-out over a vesting period as occurs for newly-issued options.\nSix Month Financial Results\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018 (“H1”), revenues were $5,885,760, up by 28% from 2017. H1 provided a net comprehensive loss of $436,630, compared to $2,958,822 in 2017, of which $2,541,066 was due to effects of a debt restructuring, legal settlement and tax asset revaluation. Net of those items, the loss for the first half of 2017 was $417,757. At the end of H1, Microbix’ current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was 1.5 and its debt to equity ratio (total debt over shareholders’ equity) was 0.47.\nCorporate Outlook\nWe continue to target double-digit sales growth over the balance of fiscal 2018 and through 2019. Microbix maintains a log of open purchase orders that, along with year-to-date results, supports meaningful sales growth. Efforts to improve gross margins and profitability are ongoing, with the goal of achieving successive quarterly improvements. Additionally, work continues with regards to securing partnership agreements to advance Microbix’ Kinlytic® urokinase and LumiSort™ cell-sorting projects.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS as at Mar.31, 2018\nas at Mar.31, 2017\nTotal Revenue $ 3,000,193 $ 2,646,649 Gross Margin 1,152,542 1,414,994 S,G&A Expenses 1,044,777 910,775 R&D Expense 243,514 172,624 Financial Expenses 206,753 223,946 Net Operating Income (Loss)\n(Before Debt Restructuring and Settlement Costs) (342,502 ) 107,649 Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities 465,068 143,721 Cash 91,904 32,817 Accounts receivable 888,290 1,324,816 Total current assets 5,842,983 5,639,137 Total assets 26,865,891 25,844,846 Total current liabilities 3,797,379 5,786,309 Total liabilities 8,555,785 10,255,564 Total shareholders' equity 18,310,106 15,589,282 Current ratio 1.54 0.97 Debt to equity ratio 0.47 0.66 About Microbix Biosystems Inc.\nMicrobix specializes in developing proprietary biological and technology solutions for human health and well-being.
