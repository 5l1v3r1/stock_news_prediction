The BoE decision is scheduled for 1100 GMT.\n“Bank of England is widely expected to leave policy unchanged on Thursday, with markets pricing minimal chance of a hike,” BNP analysts said.\n“We expect the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to continue to signal a bias to hike further, consistent with our view that the next hike will come in August of this year.”\nThe pound traded flat at $1.3545 versus the dollar and slipped 0.1 percent to 87.600 pence per euro against the single currency.
