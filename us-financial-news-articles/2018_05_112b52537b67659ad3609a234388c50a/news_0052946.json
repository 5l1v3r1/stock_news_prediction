A former economy minister has called him “suicidally anti-German”.\nIn his latest book he calls for a “plan B” to be drawn up to allow Italy to leave the euro zone with as little damage as possible should this prove necessary.\nPresident Mattarella has made it clear he does not want the powerful economy job to go to Savona, but the League and 5-Star have so far shown no sign of wanting to back down.\nBoth League leader Matteo Salvini and 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio look certain to enter the cabinet as interior minister and labour minister respectively.\nAn experienced diplomat was expected to be made foreign minister, but the final choice remained unclear, while security analyst Elisabetta Trenta was in pole position for the defence portfolio.\nConte was expected to present his cabinet list to the head of state later on Friday or on Saturday, opening the way for confidence votes in both houses of parliament next week.
