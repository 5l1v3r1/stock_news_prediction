ICL unit growth of 41% for the quarter included EVO Visian ICL growth greater than 50% in China, Korea and Japan, respectively, with additional key international markets growing in excess of 20 percent. Surgeons and their patients are increasingly relying upon our EVO Visian ICL as a premium and primary solution to achieve visual freedom. We believe our top line momentum can persist for the remainder of the year based on our Q1 results and performance indicators through the first several weeks of Q2. We are therefore raising our fiscal 2018 sales growth percentage target from low double digit to closer to twenty percent growth over 2017.”\n“We will continue to make investments in clinical studies, regulatory, commercial operations infrastructure and consumer outreach that will support the growth of our ICL family of products, such as our European multi-site EVO with EDOF presbyopia clinical trial where we are currently enrolling patients. Regarding the FDA, the re-inspection of our Monrovia facility in relation to the 2014 Warning Letter commenced on April 30 th . We will provide an update when appropriate, and permitted, after the inspection is completed,” added Ms. Mason.\nFinancial Overview – Q1 2018\nNet sales were $27.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 33% compared to $20.4 million reported in the prior year quarter. The sales increase was driven by ICL revenue and unit growth of 39% and 41%, respectively, and strong injector part sales.\nGross profit margin for the first quarter of 2018, was 71.7% compared to the prior year period of 71.6%. Exceptionally strong ICL/TICL sales and favorable IOL mix offset the negative impact to margins of increased injector part sales and higher unit costs.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $18.6 million compared to the prior year quarter of $16.7 million. General and administrative expenses were $6.2 million compared to the prior year quarter of $5.4 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increased headcount and compensation. Marketing and selling expenses were $7.4 million compared to the prior year quarter of $6.5 million. The increase in marketing and selling expenses was due to increased investments in digital and consumer marketing and commercial infrastructure. Research and development expenses were $5.0 million compared to the prior year quarter of $4.8 million. The increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in clinical expenses associated with our clinical trial for the next generation ICL with EDOF optic and increased development project spending, partially offset by decreased quality remediation expenses.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately $0.6 million or $0.01 per share compared with a net loss of $2.2 million or $0.05 per share for the prior year quarter. Adjusted Net Income for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.8 million or $0.04 per share, compared to an Adjusted Net Loss in the prior year quarter of $1.6 million or $0.04 per share. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in the financial tables included with this release.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at March 30, 2018 totaled $20.9 $18.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast today, Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern / 1:30 p.m. Pacific to discuss its financial results and operational progress. To access the conference call (Conference ID 4089747), please dial 855-765-5684 for domestic participants and 262-912-6252 for international participants. The live webcast can be accessed from the investor relations section of the STAAR website at www.staar.com .\nA taped replay of the conference call (Conference ID 4089747) will be available beginning approximately one hour after the call’s conclusion for seven days. This replay can be accessed by dialing 855-859-2056 for domestic callers and 404-537-3406 for international callers. An archived webcast will also be available at www.staar.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes supplemental non-GAAP financial information, which STAAR believes investors will find helpful in understanding its operating performance. “Adjusted Net Income (Loss)” and “Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share” exclude the following items that are included in “Net Income (Loss)” as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”): gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, stock-based compensation expenses, and quality remediation expenses. Management believes that “Adjusted Net Income (Loss)” and “Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share” are useful to investors in gauging the outcome of the key drivers of the business performance: the ability to increase sales revenue and our ability to increase profit margin by improving the mix of high value products while reducing the costs over which management has control. Management has excluded quality remediation expenses because their inclusion may mask underlying trends in our business performance.\nManagement has also excluded gains and losses on foreign currency transactions because of the significant fluctuations that can result from period to period as a result of market driven factors. Stock-based compensation expenses consist of expenses for stock options and restricted stock under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718. In calculating Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Per Share, STAAR excludes these expenses because they are non-cash expenses and because of the complexity and considerable judgment involved in calculating their values. In addition, these expenses tend to be driven by fluctuations in the price of our stock and not by the same factors that generally affect our other business expenses.\nAbout STAAR Surgical\nSTAAR, which has been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 30 years, designs, develops, manufactures and markets implantable lenses for the eye with companion delivery systems.
