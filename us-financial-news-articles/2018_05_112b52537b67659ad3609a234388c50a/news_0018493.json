Operating results were on target, occupancy was up year-over-year, with high resident retention resulting from Aimco focus on customer selection and satisfaction. Average monthly revenue per apartment home reached $2,052, up 7% year-over-year. And Aimco was recognized as a top workplace in Colorado for the sixth consecutive year.\n“Aimco agreed to $600 million in acquisitions: Bent Tree Apartments in Fairfax County, Virginia, and six properties in the Philadelphia area. Aimco plans to fund these acquisitions by the sale of its Asset Management business, the sale of Chestnut Hill Village and four Affordable properties, and issuance of OP Units at $53 per share.”\nChief Financial Officer Paul Beldin adds: “First quarter 2018 AFFO of $0.54 per share was $0.02 per share ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range and Pro forma FFO of $0.60 per share was $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of guidance. AFFO was ahead of the midpoint primarily due to stronger operations, including the contribution from Bent Tree, and the timing of capital projects moved to later in 2018. Aimco is updating its full year 2018 guidance to reflect both first quarter results and the effect of year-to-date transactions. We now expect AFFO to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 per share.”\nFinancial Results: First Quarter Pro forma FFO Up 3%; AFFO Up 6%\nFIRST QUARTER (all items per common share - diluted) 2018 2017 Variance Net income $ 0.52 $ 0.07 643 % Funds From Operations (FFO) / Pro forma Funds From Operations (Pro forma FFO) $ 0.60 $ 0.58 3 % Deduct Aimco share of Capital Replacements $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) (14 %) Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) $ 0.54 $ 0.51 6 % Net Income (per diluted common share) - Year-over-year, first quarter net income increased due to higher gains on the sale of apartment communities and a higher tax benefit resulting from an intercompany transfer of assets related to the Asset Management business.\nPro forma FFO (per diluted common share) - Aimco’s first quarter Pro forma FFO increased by $0.02 per share, or 3%, on a year-over-year basis. Property results contributed the following to Pro forma FFO:\n$0.02 from Same Store Property Net Operating Income growth of 2.7%, driven by a 2.6% increase in revenue, offset by a 2.1% increase in expenses; and $0.01 from leasing activity related to renovated homes at Redevelopment communities, the second quarter 2017 reacquisition of a 47% interest in the Palazzo communities, and the first quarter 2018 acquisition of Bent Tree Apartments, offset in part by lower Property Net Operating Income from apartment communities sold in 2018 and 2017.\nAs compared to 2017, higher legal costs and other factors reduced Pro forma FFO by $0.01.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations (per diluted common share) - The $0.02 increase year-over-year in Pro forma FFO per share plus $0.01 in lower capital replacement spending due to fewer apartment homes increased AFFO per share by $0.03, or 6%.\nOperating Results: First Quarter Same Store NOI Up 2.7%\nFIRST QUARTER Year-over-Year Sequential 2018 2017 Variance 4th Qtr.

Newly executed leases are classified either as a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or as a renewal. The table below details changes in new and renewal lease rates.\n2018 Jan Feb Mar 1st Qtr.

Aimco also undertakes ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly in connection with the redevelopment of an existing apartment community, or on a more limited basis, at a new location. Aimco invests to earn risk-adjusted returns in excess of those expected from the apartment communities sold in paired trades to fund the redevelopment and development. Of these two activities, Aimco favors redevelopment because it permits adjustment of the scope and timing of spending to align with changing market conditions and customer preferences.\nDuring the first quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development. In Center City, Philadelphia, Aimco continued construction on the fourth and final tower of Park Towne Place. Initial move-ins have occurred and at the end of April, 31% of the tower is pre-leased.\nConstruction is underway, on plan and on budget at Parc Mosaic, Aimco’s $117 million, 226 apartment home community being developed on the site of its former Eastpointe community in Boulder, Colorado. Aimco expects Parc Mosaic will be available for occupancy in the summer of 2019.\nDuring the first quarter, Aimco leased 59 apartment homes at its redevelopment communities. At March 31, 2018, Aimco’s exposure to lease-up at active redevelopment and development projects was approximately 527 apartment homes, of which 201 were in the fourth tower of Park Towne Place and 215 were being constructed at Parc Mosaic.\nPortfolio Management: Revenue Per Apartment Home Up 7% to $2,052\nAimco’s portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across “A,” “B” and “C+” price points, averaging “B/B+” in quality and is diversified across some of the largest markets in the U.S.\nAs part of its portfolio strategy, Aimco seeks to sell up to 10% of its portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, occasional developments, and selective acquisitions with projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, Aimco has significantly increased the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 2017 Variance Apartment Communities 134 141 (7 ) Apartment Homes 37,228 39,173 (1,945 ) Average Revenue per Apartment Home* $ 2,052 $ 1,922 7 % Portfolio Average Rents as a Percentage of Local Market Average Rents 113 % 112 % 1 % Percentage A (1Q 2018 Average Revenue per Apartment Home $2,736) 49 % 51 % (2 %) Percentage B (1Q 2018 Average Revenue per Apartment Home $1,797) 35 % 35 % — % Percentage C+ (1Q 2018 Average Revenue per Apartment Home $1,660) 16 % 14 % 2 % NOI Margin 71 % 71 % — % Free Cash Flow Margin 66 % 65 % 1 % *\nIn 2018, Aimco changed its presentation of revenues and expenses to reflect utilities costs net of amounts reimbursed by residents, which were previously included in revenue. 2017 amounts have been revised to conform to this presentation.\nFirst Quarter Real Estate Portfolio - For its entire portfolio, Aimco’s average monthly revenue per apartment home was $2,052 for first quarter 2018, a 7% increase compared to first quarter 2017. This increase is due to year-over-year growth in Same Store revenue as well as Aimco’s second quarter 2017 reacquisition of the 47% interest in the Palazzo communities, lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition properties, and the sale of apartment communities with average monthly revenues per apartment home lower than those of the retained portfolio.\nAcquisitions - Aimco evaluates potential acquisitions with an eye for unique and opportunistic investments and funds acquisitions pursuant to its strict paired trade discipline. As previously announced, subsequent to quarter end, Aimco entered into a transaction to acquire six apartment communities in the Philadelphia area for a purchase price of $445 million. The portfolio includes 1,006 existing apartment homes, 110 apartment homes under construction, and 185,000 square feet of office and retail space. This “A” quality portfolio is located primarily in the Center City and University City submarkets of Philadelphia. Aimco anticipates its operation of the five operating communities will generate a year one NOI yield of 5.3%, and for all six communities, average revenue per apartment home of $2,200 and a ten-year expected free cash flow internal rate of return of about 8%.\nThe $445 million acquisition will be funded initially through taking title subject to $290 million of non-recourse property debt, issuance of $90 million in Aimco Properties, L.P. OP Units valued in the transaction at their estimated net asset value of $53 per unit, and payment of $65 million in cash funded from bank borrowings. The ultimate paired trade funding includes the sale of Chestnut Hill Village, located in north Philadelphia, and the sale of the Asset Management business, described below.\nOn May 1, 2018, Aimco completed the acquisition of four of the six apartment communities including 665 apartment homes and 153,000 square feet of office and retail space. Aimco anticipates the acquisition of the fifth apartment community during the summer of 2018 and the acquisition of the final apartment community upon completion of construction, expected in the first half of 2019. Please refer to Addendum A following the release and before the supplemental schedules for additional information regarding the Philadelphia market and Aimco’s investments within the market.\nIn the first quarter, Aimco purchased for $160 million Bent Tree Apartments, a 748-apartment home community in Fairfax County, Virginia. Bent Tree is a “B” quality community located in a market Aimco knows well from its ownership of two nearby communities built by the same developer. Further, Aimco believes the same business plan used at these communities will produce greater than market rate NOI growth for Bent Tree. The community is expected to achieve a 5.6% year one NOI cap rate. Before consideration of capital enhancement opportunities, new lease rents are 4% higher than expiring leases, as compared to new lease rents that have decreased elsewhere in northern Virginia. Aimco funded the acquisition with bank borrowings pending the expected third quarter sale of the Asset Management business, described below.\nDispositions - In the first quarter, Aimco sold three apartment communities with 513 apartment homes for a gain of approximately $51 million, net of income tax, and gross proceeds of $72 million resulting in $65 million in net proceeds to Aimco. Two of these communities are located in southern Virginia and one is located in suburban Maryland. Proceeds from these sales were used to repay outstanding borrowings on Aimco’s revolving credit facility, effectively funding the equity portion of the Palazzo reacquisition as well as Aimco’s 2017 redevelopment and development activities.\nAt the end of the first quarter, Aimco completed the previously announced sale of its interests in the entities owning the La Jolla Cove property in settlement of legal actions filed in 2014 by a group of disappointed buyers who had hoped to acquire the property. Aimco provided seller financing with a stated value of $49 million and received net cash proceeds of approximately $5 million in the sale.\nAs previously announced, in April 2018, Aimco entered into a binding agreement to sell for $590 million its Asset Management business and the four Hunters Point affordable apartment communities. Aimco expects to close this transaction during the third quarter of 2018. After payment of closing costs and repayment of property level debt encumbering the Hunters Point apartment communities, the net proceeds to Aimco are expected to be approximately $512 million, which Aimco plans to use to: repay the borrowings on its credit facility used to fund the acquisition of Bent Tree Apartments and the acquisition of the apartment communities in the Philadelphia portfolio; reduce overall leverage; fund 2018 redevelopment; and redeem its Class A preferred stock, which is callable in second quarter 2019. Taken together, these transactions are expected to reduce Aimco’s AFFO by $0.03 per share and $0.04 per share in 2018 and 2019, respectively, before becoming accretive in 2021.\nBalance Sheet\nAimco Leverage\nAimco’s leverage strategy seeks to increase financial returns while using leverage with appropriate caution. Aimco limits risk through balance sheet structure, employing low leverage, primarily non-recourse and long-dated property debt; builds financial flexibility by maintaining ample unused and available credit as well as holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt; and uses partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk.\nNon-recourse Property Debt - During the first quarter, Aimco closed two non-recourse, fixed-rate property loans totaling $242 million. These loans have 10-year terms and a weighted average interest rate of 3.48%, 126 basis points above the corresponding treasury rates at the time of pricing. The net effect of 2018 fixed-rate property debt refinancing activities has been to lower Aimco’s weighted average fixed interest rate by nearly 10 basis points since December 31, 2017, to 4.55%, reducing prospective interest expense by more than $3 million.\nAimco also closed two non-recourse, variable-rate property loans totaling $119 million. These loans each have a five-year term and bear interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.25%. The five-year terms fill a hole in Aimco’s laddered maturities and, taken together with the planned repayment of the variable term loan, reduce Aimco exposure to increasing short-term interest rates to less than 7% of Aimco total leverage.\nAimco total leverage includes Aimco share of long-term, non-recourse, property debt encumbering apartment communities in its Real Estate portfolio, its term loan, outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and outstanding preferred equity. Aimco leverage excludes non-recourse property debt obligations of consolidated partnerships served by its Asset Management business.\nAS OF MARCH 31, 2018 $ in Millions Amount % of Total Weighted Avg.\nMaturity (Yrs.)\nAimco share of long-term, non-recourse property debt $ 3,710 87 % 7.4 Term loan 250 6 % 1.3 Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility 79 2 % 3.8 Preferred Equity* 226 5 % 40.0 Total leverage $ 4,265 100 % 8.7 Cash, restricted cash and investments in securitization trust assets (174 ) Net Leverage $ 4,091 *\nAimco’s Preferred Equity is perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, Aimco has computed the weighted average maturity of its total leverage assuming a 40-year maturity for its Preferred Equity.\nLeverage Ratios\nAimco target leverage ratios are Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA below 7.0x and Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends greater than 2.5x. Aimco calculates Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Interest Expense used in its leverage ratios based on current quarter amounts, annualized.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.8x Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA 7.2x Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense 3.6x Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends 3.2x Aimco’s leverage ratios have been calculated on a pro forma basis to reflect the acquisition of Bent Tree Apartments and the disposition of three apartment communities during the period as if the transactions had closed on January 1, 2018.\nFuture improvement in leverage metrics is expected from the repayment of bank borrowings and property level debt with the proceeds from Aimco’s expected third quarter sale of its Asset Management business and the Hunters Point communities. Aimco also expects to use the proceeds from this sale to redeem its Class A preferred stock, which is callable in second quarter 2019. Aimco expects its Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA ratios to decrease by the end of 2018 to 6.3x and 6.7x, respectively.\nLiquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, Aimco held cash and restricted cash of $91 million and had available capacity to borrow $509 million under its revolving credit facility, after consideration of outstanding borrowings of $79 million and $12 million of letters of credit backed by the facility. Aimco uses its credit facility primarily for working capital and other short-term purposes and to secure letters of credit.\nAimco also manages its financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating and holding apartment communities that are unencumbered by property debt. At March 31, 2018, Aimco held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $2.0 billion.\nDividend - As previously announced, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 6% compared to the dividends paid during 2017. This dividend is payable on May 31, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 18, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\n($ Amounts represent Aimco Share)\nYEAR-TO-DATE\nMARCH 31, 2018\nFULL YEAR 2018 PREVIOUS FULL YEAR\n2018\nNet Income per share $0.52 $4.05 to $4.55 $0.36 to $0.46 Pro forma FFO per share $0.60 $2.39 to $2.49 $2.42 to $2.52 AFFO per share $0.54 $2.08 to $2.18 $2.11 to $2.21 Select Components of FFO Same Store Operating Measures Revenue change compared to prior year 2.6% 2.10% to 3.10% 2.10% to 3.10% Expense change compared to prior year 2.1% 2.60% to 3.60% 2.60% to 3.60% NOI change compared to prior year 2.7% 1.70% to 3.10% 1.70% to 3.10% Other Earnings Asset Management Contribution $10M $22M to $24M $36M Tax Benefits $4M $16M to $18M $16M to $18M Offsite Costs Property management expenses $5M $20M $20M General and administrative expenses $11M $44M $44M Total Offsite Costs $16M $64M $64M Capital Investments Redevelopment/Development $47M $120M to $200M $120M to $200M Capital enhancements $19M $80M to $100M $80M to $100M Transactions Property dispositions $65M $790M to $870M $180M to $220M Property acquisitions [1] $160M $551M $0M Portfolio Quality Average revenue per apartment home [2] $2,052 ~$2,100 ~$2,100 Balance Sheet Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.8x ~6.3x ~6.5x Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA 7.2x ~6.7x ~6.9x [1] Aimco does not predict or guide to acquisitions.
