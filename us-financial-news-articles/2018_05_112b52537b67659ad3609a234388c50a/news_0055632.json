The wounded were taken to hospital, he said.\nWell-armed militia groups have repeatedly struck Banro’s operations in eastern Congo, which is home to dozens of such groups.\nFighting between the Congolese army and a local militia in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo forced Banro to suspend operations at the Namoya gold mine for a month and temporarily evacuate its staff in mid-2017.\nMilitias like the “Mai Mai,” who believe blessed water has magical properties like protecting fighters from bullets, have preyed on the population and exploited mineral resources since 2003, at the end of a regional war that killed millions.\nInsecurity has worsened across Congo since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired at the end of 2016.\nMilitiamen kidnapped five Namoya workers in March, and later released them. Three police officers were killed in a raid on Banro’s Twangiza gold mine in a neighboring province in February.\nReporting by Fiston Mahamba; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:53:21.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
