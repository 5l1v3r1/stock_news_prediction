Before the tour kicked off two weeks ago, Agroconsult had estimated 60.2 million tonnes for second-corn production.\nBrazil is expected to sell 28 million tonnes of corn this year in global markets, Agroconsult said. This compared with 29.2 million tonnes, according to data from national grain exporters group Anec.
