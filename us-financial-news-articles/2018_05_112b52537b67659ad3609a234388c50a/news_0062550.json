Ophir also suggested it was close to finding a new partner to replace Schlumberger.\n“Ophir has already held informal discussions with other, well-capitalised, potential partners for our Fortuna project,” it said. “Following (Golar’s) announcement ... we have now formalised discussions and are actively moving forward with them.”\nOphir replaced its chief executive, Nicholas Cooper, this month in a bid to get its strategy back on track. Its shares were down almost 10 percent at 56.9 pounds each at 1345 GMT while Golar’s shares fell 18 percent to $28.35.
