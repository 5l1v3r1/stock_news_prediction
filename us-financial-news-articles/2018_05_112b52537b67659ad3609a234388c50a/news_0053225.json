(\"GlobalLogic\" or the \"Company\") to Partners Group. The transaction, which values GlobalLogic at over $2 billion, represents a continuation of Siguler Guff's strong track record of investing in, managing and exiting industry-leading technology companies.\nIn January 2014, Siguler Guff invested $26 million in GlobalLogic through two affiliated funds that focus on technology and software investments in the emerging markets. Siguler Guff originally acquired an 8% stake in partnership with Apax Partners who purchased the remaining majority stake in the Company. In April 2017, Siguler Guff, alongside Apax Partners, sold approximately half of its stake in GlobalLogic to the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (\"CPPIB\").\nThe sale, also led by Apax Partners, values GlobalLogic at a total transaction value of approximately $2.1 billion. Inclusive of all prior transactions, GlobalLogic represents a 4.9x gross multiple of invested capital for Siguler Guff, with proceeds amounting to $126 million. Following the acquisition, Partners Group and CPPIB will become equal shareholders in the Company.\nDrew Guff, Managing Director and Founding Partner of Siguler Guff, commented, \"We are pleased to announce the sale of our stake in GlobalLogic to Partners Group.
