(Nasdaq:STDY), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug product candidates to treat orphan and high-value diseases with unmet parenteral delivery needs, today provided a corporate update and announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary Corporate Update:\nOn April 29, 2018, SteadyMed and United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR) entered into a definitive merger agreement under which United Therapeutics will acquire SteadyMed for $4.46 per share in cash at closing and an additional $2.63 per share in cash upon the achievement of a milestone related to the commercialization of Trevyent®. The transaction, including the $75 million in contingent consideration, is valued at $216 million.\nThe validation and verification work on our lead drug product candidate Trevyent®, , which is in development for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), is ongoing; the Trevyent NDA remains on track for resubmission to the FDA before the end of 2018.\nIn March 2018, SteadyMed received a notice of allowance for U.S. Patent Application No. 14/456,416. The patent provides broad coverage for our PatchPump Drug Delivery Device, including its ECell displacement generating battery and prefilled drug reservoir.\n“We are pleased that our progress towards NDA re-submission for Trevyent is on track for later this year,” said Jonathan Rigby, President and Chief Executive Officer of SteadyMed. “In addition, we believe that the proposed merger with United Therapeutics will help us realize our commitment to bring Trevyent to market to improve the lives of patients with PAH.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results Compared to First Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nSteadyMed recorded no licensing revenues in the first quarter of 2018, compared to revenues of $315,000 in the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter 2017, SteadyMed completed the recognition of revenue associated with the $3 million upfront payment received from Cardiome in 2015.\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, SteadyMed reported a net loss of $10.4 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.6 million, or $0.92 per share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The current quarter's calculation of loss per share is based on 26,572,719 weighted-average shares outstanding compared to 20,139,826 shares outstanding in the prior-year period.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $6.1 million, compared to $6.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative (G&A) expenses offset by decreases in research and development (R&D) expenses and sales and marketing (S&M) expenses.\nR&D expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.9 million, compared to $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily due to a decrease in use of sub-contractor services, and materials for Trevyent and our other development programs.\nG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.0 million, compared to $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to an increase in legal expenses related to the recently-announced merger agreement with United Therapeutics.\nS&M expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.1 million compared to $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in S&M was primarily due to decreases in consulting fees and salary expenses associated with the scaling back of the pre-commercialization plan for Trevyent in response to the refusal to file letter from the FDA for the Trevyent NDA.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded $4.2 million in financial expense, primarily as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in the April 2017 and August 2016 private placements compared to $12.7 million in financial expense for the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in the August 2016 private placement.\nAs of March 31, 2018, SteadyMed had cash and cash equivalents of $26.6 million.\nAbout SteadyMed\nSteadyMed Ltd. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of drug products to treat orphan and high value diseases with unmet parenteral delivery needs.
