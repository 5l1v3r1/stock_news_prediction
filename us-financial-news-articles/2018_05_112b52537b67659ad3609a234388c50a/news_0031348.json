In recent years, investors have voted to reject proposals to lower the threshold below 20 percent.\nDuring a wide ranging question-and-answer session, Dimon told shareholders the bank would review investments in private prisons and an oil drilling project in the Amazon rainforest.\nReporting By Elizabeth Dilts; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:20:43.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
