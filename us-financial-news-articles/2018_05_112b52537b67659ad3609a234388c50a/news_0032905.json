(WFCF) (OTCQB:WFCF), the most trusted resource for independent, third-party verification of food production practices in North America, today announced its 2018 first quarter financial results.\n“We are off to a solid start to 2018. We achieved growth in all revenue segments, and are particularly pleased with the performance of our SureHarvest unit, which generated a 71% year-over-year increase in revenue for the quarter,” said John Saunders, Chairman and CEO. “In what is traditionally one of our slower, off-season quarters for beef verification activity, we saw 9% overall growth in this segment, driven in part by an uptick in activity due to the recent re-opening of Chinese beef markets. Although the potential for tariffs on Chinese beef imports has created some uncertainty in this area, we saw steady growth in new customer wins for source and age verifications and are cautiously optimistic that the political issues will be resolved favorably. If that should not be the case, we are still confident in our ability to achieve year-over-year revenue growth.\n“In the meantime, we continue to benefit from industry tailwinds around food transparency and consumer preferences for knowing more about where their food comes from,” Saunders added. “Demand for Non-GMO Project and organic certifications, in particular, has been very strong and we continue to benefit from our bundling capabilities made possible by the diversity of our solutions mix. Looking forward, we expect to continue to add new solutions through internal development as well as selective M&A activity that can not only add new verification standards but can strengthen our technology portfolio as well.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nRevenue increased 18% in the first quarter of 2018 to $3.6 million from $3.1 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue mix included $2.8 million in verification and certification services revenue, up 9% year over year; product revenue of $353,900, up 45%; license, maintenance and support revenue of $287,400, up 168%; and software-related consulting services of $183,300, up 9%. The increase in verification, certification and product revenue was due to the addition of new customers and increased activity related to the re-opening of Chinese beef markets. Software license, maintenance, support and consulting revenue, all of which is generated by the Company’s SureHarvest subsidiary, increased 71% to $470,700 due primarily to an increase in billable hours.\nGross profit for the quarter increased 18% to $1.7 million from $1.5 million a year ago. Gross margin was 47.8%, up slightly from 47.6% in the same period last year. All revenue segments contributed positively to gross profit.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased to $1.7 million from $1.5 million last year. Approximately $57,000 of the increase was due to the write-off of a beneficial lease arrangement (included in depreciation and amortization expense) related to the Company’s 2012 acquisition of ICS. The balance was attributable to costs associated with office space expansion, personnel, and higher public company expenses, including compliance with the new revenue recognition accounting standard ASC 606 implemented in 2017.\nNet income attributable to Where Food Comes From, Inc. for the quarter declined to $35,500, or less than $0.01 per share, versus $115,400, or less than $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $355,000, down 19% from $436,900 in the same quarter last year.\nThe Company generated $1.3 million in net cash from operations for the quarter, up 65% year over year from $795,400.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance at March 31, 2018, increased 32% to $4.6 million from $3.4 million at 2017 year-end. Working capital was $3.8 million, up from $3.7 million at 2017 year-end.\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 10:00 a.m. Mountain Time.\nDial in:\nDomestic Toll Free: 1-877-407-8289\nInternational: 1-201-689-8341\nConference Code: 13679187\nPhone replay:\nA telephone replay of the conference call will be available through May 28, 2018, as follows:\nDomestic Toll Free: 1-877-660-6853\nInternational: 1-201-612-7415\nConference Code: 13679187\nAbout Where Food Comes From, Inc.\nWhere Food Comes From, Inc. is America’s trusted resource for third party verification of food production practices.

The term \"EBITDA\" refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings (net income or loss) plus or minus net interest plus taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing WFCF’s operating performance (as further described in the attached financial schedules). None of these non-GAAP financial measures are recognized terms under GAAP and do not purport to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or any other GAAP measure. We have reconciled Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income in the Consolidated Statements of Income table at the end of this release. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, based on current expectations, estimates and projections that are subject to risk. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and actual events could differ materially from the Company’s predictions. Important factors that could cause actual events to vary from predictions include those discussed in our SEC filings. Specifically, statements in this news release about industry leadership; adding new solutions through internal development and M&A activity; strengthening our technology portfolio; potential for a positive outcome to the Chinese beef tariff issue; expectations for continued revenue growth; and impact and efficacy of, the Company’s products and services on the marketplace, are forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of factors, including availability of capital, personnel and other resources; competition; governmental regulation of the agricultural industry; the market for beef and other commodities; and other factors.

The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of the Company's financial performance, but non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided herein.\nAll of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, etc.) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance (e.g., M&A costs, income taxes, gain on sale of investments, loss on disposal of assets, etc.). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the Company's operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect the Company's ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business.\nWe use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the Company's performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures.\nWhere Food Comes From, Inc.\nBalance Sheets\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n(Unaudited)\nASSETS Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,822,322 $ 2,705,778 Accounts receivable, net 1,523,334 1,898,749 Short-term investments 745,122 743,206 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 317,024 245,073 Total current assets 6,407,802 5,592,806 Property and equipment, net 1,140,332 1,068,087 Intangible and other assets, net 3,758,084 3,948,530 Goodwill 2,652,250 2,652,250 Deferred tax assets, net 125,622 79,622 Total assets $ 14,084,090 $ 13,341,295 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 459,020 $ 457,307 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 666,800 555,129 Customer deposits and deferred revenue 1,468,537 851,185 Current portion of notes payable 9,622 9,446 Current portion of capital lease obligations 7,577 7,527 Total current liabilities 2,611,556 1,880,594 Notes payable, net 39,964 42,452 Capital lease obligations, net of current portion 23,507 25,419 Lease incentive obligation 144,480 147,189 Total liabilities 2,819,507 2,095,654 Contingently redeemale non-controlling interest 1,559,969 1,574,765 Stockholders’ equity: Common stock 24,972 24,972 Additional paid-in capital 10,390,939 10,353,037 Treasury stock (764,178 ) (724,530 ) Retained earnings (accumulated deficit) 52,881 17,397 Total Equity 9,704,614 9,670,876 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 14,084,090 $ 13,341,295\nSource:Where Food Comes From", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7f212b5f-08eb-40e1-af7e-5bbd24a00240", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eaxfeRdR5X1Qt_Auts6L-K90wOvMeMw9bvBHhgE_GlzRyrZJ1bZkVTeNdnRLNA3PmS5JyHOPt1RLVeTXqzP5mw=="], "published": "2018-05-14T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T17:30:19.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
