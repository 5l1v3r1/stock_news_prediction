India is seen as an important retail battleground.\nSimon, speaking ahead of both Walmart's and Amazon's shareholder meetings this week, wondered about Walmart's \"expensive\" trip into e-commerce but at the same time applauded the company's commitment to online.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.\nBy signing up for newsletters, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .", "external_links": ["https://nbcuni.com/privacy/"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:29:41.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
