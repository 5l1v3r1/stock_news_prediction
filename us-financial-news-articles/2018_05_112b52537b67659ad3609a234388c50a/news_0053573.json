Tobia, Jr., one of the nominees of Sidus Investment Management LLC and BLR Partners LP. Mr. Tobia has not indicated whether he would accept such an appointment.\n“The Board is convinced that a costly and protracted contested election is not in the interest of our stockholders,” said Louis Graziadio, Executive Chairman of Acacia. “We have offered to put Mr. Tobia on the Board now in an effort to end the election contest. Unfortunately, Sidus and BLR have rejected our offer. However, we want our stockholders to know that we are happy to accept Mr. Tobia onto the Board and that it is our intention, if our candidates are elected at the annual meeting, to offer Mr. Tobia a seat on our Board. We hope Mr. Tobia will join the Board as we welcome stockholder input.”\nAcacia’s nominees, Mr. Graziadio and Mr. Walsh, are each large personal investors in Acacia, having purchased stock in the open market. Both are also extremely active in Acacia’s business, with Mr. Graziadio effectively serving as the Company’s chief executive and Mr. Walsh leading the Strategic Review Committee of the Board. Acacia’s Board unanimously nominated Mr. Graziadio and Mr. Walsh and believes their contributions to the Company and future opportunities, including investments and partnerships that are in the deal pipeline, are irreplaceable.\nStockholders are encouraged to read the Company’s complete proxy statement and to vote on the WHITE proxy card FOR nominees Louis Graziadio and Frank (Ted) Walsh.\nVOTE THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY\nGeorgeson\n1290 Avenue of the Americas, 9th Floor\nNew York, NY 10104\n(888) 566-8006 (Toll Free)\nMackenzie Partners, Inc.\n1407 Broadway - 27th Floor\nNew York, New York 10018\nproxy@mackenziepartners.com\nCall Collect: (212) 929-5500\nor\nToll-Free (800) 322-2885\nABOUT ACACIA RESEARCH CORPORATION\nFounded in 1993, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG) is an industry leader in patent licensing and partners with inventors and patent owners to unlock the financial value in their patented inventions.
