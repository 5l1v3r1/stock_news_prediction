(TSX-V:CBW) (\" Cannabis Wheaton \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has closed its previously announced acquisition (the “ Transaction ”) of all of the outstanding securities of Dosecann Inc. (“ Dosecann ”), a late-stage “Licensed Dealer” applicant pursuant to the Narcotic Control Regulations (the “ NCR ”).\nLocated in the biotech hub of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Dosecann is currently completing the buildout of a 42,000 square foot facility, purpose-built for the research, development, extraction, formulation, filling and packaging of cannabis-based products. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, Dosecann will leverage its state-of-the-art facility to begin developing a range of value added cannabis-based products for the Company and its streaming partners to ultimately be sold to medical cannabis patients and, upon approval, into the natural health product and adult-use cannabis markets.\nPursuant to the acquisition agreement dated April 3, 2018, the Company has acquired all of the outstanding securities of Dosecann (the “ Dosecann Securities ”) by way of a “three-cornered amalgamation” (the “ Acquisition ”) for an aggregate purchase price of up to $38,000,000, payable in common shares of the Company to the holders of the Dosecann Securities (the “ Consideration Shares ”), subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing time and performance-based milestones. As part of the Acquisition, all outstanding convertible securities of Dosecann have either been converted into Dosecann common shares and exchanged for Consideration Shares or have otherwise been exchanged for convertible securities of Cannabis Wheaton based on the exchange ratio used in the Acquisition.\nThe Company has issued 24,494,496 Consideration Shares at a deemed price of $1.47, of which 9,630,947 are subject to performance based milestone release. In addition, the Company has assumed the obligations of the existing Dosecann common share purchase warrants, resulting in the issuance of 5,071,248 common share purchase warrants in the capital of the Company (the “ Replacement Warrants ”). Each whole Replacement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of $0.962 until January 2020. As a result of the closing of the Transaction, Dosecann is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nUpon receipt of a Dealer’s Licence pursuant to the NCR, Dosecann will serve a critical role in the “mid-stream” segment of Cannabis Wheaton’s platform. Dosecann will be the Company’s primary facility for various value enhancing intellectual property related activities such as extraction, processing, branding and licensing, product development and manufacturing, research and development, and various international opportunities. The Company also intends to utilize the Dosecann facility for the commercialization of various cannabis products available under the Company’s recently announced license agreement with Dixie Brands, Inc., as permitted by applicable law.\nHugo Alves, President and Director of Cannabis Wheaton stated, “The addition of Dosecann to the Cannabis Wheaton platform provides us with a strategic regulatory tool that we believe will be increasingly important under the proposed Cannabis Act. We couldn’t be more excited to be working with the high caliber team Greg Boone has put together to develop Dosecann into a true ‘center of excellence’ in the creation of intellectual property, product development and commercialization. We believe the Dosecann team’s proven ability to take pharmaceutical, natural health products, and consumer packaged goods from conceptualization to commercialization will be of huge value to the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries and streaming partners as we enter the next leg of growth in the domestic and international markets for cannabis products.”\nGreg Boone, Founder and CEO of Dosecann commented, “The Dosecann team is delighted to partner with Cannabis Wheaton as we near the completion and licensing of our purpose-built facility. Given their in-depth industry knowledge and exceptionally strong management team, we believe Cannabis Wheaton is the perfect partner to bring Dosecann’s unique product formulations to market. We look forward to collaborating with Hugo and his team going forward.”\nDr. Christina Woollard, Dosecann’s Chief Science Officer states, “I joined Dosecann because I was confident that Dosecann would play a significant role in the Canadian cannabis industry. I have dedicated my career to the study and commercialization of patient focused medicines and I look forward to leveraging my 18 years of experience as the Head of Pharmaceutical Development for GW Pharmaceuticals to help Dosecann become the benchmark cannabis manufacturing and development facility in Canada.”\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\n\" Chuck Rifici \" Chairman & CEO\nAbout Cannabis Wheaton (TSX-V:CBW)\nCannabis Wheaton is a collective of entrepreneurs with a passion for the cannabis industry past, present and future.
