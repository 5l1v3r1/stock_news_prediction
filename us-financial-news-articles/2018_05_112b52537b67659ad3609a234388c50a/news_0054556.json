It said the jet crashed in an uninhabited area and no one was hurt on the ground.\nThe pilot and co-pilot of the twin-jet fighter were picked up and taken to the hospital for exams, as investigators inspected the crash site to find out what caused the accident, the Air Force said on Twitter.\nThe F-5 built by Northrop was first designed for use by the United States in the Korean war in the mid-1950s to face Russian Mig-15s. Brazil bought around 60 of the fighters in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe refurbished F-5s have been the mainstay of the Brazilian Air Force since it retired its Mirage 2000s in 2013. It has been awaiting delivery of 36 Gripens from Swedenâ€™s Saab AB.\nReporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier; Writing and additional reporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:00:06.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
