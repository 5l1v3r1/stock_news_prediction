This deal demonstrates how the use of distributed ledger (blockchain) can transform and digitalise the processes in this space,” he said in a statement.\nThe EUR/PLN FX Forward deal, which amounted to 500,000 euros with a one month tenor, was initiated by Thyssenkrupp on Wednesday using Commerzbank’s FX Live Trader platform.\nThe deal confirmation was sent to Thyssenkrupp directly via CORDA, a distributed ledger designed for finance by the R3 blockchain consortium.\nHowever, Commerzbank said in order for the full efficiency benefits of using blockchain to be realised, technical, regulatory and legal requirements need to be further developed.
