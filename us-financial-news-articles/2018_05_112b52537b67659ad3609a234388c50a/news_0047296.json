REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci The United States earlier in the day demanded Iran make sweeping changes - from dropping its nuclear program to pulling out of the Syrian civil war - or face sanctions as the Trump administration hardened its approach to Tehran.\n“From here I will actually travel to Washington to have a meeting with Secretary Pompeo, and take advantage of that meeting to talk about this,” Maas said in response to a question from a journalist about the Iran deal.\nMaas spoke to reporters in Buenos Aires at the end of a G20 meeting in the Argentine capital. He did not give a date for the meeting with Pompeo.\nEuropean powers want to keep the Iran deal alive without the United States, Maas said earlier this month.\n“We think that without this agreement we could run the risk that Iran could restart a nuclear program,” Maas said.\nReporting by Maximiliano Rizzi; Writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Bill Trott and Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:12:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
