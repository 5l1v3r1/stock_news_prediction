REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\nBut he said it was premature to debate when the BOJ could whittle down its massive stimulus programme, with inflation distant from its 2 percent target.\n“We will communicate specifics on how we plan to exit once inflation accelerates toward 2 percent and conditions for hitting our target gradually fall into place,” Kuroda told the upper house of parliament in a semi-annual testimony on Tuesday.\n“For now, we don’t think conditions are rife to consider specific timings for an exit,” he said. “The BOJ won’t end its ultra-easy policy before inflation reaches 2 percent.”\nThe BOJ has various tools to mop up excess funds and can learn from other central banks in seeking to smoothly dial back stimulus, Kuroda said.\nJapan’s core consumer price growth slowed in April for a second straight month, underscoring the view weak inflation will keep it from dialing back stimulus any time soon.\nBut central bank policymakers have begun brainstorming ways to edge away from crisis-era policy given the rising cost of prolonged easing, such as the pain ultra-low rates is inflicting on financial institutions, sources say.\nKuroda said that while the BOJ will “patiently maintain powerful” monetary easing, he was mindful of the need to take into account the side effects of its massive stimulus.\n“We will guide monetary policy taking into account its side effects such as its impact on financial institutions, particularly regional banks,” he said.
