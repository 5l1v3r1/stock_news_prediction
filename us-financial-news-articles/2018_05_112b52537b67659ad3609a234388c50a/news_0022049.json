American Public Education believes that the use of adjusted net income is useful because it allows investors to better compare results to prior year periods.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The principal limitation of adjusted net income is that it excludes expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded. In addition, non-GAAP measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses are excluded.\nAmerican Public Education is presenting adjusted net income in connection with its GAAP results and urges investors to review the reconciliation of adjusted net income to the comparable GAAP financial measures that is included in the tables following this press release (under the caption \"GAAP to Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation\") and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook:\nThe following statements are based on American Public Education's current expectations.
