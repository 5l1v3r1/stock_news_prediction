It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.\nMudslides in California, winter storms across the United States and an earthquake in Papua New Guinea contributed to $376 million worth of catastrophe losses in AIG’s general insurance business during the quarter.\nThose costs slashed the unit’s quarterly adjusted pretax income by more than half, to $510 million from $1.1 billion in the year-earlier period, and drove its expense and loss ratios higher.\nIn AIG’s life and retirement business, adjusted pretax income fell 1 percent to $892 million. The insurer attributed that decline to lower-yielding assets.\nThe results mark the end of three full quarters for AIG under Chief Executive Officer Brian Duppereault, who took charge of AIG last May, vowing to grow the company and boost revenues.\nHe has since been working to improve underwriting practices, increase AIG’s focus on technology and install new executives across the insurer to jumpstart profits. But his steps have yet to boost the bottom line, and AIG’s stock is down 10 percent since Duperreault’s arrival on May 14, 2017.\nIn after-hours trading, AIG shares were 1.9 percent lower at $53.82.
