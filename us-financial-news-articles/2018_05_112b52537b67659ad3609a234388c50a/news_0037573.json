Any company with less than that loses marks while any above that gains marks up to a target of 50 percent, which equates to a maximum score and is something only Renewables Infrastructure has so far attained.\nRounding out the 10 best-performing companies are Merlin Entertainments ( MERL.L ), Ascential ( ASCL.L ), N. Brown ( BWNG.L ), Next ( NXT.L ), Marks & Spencer ( MKS.L ), UBM ( UBM.L ), ASOS ( ASOS.L ), Shaftesbury ( SHB.L ) and Halfords ( HFD.L ), LGIM said.\n“There’s a growing body of evidence that helps support the notion that more diverse leadership teams and boards make better decisions and have higher long-term performance,” LGIM Chief Executive Mark Zinkula said.\nLGIM and others, including AXA Investment Managers, have said they will vote against the board of companies that perform poorly, backed by data that shows those with more female leaders perform better.\nA British government-backed report has set a target for women to make up at least a third of the board at each of Britain’s biggest companies by 2020.\nLGIM, the third biggest investor in the FTSE 350 .FTLC, said it would launch the fund with 50 million pounds ($67.47 million) of its own money and make it available to both retail and institutional investors.
