It also said it had a number of concerns over the transparency of the review process and whether players would be held to higher standards than those set out by the International Cricket Council.\n“We are concerned that our players may be subject to conditions which could be different from those that apply to players from other countries against which they play,” ACA president Greg Dyer said in a statement.\n“Changes to player behaviour, expectations or sanctions must be aligned with those which would be handed down to players on both sides of international cricket matches.”\nAustralia’s players have long prided themselves on playing aggressive cricket and often spoken of “pushing the line” of acceptable behaviour.\nFormer players and pundits, however, have criticised the team for relentless sledging of opponents and other boorish conduct on field.\nCA CEO James Sutherland, who has led the governing body since 2001, has faced calls to step down from his role for failing to improve the team’s standards of behaviour as the Australian public has grown increasingly uncomfortable with their conduct on the field.\n“I haven’t thought about (resigning as CEO) and I really see the responsibility I have to push through this and deal with the situation,” he told local radio station SEN on Tuesday.\n“This is an opportunity for the game to get better and it will be better through this.”\nSutherland also said that Warner, Smith and Bancroft could “absolutely” win their places back on the Australian team once they had done their time.\n“I think everyone deserves their chance and their own personal redemption story is very much in their own hands now,” he added.
