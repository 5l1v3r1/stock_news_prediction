Given the positive sentiment and the lack of liquidity, it doesn’t take much for the dollar to move higher,” said Valentin Marinov, Head of G10 FX Strategy at Credit Agricole.\nMarinov noted that price action later in the week when the Federal Reserve gives its monetary policy decision and crucial U.S. jobs data is published will be a better gauge of whether investors are prepared to push the dollar much higher.\nMost analysts had been negative on the dollar this year, predicting that a splurge in U.S. government borrowing and a U.S. administration keen on a weaker currency would dent the dollar at the same time as investors flocked back to the euro zone.\nMost still believe the dollar will weaken over the medium to long term, however, with the euro and yen seen as the main beneficiaries.\nBut the U.S. economy has shown signs of strength in 2018 few other developed economies can match while geopolitical tensions, including around a U.S.-China trade spat, have subsided in recent weeks to support the greenback.\n“The key U.S. dollar driver has been the divergence between economic data in the U.S. and the rest of the world, and U.S. data continues to look comparatively robust” Morgan Stanley said.\nWhile markets don’t expect a change in interest rates from the Fed at the conclusion of a meeting on Wednesday, analysts will be watching for any change in language.\nBNY Mellon strategists said that if the Fed drops any cautionary comments on its inflationary outlook, then it would signal a growing confidence among policymakers that inflation has firmed up enough for an increase in forecasts.\nBond markets are expecting roughly three rate hikes until the end of the year.\nMarkets are also focused on Friday’s April U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could provide further signs of strength.\nWith the dollar rallying, there were several casualties on Tuesday. The Swedish crown fell more than one percent to 8.8335, its lowest since May last year.\nThe crown is one of the worst performing major currencies in 2018 as investors bet the Riksbank will be one of the last central banks to rein in its stimulus.\nSterling also skidded more than half a percent, although most of the move was down to more weaker-than-expected economic news.\nThe dollar rose 0.2 percent to 109.575 yen, its highest since early February.\nThe New Zealand and Australian dollars also fell, the latter to $0.7507 and its weakest since Dec. 11.\nAdditional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO, Editing by Andrew Heavens, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-05-01T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:51:35.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
