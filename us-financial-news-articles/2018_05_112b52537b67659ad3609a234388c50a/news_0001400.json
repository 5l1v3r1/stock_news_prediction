(NASDAQ:DVCR), a premier provider of long-term care services, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOn April 26, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.055 per common share payable to shareholders of record as of June 30, 2018, to be paid on July 16, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nUnder the new Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 606, net revenue was $141.3 million in the first quarter of 2018. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was not restated. The first quarter of 2018 under legacy GAAP was $144.5 million, compared to $141.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $3.0 million or 2.1%.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $(0.1) million, or $(0.01) per share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.3 million, or $0.22 per share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe first quarter of 2017 included a non-recurring favorable outcome of $2.2 million related to an appeal of provider taxes. Absent that adjustment, EBITDA improved by $0.5 million and facility-level operating income improved by $0.4 million to $29.0 million, or 20.5% of revenue.\nSee below for a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.\nCEO Remarks\nCommenting on the results, Kelly Gill, Diversicare’s CEO, stated, “I am pleased with our first quarter 2018 results. Our skilled mix experienced positive tailwinds, increasing considerably to 16.1% from 14.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The center we acquired in the latter half of 2017 in Selma, Alabama has been fully integrated onto our platform and I am proud to report that it contributed $2.3 million of revenue during the quarter.\nMr. Gill continued, \"We continue to put an emphasis on our focus towards improving the care we provide and achieving industry-leading quality metrics and believe it is the best possible route to long-term success. I am extremely thankful for our dedicated team members leading the focus towards high quality results, which leads to the solid operational and financial results.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nThe following table summarizes key revenue and census statistics for continuing operations for each period:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Skilled nursing occupancy 79.9 % 80.1 % As a percent of total census: Medicare census 11.6 % 11.7 % Medicaid census 67.9 % 68.7 % Managed Care census 4.5 % 4.0 % As a percent of total revenues: Medicare revenues 26.4 % 26.9 % Medicaid revenues 50.7 % 51.5 % Managed Care revenues 8.4 % 7.6 % Average rate per day: Medicare $ 455.72 $ 451.26 Medicaid $ 176.78 $ 173.75 Managed Care $ 391.96 $ 381.54 Patient Revenues\nPatient revenues were $141.3 million and $141.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, a decrease of $(0.2) million. The following summarizes the revenue fluctuations attributable to our portfolio growth (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 As reported As adjusted to\nLegacy GAAP As reported Change Same-store revenue $ 138,938 $ 142,145 $ 141,500 $ 645 2017 acquisition revenue 2,347 2,347 — 2,347 Total revenue $ 141,285 $ 144,492 $ 141,500 $ 2,992 The difference between patient revenues for the first quarter of 2018 is due to the implementation of ASC 606. Refer to Note 4 \"Revenue Recognition\" to the interim consolidated financial statements.\nThe overall increase in revenues as adjusted to legacy GAAP of $3.0 million is primarily attributable to revenue contributions from the acquisition of the Park Place operations during the first quarter of 2018 of $2.3 million.\nOn a same-store center basis, the average Medicare and Medicaid rate per patient day for the first quarter of 2018 increased compared to the first quarter of 2017, resulting in increases in revenue of $0.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, or 0.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Our same-store Medicare, Medicaid and Private average daily census for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $0.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.4 million, or 1.7%, 1.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Conversely our Managed Care average daily census for the first quarter of 2018 increased $0.9 million or 9.9%.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense increased in the first quarter of 2018 to $112.3 million as compared to $110.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating expense increased as a percentage of revenue at 79.5% for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 78.2% for the first quarter of 2017. The following table summarizes the expense increases attributable to our portfolio growth (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 As reported As adjusted to\nLegacy GAAP As reported Change Same-store operating expense $ 110,709 $ 114,172 $ 110,667 $ 3,505 2017 acquisition expense 1,569 1,569 — 1,569 Total expense $ 112,278 $ 115,741 $ 110,667 $ 5,074 The overall increase in operating expense of $5.1 million is partially attributable to the acquisition of the Park Place operations during the first quarter of 2018 of $1.6 million.\nOn a same-store center basis, operating expenses slightly increased by $3.5 million, which is attributable to unfavorable variances in provider taxes and salaries and related taxes of $2.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The change in provider taxes is due to the $2.2 million refund from the state of Kentucky during the first quarter of 2017. Conversely our same-store health insurance costs decreased by $0.9 million in first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOne of the largest components of operating expenses is wages, which increased to $67.1 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $65.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, which, consistent with above, is due primarily to acquisition activity.\nLease expense in the first quarter of 2018 remained consisted with the first quarter of 2017 at $13.7 million.\nProfessional liability expense was $2.8 million and $2.7 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our cash expenditures for professional liability costs of continuing operations were $1.1 million and $2.1 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Professional liability expense and cash expenditures fluctuate from year to year based respectively on the results of our third-party professional liability actuarial studies and on the costs incurred in defending and settling existing claims. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion of the accrual for professional liability.\n expense was $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. expense decreased as a percentage of revenue from 6.3% in 2017 to 5.8% in 2018. The decrease in general and administrative expense is attributable to a decrease in corporate wages and payroll taxes by $0.9 million. The acquisition of 22 centers in the fourth quarter of 2016 resulted in an increase in salary expenses during the first quarter of 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was approximately $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.5 million in 2017. The increase in depreciation expense relates to the fixed asset acquisition of a center located in Selma, Alabama during the third quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense was $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the amendment of the term loan facility that occurred in June 2017.\nAs a result of the above, continuing operations reported a loss of $0.1 million before income taxes for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to income of $2.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The benefit for income taxes was $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, and the provision for income taxes was $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Both basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations were $0.01 for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to basic and diluted income per common share from continuing operations of $0.22 and $0.21, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.\nReceivables\nOur net receivables balance decreased $2.7 million to $62.2 million as of March 31, 2018, from $64.9 million as of December 31, 2017.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call has been scheduled for Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 4:00 P.M.

These non-GAAP measures are not measurements under GAAP. These measurements should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, hurricane costs, lease termination receipts, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, and gain on bargain purchase. We define Adjusted Net income (loss) as Net income (loss) adjusted for acquisition and disposition related costs, hurricane costs, lease termination receipts, gain on sale of unconsolidated center, gain on bargain purchase, tax impact related to those adjustments, and discontinued operations, net of tax. Funds Provided by Operations is defined as net income from operating activities adjusted for the cash effect of professional liability and other non-cash charges. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred tax benefit and other non-cash charges.\nOur measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net income (loss) are important performance measurements because they eliminate certain nonrecurring start-up losses and separation costs. Management believes that Funds Provided by Operations is an important performance measurement because it eliminates the effect of actuarial assumptions on our professional liability reserves, includes the cash effect of professional liability payments, and does not include the effects of deferred taxes and other non-cash items. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income (loss) and Funds Provided by Operations should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nDIVERSICARE HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC.\nSELECTED OPERATING STATISTICS\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 As of March 31, 2018\nOccupancy (Note 2) Region\n(Note 1) Licensed\nNursing\nBeds\nNote (4) Available\nNursing\nBeds\nNote (4) Skilled Nursing\nWeighted Average\nDaily Census Licensed\nNursing\nBeds Available\nNursing\nBeds Medicare\nUtilization 2018 Q1\nRevenue\n($ in millions) Medicare Room\nand Board\nRevenue PPD\n(Note 3) Medicaid Room\nand Board\nRevenue PPD\n(Note 3) Alabama 2,464 2,367 2,105 85.4 % 88.9 % 11.2 % $ 44.5 $ 438.26 $ 186.15 Kansas 464 462 400 86.3 % 86.6 % 12.3 % 7.8 445.41 169.62 Kentucky 1,285 1,291 1,125 87.6 % 87.1 % 13.3 % 26.3 476.02 186.70 Mississippi 1,039 978 890 85.7 % 91.0 % 14.1 % 19.1 429.13 188.04 Missouri 339 335 231 68.1 % 68.9 % 11.5 % 4.1 463.04 135.25 Ohio 403 392 349 86.7 % 89.1 % 13.1 % 8.9 494.80 185.82 Tennessee 617 546 441 71.4 % 80.7 % 13.3 % 9.2 444.31 183.12 Texas 1,845 1,613 1,215 65.8 % 75.3 % 7.6 % 21.4 494.64 148.58 Total 8,456 7,984 6,756 79.9 % 84.6 % 11.6 % $ 141.3 $ 455.72 $ 176.78\nNote 1: The Alabama region includes nursing centers in Alabama and Florida.
