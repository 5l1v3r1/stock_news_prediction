That was when Trump said he was ending a program to help the “Dreamers,” which former Democratic President Barack Obama created in 2012.\nFILE PHOTO: Protesters who call for an immigration bill addressing the so-called Dreamers, young adults who were brought to the United States as children, rally on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., December 20, 2017.
