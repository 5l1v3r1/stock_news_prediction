(OTCQX: WEYL) (\"Weyland \" or the \"Company\"), a provider of mobile business applications, provides an update on the Company’s recently announced spinoff of the eWallet business:\nManagement is currently finalizing an engagement letter with a ‘Big 5’ consulting firm to advise the Company on the spinoff and IPO structure as well as ongoing audit functions for the eWallet business. The eWallet business, operating in a ‘closed Beta’ environment from December 2017 to April 2018, was on an annual run-rate of US$5.0 million Gross Transaction Volume (“GTV”) with 15 sales people on staff and zero marketing and advertising expenditures. Recent hires have increased the current sales staff to 24 and our plan is to have 400 sales staff in place by year end 2018 with a targeted GTV of US$25-35 million run-rate. The 2019 goal is to have 1,000 sales staff and a target GTV of over US$80 million. The current funding environment in Southeast Asia has produced investment rounds for companies such as Go-Jek, Grab, SEA Ltd., and other technology centric companies valued at 1.2X GTV or higher. Recent M&A activity in the region has valued eWallet businesses as high as 1.8X GTV. It is the Company’s stated goal to take the eWallet business through the S-1 process and a subsequent IPO via a ‘fully-underwritten’ offering. For transparency in the interim the eWallet business will file public financials prior to the offering. As soon as practicably possible, the Company will designate a record date and ex-dividend date for the Spinoff of the eWallet business to shareholders of Weyland Tech.\nAbout Weyland Tech Inc.\nWeyland Tech's CreateApp platform is focused on the Asia markets.
