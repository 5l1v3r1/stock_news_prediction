Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo The report states league executives did not hold an official tally on the decision, which requires players, coaches and personnel on the field to stand when the national anthem is played. Instead, owners were polled to determine how they would vote.\nCommissioner Roger Goodell said owners unanimously approved the anthem policy, but at least one owner, Jed York of the San Francisco 49ers, abstained. ESPN reports Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis also abstained from voting.\nThe NFL declined to comment on the voting process when reached by ESPN.\nThe new policy has been divisive throughout the NFL since being announced Wednesday. Players claim they were not consulted and immediately threatened to challenge the policy. A terse statement from the NFL Players Association claimed the NFL and its owners went rogue in establishing anthem guidelines after an effort to work together with players.\n“Our union will review the new ‘policy’ and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,” the NFLPA statement read.\nThe policy change has also drawn attention outside of football. President Donald Trump said he believes the NFL is “doing the right thing” with the change while Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr on Thursday slammed it as “idiotic” and “typical of the NFL.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:48:40.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
