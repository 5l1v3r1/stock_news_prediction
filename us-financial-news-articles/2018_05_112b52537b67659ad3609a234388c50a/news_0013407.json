This thesis would indicate a rally back to the $57 range for the consumer staples ETF ( XLP ), or more than 10 percent higher from its current levels.\nOn Friday, the consumer staples sector showed signs of resurgence, with the XLP rallying more than 1.5 percent as the best performing sector for the day. The group failed to maintain those gains on Monday, even as the broader market moved higher.\nWorth counters, however, that the unusual speed of decline for the group is \"overdone,\" and Friday's bounce off a downward trend should set the group up for a bigger rebound.\nWorth also noted a rise in the U.S. dollar , warning that its recent strength has put pressure on the consumer-facing stocks that tend to have high international sale exposure. The dollar rallied to a four-month high on Monday, but Worth argues the greenback has gone too far too fast.\n\"I'm going to make a bet that we're going to turn down here and the dollar would be a tailwind for staples,\" he said.\nShares of the consumer staples ETF were trading fractionally lower Monday afternoon, around $49.50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T20:12:53.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
