We are proud to have delivered reliable, clean energy and more than $200 million in savings to our 189,000 customers,” said Lynn Jurich, Sunrun Chief Executive Officer and co-founder. “Sunrun is in the market leading position and is cash flow positive. We will use this athletic position to expand our service offerings and markets to improve the resiliency of our energy system and combat climate change.”\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2018, Sunrun adopted FASB’s new accounting standards for contracts with customers (“Topic 606”) and lease accounting rules (“ASC 842”), using retrospective methods. Adoption requires that prior financial results are recast to reflect the new standards. Unless otherwise specified, financial results for both the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017 are presented in this release under Topic 606 and ASC 842. The financial results for the first quarter of 2017 may differ from those previously reported.\nKey Operating Metrics\nIn the first quarter of 2018, MW deployed decreased to 68 MW from 73 MW in the first quarter of 2017, a 7% year-over-year decline.\nCreation Cost per watt was $3.51 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.38 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 4% year-over-year. The presentation of Creation Cost in the first quarter of 2017 remains as previously reported, as the new calculation methodology due to the adoption of the new accounting standards and the resulting recast financials would have resulted in immaterial changes in the Creation Cost for this period.\nNPV per watt in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.10 compared to $0.83 in the first quarter of 2017. NPV created in the first quarter of 2018 was $65 million, a 16% increase from $56 million in the first quarter of 2017. Project Value per watt was $4.61, compared to $4.21 in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross Earning Assets as of March 31, 2018 were $2.4 billion, up $467 million, or 24%, since March 31, 2017. Net Earning Assets as of March 31, 2018 were $1.3 billion, up $213 million, or 20% from the prior year.\nFinancing Activities\nAs of May 9, 2018, closed transactions and executed term sheets provide us expected tax equity capacity into the first quarter of 2019 and project debt capacity into the fourth quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 GAAP Results\nCustomer agreements and incentives revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $67.0 million. Solar energy systems and product sales increased 38% year-over-year to $77.4 million. Total revenue grew to $144.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, up $39.3 million, or 37% from the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal cost of revenue was $119.2 million, an increase of 29% year-over-year. Total operating expenses were $201.1 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year.\nNet income available to common stockholders was $28.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDiluted net earnings per share available to common shareholders was $0.25 per share.\nGuidance for Q2 and Full Year 2018\nThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.\nIn Q2, we expect to deploy approximately 88 MW, reflecting approximately 16% growth year-over-year.\nFor the full year 2018, we continue to expect deployments to grow 15% year-over-year.\nConference Call Information\nSunrun is hosting a conference call for analysts and investors to discuss its first quarter 2018 results and outlook for its second quarter 2018 at 2:30 p.m. Pacific Time today, May 9, 2018.

$ 0.83 NPV (in millions) (1) $ 65 $ 56\n(1) Numbers may not sum due to rounding.\n(2) Net Earning Assets for the period ending March 31, 2017 reflects changes owning to the adoption of new accounting standards.\n(3) Creation Cost for the period ending March 31, 2018 excludes two non-recurring items totaling approximately $7 million: charges related to establishing a reserve for litigation and an impairment of solar assets under construction by a channel partner that ceased operations.\n(4) The presentation of Creation Cost for periods commencing with March 31, 2018 reflects changes made to the calculation methodology owing to the adoption of new accounting standards. The presentation of Creation Cost for periods prior to March 31, 2018 remain as previously reported, as the new methodology and recast financials would have resulted in immaterial changes in the Creation Cost for such prior periods.\nDefinitions\nCreation Cost includes (i) certain installation and general and administrative costs after subtracting the gross margin on solar energy systems and product sales divided by watts deployed during the measurement period and (ii) certain sales and marketing expenses under new Customer Agreements, net of cancellations during the period divided by the related watts deployed.\nCustomers refers to all residential homeowners (i) who have executed a Customer Agreement or cash sales agreement with us and (ii) for whom we have internal confirmation that the applicable solar energy system has reached notice to proceed or “NTP”, net of cancellations.\nCustomer Agreements refers to, collectively, solar power purchase agreements and solar leases.\nGross Earning Assets represent the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 6%) we expect to receive during the initial 20-year term of our Customer Agreements for systems that have been deployed as of the measurement date, plus a discounted estimate of the value of the Customer Agreement renewal term or solar energy system purchase at the end of the initial term. Gross Earning Assets excludes estimated cash distributions to investors in consolidated joint ventures and estimated operating, maintenance and administrative expenses for systems deployed as of the measurement date. In calculating Gross Earning Assets, we deduct estimated cash distributions to our project equity financing providers. In calculating Gross Earning Assets, we do not deduct customer payments we are obligated to pass through to investors in pass-through financing obligations as these amounts are reflected on our balance sheet as long-term and short-term pass-through financing obligations, similar to the way that debt obligations are presented. In determining our finance strategy, we use pass-through financing obligations and long-term debt in an equivalent fashion as the schedule of payments of distributions to pass-through financing investors is more similar to the payment of interest to lenders than the internal rates of return (IRRs) paid to investors in other tax equity structures.\nGross Earning Assets Under Energy Contract represents the remaining net cash flows during the initial (typically 20 year) term of our Customer Agreements (less substantially all value from SRECs prior to July 1, 2015), for systems deployed as of the measurement date.\nGross Earning Assets Value of Purchase or Renewal is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for systems deployed as of the measurement date.\nMW Deployed represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements, for which we have (i) confirmation that the systems are installed on the roof, subject to final inspection or (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost.\nNet Earning Assets represents Gross Earning Assets less both project level debt and pass-through financing obligations, as of the same measurement date. Because estimated cash distributions to our project equity financing partners are deducted from Gross Earning Assets, a proportional share of the corresponding project level debt is deducted from Net Earning Assets.\nNPV equals Unlevered NPV multiplied by leased megawatts deployed in period.\nNTP or Notice to Proceed refers to our internal confirmation that a solar energy system has met our installation requirements for size, equipment and design.\nProject Value represents the value of upfront and future payments by customers, the benefits received from utility and state incentives, as well as the present value of net proceeds derived through investment funds. Specifically, Project Value is calculated as the sum of the following items (all measured on a per-watt basis with respect to megawatts deployed under Customer Agreements during the period): (i) estimated Gross Earning Assets, (ii) utility or upfront state incentives, (iii) upfront payments from customers for deposits and partial or full prepayments of amounts otherwise due under Customer Agreements and which are not already included in Gross Earning Assets and (iv) finance proceeds from tax equity investors, excluding cash true-up payments or the value of asset contributions in lieu of cash true-up payments made to investors. Project Value includes contracted SRECs for all periods after July 1, 2015.\nUnlevered NPV equals the difference between Project Value and estimated Creation Cost on a per watt basis.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nPatrick Jobin\nVice President, Finance & Investor Relations\ninvestors@sunrun.com\n(415) 510-4986\nMedia Contact:\nGeorgia Dempsey\nDirector of Corporate Communications\npress@sunrun.com\n(415) 518-9418\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/23775bc0-f6ef-443d-adb9-8e796f0ad138\nSource:Sunrun Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9bc194d3-c574-42a2-b8a7-73781d611479", "http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/23775bc0-f6ef-443d-adb9-8e796f0ad138", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=laNWOTlf7HZnKkm5Ar06PUeUU0DGqs-FDpsgGxJ36sn9dYkTd3vIUO-aPlInPuOechTke0iKBU1stQ8iuVCbdjnob3fJ6xrC6SygPe7cr5GQO6xoybHs3wYsdDdFanx5QVUFuAUgGf7ZMNLkRoDB8HGuhZh6O5ty-SqEXK2S4_AQRpmPvwMIFG6UBBfzD43-M-cbjONGg_kfVhM0Xl6WBNc6v-J1mNO5jXgK5fB2A3XlBNhI6tB8sDciFN9ZUgj0Xce6bGxGXEsYE6seSSmLbA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/23775bc0-f6ef-443d-adb9-8e796f0ad138/en"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:43:41.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
