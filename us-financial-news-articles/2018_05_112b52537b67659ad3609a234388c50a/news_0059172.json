REUTERS/Tony Gentile UNCERTAINTY On Tuesday, the prospect of a snap election - likely to lead to a eurosceptic government that could put Italy’s euro zone membership in question - hit Italian bonds, shares and pushed the euro to multi-month lows.\nA surprise breakthrough between the president and 5-Star/League would ease uncertainty but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro zone fiscal rules.\nBut even with uncertainty remaining, Italy’s government bond yields fell from multi-year highs on Wednesday and a smooth bond auction brought a degree of calm to a battered market.\n“We are not yet at the point where investors refuse to lend money to Italy,” said Roberto Coronado of PineBridge Investments.\nIn Germany, the euro zone’s largest economy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz played down the risk of the Italian crisis engulfing the currency area.\n“One can say that Europe is better prepared for difficult situations than before. What is more, I am firmly convinced that the majority of Italians have a very pro-European stance. It is a European nation,” he told Reuters.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Three officials at the European Central Bank told Reuters the ECB was not considering any intervention as indicators were not yet showing signs of stress among banks and the central bank did not have the tools or mandate to solve what they said was being treated as essentially a political crisis.\n Steve Scherer, Gavin Jones, Giselda Vagnoni, Steve Jewkes, Dhara Ranasinghe, Helen Reid, Sujata Rao, Marc Jones, Michael Nienaber and Antonio Denti; Writing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:34:48.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
