They became appointment viewing even though their games were almost never in doubt. They won more than any team in NBA history, but you didn’t watch to find out if they won. You watched to find out how they might win on that particular night. You watched in case Stephen Curry went off.\nRemember that Stephen Curry? The guy who went supernova on a nightly basis as he won the MVP and then won the MVP unanimously? That he was incredible was one of the world’s last universally agreed upon opinions. That’s how good he was: No one even bothered arguing otherwise. There was nothing as thrilling as the spectacle of peak Curry. He was, to put it simply, the most exciting thing in sports.\nUntil he wasn’t. The Warriors had their record-breaking 2016 season spoiled in epic fashion by the Cleveland Cavaliers. The best team ever had to get even better. They signed Kevin Durant, romped through the 2017 playoffs and got so good they could afford to blow off this entire regular season in sheer boredom. They are no longer irresistible. They are now an undeniably awesome basketball machine, but they’re not always worth staying up past your bedtime to watch.\nIt’s games like their 126-85 beatdown of the Houston Rockets on Sunday, though, that serve as a reminder of what the Warriors used to be and how they used to win. They now have a 2-1 lead in the Western Conference Finals before Game 4 on Tuesday night. And it’s because Curry went off in a very Curry way. He scored 30 points. He dared to take the shots that only he can make. He twisted his body in unnatural ways to finish around the rim. He shimmied. He screamed “this is my f—-ing house!” and then claimed afterward to have blacked out.\nWhat this one performance made clear is that Stephen Curry is still the most exciting thing in sports. And the Warriors are going to win their third title in four years if Curry keeps playing this way.\nStephen Curry takes a shot over the Rockets’ James Harden during Game 3. Photo: Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images It’s an easy thing to forget. Curry had another quietly brilliant season that was obscured partly because he was hurt and missed 31 games, but mostly because the Warriors don’t require Curry to shine like this every game. They have Durant. And Klay Thompson. And Draymond Green. That was the whole point of signing Durant to complement their existing pieces. Durant can do things that Curry and maybe every other player in the NBA simply can’t.\nBut he’s not Curry. To watch Durant is to expect him to score every time he shoots. To watch Curry is to be surprised, delighted and slightly mindblown that he scores any time he shoots all the while knowing that he’s the best shooter of all time. The big Durant games are methodical. A big Curry game is magical.\nFrom the Archives Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors have made more 3-point shots than any NBA team in history. Four plays illustrate how they pull off their game-changing 3-point strategy. Photo: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images (Originally published June 1, 2016) Sunday night was one of those classic big Curry games.\nFor one thing, it was defiant. Curry spent the interminable three days between playoff games being picked apart. He was 2-of-13 on threes. He was being targeted on defense by the Rockets, who did everything in their power to make sure Curry was the player on the other end of a James Harden isolation. He played so tentatively—so unlike Curry—that it seemed like he was still feeling the effects of his latest injury. He was asked to discuss his knee so much that his head began to hurt instead.\nIt was also unlikely. Curry started the game 1-of-7 on threes, including some that were so wide-open he could’ve shimmied for a few seconds even before shooting. The Rockets have been on the wrong side of enough Curry explosions, however, to sense that one was coming. “Sooner or later,” Houston coach Mike D’Antoni said, “he’s going to erupt.”\nStephen Curry went off in a very Stephen Curry way in Game 3. Photo: kyle terada/Reuters When he did—it turned out to be sooner—it came in a third-quarter burst. That, too, was quintessential Curry. “We’ve seen this so many times with Steph,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “All it takes is one.”\nEven the way that Curry went crazy and broke the game open was familiar to anyone who has seen him play during this Warriors dynasty run. The acrobatic layups to get him going. The deep 3-pointers and their perfect swishes. The sheer bravado of the whole thing. There is nothing about these Curry sequences that isn’t frightening: how quickly they happen, how dramatically they warp every game, how fruitlessly defenses attempt to stop them. It’s like taking an umbrella into a hurricane and hoping to stay dry.\nHere’s what happened in that one third-quarter run. There were enough highlights in this stretch to keep other players happy for an entire season:\n• 54-43, 11:47 left: Curry layup and the foul.\n• 59-43, 10:49 left: Curry layup.\n• 66-53, 6:13 left: Curry layup.\n• 68-56, 5:38 left: Curry layup.\n• 70-56, 5:07 left: Curry 30-footer.\n• 75-56, 4:02 left: Curry stepback, dancing, off-the-dribble 3-pointer.\n• 78-56, 3:29 left: Curry layup.\nThere was still more than a quarter of playoff basketball to be played between the two best teams in the NBA. But the game was already over. The Warriors were on their way to another blowout win in which they once again looked unbeatable.\nThat’s the thing about the full Curry experience. It’s the same old show every time. And yet it never gets old.\nMore on Warriors vs. Rockets The Rockets Have No Margin for Error Against the Warriors The Warriors and Rockets Are Not Who You Think How the Rockets Chased Value to Challenge the Warriors James Harden’s Stepback 3 Is a Step Ahead of the NBA It’s the NBA’s Worst Shot.
