Five separate federal agencies share responsibility for writing and enforcing it.\nCongress passed Dodd-Frank in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, placing stronger restrictions on bank activities in a bid to eliminate the need for future bailouts.\nThe Fed is expected to approve the proposed changes at the May 30 meeting. The public will be invited to weigh in on the proposals.\nRegulators are considering a range of changes aimed at making the rule simpler for banks. Among the most significant changes discussed is removing a requirement that banks prove their trading is permitted under the rule. Instead, the altered rule would place the burden on regulators to prove trading is prohibited.\nRegulators are also considering simplifying definitions central to the rule, such as what constitutes proprietary trading, and the treatment of overseas funds.\nThe Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have joint responsibility for enforcing the rule and broadly agree it could be simplified.
