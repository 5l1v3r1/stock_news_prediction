Bringing in coke from elsewhere could also add to pressure on the country’s rail system after China cracked down on diesel trucks carrying bulk commodities in many regions.\nIt is not known when the authorities will make a final decision, the official said.\nThe Jiangsu state planner did not respond to a request for comment.
