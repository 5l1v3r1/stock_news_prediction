FILE PHOTO: French President Emmanuel Macron attend a joint news conference with Switzerland's President at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, July 18, 2017. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has come under pressure from rights groups to scale back ties with a Saudi-led coalition that has intervened in Yemen’s civil war, where more than 10,000 people have been killed since 2015.\nDroit Solidarite, a legal NGO, and Aser, which specialises in armament issues, demanded in March that export licenses to Saudi Arabia and the UAE be withdrawn. They gave Prime Minister Edouard Philippe a two-month ultimatum.\nThey have had no response, so the groups said they would present a legal challenge on Monday to the Conseil d’Etat, France’s highest legal authority, which advises the government on legislative matters and arbitrates on public policy issues.\n“It will be up to (Council of State) to decide on the legality of the export licence authorisations issued by the prime minister,” ASER et Droit Solidarite said in a statement.\nThe two argue that France is violating national and international law by selling arms that are being used in the conflict in Yemen. The United Nations and rights groups accuse the coalition of targeting civilians, which amounts to a war crime, a charge the coalition denies.\nThe French government was not immediately available for comment.\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE are major purchasers of French arms, and the country’s top defence firms, such as Dassault ( AVMD.PA ) and Thales ( TCFP.PA ) have big contracts in the Gulf.\nThe Saudi-led coalition is fighting on the side of an internationally recognised Yemeni government against the Iran-aligned Houthi group.\nSince the war began, at least three million people have been displaced and Yemen has been plunged into a humanitarian disaster.\nUnlike many if its allies, in France - the world’s third-biggest arms exporter - export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances, and are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister.\nSome European states, including Germany, have curtailed links with the Saudi-led military coalition, though France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit.
