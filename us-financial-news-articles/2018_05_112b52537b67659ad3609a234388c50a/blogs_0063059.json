That gave Lopez Obrador more backing than his nearest two rivals combined.\nLopez Obrador, 64, was runner-up in the previous two elections, with fears that he could destabilize the economy contributing to his defeat. This time frustration over corruption, rising violence and tepid growth have all helped lift his bid.\nLopez Obrador's closest competitor is Ricardo Anaya, a former chairman of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), who is fronting a right-left coalition of parties.\nBernardo Montoya | Reuters Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto However, support for Anaya slipped 5 percentage points to 20 percent, in spite of the May 16 withdrawal from the race of former first lady and onetime PAN member Margarita Zavala.\n\"Anaya was expected to go up because of Margarita quitting, but it seems that the one who benefited was (Lopez Obrador),\" Parametria founder Francisco Abundis said.\nHolding steady at 14 percent support in third place was former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, the candidate of President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The law prevents Pena Nieto from running again.\nThe fourth candidate on the ticket, independent Jaime Rodriguez, dipped one point to 1 percent.

The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\nThe silver-haired Lopez Obrador has pledged to root out corruption and reduce violence, as well as re-invigorate the domestic economy and address chronic inequality if elected.\nHis room for maneuver as president will depend considerably on how much control his National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party can exercise in Congress.\nThe latest poll showed increasing support for MORENA, but it is unclear whether the party will have an outright majority. No party has held an absolute majority in Mexico since 1997.\nSupport for MORENA and its two main allies came to about 37 percent in the lower house and 39 percent in the Senate.
