(but) we’re not able to determine if this is already a trend,” Siemens Gamesa CFO Miguel Angel Lopez, told a conference call.\nMost recent rankings by consultancy firms GlobalData and MAKE show Siemens Gamesa claiming the top spot in terms of sold turbine capacity last year, overtaking Vestas in a race to cater the competitive wind power sector.\nVestas is still a market leader in terms of total installed capacity, said Vestas citing MAKE.\nSiemens Gamesa, which counts Spanish energy group Iberdrola among its key shareholders, kept its target for an EBIT margin of 7-8 percent this year.\nVestas still targets an EBIT margin of 9-11 percent this year.\nSiemens Gamesa in February unveiled 2 billion euros in cost cuts by 2020 to close a margin gap to Vestas, both facing margin pressure as government cuts support for renewables to force them into competition with conventional energy sources.\nSiemens Gamesa more than doubled its quarterly order intake to 2.5 GW, while Vestas order intake came in at 1.6 GW.\n($1 = 0.8355 euros) ($1 = 0.8360 euros)\nReporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen, Paul Day and Jose Elias Rodriguez in Madrif; additional reporting by Chris Steitz in Frankfurt; Editing by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen/David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:14:43.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
