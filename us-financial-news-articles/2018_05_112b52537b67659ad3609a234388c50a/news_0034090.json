The funds raised through the S3 filing may be used for equipment to support long-term customer agreements, future expansion and acquisitions. We believe the registration statement will provide increased financial flexibility and streamline the offering process,” said Ed Smith, president and CEO of SMTC.\nThe registration statement, when declared effective by the SEC, will allow SMTC to issue various types of equity securities, including common stock, preferred stock, warrants to purchase common or preferred stock, subscription rights for our existing stockholders to purchase common stock or preferred stock, and/or units to purchase a combination of such securities, from time to time, up to an aggregate amount of $10 million.\nSMTC may after the shelf registration statement becomes effective offer and sell such securities through one or more methods of distribution including a potential rights offering, subject to market conditions, SMTC’s capital needs and the limitation of Form S-3 that restricts SMTC from selling securities in a primary public offering with a value exceeding more than one-third of our aggregate common stock public float in any 12‑month period.\nThe terms of any offering under the shelf registration statement will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to completion of the offering. The shelf registration statement does not cover offerings of currently outstanding securities held by Company stockholders.\nThese securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Any offering of the securities covered under the shelf registration statement will be made solely by means of a prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement relating to that offer.\nForward-Looking Statements\nExcept for the factual statements made herein, the information contained in this press release consists of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding the company’s growth strategy, impact of the filing of a Form S-3 shelf registration on SMTC’s financial flexibility and access to capital markets. The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, including those risk factors set forth in SMTC’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other factors detailed from time to time in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
