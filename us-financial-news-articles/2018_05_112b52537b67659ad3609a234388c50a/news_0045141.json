One in four staff at the chain is homeless, and customers can pay for meals that homeless people can claim later.\nIt distributed nearly 100,000 items of food last year and engages with more than 300 homeless people per week.\nLast year the Scottish government pledged 50 million pounds ($67.53 million) to fund homelessness prevention schemes over the next five years.\nThe village will be operated in conjuction with Scottish homeless charity Cyrenians, which is assessing applications for residents.\n“The mark of any society is how you look after those who are most excluded. This village says an extraordinary thing about how we all want the world to be,” said Cyrenians chief executive Euan Aitken in a speech marking the opening of the village.\n$1 = 0.7405 pounds Reporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Claire Cozens.
