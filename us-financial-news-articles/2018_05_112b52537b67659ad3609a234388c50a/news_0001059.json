(RUS - TSX) announces financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n$\n931\n$\n804\nEBIT 1\n$\n61\n$\n48\nNet Income\n$\n38\n$\n30\nEarnings per Share\n$\n0.62\n$\n0.48\nFree Cash Flow 1\n$\n60\n$\n51\nDividends paid per common share\n$\n0.38\n$\n0.38\nAll amounts are reported in millions of Canadian dollars except per share figures,\nwhich are in Canadian dollars\n1 EBIT and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. EBIT represents earnings\nbefore interest, finance expense and taxes. Free cash flow represents cash from\noperating activities before change in working capital less capital expenditures.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, we reported net income of $38 million or $0.62 per share on increased revenues of $931 million compared to net income of $30 million or $0.48 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Higher steel prices and volumes led to higher gross margin dollars. This growth, along with our operating efficiencies, led to improved operating profits in all of our segments.\nFirst quarter revenues in our metals service centers increased 18% to $455 million compared to the same period in 2017 as same store tons shipped were approximately 7% higher. The average selling price improved 8% over first quarter 2017 and 5% over 2017 fourth quarter due to steel price increases and continued growth in value-added processing. Gross margins were 22.1% compared to 22.4% in the same quarter last year. Operating profits in this segment increased by $7 million to $29 million from $22 million and, as a percentage of revenues, increased to 6.3% compared to 5.6% in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues in our energy products segment increased 13% to $382 million compared to $339 million in the 2017 first quarter due to increased valves and fittings revenues at our North American field stores, increased line pipe activity and improved pipe prices. Drilling activity in Canada was slightly lower than the 2017 first quarter which impacted our Canadian downhole operations. Gross margins were 19.3% compared to 17.3% for the 2017 first quarter due to rising prices and product mix. Operating profits as a percentage of revenues were 8.5% compared to 7.0% in first quarter 2017. Segment operating profits of $32 million improved substantially compared to $24 million in the same quarter last year.\nRevenues in our steel distributors segment increased by 21% to $94 million in the 2018 first quarter compared to first quarter of 2017 reflecting higher North American steel prices and stronger demand in the Canadian operation. Gross margins were 21.6% in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Segment operating profits increased to $11 million from $8 million in 2017 as operating profits as a percentage of revenues rose to 11.4% compared to 10.8% in the first quarter of 2017.\nMr. John G. Reid, President and COO, commented, \"Steel prices continued to improve throughout the quarter benefiting our metals service centers and steel distributors which also enjoyed improved demand. Details of the 232 trade actions in the U.S. are coming into focus around exemptions and quota announcements that to date have improved the overall mill utilization rates and pricing. We continue to expand our geographic footprint and systematically invest in our value-added processing capabilities.\"\nMr. Reid continued, \"Our energy products operations benefited from the pricing recovery, improved demand and better industry-wide inventory management. U.S. line pipe projects have been particularly robust as well as continued growth in our field store operations. The extent of the duration of the seasonal road closures could impact certain of our Canadian energy products operations. Entering the second quarter, we remain encouraged with current demand and pricing levels.\"\nThe Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.38 per common share payable June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 28, 2018.\nThe Company will be holding an Investor Conference Call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET to review its 2018 first quarter results.
