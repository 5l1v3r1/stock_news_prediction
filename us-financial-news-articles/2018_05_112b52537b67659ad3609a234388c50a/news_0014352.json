This is football and everything should stay on the pitch.”\nRamos also said he thought Suarez had been exaggerating his pain when the Uruguayan striker went down after a challenge in the first half. Real did not put the ball out of play at the time, angering Barca players.\n“When an opponent is down on the floor and you think it’s serious you normally kick the ball out of play. But I know him a little and I know what he’s like,” Ramos added.\n“We always respect Barcelona but in that play I thought kicking the ball out was not necessary.”\nSuarez also had a goal ruled out for offside, while Madrid were denied a late penalty when Marcelo was tripped in the area by Jordi Alba.\n“We watched an incredible game of football and I can’t say if the draw is fair or not,” said Real coach Zinedine Zidane, who would not be drawn on the referee’s performance.\n“Those that came to the stadium will go home happy. The game had a little bit of everything, I imagine it was very tough to referee.”\nReporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ian Ransom\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:48:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
