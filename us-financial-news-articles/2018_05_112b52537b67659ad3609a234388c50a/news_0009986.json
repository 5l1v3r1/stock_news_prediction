StanChart said in February it will restore that to 8 percent in the medium term, but has not announced the timetable for achieving the goal.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo NO SHORTCUTS\nHitting the target will involve improving income across all of the bank’s main business lines, with the first quarter showing mixed results.\nWhile income for its private banking business climbed 23 percent from the same first-quarter period a year ago, albeit from a low base, income in the key financial markets trading business rose only 2 percent.\nThat compares with record profits for the quarter posted by U.S. investment banks, which reaped bumper trading profits in the first two months of the year as investors reacted to volatility across stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.\nStanChart posted an annualised return on equity of 7.6 percent in the March quarter, compared to 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\n“There are no shortcuts but we are gathering momentum and gaining in confidence,” Finance Director Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday.\nStanChart did show continued signs of improving its balance of bad loans, with net impairment on financial assets in the quarter 29 percent lower than in the previous period.\nLosses from bad debts had plagued StanChart in the recent past, but the bank has since tightened limits on who can make decisions about such big loans and decreased internal limits for exposure to a single client.
