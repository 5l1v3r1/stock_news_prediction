Across the region, other major markets such as Mexico and Brazil saw equities rise over 1 percent, as well, supported by a solid day on Wall Street, oil prices that remain high in the face of fresh U.S. sanctions on Iran, and a slew of positive corporate earnings reports. On Thursday, Argentine Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne is set to meet with IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde regarding a financing arrangement from the institution meant to calm Argentina's volatile financial markets. On Wednesday, Argentina's Congress passed a capital markets reform bill, seeking to boost the economy by reducing the power of market regulators and loosening restrictions on some funds investing in the country. \"After the announcement to request financial help from the IMF ... local stocks were able to take a breather after the recent downturn and rebounded, taking advantage of the approval of the capital markets law,\" said Gustavo Ber, a partner at Buenos Aires consultancy Estudio Ber. Argentina's benchmark Merval index had climbed 3.79 percent in morning trade on Thursday, after rising about 6 percent on Wednesday. That followed a 12 percent rout over the previous 12 sessions. Energy stocks in particular helped support the index, after crude oil prices rose, triggered by potential disruption to oil flows from major exporter Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions. While oil prices moderated amid profit booking on Thursday, prices remain high. Pampa Energia SA climbed some 8.4 percent, while various other energy stocks in Argentina climbed more than 5 percent. In Brazil, common and preferred shares in state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA jumped 4.6 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, after Bank of America elevated its rating on the stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral.\" That accounted for over a third of the Bovespa's 1.17 percent gain and followed gains of over 8 percent in each share class on Wednesday, following strong quarterly profit figures. The MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index, which puts together a cross-section of large- and mid-cap stocks from five major economies in the region, climbed 1.99 percent.
