But it is “the key to empowering refugees and displaced persons”, added the UNHCR’s director of programme support and former representative in Jordan.\nIn 2012 when Jordan’s Za’atari camp opened - home at one point to as many as 130,000 Syrian refugees - Friday prayers would be followed by “a riot”, with frustrated, anxious residents destroying things and throwing stones, Harper said.\nBut once UNHCR began spending up to $450,000 each month on electricity supplied to the camp via a grid connection, refugees used it to set up some 3,000 shops and businesses, and the rampages stopped as their sense of dignity grew, he said.\n“They started feeling possessive, protective, engaged in the stability of the camp,” he added.\nSince last year, two of Jordan’s main refugee camps have used power produced by their own solar plants - one in Za’atari funded by German development bank KfW and the other in Azraq backed by the IKEA Foundation - that can also feed back surplus electricity into the national grid.\nSarah Rosenberg-Jansen, head of humanitarian energy at UK-based charity Practical Action, said Jordan’s government takes the wider view that getting camps connected will improve the country’s infrastructure and support national development.\n“They see it as an opportunity, and as a way to change perceptions in host communities that this is good for both of us - not just for refugees,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ENERGY FOR ALL\nPractical Action is embarking on a project in the north Jordan city of Irbid, also funded by the IKEA Foundation, that will assist landlords renting properties to vulnerable refugee families to install rooftop solar systems for heating water.\nThe development charity will also work with UNHCR and other partners in Rwanda to set up solar micro-grids and home systems to power schools, clinics, street lighting and home appliances in three camps hosting Congolese refugees, offering an alternative to candles and kerosene.\nIt will also look at ways to provide more sustainable fuel and efficient stoves for cooking.\nGovernment officials and others at a meeting on Wednesday in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, about the “Renewable Energy for Refugees” project emphasised the need to move away from the environmentally harmful use of firewood, co-host MEI said.\nEnergy underpins many things displaced people need to do in their daily lives, said Rosenberg-Jansen - from charging mobile phones used to contact relatives and transfer money, to washing clothes, lighting, entertainment and moving around.\nBut the answer is not to distribute energy for free, she added. “There is already a market there (in camps),” with households spending a relatively high proportion of their disposable income on energy, she noted.\nHandouts risk destroying that market, and making people worse off by giving them products they do not want, she said.\nThe challenge is to supply cleaner power and cooking methods for a lower price, Rosenberg-Jansen and other experts said. COST SAVINGS\nThe forthcoming global action plan will include targets and concrete ways of reaching them, those drafting it said.\nPractical Action’s Rosenberg-Jansen hopes that in five years, aid workers will factor in the provision of clean energy from the outset of an emergency and include it in funding plans.\nDoing so would also bring significant cost savings for agencies that spend millions of dollars each year on power from unreliable diesel generators that often break down, cutting off the health clinics and other services they run, she added.\nUNHCR’s Harper said aid organisations needed to collaborate with business, governments and development banks to overcome barriers to building and operating clean energy services for refugees and displaced people. Problems include high upfront costs, onerous bureaucracy and restrictive regulations.\nIn Za’atari, for example, UNHCR found refugees were willing to buy electricity but the agency had no mechanism to receive payment.\nA new partnership called the Smart Communities Coalition, co-chaired by credit card giant Mastercard and the U.S. government’s “Power Africa” programme, will attempt to resolve such issues by putting in place digital infrastructure in refugee camps and settlements, starting later this year in Kenya and Uganda.\nThe aim is for governments, aid agencies and companies to develop a model to provide refugees with internet and mobile connectivity, digital financial tools and access to low-cost clean energy. That will require fresh thinking on all sides, said Tara Nathan, who leads on public-private partnerships for Mastercard, which will offer its expertise in digital payments.\n\"The money, the capacities exist - it's about... finding a way for everyone to act like grown-ups and intervene together,\" she said on the sidelines of a conference on energy access in Lisbon this month.
