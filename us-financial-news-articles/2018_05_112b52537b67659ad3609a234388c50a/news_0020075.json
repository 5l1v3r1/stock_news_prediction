(NYSE: VPG), a leading producer of precision sensors and systems, today announced its results for its fiscal 2018 first .\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nGrowth in revenues to $73.1 million, up 22.3% year-over-year Earnings increased to $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $0.15 reported last year Adjusted diluted EPS* increased 95% to $0.37 compared to prior year $0.19 Operating margin for the quarter was 11.2% as compared to 6.6% for the prior year period Book-to-bill remained strong at 1.05, reflecting healthy, stable end-markets\nZiv Shoshani, Chief Executive Officer of VPG, commented, “Our operating performance in the first quarter of 2018 demonstrates our ability to capture opportunity across all of our end markets in the improved business environment, delivering solid operating margins. We continue to execute well against our business strategy and deliver value to our stockholders.”\nThe Company grew first fiscal quarter 2018 net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders to $5.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the first fiscal quarter of 2017.\nThe first fiscal quarter 2018 adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders approximately doubled to $5.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders of $2.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period. This growth was achieved despite a foreign currency exchange rate headwind that reduced net income for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 by $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share relative to the first fiscal quarter of 2017.\nSegments\nFoil Technology Products segment revenues grew 23.0% to $34.2 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, up from $27.8 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2017; sequential revenue increased 14.3% compared to $29.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and sequential increases in revenues were attributable to precision resistors growth in all regions, primarily for the test and measurement market, in addition to an increase mainly in the advanced sensors products across all regions.\nGross profit margin for the segment was 42.8% for the first fiscal quarter of 2018, an increase compared to 41.4% in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 and 39.3% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. The year-over-year and sequential increase in gross margin was directly due to the volume increase experienced in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.\nForce Sensors segment revenues grew 24.3% to $19.2 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, up from $15.5 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2017; sequential revenue increased 8.5% up from $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in revenues was mainly attributable to OEM customers in the force measurement and precision weighing markets across all regions. The increase in sequential revenue was primarily attributable to OEM customers in the force measurement market in Europe.\nGross profit margin for Force Sensors was 27.3% for the first fiscal quarter of 2018, an increase compared to 23.9% in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 and a decrease compared to 29.5% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. Gross margins were up compared to the prior year period due to the volume increase experienced in the first fiscal quarter of 2018. The sequential decline in gross margins is primarily related to higher freight costs and wage increases.\nWeighing and Control Systems segment revenues grew by 19.0% to $19.7 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018, up from $16.6 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2017; sequential revenue decreased 9.7% from $21.8 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. The increased year-over-year revenues were primarily attributable to the on-board weighing and process weighing product lines in Europe and the Americas. The comparative decrease in sequential revenue was attributable to the significant revenues in the steel business, primarily in Asia, that occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.\nThe first fiscal quarter 2018 gross profit margin for the segment was 43.9%, a decrease compared to 44.3% from the first fiscal quarter of 2017 and 44.8% from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix. The sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to a reduction in volume.\nNear-Term Outlook\n“In light of a continued strong business environment, at constant first fiscal quarter 2018 exchange rates, we expect net revenues in the range of $71 million to $77 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2018,” concluded Mr. Shoshani.\n*Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nWe define “adjusted net earnings” as net earnings attributable to VPG stockholders before restructuring costs and associated tax effects. The reconciliation table within this release reconciles the Company's non-GAAP measures, which are provided for comparison with other results, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful because they provide insight with respect to intrinsic operating results.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call will be held today (May 8) at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT).
