Alvaro is out and so are a lot of other very good team-mates,” Aspas told reporters.\n“(Mario) Gotze scored the goal which won the last final (for Germany in 2014 against Argentina) and he is not going to the World Cup. You have a bad season and another team-mate will have the opportunity to be here (instead).”\nAspas has scored four goals in eight appearances for Spain, making his debut in 2016 under Lopetegui when he scored in a 2-2 friendly draw with England as a substitute.\n“I’ve worked to be here since the first day with a lot of hope,” added former Liverpool striker Aspas. “I came into the squad because of an injury to a team-mate and (Lopetegui) has given me the chance to keep coming.\n“I would like to start all the games, me and anyone else in the squad, but it’s to the coach’s virtue that he thinks that I can help the team with just a few minutes on the pitch (as a substitute).”\nEditing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:11:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
