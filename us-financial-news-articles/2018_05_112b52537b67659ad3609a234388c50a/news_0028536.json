However, Torra could still be elected in a second round of voting to beheld on Monday in which only a simple majority in the 135-seat regional parliament is needed, provided the far-left CUP party can be persuaded not to vote against his candidacy.\nThe CUP, whose four parlementarians abstained in the vote on Saturday, will meet on Sunday to decide how it will vote in the second round.\nBacking unilateral independence over the negotiated exit favoured by larger separatist parties, the CUP has previously broken ranks with the pro-independence block.
