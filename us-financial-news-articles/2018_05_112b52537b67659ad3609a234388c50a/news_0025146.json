REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo\nIn sharp contrast to expectations a few weeks ago that it would raise rates, the BoE said its nine rate-setters voted 7-2 to keep them at 0.5 percent.\nThat was in line with forecasts from economists polled by Reuters in the past week.\nGovernor Mark Carney said the BoE - which cut its 2018 growth forecast due to the weak start to the year and trimmed its inflation forecasts - expected the economy would pick up speed again and it was sticking to its message that rates would probably need to rise.\nInvestors slightly pushed back their expectations of when that was likely to happen.\n“The judgement relies on the economic data being broadly consistent with the Monetary Policy Committee’s projections,” Carney told reporters.\nSterling fell close to a four-month low against the dollar, reversing earlier gains, and the yield on two-year British government bonds, which are sensitive to moves by the BoE, eased modestly.\n“It looks like the 2018 rate hike has been delayed not cancelled,” Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton said.\n“But the area that is probably giving them most grounds for pausing is the recent weakening in consumption indicators, which could be flagging a bigger downside risk to the growth outlook.”\nBritain’s economy grew more slowly than most of its peers last year after a Brexit-driven jump in inflation hit consumer spending power and some businesses delayed long-term investment.\nGrowth slowed even more sharply in the first quarter of 2018 on a mix of unusually snowy weather and headwinds from Britain’s impending European Union exit. Surveys have suggested little rebound last month.\nFor now, most policymakers wanted to wait to be sure that the economic weakness passed quickly.
