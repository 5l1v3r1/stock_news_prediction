Sandoz said it got only a so-called complete response letter from the FDA.\n“Sandoz stands behind the robust body of evidence included in the regulatory submission and is currently evaluating the content of the letter. While disappointed, Sandoz remains committed to further discussions with FDA in order to bring this important medicine to U.S. patients as soon as possible,” it said.
