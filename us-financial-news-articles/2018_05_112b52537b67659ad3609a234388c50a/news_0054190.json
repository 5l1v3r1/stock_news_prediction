Then parliament would be dissolved with elections at the beginning of 2019,” Cottarelli said shortly after being named interim prime minister by Italy’s president.\n“In the absence of (parliament’s) confidence, the government would resign immediately and its main function would be the management of ordinary affairs until elections are held after the month of August,” Cottarelli added.
