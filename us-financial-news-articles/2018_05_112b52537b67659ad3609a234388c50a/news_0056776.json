Matt Harvey (1-3) pitched into the sixth inning but took his first loss since he came to the Reds in a May 8 trade with the New York Mets.\nHarvey allowed four runs on nine hits and two walks in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out four.\nVotto and Gennett hit back-to-back doubles in the first to give the Reds a 1-0 lead, but the Rockies dominated after that.\nWith one out in the bottom of the first, Dahl hit the first pitch he saw from Harvey into the second deck in right to tie the score. Arenado singled, and one out later, Gonzalez unloaded on a Harvey fastball, sending it into the third deck in right field to give Colorado a 3-1 lead. It was his fifth home run of the season and first since May 11 against Milwaukee.\nGonzalez added three singles to collect his first four-hit game since Sept. 12, 2016, at Arizona.\nThe Rockies padded their lead in the sixth. Tony Wolters led off with a single and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Marquez. Wandy Peralta relieved Harvey and gave up Charlie Blackmon’s RBI single to make it 4-1. After Dahl struck out, Arenado made it 6-1 with a two-run homer off reliever Tanner Rainey, his 10th.\nDesmond made it 8-1 with a two-run homer in the seventh, his ninth, off Dylan Floro.\nCincinnati failed to score after loading the bases in the eighth but got one run on a wild pitch in the ninth inning.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:29:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
