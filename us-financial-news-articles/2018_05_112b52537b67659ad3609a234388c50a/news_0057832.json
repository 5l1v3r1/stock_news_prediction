The ball clipped the heel of Lyon captain Wendie Renard and trickled past goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi.\nThe German side’s joy was short-lived when midfielder Alexandra Popp flew in with a reckless challenge and received a second booking, reducing Wolfsburg to 10 players.

Defender Lena Goessling failed to clear and Henry capitalised, taking the ball into the area and firing into the top corner.\nThe French side took the lead almost straight from the restart when substitute Shanice van de Sanden raced down the right and into the box, putting in a low cross for Le Sommer to flick the ball into the net.\nA scuffed half-volley from Hegerberg shortly before halftime in the extra period made it 3-1 and meant the Norwegian became the first player to score 15 goals in a Champions League campaign.\nVeteran Abily, who will retire at the end of the season, fittingly sealed the win with a clean strike four minutes from the end.\nThe Frenchwoman has played a part in each of Lyon’s victorious European campaigns and can cap her career with a glittering treble when the league champions take on Paris St Germain in the French Cup next week.
