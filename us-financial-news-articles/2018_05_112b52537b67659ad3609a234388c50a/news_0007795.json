Lee was arrested last year on bribery and embezzlement charges. Lee, who has denied charges, was set free in February after a court suspended his sentence.\nSamsung BioLogics' shares fell as much as 19.8 percent to their lowest since late January, before paring losses to trade down 17.2 percent. It was their biggest intra-day drop since listing in late 2016. The benchmark KOSPI .KS11 was down 0.4 percent. PROFIT SWING\nActivist group the People’s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and lawmakers raised questions last year about Samsung BioLogics’ 1.9 trillion won ($1.77 billion) net profit in 2015. A year earlier it had posted a roughly 28 billion won net loss.\nThe world’s third-largest biotech contract manufacturer after Lonza Group ( LONN.S ) and Boeringer Ingelheim in terms of manufacturing capacity said the profit was the result of following IFRS accounting standards.\nIn late 2015 and early 2016, when BioLogics’ books for 2015 were being compiled, the perceived market value of its unit Samsung Bioepis skyrocketed on the back of approvals for its copies of blockbuster biotech drugs in Europe and South Korea.\nAs Bioepis’s perceived value rose, minor shareholder Biogen said it could exercise its call option to increase its stake to 50 percent minus one share.\nAccounting experts told BioLogics that according to IFRS rules, the possibility of the call option being exercised meant Bioepis needed to be categorized as an affiliate, not a unit, which in turn meant the stake needed to be reflected in BioLogics’ books by fair value, not book value, BioLogics said on Wednesday.\nThe change to fair value, and the subsequent net profit, was approved by KPMG Korea, Deloitte Korea and PricewaterhouseCoopers Korea, and the FSS did not raise an issue when it released the 2015 books in 2016, the company added.\nAn FSS official declined to comment.\nShares in Samsung C&T Corp ( 028260.KS ), which held a 43 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, also fell more than 5 percent. Shares of Samsung Elec, which owned a 31.5 percent stake in Samsung BioLogics as of end-2017, were on a trading halt on Wednesday ahead of a stock split.\n($1 = 1,075.8000 won)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T03:36:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
