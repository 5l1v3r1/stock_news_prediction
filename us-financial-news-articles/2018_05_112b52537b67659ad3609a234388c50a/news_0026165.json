Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “plan,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are based upon the Company's current expectations and assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and performance to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the “Risk Factors” section of its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018. Included among the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and performance to differ materially are the risk that the Company will be unsuccessful in gauging fashion trends and changing consumer preferences, the risks resulting from the highly competitive nature of the Company’s business and its dependence on consumer spending patterns, which may be affected by the weakness in the economy which continue to affect the Company’s target customer, the risk that the Company’s strategic initiatives to increase sales and margin are delayed or do not result in anticipated improvements, the risk of delays, interruptions and disruptions in the Company’s global supply chain, including resulting from foreign sources of supply in less developed countries or more politically unstable countries, the risk that the cost of raw materials or energy prices will increase beyond current expectations or that the Company is unable to offset cost increases through value engineering or price increases, and the uncertainty of weather patterns. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nContact: Robert Vill, Group Vice President, Finance, (201) 453-6693\nSource:The Children's Place, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hu7KhxGGNhEqdNIeS6kTn_T4VPt_-cWDoH51-ZLrG6YSwOUGMdXdTsmiBrrxeUtdndXaGTRzIZ2rToog7pjSSgq_wuFVwuAAwKroqmTVjaWVVbeq8V-OBXcynEC1G0gA", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=e_Af4ZgWlrC5LvN4wRrqUDosZ1vfksiFKq4EVAC4iNUVRFRTd8YQ2PP3ViivpX1iQ93djha-0NHEg-xPg5UGPLaz4ZTs1zewiCO95r6vHcI="], "published": "2018-05-11T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:29:39.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
