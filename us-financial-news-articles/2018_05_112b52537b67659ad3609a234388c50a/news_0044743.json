When a friend queried about his injury, Mr. Shubert pointed to the large bandage on his neck, then lifted his curls to show where the bullet struck him.\nRome Shubert, who survived a shot to his head, at Saturday’s game.

Players crowded around the starting pitcher, offering him comfort as he was pulled.\nSanta Fe players Tyler Martin, left, and Dalton Stevens hugged before Saturday’s game. Photo: David J. Phillip/Associated Press “I think it’s the best medicine for them…takes power away from yesterday,” said Reagan McDonald, 47 years old, whose sophomore son, No. 9, plays for the team. “They’re all here to support each other, just like right now, the guy on the mound didn’t have it, but they’re all out there giving him hugs.”\nIn the stands, Melissa Nugent’s two children held homemade signs. “Get well soon, Rome,” read the one held by her son Cole, 7. In her 5-year-old daughter Camryn’s hands, a heart-covered message: “Santa Fe strong.”\nRelated Coverage Shooting Victims: Girl Scout, Exchange Student, Substitute Teachers Texas Shooting Suspect’s Family Expresses Shock President Trump Comments on ‘Horrific Attack’ in Santa Fe, Texas Lives Lost in Three Decades of School Shootings Analysis: Data Show How School Attacks Unfold Most Guns Used in School Shootings Come From Home Designing a School to Stop Shooters Along the outfield fence, Betty Lawson, 47, watched with her 16-year-old daughter, Hannah, a Santa Fe student.\n“Even if the team doesn’t win tonight,” Ms. Lawson said, “in our hearts because they wanted to play, they’re already winners.”\nWith the team down 7-0 in the bottom of the fifth, Santa Fe High fans raised their voices in a chant and began to clap: “Here we go, Santa Fe, here we go. Here we go, Santa Fe, here we go.”\nThe game ended with a Santa Fe loss, 7-0. As the players went to shake hands with the opposing team, a man in the crowd yelled out, “Keep your heads up, guys. Keep your heads up.”\nSome in the crowd sang the Santa Fe fight song: “Santa Fe, dear Santa Fe, surely thou will be, ever worthy of our homage, hail oh hail to thee.”\nWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T17:36:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
