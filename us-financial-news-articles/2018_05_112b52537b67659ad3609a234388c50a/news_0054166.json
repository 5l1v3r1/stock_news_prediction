He is 3-1 in five May starts.\nReliever Jared Hughes got the final two outs for his second save.\nPittsburgh starter Ivan Nova (2-5) allowed five runs, four of them earned, and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings, with four strikeouts and two walks. He has not won since April 15, going 0-4 with three no-decisions in that span.\nNova had a rough third inning.\nAfter giving up just eight walks in 56 1/3 innings entering the game, he walked his counterpart Castillo on five pitches to begin the third. Winker followed with a base hit, moving Castillo to second.\nAn out later, Nova loaded the bases with a throwing error — his third, the most among National League pitchers — on Scooter Gennett’s grounder. That set up Suarez, who hit a 2-2 hanging curveball into the stands in left for his eighth homer and a 4-0 Reds lead. Suarez is among the NL leaders with 38 RBIs.\nWinker led off the fifth with his first homer of the season, to left-center, to make it 5-0.\nIn the sixth, Adam Frazier walked with one out for the Pirates, and David Freese followed with his fourth homer to cut the lead to 5-2.\nIn the ninth, Corey Dickerson opened with an infield hit for the Pirates. After Jose Osuna struck out, rookie Austin Meadows hit his third homer to close the gap to 5-4, chasing reliever Amir Garrett.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:09:56.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
