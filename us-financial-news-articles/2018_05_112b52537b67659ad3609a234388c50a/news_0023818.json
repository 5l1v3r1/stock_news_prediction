Four people were killed and others injured in the school shooting. REUTERS/Matthew Smith/File Photo The man’s identity is protected by a court-ordered publication ban because he was a minor during the January 2016 killings in the isolated and impoverished town of La Loche in northern Saskatchewan.\nHe was sentenced after pleading guilty last year to killing a teacher and teaching assistant in a local school and two teenage brothers in their home in La Loche, 850 kilometers (528 miles) northwest of Saskatchewan’s capital, Regina.\nJudge Janet McIvor sentenced the man as an adult even though he was 17 at the time of the shooting. She ruled earlier this year that a lighter youth sentence was inappropriate.\nHe will be eligible for parole in 10 years, CBC reported.\n“I can’t undo what I did. I’m sorry,” the man said in a Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan courtroom, according to the CBC report.\nCBC reported that the publication ban on his identity remains in place until the appeal period lapses.\nThe man pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder.\nMass shootings are less common in Canada than the United States, which has less stringent gun laws. A gunman killed six people in a January 2017 Quebec mosque shooting.\nReporting by Rod Nickel in Calgary, Alberta; editing by Jim Finkle and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:19:08.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
