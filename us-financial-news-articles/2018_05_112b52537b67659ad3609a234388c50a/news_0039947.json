The merger would take place after a sufficient number of jets had the new product.\nAs part of its transformation programme, Singapore Airlines had already handed some of SilkAir’s routes to the group’s budget carrier Scoot and merged part of SilkAir’s finance team with its parent.\nSingapore Airlines shares were trading 1.9 percent higher at on Friday afternoon, while the broader Singapore market was down 0.2 percent.
