Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc, two companies in which Apollo invested.\nThere is no certainty that Apollo's approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo declined to comment, while Xerox and Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T19:35:51.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
