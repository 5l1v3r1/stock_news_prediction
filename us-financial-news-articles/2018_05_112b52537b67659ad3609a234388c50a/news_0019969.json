It’s not a big thing,” Hossain told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“We would be mistaken to think that something like this will be a magic bullet solution.”\nReporting by Annie Banerji @anniebanerji, Editing by Claire Cozens Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
