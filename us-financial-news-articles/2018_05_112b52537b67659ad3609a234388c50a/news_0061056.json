Pick up a copy at Amazon . Drawing from 22 years of experience in business management with companies like Eaton Corporation , Parker Hannifin and KeyCorp , coupled with education and experience in nutrition sciences, Carter makes a compelling business case for improving employee well-being, maximizing productivity, and reducing companies' carbon footprints through bold and thoughtful transformations of the workplace food environment. Carter is launching a partnership with business leaders to create a long-lasting and beneficial legacy.\nCarter presents the business case for the plant-based workplace in the context of her wellness journey. She walks readers through a ten-year transformation that began when her physician informed her she \"had the arteries of a 46-year-old, yet was only 35.\" Carter's unconquerable spirit refused to acquiesce to a life of prescription statins. She instead chose to empower herself by adopting a plant-based diet and reversing the dietary damage her former life had inflicted. Now in her forties, Carter has the arteries of someone half her age. The Plant-Based Workplace gives companies a roadmap for helping employees achieve similar real-life health \"miracles\" through transformation of the workplace food environment.\nEach section in The Plant-Based Workplace covers a key component of the plant-based food environment philosophy. Carter first takes readers through the science of chronic diseases and environmental impacts of food choices. She then makes the business case for the plant-based workplace and concludes with guidelines for application. By demonstrating not only her success in overcoming health barriers but also her wisdom concerning fiscal issues companies face, Carter challenges readers \"to make it personal\" and take the initiative to implement an ambitious change model, step-by-step.\nAt the core of The Plant-Based Workplace is the notion that chronic disease can be treated like any other environmental, health and safety responsibility in the workplace, addressing acute and chronic injuries, and raising the bar with sustainability efforts. Carter's visionary book makes a convincing case for all companies to consider.\nContact: +1-601-201-5486 or gigi.mytrueself@gmail.com\nMy True Self , a wellness consulting practice.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-book-shows-companies-how-one-change-can-boost-profits-engage-employees-and-leave-a-lighter-footprint-300656295.html\nSOURCE My True Self, PLLC", "external_links": ["http://www.key.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0692088636", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-book-shows-companies-how-one-change-can-boost-profits-engage-employees-and-leave-a-lighter-footprint-300656295.html", "https://mtswellness.com/", "https://plantbasedworkplace.com/", "http://www.eaton.com/us/en-us.html", "http://www.parker.com/portal/site/PARKER/menuitem.b90576e27a4d71ae1bfcc510237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=c38888b5bd16e010VgnVCM1000000308a8c0RCRD&vgnextfmt=EN", "http://plantbasedworkplace.com/"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T19:38:15.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
