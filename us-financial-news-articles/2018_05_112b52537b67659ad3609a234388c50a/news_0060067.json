It was the strongest monthly increase since October 2016.\nThat was much stronger than the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.7 percent rise and followed an upwardly revised drop of 0.4 percent in March.\nOn the year, retail rose by 1.2 percent, slightly weaker than the Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.3 percent increase.\nPrivate consumption has been a key growth driver in recent years as German consumers benefit from record-high employment, rising real wages, strong job security, moderate inflation and low borrowing costs.\nIn the first quarter, household spending contributed 0.2 percentage points to a quarterly expansion rate of 0.3 percent.\nThe retail sales data came after a GfK survey published last week showed the mood among German consumers deteriorated further heading into June to reach the lowest level so far in 2018.
