We need to develop the relationship and trust,” HKEX chief executive Charles Li said at a metals industry event in Hong Kong hosted by the bourse.\nThe LME, bought by HKEX around five years ago, has for years pursued its ambition to set up warehouses in China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals. But it has been without success so far as Chinese regulators have nurtured mainland exchanges.\nHKEX is also focusing on how to better connect China’s domestic commodity market with the LME and other international markets, while its onshore commodity business at its Qianhai exchange is still waiting for regulatory approval.\nLi added that LME week Asia would not see a “big bang” announcement from the bourse.\n“This year it’s more of a work in progress,” he said.\nReporting by Melanie Burton and Tom Daly; Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T05:43:01.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
