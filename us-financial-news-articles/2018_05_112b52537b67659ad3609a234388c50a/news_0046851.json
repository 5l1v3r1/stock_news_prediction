The most-traded iron ore futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange closed down 0.7 percent on Wednesday, while oil benchmarks fell after an unexpected build in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories despite strong demand. The local share price index futures fell 0.2 percent or 12 points to 6,024, an 8.5 point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark shed 0.2 percent on Wednesday.
