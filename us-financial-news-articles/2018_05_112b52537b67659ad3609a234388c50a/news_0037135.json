CEFC Europe’s now-deposed Vice-Chairman Jaroslav Tvrdik said on Twitter that J&T had acted to seize control before a deadline to make the payment by 1200 GMT on Friday.\nCITIC has been in the process of taking a 49 percent stake in CEFC Europe, according to CEFC Europe and the Czech presidential administration. Calls to the media relations office of the Beijing-based CITIC went unanswered.\nCEFC Europe bought Czech assets in the past three years from real estate to breweries under an investment drive promoted by Czech President Milos Zeman. CEFC founder Ye holds the post of an economic adviser to Zeman.\nThe vice-Chairman of co-creditor J&T Finance Group (JTFG), Patrik Tkac, said on Friday that the fight could be solved if the debt is repaid.\n“We are ready to immediately accept a payment made in a legal way and hand over the keys,” Tkac said on Twitter.\nA filing with the Czech business registry dated May 17 showed JTFG board member Dusan Palcr and Petr Kubik were appointed as CEFC Europe board members and the previous board was removed under provisions in a collateral contract between JTPI and CEFC.\nCEFC China also holds a 9.9 percent stake in JTFG. It had tried to raise the stake to 50 percent but the attempt was first halted by the Czech National Bank and later abandoned.\n($1 = 0.8463 euros)\nReporting by Robert Muller and Jan Lopatka; Additional reporting by Aizhu Chen in Beijing; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:55:30.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
