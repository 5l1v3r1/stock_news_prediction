Gordon Moore, the founder and original chairman of the organization, will continue to serve on the board as chairman emeritus.\nPaul Gray joined the foundation’s board of trustees in March 2008 , became vice chairman of the board in 2013, and served as interim president in 2014. He is the former executive vice chancellor and provost at the University of California, Berkeley and former dean and professor emeritus in Berkeley’s College of Engineering. In 2015, Gordon and Betty endowed the Paul R. Gray Distinguished Chair in the College of Engineering at U.C. Berkeley to acknowledge Gray’s contributions to engineering and thank him for the leadership he provided to the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation as a longtime trustee and as interim president.\n“Recognizing that age and health won't allow me to continue as chairman forever, the time is right for this transition,” said Gordon Moore. “Both Betty and I are deeply grateful for the leadership Paul has offered the foundation over the past decade and are especially thankful that he will assume the role of chairman now. We share a belief in the importance of the work the foundation supports and its potential to make the world a better place for future generations.”\nGordon and Betty Moore established the foundation in 2000 to create positive outcomes for future generations. They are committed to tackling large, important issues at a scale where it can achieve significant and measurable impacts. Perhaps best known for his 1965 rule-of-thumb prediction that later became known as Moore’s Law , Gordon was a founder of Intel and Fairchild Semiconductor. He helped shape what we now recognize as Silicon Valley and the technology sector.\n“I’m deeply honored to accept this position and enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue to work with Gordon and the organization in this capacity,” said Gray. “In creating the foundation, Gordon and Betty set an ambitious goal to create significant and measurable positive impact in the world. My goal is to do all I can to help the organization achieve that in the most thoughtful, meaningful and effective way.”\n“The foundation is fortunate to have Paul’s leadership and Gordon’s continuing engagement on the board,” said Harvey V. Fineberg, M.D., Ph.D., president of the foundation. “Paul’s ten years of experience with the organization as both a trustee and interim president will ensure a high-level of continuity, allowing us to stay focused on our programmatic goals.”\nGray assumes the role of chairman immediately.\nThe Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation fosters path-breaking scientific discovery, environmental conservation, patient care improvements and the preservation of the special character of the Bay Area.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523005446/en/\nGordon and Betty Moore Foundation\nGenny Biggs\ngenny.biggs@moore.org\nSource: Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moore.org%2Farticle-detail%3FnewsUrlName%3Dgordon-and-betty-moore-endow-chair-to-honor-uc-berkeley-engineering-professor-paul-gray&esheet=51810716&newsitemid=20180523005446&lan=en-US&anchor=Paul+R.+Gray+Distinguished+Chair+in+the+College+of+Engineering+at+U.C.+Berkeley&index=2&md5=79e0042ac37c1a15d31a9886b7f1f3d7", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523005446/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moore.org%2Farticle-detail%3FnewsUrlName%3Dgordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-announces-paul-gray-ph-d-as-board-of-trustees-member&esheet=51810716&newsitemid=20180523005446&lan=en-US&anchor=March+2008&index=1&md5=1ac7dd8edb2047108104dd7d0c551711", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMoore%2527s_law&esheet=51810716&newsitemid=20180523005446&lan=en-US&anchor=Moore%27s+Law&index=3&md5=6a0a4a5f95f2fe380bee56b19d8cb4af"], "published": "2018-05-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:48:21.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
