If his forecast becomes reality, it would be the first $100 million opener for the holiday weekend since \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was released in 2014, he added.\n\"Memorial weekend needs to get its groove back because it's a very important weekend,\" he said. \"This is where the month of May passes the baton to June and keeps that momentum going.\"\nLast year, the holiday weekend only brought in $181 million for the entire weekend, compared with other years where it saw sales of more than $300 million, Dergarabedian said. The lackluster response continued through the season, with the summer being the lowest grossing one since 2006.\n\"The summer season is vitally important and Memorial weekend is a big barometer of how the overall summer will perform,\" he said.\nHowever, Dergarabedian is much more bullish about this summer, which is already off to a good start with Disney 's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and Fox's \"Deadpool 2 .\"\n\"If this Memorial weekend is any indicator, we're going to have a really strong summer and there's a lot of big movies on the way,\" he said.\nThose films include new installments in the \"Jurassic World\" and \"Mission: Impossible\" franchises. Pixar's \"Incredibles 2,\" Marvel's \"Ant-Man And The Wasp,\" Warner Bros.' \"Ocean's 8\" and Sony Pictures' \"Hotel Transylvania 3\" are also set to be released this summer.\nWATCH: Can 'Solo' give Disney the force to rally? show chapters Can 'Solo' give Disney the force to rally? 18 Hours Ago | 04:53", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:07:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
