Poland and Senegal are the other teams in their group.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Nishino deployed a new formation with three central defenders, two wing-backs and two inside forwards supporting a lone striker.\nHowever, Ghana captain Thomas Partey scored and debutant Emmanuel Boateng converted a penalty to ensure a miserable night for Japan in front of 64,520 fans at a rain-soaked Nissan Stadium in Yokohama.\n“Having not played a game at home in half a year, we absolutely wanted a good game just before the World Cup,” Nishino said.\n“We gave it a good try, but the result is disappointing. We had chances but couldn’t capitalize.”\nNishino will name his World Cup squad on Thursday before warm-up games against Switzerland on June 8 and Paraguay four days later.\nThere was good news for Egypt who are hopeful that forward Mohamed Salah will have recovered from his shoulder injury in time to play in their final World Cup group game.\n“The (Egyptian) football association confirms once again ... Salah will be in the World Cup, God willing, and won’t be absent for more than three weeks,” the Egyptian FA said.\nReporting by Angel Krasimirov, editing by Ed Osmond\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
