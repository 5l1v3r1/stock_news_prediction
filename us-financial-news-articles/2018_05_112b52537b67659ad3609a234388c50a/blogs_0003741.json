(Courtesy of General Motors Co. via AP) Photo: Associated Press\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission wants to hear from boards when determining if shareholders’ proposals amount to meddling with a company’s day-to-day business.\nThe agency in April denied a request by General Motors Co. to omit from its proxy materials a shareholder resolution asking for its fleet’s future emissions. In the denial, the SEC specifically made reference to the lack of context from the company’s board.\nThe SEC had indicated in guidance released November that a company’s board was in a better position than the agency to determine the relevance to a company’s business operations any policy issue raised in a proposal. It is unclear if including the board’s opinion would have helped GM’s request or not.\n“We note that the no-action request does not include a discussion of the board’s analysis and as a result we do not have the benefit of the board’s views on these matters,” said the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, in its denial of the GM request.\nGovernance experts say the wording of the SEC’s decision, dated April 18 but made public last week, is another sign the regulator is eager to review boards’ insights on certain points being raised by shareholders.\n“The [SEC] seems to be putting its thumb on the scale and saying it would like to get more discussion” from companies’ boards, said Cornish Hitchcock, principal at Hitchcock Law Firm in Washington, D.C.\nThe SEC usually allows companies to exclude shareholder proposals that overstep on matters that are part of ordinary business. But there is room for argument on issues that go beyond day-to-day business into significant policy areas—such as the environment.\nNot many companies that sought to exclude shareholder resolutions on environmental issues from their 2018 proxies have submitted their boards’ insights, Mr. Hitchcock said. But in a few cases since the guidance, the SEC has allowed companies that included the board’s views on these issues to exclude such resolutions from their proxies, he said.\nRetailer TJX received a proposal in 2017, before the SEC guidance was issued, requesting a report on how it may achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by a fixed date in all of its operations. It sought to exclude that from its proxy, but the SEC disagreed with the company’s argument that the request amounted to micromanagement. A TJX spokesman declined to comment beyond the public record of SEC filings.\nApple got a similar request from the same shareholder as TJX concerning the technology company’s net-zero emissions this proxy season. The SEC allowed Apple to exclude the proposal on the ground that the matter related to ordinary business, the opposite of its TJX verdict. In its response, the SEC said it reviewed the submission, “including the description of how your board of directors has analyzed this matter.” Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nAt TJX, meanwhile, the shareholder submitted the same proposal again this proxy season, but withdrew it after meetings with the company, according to filings.\nIn its proxy statement , GM had advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal on its future fleet’s emissions. The resolution was sponsored by a group of shareholders led by the Arkay Foundation, a progressive grant providerin California.\n“Our request to the SEC on that shareholder proposal was a procedural move because we believe we already substantially implement the proposal through our existing sustainability reporting,” a spokesman said before GM released its proxy materials, which included its full response to the proposal.\nWrite to Mara Lemos Stein at mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com.
