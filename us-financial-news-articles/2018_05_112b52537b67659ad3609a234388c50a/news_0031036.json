S&P 500 e-minis were up 6.25 points, or 0.23 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.15 percent.\nThe S&P 500 reclaimed its 100-day moving average for the first time since April 19, suggesting to some traders that the market may move higher.\nWith one trading session to go, the benchmark index is up 2.24 percent so far this week, on track for its best week since March 9.\nSymantec Corp declined 25.1 percent after the Norton Antivirus maker said it was investigating concerns raised by a former employee and forecast full-year results below analysts’ estimates.\nJames Bullard, the president of St. Louis Federal Reserve, will speak on monetary policy at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nHe has expressed concern about economic growth in recent months, so this will be a chance to see if the recent slowdown in inflation has changed his outlook.
