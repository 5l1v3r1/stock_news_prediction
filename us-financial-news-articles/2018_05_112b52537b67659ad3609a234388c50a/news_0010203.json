REUTERS/Charles Platiau\nL’Oreal did not disclose how much it had paid for the company, detailing only that Nanda, known for its fashion business Stylenanda and 3CE cosmetics brand, had a turnover of 127 million euros (111.7 million pounds) in 2017.\nThe acquisition was estimated at around 400 billion won (273.2 million pounds), Korean media previously reported.\nForeign investors including LVMH ( LVMH.PA ), Estee Lauder ( EL.N ) and Unilever ( UNc.AS ) are also among those betting on continued demand for Korean beauty products in Asian markets such as China, backed by the popularity of Korean pop culture.
