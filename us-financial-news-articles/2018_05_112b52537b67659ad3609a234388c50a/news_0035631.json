Critics since then say the ruling Socialist Party has exaggerated coup threats as an excuse to throw adversaries in jail.\nMaduro says the armed forces are broadly loyal to his government but that small groups of conspirators have sought to undermine his administration with the help of Washington.\nDiscontent among the armed forces has grown as hyperinflation eats away at salaries and food shortages leave soldiers and rank-and-file troops struggling to get by.\nThe indictment on charges of treason and conspiracy says the nine officers were holding meetings in Caracas to discuss an uprising, said Difurt de Medina. The alleged meetings took place at a time when her husband was on the other side of the country, she added.\nThe detentions include six lieutenant colonels and three lower-ranking officers, according to a lawyer representing the group. Last month they were transferred to different prisons around the country, including several notoriously violent jails.\nMilitary counterintelligence agency DCGIM held the officers incommunicado for more than a week, in violation of regulations, she said. Most of them were later transferred to different prisons around the country.\nJuan Carlos Peña, one of the detained officers, was held in handcuffs for the entire week, according to Leanys Ortega, his former wife and mother of his two children, who is also his lawyer. At the time, he was completing a military certification course.\nDGCIM officials then falsified the arrest date in official records to make it appear as though they were presented to a judge within 48 hours as required by law, she said.\n“Juan Carlos is not a commander, he did not have any troops or weapons under his command - what danger could he have posed?” said Ortega in an interview at her home in the western city of Maracaibo.\nReuters was unable to obtain comment from relatives of other detained officials.\nReporting by Brian Ellsworth and Isaac Uruttia; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T17:22:07.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
