Audi will also skip the 2019 Detroit show, where the Volkswagen group attended with a significantly reduced line-up this year.\nMany of the traditional industry gatherings have registered a drop in visitor numbers since the turn of this century.\nAmong the reasons for the decline is the emergence of technology as the main battleground for connected, autonomous cars, which has drawn exhibitors to competing events such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\nA spokesman for VW’s French operations said that Audi, sports car brand Porsche, Czech division Skoda and Spanish unit Seat are still due to attend the Paris show.\nVW’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, said the decision to skip the 2018 event does not mean the VW brand will also stay away from the next Paris show in 2020.
