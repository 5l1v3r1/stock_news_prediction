It was last up 0.2 percent at 92.792.\nSpeculators trimmed their bets on a falling dollar to the lowest in seven weeks last week, based on data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.\nFriday’s somewhat disappointing U.S. payrolls report, which showed hiring and wage growth fell short of expectations, did not alter traders’ outlook for further rate increases from the Federal Reserve.\n“Nevertheless, the data was still expansionary, showing tepid but positive growth,” Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York, said of the April jobs data.\n“In contrast, today news from the eurozone only added to the sense of dread in the region as consumer spending slowed materially,” he added.\nTraders have scaled back expectations on the timing of when the European Central Bank may raise interest rates following a spate of disappointing regional economic readings.\nThe euro broke below $1.19 for the first time this year in the aftermath of weaker-than-expected data on German industrial orders and euro zone investor sentiment.\nThe euro EUR= shed 0.33 percent at $1.1918 EUR= after touching $1.1896, the lowest in more than four months.\nThe British pound GBP=D3 traded up 0.25 percent at $1.3560, bouncing off a four-month low of $1.3487 set last week.
