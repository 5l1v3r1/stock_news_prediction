(NasdaqGM: SYNC) have filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between May 4, 2016 and March 15, 2018. Synacor is a technology development, multiplatform services, and revenue partner for video, Internet, and communications providers.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: www.robbinsarroyo.com/synacor-inc\nSynacor Accused of Touting Unrealistic Revenue Forecasts\nAccording to the complaint, on May 4, 2016, Synacor announced that it secured a three-year contract to host web and mobile services for AT&T Inc., anticipating contract revenues to be approximately $100 million per year. On August 9, 2017, Synacor revealed that a significant portion of the revenue it was expecting in Q3 and Q4 2017 would be delayed to 2018 and adjusted its Q3 and fiscal year revenue guidance accordingly. On March 15, 2018, Synacor admitted the shortcomings with the AT&T contract, noting that Synacor had only generated about $25 million in revenue during the last three quarters of 2017. When news of Synacor's revenue troubles began to hit the market, Synacor's stock plummeted over 50% to close at $1.75 per share on March 16, 2018, and has yet to recover.\nSynacor Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
