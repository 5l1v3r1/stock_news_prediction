FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - International Friendly - Northern Ireland vs South Korea - National Football Stadium at Windsor Park, Belfast, Britain - March 24, 2018 South Korea coach Shin Tae-yong Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nSouth Korea seem to have lost their way in the three years since they reached the Asian Cup final in Australia, where the disappointment of an extra-time defeat to the hosts was softened by optimism over the side’s potential.\nGerman Uli Stielike, who guided them to that 2015 Sydney final, was sacked last June after defeats in Iran, China and Qatar left South Korea’s hopes of reaching the World Cup finals hanging by a thread.\nShin took over for the final two qualifiers and while he cajoled the side over the line with a pair of nervy 0-0 draws, the Koreans grabbed an automatic spot only as other results went their way, raising fears they would be embarrassed at the World Cup.\nListless defeats to Russia and Morocco in October friendlies heightened the sense of panic in Korea to such an extent that 2002 coach Guus Hiddink was even being touted as a possible saviour.\nBut just as the demands that the popular Dutchman take the reins for Russia were building into a groundswell, everything changed in the blink of an eye. Related Coverage Factbox - South Korea World Cup\nSouth Korea were a team transformed.\nIn November, Korea played Colombia off the park in a 2-1 win in Suwon and Serbia were fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw in Ulsan days later.\nSouth Korea then went through a regional tournament involving North Korea, China and Japan unbeaten at the end of last year before beating Moldova and Latvia, and drawing with Jamaica, in friendlies early in 2018.\nLike all good things, however, Korea’s good run had to come to an end, and after back-to-back defeats in Northern Ireland and Poland in March, questions are again being raised about their form heading into the World Cup.\nIf South Korea are to have any chance of escaping a group that also contains world champions Germany, Sweden and Mexico, they must find a way to get the best out of Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min.\nThe 25-year-old has the pace and ability to unlock any defence but too often lacks support on international duty and one of Shin’s main tasks as coach will be to find someone to share the goalscoring burden in Russia.
