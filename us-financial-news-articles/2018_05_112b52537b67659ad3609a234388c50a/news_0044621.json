And plenty of questions remain.\n“Who will be the next finance minister in Italy, that is the question in the market at the moment,” said Rabobank’s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot.\nOne of the names in the frame is Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist and former industry minister. “He is seen as quite a eurosceptic,” de Groot added. “It would be quite tough for the market to digest.”\nItaly’s main bourse also outperformed as the news flow eased.\nEurope’s big carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler jumped 1 to 1.6 percent too, after China said it would cut import duty on passenger cars and car parts from July 1.\nIn Asia overnight, Japan’s Nikkei had ended 0.2 percent lower and Australian shares fell 0.7 percent. Chinese stocks finished in the red too, with the blue-chip CSI300 off 0.4 percent.\nAnalysts said investors in the region were worried about the growth outlook, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plans to increase its interest rates pushing up global borrowing costs.\n“Stocks have rallied several times on the belief that trade tensions were easing, only to fall back down as investors took the opposite view,” said James McGlew, executive director of stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut.\nA total of three hikes is almost fully priced-in by the market for 2018 although some investors expect the Fed to be more aggressive.\nCURRENCIES AND OIL Emerging market stocks snapped a three-day losing streak and many of the more beaten-down currencies, such as the Turkish lira and South African rand, pulled out of their recent dives as the dollar pulled back.\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against the main world currencies, was last down 0.3 percent at 93.40 from Monday’s five-month top of 94.058 as the euro clawed back above $1.18 too.\nElsewhere, oil prices bobbed just under highs last seen in 2014 after Venezuela’s weekend presidential election heightened persistent worries about falls in global oil output.\nThe market is bracing for the possibility of additional U.S. sanctions on the country following President Nicolas Maduro’s re-election.\nU.S. crude added 26 cents to $72.50 per barrel and Brent rose 19 cents to $79.40.\nThe combination of higher oil and conciliatory actions on the U.S.-China trade front boosted the Australian dollar , a liquid proxy for risk, to a one-month peak.\nAs the dollar edged back, gold prices eased off December lows to get to $1,294 an ounce.\nReporting by Marc Jones Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:58:27.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
