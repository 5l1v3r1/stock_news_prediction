Industry experts give Merck’s drug the edge after results from trials for both treatments last month, and Merck said on Tuesday the drug could be its largest seller ever.

REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky\nRevenue from the drug accounted for nearly 15 percent of Merck’s sales.\nMerck CEO Ken Frazier said on the company’s conference call that while the company did not expect to do transformational deals, it was looking for opportunities to enhance its drug pipeline.\n“We have a strong balance sheet. We have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage, and we’re going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth,” he said.\nMerck raised its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings to $4.16 to $4.28 per share from its previous forecast of $4.08 to $4.23 per share.\nNet income fell 52.5 percent to $736 million, or 27 cents per share, hurt by a $1.4-billion charge related to a collaboration with Eisai Co Ltd, the company said.\nExcluding items, Merck earned $1.05 per share, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $1 per share. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $10.04 billion but missed estimates of $10.11 billion.
