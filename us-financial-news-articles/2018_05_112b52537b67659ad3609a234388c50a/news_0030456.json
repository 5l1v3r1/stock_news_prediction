Some cities like Tangshan and Handan, which have a lot of plants, may apply for an extension until 2022.\nThis is the latest hit to major polluters like steel mills in Beijing’s years-long anti-smog campaign, which is aimed at cutting total emissions of small hazardous particles known as PM2.5 that can lodge in the lungs.\nThe new targets will force mills to install more equipment to curb emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and other particulate matter, increasing their production costs.\nChina’s steel capacity is about 950 million tonnes a year, and it produced 832 million tonnes of the metal last year.
