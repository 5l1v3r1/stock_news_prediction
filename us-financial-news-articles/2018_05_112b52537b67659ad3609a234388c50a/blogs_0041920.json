He told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" on Thursday what this could mean for bond markets. The U.S. 10-year yield is much higher than in Japan and Germany, but a global shortage of dollars has increased the cost of hedging these bonds. Even though U.S. yields are relatively high, they're less competitive to Treasurys overseas because of those global hedging costs. This is putting dramatic selling pressure on the 10-year and starting to upset the market. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield should hit 4 percent this year. The spot between a 3.1 percent and 3.15 percent yield offers a good buying opportunity on the TBT ProShares UltraShort Treasury ETF.\nBottom line: Non-U.S. bonds look more competitive and will continue to pressure U.S. 10-year bonds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:27:51.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
