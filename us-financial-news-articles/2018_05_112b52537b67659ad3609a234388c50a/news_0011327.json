Encana said it continues to expect 30 percent output growth from the U.S. basin.\nJefferies analyst Zach Parham said he expects Duvernay and Eagle Ford basins to return to growth in the second half of the year.\nEncana reported a rise in realized prices of all its products including oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, reflecting a broad rise in global prices.\n“Consistent with our plan, we expect significant high-margin oil and condensate growth in the second half of 2018,” said Encana Chief Executive Doug Suttles in a statement.\nEncana also bought back 10 million shares for $111 million in the quarter, as part of its $400 million buyback program.\n“This combination of robust production growth and significant margin expansion should drive peer-leading growth in cash flow,” said Raymond James analyst Chris Cox in a note.\nEncana’s adjusted income rose to $156 million, in the quarter ended March 31, from $104 million, a year earlier.\nEncana earned 16 cents per share, above an expected 13 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nEncana’s Toronto shares were up 1 percent in early trading.
