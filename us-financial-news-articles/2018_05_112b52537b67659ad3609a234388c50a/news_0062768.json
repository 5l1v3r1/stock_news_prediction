Earth Alive’s EA1 Dust Supressant gained much attention when Earth Alive was invited to participate at the live event of #DisruptMining accelerator challenge at the Innovation Expo, during the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) conference held in Toronto this year, where the EA1 product made it to the semi finals. The Board of director’s international profile was strengthened with the nomination of Mr. Ousmane Paye in March of 2018. The court proceedings brought by the Corporation’s former CEO were settled, putting an end to all pending court proceedings. The former CEO subsequently sold all of his shareholdings in Earth Alive to several groups of investors.\n“We are pleased to report that sales for this first quarter of 2018 have already surpassed those for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sales and operations are steadily improving and we are slowly building a customer base with 67% of the orders having come from existing customers that have tried and tested our products. Although, the slow rates of adoption for innovative products in the agricultural industry have been and continue to be an important challenge, moving forward, we are gaining an in-depth understanding of the process and we expect to build on these early adopters by adding industry leaders to our client base. Furthermore, we are excited by the renewed interest in the EA1 Dust Supressant following Earth Alive’s participation at the live event of #DisruptMining, during the PDAC, where Earth Alive had the unique opportunity to connect with a large audience of mining industry executives, many of whom where surprised by EA1’s simple, environmentally friendly solution to several challenges faced by today’s mining operations. We are and will continue to develop this market as well.” stated Michael Warren, the President & Chief Executive Officer.\nSubsequent Events\nIn April 2018, Earth Alive entered into a distribution agreement covering the United Kingdom, with The Growers Wholesale Ltd., a strategic long term partner that has committed to a minimum annual purchase of $200,000 during the initial twelve month period. The first sale of Earth Alive’s EA1 Dust Suppressant following our recent relaunch of the product, was made to a leading global mining group (Q2-2018) for trial purposes. Groupe Lune Rouge Inc. agreed to amend the terms of the subscription agreement entered into on October 11, 2017, in regards to their second tranche investment of up to $1M as part of the secured convertible debenture financing, to allow for draws in three equal tranches over the next twelve month period.
