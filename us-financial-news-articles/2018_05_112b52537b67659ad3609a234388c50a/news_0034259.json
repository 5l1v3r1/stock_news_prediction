The firm aims to use its 23.8 million crowns in proceeds to expand production and build a presence in the United States.\n“We are satisfied we reached the subscription. It is not too easy to convince investors to do something unknown,” Fillamentum Chief Executive Josef Dolecek said.\nBoot maker Prabos plus sold 55,635 shares, out of up to 150,000 offered, at 400 crowns apiece, the bottom of its planned 400-600 crown range. That raised gross proceeds for owner Jaroslav Palat of 22.3 million crowns and gave the company a market capitalisation of 400 million.\nPalat plans to reinvest the proceeds into the firm via subordinated debt.\nPrimoco UAV, a maker of unmanned aircraft, pulled its offering after demand failed to reach the required level.\nPrimoco had aimed to sell up to 722,154 shares at 250-350 crowns apiece. The firm said it might consider another attempt at a listing in the autumn.\nPSE chief Petr Koblic said the new market was ready and there could soon be more joiners. “Today, there were at least five or six issuers here to have a look around,” he said.\n($1 = 21.6190 Czech crowns)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:29:52.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
