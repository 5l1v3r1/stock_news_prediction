Paneuropean Oil owns 45.5 percent and the Greek government holds a 35.5 percent stake.\nThe deadline for making submissions expired at 1400 GMT on Wednesday.\nSources have said that Greece and Paneuropean Oil want to maintain a stake of about 15 percent each in Hellenic. The exact size of the holding to be sold will not be disclosed until short-listed investors are invited to submit binding offers.\nThe agency said its advisers would evaluate the expressions of interest and make recommendations to its board of directors on the companies qualifying for the next phase of the tender.
