The FTC could not be immediately contacted for a comment late on Monday.\nThe outcome will signal how Japan will handle future situations in the regional banking industry, which controls almost half of the nation’s 489 trillion yen ($4.5 trillion) in bank lending and is the lifeblood for small businesses.\n($1 = 109.2100 yen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T14:56:50.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
