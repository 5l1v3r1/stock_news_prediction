XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin and Ethereum, is the name for both a digital currency and an open payment network. It allows users to efficiently send money globally using the blockchain.\nGarlinghouse also criticized Bitcoin’s efficiency when it comes to making payments. He said it’s a bad idea for Bitcoin to replace fiat currency as the average Bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes and the transaction fees are still pretty steep.\nFor context, Ripple can handle 1,500 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can reportedly only handle seven in the same timespan. Earlier this month, actor and tech investor Ashton Kutcher donated $4 million in Ripple’s XRP tokens to wildlife charity, The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund. “We can actually transfer [the donation] into Rwandan francs right now, right here, and all we have to do is push this button and it’s in your account,” Kutcher said.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-is-like-napster-important-flop-ripple-ceo-says/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-ripple-819806/"], "published": "2018-05-31T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T18:45:37.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
