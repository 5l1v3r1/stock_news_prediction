The church did not say whether this was a factor in its decision.\nThe church, which holds socially conservative views, however did say on Tuesday that it needs to reach young people globally as it increasingly becomes a worldwide organization, with a majority of its membership living outside the United States.\n“That trend is accelerating,” the church said.\nCub Scout and Boy Scout programs serve about 330,000 Mormon youth ages 8 to 13 in the United States.\nIn May 2017, the church said it was no longer participating in two Boy Scouts of America programs for older teenagers, a change that affected more than 185,000 boys in the United States and Canada.\nThat announcement came months after the Boy Scouts began accepting transgender boys into the program. The church said this did not influence its decision to pull out of the programs.
