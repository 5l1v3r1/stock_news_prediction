(TSX-V:HTL), a leading provider of precision instruments, consumables, software and services to the Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) and developmental biology research markets, today reported financial and operational results for the quarter-ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights\nSales increased 113% year over year to $7.0 million Gross profit increased 76% year over year to $3.9 million Net income increased 120% year over year to $893 thousand Adjusted EBITDA increased 99% year over year to $1.5 million 18% organic sales growth for the quarter\n“This was a great start to the year for Hamilton Thorne,” stated David Wolf, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Sales into the human clinical market grew substantially, driven by the contribution from the Gynemed acquisition, augmented by strong increases in the sales of our clinical instruments and quality control testing services. Sales into the animal breeding market also grew substantially while sales into research markets were somewhat down. Organic growth was 18% for the quarter. As expected margins were just over 56% due to the mix of our own high-margin branded products and services and third-party products. Cash flow from operations was $749 thousand for the quarter.”\nMr. Wolf added, “We are pleased with the progress we are making in expanding our sales and marketing footprint, including the expansion of our US-based sales team, as well as additional cross-selling and marketing synergies between our North American and European-based businesses. Looking forward into the balance of the year, we expect to see continued growth in our worldwide business, driven by strong performance of our services and consumables brands, augmented by substantial growth in the US, as our new direct sales team performs to expectations. With continued earnings growth, strong cash flow from operations and a cash balance of $5.9 million at the end of the quarter, we believe we are well-positioned to continue our acquisition program.”\nThree Month Periods Ending March 31,\nStatements of Operations:\n2018 2017 Sales $7,002,736 $3,285,161 Gross profit 3,938,533 2,234,049 Operating expenses 2,923,470 1,744,114 Net income 893,121 405,237 EBITDA 1,496,216 751,272 Basic earnings per share $0.01 $0.01 Diluted earnings per share $0.01 $0.01 All amounts are in US dollars, unless specified otherwise, and results, with the exception of Adjusted EBITDA, are expressed in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").
