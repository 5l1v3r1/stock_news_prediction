I think it’s the time of year,” he told Nine Network television on Wednesday. “Now they are getting cheekier and cheekier.”\nThe seagulls congregate near the waterfront restaurants at a marina, Hillary’s Boat Harbour, scavenging leftovers or hoping for scraps from diners.\nEvans decided to equip each table with a water pistol and customers say the strategy, adopted since Saturday, works.\n“We didn’t have to throw anything at them or run for cover,” said one customer.\nReporting by Stefica Nicol Bikes; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
