It is different from the figure monitored by Greece’s EU/IMF lenders but indicates the state of the country’s finances.\nNet tax revenue came in at 14.42 billion euros, 689 million euros above target, while spending reached 15.32 billion euros, 751 million euros below target.\nThe government projects a primary budget surplus of 3.8 percent of economic output this year, according to its 2018 budget. The bailout target is for a primary surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP.
