Macruz also noted the company’s significant tax burden, which surged 53 percent in yearly terms.\nAs with previous quarters, Carrefour Brasil was also held back by stubborn food deflation in Brazil of 4 percent in the first quarter, according to government statistics. In previously reported figures, total sales rose a modest 0.4 percent.\nThe company maintained its forecast for the opening 20 new wholesale-style Atacadao stores in 2018, 20 convenience-style Express stores, and 10 supermarkets under the Market brand.\nCarrefour Brasil also pledged to expand its online marketplace, in which third-party retailers can sell via Carrefour websites, to 20 percent of its e-commerce sales by the end of the year, up from 11 percent currently.\nAmong the bright spots was the company’s e-commerce segment, which represented 6.3 percent of total non-gasoline sales in the first quarter, up from just over 3 percent last year.\nThe company’s credit segment also posted strong results, with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization jumping some 25 percent in the same period.\nCarrefour Brasil’s shares fell 4.2 percent to 15.57 reais in morning trading, their biggest intraday loss since early February. $1 = 3.62 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery and Carolina Mandl; Editing by Bernadette Baum", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:44:12.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
