REUTERS/Ints Kalnins Police said Martins Bunkus was shot by two men as he drove through the surburbs of Riga in early morning. His attackers escaped in a van which was later found abandoned and burnt out.\n“We think that it was a carefully planned murder ... connected with the victim’s professional work. We think we are dealing here with organized crime,” Andrejs Grisins, a police official, told journalists. Bunkus had reported death threats to police in 2016, he added.\nThe killing casts a cloud over efforts by the former Soviet-ruled European Union state of 2 million people to fight corruption.\nLatvian police expert inspect a car at the crime scene where insolvency administrator Martins Bunkus was murdered in Riga, Latvia May 30, 2018.

Both the governor and bank deny wrongdoing.\nBunkus worked on the winding down of Trasta Komercbanka, a bank that lost its license in 2016 after it broke anti-money laundering and terror-financing rules, said one person with knowledge of the matter.\nThere is no suggestion his involvement with this process was connected with his murder.\nWriting By John O'Donnell; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:28:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
