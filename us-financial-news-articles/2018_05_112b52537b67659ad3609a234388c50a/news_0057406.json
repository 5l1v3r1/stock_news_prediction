The group EBIT margin fell to 1.6 percent over the period from 5.5 percent a year earlier.\nFirst quarter rose $5.41 billion, up 17.1 percent from the year-earlier period, buoyed by a rise of 15 percent in volumes, CMA CGM said, citing good results of vessel-sharing Ocean Alliance and strong momentum of the African/US and North America/South America lines.\nCMA CGM expects the market to see strong volume growth in 2018.\n“In this context, CMA CGM expects an improvement in the market environment in the second half of 2018, excluding bunker costs and the impact of exchange rates,” it said.\nReporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Mathieu Rosemain\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:32:21.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
