The dollar’s rise also helped pushed down gold to its low point for the year.\nData showed that U.S. retail sales rose moderately in April as higher gasoline prices cut into discretionary spending, but consumer spending appeared on track to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month, while data for March was revised up to show sales surging 0.8 percent instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent.\nThe data indicated consumer spending is stronger than expected by the market, said Jon Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders North America in New York.\n“The implication is that means inflation has more upside potential, which means the Fed is more likely than not to hike four times this year, versus what the market was pricing in a month ago, which is two to three times,” Mackay said.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 26/32 in price to yield 3.0889 percent, from 2.995 percent late on Monday, rising to its highest point since July 2011.\nThe dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, rose 0.63 percent, with the euro down 0.62 percent to $1.1851.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 191.98 points, or 0.77 percent, to 24,707.43, the S&P 500 lost 19.4 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,710.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 64.97 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,346.35.\n“The reason why equity market is falling today is because we are once again pondering if the strength of the U.S. economy is enough to make the Fed raise faster in the future,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nAfter improved trade sentiment helped stocks on Monday, equities were again jostled by developments involving U.S.-China talks.\nEarlier on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said the United States wanted a timetable on how China would open up its markets to U.S. exports, with the two countries still not close to resolving trade frictions.\n“A little bit of today’s jitters are related to a hangover to yesterday’s wrongly placed exuberance that a trade deal was imminent and the reality is we are in for a long slugfest between the U.S. and China,” Mackay said.\nHome Depot shares fell 1.2 percent after the home improvement chain missed Wall Street’s sales forecast.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.14 percent.\nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.86 percent amid weak economic data from Germany and China.\nOil prices hovered around multi-year highs, supported by concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran are likely to restrict crude oil exports from one of the biggest producers in the Middle East.\nU.S. crude rose 0.55 percent to $71.35 per barrel and Brent was last at $78.41, up 0.23 percent on the day.\nSpot gold dropped 1.8 percent to $1,289.21 an ounce, touching its lowest point of the year.\nAdditional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Kate Duguid in New York, Medha Singh in Bengaluru and Alasdair Pal in London; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
