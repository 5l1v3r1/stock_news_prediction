We will continue our path with the support of our nation.” Related Coverage Iran's Zarif tweets that U.S. is repeating mistakes on Iran\nTension between the two countries has grown notably since Trump this month withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement aimed at preventing Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nA senior Iranian official said Pompeo’s remarks showed that the United States was pushing for “regime change,” a charged phrase often associated with the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein.\nPompeo warned that if Iran fully resumed its nuclear programme Washington would be ready to respond and said the administration would hold companies doing prohibited business in Iran to account.\n“Our demands on Iran are not unreasonable: give up your programme,” Pompeo said, “Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we are fully prepared to respond to that as well,” he said, declining to elaborate.\nPompeo said Washington would work with the Defense Department and allies, including Arab Gulf states and Israel, to counter Iran in the cyberspace and maritime areas.\nThe Pentagon said it would take all necessary steps to confront Iranian behaviour in the region and was assessing whether that could include new actions or doubling down on current ones. NAMING NAMES\nPompeo said if Iran made major changes, the United States was prepared to ease sanctions, re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relations and support the country’s re-integration into the international economic system.\nThe speech did not explicitly call for regime change but Pompeo repeatedly urged the Iranian people not to put up with their leaders, specifically naming President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n“At the end of the day the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership,” Pompeo said.\nSuzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Brooking Institution think tank’s foreign policy programme, said Pompeo’s speech did indeed amount to a strategy of regime change.\n“There is only one way to read it and that is that Trump administration has wedded itself to a regime-change strategy to Iran, one that is likely to alienate our allies. One with dubious prospects for success,” she said.\nThe administration’s approach “explicitly puts the onus on the Iranian people to change their leadership or face cataclysmic financial pressure,” said Maloney who has advised the State Department on Iran in the Bush administration between 2005-2007.\nLebanese analyst Ghaleb Kandil, who has close ties to the pro-Iran Hezbollah group, said Washington’s demands have previously not worked.\n“These are conditions that were tested in previous phases of American pressures, before the nuclear deal, when Iran was in more difficult circumstances than it is in these days, and it did not surrender to these conditions or accept them,” said Kandil.\nPompeo outlined 12 U.S. demands for Iran including to stop uranium enrichment, never to pursue plutonium reprocessing and to close its heavy water reactor.\nIt also had to declare all previous military dimensions of its nuclear programme and to permanently and verifiably abandon such work, he said.\nPompeo’s demand that Tehran stop uranium enrichment goes even further than the nuclear deal. Iran says its nuclear work has medical uses and will produce energy to meet domestic demand and complement its oil reserves.\nEuropean parties to the nuclear deal - France, Britain and Germany - are working to find a way to keep the nuclear pact in effect after Washington’s exit.\nPompeo said Washington would be open to a new treaty and wanted the support of America’s allies, not just in Europe.

They know where we stand,” he said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had urged Trump to pull out of the deal, praised the administration’s position on Monday.\n“We believe this is the right policy. We believe it’s the only policy that can ultimately guarantee the security of the Middle East and peace in our region,” he said in Jerusalem.
