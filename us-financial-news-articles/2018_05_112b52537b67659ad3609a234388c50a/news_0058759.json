Facebook and WhatsApp are widely used in Uganda and many other African countries.\nDigital advocacy group the World Wide Web Foundation says data costs in Africa are among the world’s highest, a fact blamed for slow internet penetration and limited use even for those connected.\n“Data right now is essential in nearly every worker’s day to day business, a responsible government should be lowering its price not the opposite,” said Diana Taremwa, a charity worker in the capital Kampala.\nCritics of Museveni, 73, say his government employs a wide array of tactics to limit political debate, trample on civil rights and stifle the opposition.\nMuseveni has won a series of elections but his opponents say these have been rigged in his favor. His main rival, Kizza Besigye, has been jailed dozens of times since he first run against him in 2001.\nSome opposition critics have in the past been charged for allegedly insulting him in posts on Facebook.\nIn the last presidential election in 2016, authorities also blocked access to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp saying the platforms would be used by the opposition to mobilize protests.
