One study found that adding 20 minutes to your commute makes you as miserable as taking a 19 percent pay cut. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and economist Alan Krueger once surveyed 900 people and found that commuting was their least favorite activity of all, behind work, child care and home chores.\nUnfortunately, Americans are commuting longer than ever before and it's having a serious impact their lives. Vox's Kimberly Mas points out that commuting has been linked to obesity, stress, anxiety, depression, higher blood pressure, higher rates of divorce, neck and back pain and shorter lifespans.\nshow chapters These are the 10 happiest states in the US 9:59 AM ET Fri, 23 Feb 2018 | 01:21 And yet, commute times have modestly but steadily increased over the past several decades. According to the U.S. Census, in 1990 the average commute time was less than 22 minutes . Today, Americans spend just over 26 minutes commuting to work each way.\nThese four extra minutes spent on commuting equates to eight minutes a day (4 x 2) round trip, 40 (8 x 5) extra minutes each week and 2080 (40 x 52) extra minutes of commuting each year. This means that commuters now are spending 34.6 more hours in transit — a whole work week — than workers in the 1990s.\nOf course, where you live dramatically impacts how long it takes you to travel to work.

New Yorkers, for instance, endure the longest commutes — 32.6 minutes on average.\nLong commutes like these are just one of the reasons more Americans are working remotely than ever before .
