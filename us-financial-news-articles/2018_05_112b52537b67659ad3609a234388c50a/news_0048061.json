Investors overwhelmingly expect a rate rise at the next meeting on June 12-13.\nShares of rate-sensitive utilities and real estate gained following the release of the minutes, leading percentage gains among sectors.\nAt 2:36 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 60.9 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,773.51, the S&P 500 lost 2.04 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,722.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,392.28.\nTiffany surged 21.8 percent after the jeweler’s quarterly results blew past estimates and the company raised its full-year profit forecast and announced a $1 billion buyback program.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 38 new lows.
