REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\nDedicated to the memory of John Hurt and Jean Rochefort, two deceased actors who starred in earlier, abandoned versions, the movie has long-time Gilliam collaborator Jonathan Pryce as Quixote, alongside Star Wars’ actor Adam Driver.\n“I was the victim of Don Quixote, he wouldn’t leave me alone. He stalked me for 24, 25 years,” Gilliam told Reuters in at the Cannes Film Festival.\n“It’s not the film I set out to make, it’s a much better film. The film I set out (to make) was just not a patch on what this film is. It’s taken all those years of marinating in my life to get there,” he said ahead of the world premiere.\nA version starring Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis made it to the screen only in a 2002 documentary, “Lost In La Mancha” which charts the film’s descent into oblivion.\nInitially, the plot was about a man who wakes up in the 17th century, believing he is the hero of Miguel de Cervantes’ novel.\nIn the final version, Driver plays an obnoxious director of TV adverts who realizes the Spanish location he is filming in is near where he made his film-school movie, “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote”, a decade earlier. 71st Cannes Film Festival - Photocall for the film \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" out of competition - Cannes, France, May 19, 2018 - Director Terry Gilliam, cast members Rossy de Palma and Sergi Lopez. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\nHe tracks down the man he cast as the lead, now a deluded geriatric convinced he really is Don Quixote living in the age of chivalry. “SURREAL”\nDriver, who stars in another prominent Cannes movie, Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman”, said it was “surreal” to be working with directors whose work he grew up watching.\nHaving acted in Martin Scorsese’s 2016 “Silence”, which also took decades to make, he was not daunted about joining “Quixote”, in the shoes of Johnny Depp.\n“Any movie that actually comes together is always a miracle,” Driver said.

Until, basically, he got the part because finally his eyebrows got so bushy we didn’t have to have extra makeup for them.”\n“The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” is playing, out-of-competition, as the closing film of the Cannes Film Festival which ends on Saturday.
