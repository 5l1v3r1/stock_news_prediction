We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We use certain financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of our performance.\nEBITDA consists of net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that making such adjustment provides investors meaningful information to understand our results of operations and the ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and acquisition and integration related costs. We believe that making such adjustment provides investors meaningful information to understand our results of operations and the ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.\nWe believe both financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the term EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from that of others in our industry. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net loss before taxes, net loss, loss per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of performance.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitation as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBTIDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt;\nEBTIDA and Adjusted EBITDA eliminate the impact of income taxes on our results of operations;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant acquisition and integration related costs related to mergers and acquisitions;\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant non cash stock compensation expense which should be viewed as a component of recurring operating costs; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures.\nIn addition, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements.\nWe compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include gross profit, net loss, net loss per share and other performance measures.\nIn evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nReconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss (In thousands, unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss $ (23,862 ) $ (15,654 ) Add: Interest expense, net 4,873 702 Income tax (benefit) provision (103 ) 150 Depreciation expense 1,531 658 Amortization expense 6,722 1,949 EBITDA (10,839 ) (12,195 ) Stock-based compensation 7,832 3,097 Acquisition and integration related costs 1,569 — Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,438 ) $ (9,098 ) Media:\nCourtney McLeod\n914-265-6789\ncmcleod@teladoc.com\nInvestors:\nWestwicke Partners\nJordan E.
