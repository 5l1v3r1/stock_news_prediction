(\"iAnthus\" or \"the Company\"), (CSE: IAN , OTCQB: ITHUF), which owns, operates, and partners with licensed cannabis operations throughout the United States, is pleased to announce the release of its financial results for the fourth quarter (\"Q4 2017\") and fiscal year 2017 (\"FY 2017\"), and to provide an update on the Company's existing and future operations.\nHadley Ford, CEO of iAnthus, provided the following statement on the Company's operations:\n\"The past year has brought major developments for iAnthus, including acquisitions in the major east coast markets of Florida and New York, the continued buildout of a world-class operations team led by Carlos Perea (Chief Operating Officer), and the establishment of iAnthus as one of the U.S. cannabis industry's most well-known and well-funded companies.\nOur vision is to create the most valuable network of cannabis operations and distribution in the United States. We have prioritized long-term, sustainable growth that provides immediate and future value to our investors, customers and industry partners. To that end, we have focused on building out state-of-the-art, highly automated cultivation facilities in Massachusetts, New York, and Florida that we anticipate will greatly reduce our future cultivation and production costs, while providing a superior and more consistent product to our patients and customers. Our dispensary locations in Florida, Massachusetts, and New York, have prioritized ease of access for our patients and customers and the designs have relied on their feedback and engagement. Our approach should result in dispensaries located in high traffic locations in densely populated areas and allow us to develop a loyal following of patients and customers with whom we will foster meaningful, long-term relationships.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal year 2018, iAnthus will continue to be opportunistic in building our network in high growth U.S. markets. The U.S. cannabis market still represents a vast untapped potential, and we plan to remain well-funded and flexible to create shareholder value through strategic opportunities when they arise. While we will not always want to be the first to market, we feel it is crucial to seize unique opportunities when they are available.\nThe past year has seen iAnthus solidify an unprecedented position in east coast states. By adding the markets of New York and Florida to our strong presence in Massachusetts and Vermont, we now have the licensed opportunity to sell cannabis to a population of over 48 million with very limited competition. We look forward to building on that elite presence throughout 2018, while continuing to establish ourselves as a best-in-class operator.\"\n2017 and 2018 Year-to-Date Corporate Highlights:\nBecame the sole member of the not-for-profit Mayflower Medicinals, Inc.
