REUTERS/Rogan Ward/File Photo\nRamaphosa, who replaced Jacob Zuma as head of state in February and has promised to crack down on graft, said the terms of reference for the inquiry would be published in the coming days.\n“The stabilisation of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) has received priority attention,” Ramaphosa told parliament, adding that he had signed a proclamation establishing the tax commission on Wednesday.\nThe inquiry will include investigating the handling of revenue shortfalls, the unauthorised payment of bonuses to top executives and the withholding of refunds to ordinary tax payers, a treasury official told parliament.\nTom Moyane, the suspended head of SARS, was earlier this month served with disciplinary charges related to alleged misconduct during his tenure. He denies any wrongdoing.\nMoyane is one of several government officials Ramaphosa has replaced since taking over from scandal-plagued Zuma as part of a drive to tackle endemic corruption.
