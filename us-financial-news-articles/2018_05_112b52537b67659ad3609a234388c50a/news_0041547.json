REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/Files Skripal, 66, a former colonel in Russia’s military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain, and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.\nBritain’s accusations that Russia was behind the nerve agent attack led to a Russia-West crisis in which Western governments, including the United States, have expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind.\nThe Skripals were in a critical condition for weeks and doctors at one point feared that, even if they survived, they might have suffered brain damage. But their health began to improve rapidly, and Yulia was discharged last month.\n“It is fantastic news that Sergei Skripal is well enough to leave Salisbury District Hospital,” the hospital’s Chief Executive Cara Charles-Barks said in a statement.\nPolice have said they will not give any details of the Skripals’ new security arrangements in the interests of their safety and neither they nor the hospital gave any details of Sergei’s new whereabouts. Yulia was taken to a secure location after her release, the BBC reported at the time.\nBritain and international chemicals weapons inspectors say the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok, a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.\nA spokeswoman for British Prime Minister Theresa May, who called the attack a “reckless and despicable act”, welcomed news of Skripal’s discharge.\nRussia has denied involvement in the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two.\nMoscow suggested Britain carried out the attack itself to stoke anti-Russian hysteria, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last month that the agent used in the attack may have never been made in Russia.\nRussia’s ambassador to London on Friday welcomed Skripal’s progress but reiterated Russia’s desire to see the pair, saying that currently Britain was not fulfilling its obligations under international law.\n“We’re happy that he’s alright,” Alexander Yakovenko told reporters.\n“We’re still demanding the access to these people. We want just to understand how they feel and we want them to say personally what they want. If they don’t want our assistance it’s fine. We want to see them physically.”\nBritain has said previously that Yulia, a Russian citizen, has chosen not to take up Russia’s offer of help.\nSalisbury Hospital said that patient confidentiality limited the information they could give, but that the “acutely unwell” Skripals had been stabilised and kept alive until their bodies could replace poisoned enzymes with new ones.\nThe forensic tent, covering the bench where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found, is repositioned by officials in protective suits in the centre of Salisbury, Britain, March 8, 2018.
