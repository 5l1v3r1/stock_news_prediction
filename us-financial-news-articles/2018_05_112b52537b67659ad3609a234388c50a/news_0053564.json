May democracy flourish,” one of the protest leaders, Rangsiman Rome, 26, shouted as he walked into court.\nThe 15 pro-democracy activists had been in police custody since the protest, when most of them surrendered to police, although a handful were forcibly taken away, Reuters reporters said at the time.\n“The court agreed to release them on condition that they don’t participate in political gatherings that are illegal again,” the lawyer, Kisadang Nutjarat, told Reuters.\nBail was set at 100,000 baht ($3,123) for each activist.\nPolice had earlier asked for the men to be held in custody for 12 days during their investigations.\nHundreds of activists had joined in the protest at a university in Bangkok’s old town, near the regional headquarters of the United Nations, to demand a general election in November.\nAbout 3,000 police blocked the demonstrators from marching to Government House, the site of the prime minister’s office.\nThe protesters later dispersed peacefully after the group’s leaders turned themselves in.\nAll 15 protesters have been charged with sedition, violating a junta ban on political gatherings of more than five people and illegal assembly that caused violence, among other charges.\nThey face up to seven years in prison if found guilty.\nRights group Amnesty International urged Thai authorities to drop all charges against them.\n“Detaining and charging peaceful protesters makes a mockery of the promise that authorities will lift political restrictions within the next month,” Katherine Gerson, a Southeast Asia campaigner for the group, said in a statement.\nThe military government plans to meet political parties next month to discuss ground rules for the general election, among them easing curbs on political activities.\nAs army chief, Prayuth led the 2014 coup the military said was necessary to put an end to months of street protests and political gridlock.
