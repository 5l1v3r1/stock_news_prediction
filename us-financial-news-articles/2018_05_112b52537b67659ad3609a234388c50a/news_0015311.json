(OTCBB:SRNN), the holding company for The Southern Bank Company announced net income of approximately $112,000, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to a net loss of approximately $63,000, or ($0.08) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2018 the Company recorded a net loss of approximately $625,000, which included an income tax expense of approximately $655,000 due to the recent tax law changes, as compared to a net loss of approximately $346,000 for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nGates Little, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated that the Company’s net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018 the Company’s net interest margin improved as compared to the same period in 2017. Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $1.1 million as compared to approximately $844,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $217,000 or 25.7%. The improvement in the net interest margin for the quarter was primarily attributable to an increase in total interest income of approximately $240,000 or 23.4%, offset in part by a decrease in interest and dividends on securities of approximately $40,000 and an increase in interest on borrowing of approximately $28,000. Provision for loan and lease losses decreased approximately $76,000 during the quarter as compared to the same period in 2017. Net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses increased approximately $293,000 or 38.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same quarter in 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total non-interest income increased approximately $17,000 or 53.1% while total non-interest expense increased approximately $57,000 or 6.3% as compared to the same three month period in 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in gain on sale of securities of approximately $7,000, customer service fees of $7,000 and miscellaneous income of $3,000. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and employee benefits of approximately $17,000, professional services of approximately $28,000, loss on sale of securities of approximately $9,000, other operating expenses of approximately $4,000, offset in part by a decrease in office building and equipment expenses of approximately $5,000.\nFor the nine-months ended March 31, 2018, net interest income increased approximately $749,000 or 29.7%. Provision for loan and lease losses increased approximately $185,000 or 46.8% during the nine-month period as compared to the same period in 2017. Net interest income after provision for loan and lease losses increased approximately $564,000 or 26.5% for the nine-months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. For the nine-months ended March 31, 2018, total non-interest income increased approximately $21,000 or 19.2% while total non-interest expense increased approximately $10,000 or 0.4% as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in non-interest income was primarily attributable to increases in customer service fees of approximately $14,000, miscellaneous income of approximately $23,000 offset in part by a decrease in gain on sale of securities of approximately $16,000. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in professional service expenses of approximately $11,000, other operating expense of approximately $17,000, loss on sale of securities of approximately $9,000, offset in part by decreases in salaries and employee benefits of approximately $10,000, office building and equipment expenses of approximately $13,000, data processing expenses of approximately $4,000.\nThe Company’s total assets at March 31, 2018 were approximately $98.6 million, as compared to $96.5 million at June 30, 2017. Total stockholders’ equity was approximately $10.9 million at March 31, 2018 or 11.0% of total assets as compared to approximately $11.8 million at June 30, 2017 or approximately 12.3% of total assets.\nThe Bank has four offices located in Gadsden, Albertville, Guntersville, and Centre, Alabama.
