It said the move had been agreed with the countryâ€™s EU/IMF creditors.\nIn February, the finance ministry similarly eased capital controls by raising the monthly withdrawal limit by 28 percent.\nReporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T10:59:51.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
