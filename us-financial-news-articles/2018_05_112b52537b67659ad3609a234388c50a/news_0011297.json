The average yield rose to 2.34 tonnes per hectare,” the exchange said in its weekly crop report. “Under this scenario, we maintain our final production estimate at 38 million tonnes.”\nCorn harvesting has begun in most of the Pampas farm belt, which is focused in the central provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe and Entre Rios.\n“Nevertheless, rainfalls have hindered the collection of late-planted corn in several parts of the agricultural region,” the report said.\nAs of Thursday it said 32.5 percent of the 2017/18 corn crop had been brought in, with the national average yield at 7.16 tonnes per hectare. The exchange maintained its final commercial corn crop estimate at 32 million tonnes.\nReporting by Hugh Bronstein; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:06:32.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
