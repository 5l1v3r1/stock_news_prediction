The Board urges Destination's stockholders to vote on the WHITE proxy card \" FOR \" the Company's highly qualified slate of nominees: Barry Erdos, Melissa Payner-Gregor, Peter Longo and Pierre-André Mestre .\n\"We appreciate and share ISS's concerns about handing over control of your Company to the dissident Miller Group, including the significant risks inherent in such a change. Furthermore, while we strongly disagree with ISS's refusal to recommend the full slate of Destination's highly qualified, experienced and engaged Director nominees, we are pleased that ISS recommends voting the WHITE proxy card and recognizes the importance of Peter Longo's and Pierre-André Mestre's continued Board membership to Destination's future growth plans and continued success. We are confident stockholders will reach the conclusion that all of Destination's nominees, including Mr. Erdos, the Chairman of the Board, and Ms. Payner-Gregor, Destination's interim CEO, are the most qualified individuals to continue to execute the Company's ongoing initiatives.\"\nIn its report, ISS said:\nThe company's recent results are showing some positive signs.\nRecent improvements in sales… may give shareholders hope that improvement is finally occurring.\n…the board's refreshment [by the addition of Mr. Longo and Mr. Mestre] does appear appropriate.\n…the dissident's failure to disclose a sufficiently detailed business plan, along with the fact that none of the dissident's nominees have previously served on public company boards, raises some concern regarding a complete replacement of the board.\n…the dissident has not presented a strong enough business plan to justify election of a majority slate, which could bring additional risk to shareholders.\nIf the dissident nominees were to gain control of the board, shareholders could face business risks, as well as risks associated with a potentially suboptimal transaction. Twice so far in 2018, the company has rejected offers made by the dissident - at discounts to where the stock was trading - which could have resulted in the dissident owning at least 49.9 percent of DEST shares. Shareholders may be concerned that a dissident-controlled board might be more agreeable to such a transaction.\n\"We believe the four nominees put forth by a dissident group of stockholders led by the Miller Group would not be additive to your Board and lack the decades of corporate leadership and board experience in the retail and apparel industry currently represented in Destination's Boardroom. We strongly urge stockholders to reject the Gold proxy card , reject the Miller Group's efforts to gain control of your Company , and reject the Miller Group's efforts to replace the Company's entire Board with unproven, untested and less qualified individuals .\"\nWith the Annual Meeting rapidly approaching, Destination urges stockholders to protect the value of their investment by voting \" FOR \" ALL of the Company's highly-qualified director nominees on the WHITE proxy card: Barry Erdos, Melissa Payner-Gregor, Peter Longo and Pierre-André Mestre.\nStockholders can vote by telephone, online or by signing and dating the enclosed WHITE proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope.\nIf you have any questions, require assistance in voting your WHITE proxy card,\nor need additional copies of the Company's proxy materials,\nplease contact Okapi Partners at the phone numbers or email listed below.\nOkapi Partners LLC\n1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24 th Floor\nNew York, New York 10036\n+ 1 (212) 297-0720 (Main)\n+ 1 (855) 208-8903 (Toll-Free)\nEmail: info@okapipartners.com\nAbout Destination Maternity\nDestination Maternity Corporation is the world's largest designer and retailer of maternity apparel.
