REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier\nBased on the true story of Iraqi women who took up arms against Islamic State after escaping enslavement, a female battalion leads an attack on the jihadists while their brothers in arms prefer to wait for U.S. air strikes.\nThe reason their enemies fear them, we learn, is that they believe if they are killed by a woman, they will not go to heaven as a martyr.\nThe story, by French director Eva Husson follows Mathilde, a reporter embedded with the fighters who learns the horrific back-story of their leader Bahar, played by “Pirates of the Caribbean” star Golshifteh Farahani. 71st Cannes Film Festival – Photocall for the film “Girls of the Sun” (Les filles du soleil) in competition – Cannes, France May 13, 2018.

REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier\nThe film premiered to rapturous applause at Cannes on Saturday night, just after Cate Blanchett led a demonstration by female actors, directors and producers on the red carpet to support the campaign for women’s rights after the sex abuse scandals that shook the movie industry last year.\nWhile the film’s setting is kept vague, the story was inspired by Islamic State’s attack on members of the Yazidi faith in Sinjar, northern Iraq, in 2014, when they killed the men and traded the women and girls as sex slaves.

I think we can all feel the rumbling, the coming to the boil of the narrative voice of women.”\nSome critics found “Girls of the Sun” contrived. Variety said it was “well-intentioned yet cliché-riddled lunge at the tear ducts,” while The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called it “heartfelt, forthright and muscular”.\nThe film is in competition for the Palme d’Or which will be awarded on May 19.
