Then on June 4, third parties would have been allowed to make competing bids, in which case the two companies could make new offers.\nNeoenergia argued the rules were unfair as current bidders would have to disclose their strategy beforehand, but not a potential third party, according to the source.\nThe court determined that all contenders will now present their bids together on an auction in the stock exchange on June 4.
