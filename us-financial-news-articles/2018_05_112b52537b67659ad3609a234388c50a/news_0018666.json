The move higher followed President Donald Trump 's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal .\nMeanwhile, the 10-year Treasury broke above 3 percent, a key psychological level that puts markets on edge.\nHowever, Mahn isn't concerned about rising rates. He said investors just need to position themselves properly.\n\"Rising rates are a sign of a good strong healthy economy,\" he said.\nMichael Farr, however, admitted the bond market action \"does scare me a little.\"\nThe yield curve, which tracks the difference between longer- and shorter-term bond yields, is flattening, meaning they are getting closer together. Investors are concerned it may invert, which means long-term Treasury yields would be lower than short-term yields. Historically, when that happens, an economic recession has usually followed.\nFarr, president of investment management firm Farr, Miller and Washington, said he'll be watching the Federal Reserve as it continues to raise its federal funds rate .\n\"They can tighten too much. I think that they can choke out growth, and it does have me nervous,\" he said.\nThat said, right now he's still betting on stocks — he's just expecting more volatility.\n— CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.
