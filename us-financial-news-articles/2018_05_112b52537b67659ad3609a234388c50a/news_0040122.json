It did not provide more detail on further proceedings.\nBosnian judge Branko Peric has said Sarac was suspected by Tunisia of “instigating terrorist acts and of membership of a terrorist organisation, as well as of harming public order and international security”. Sarac has denied any wrongdoing.\nMohammed Zawari, an aerospace engineer and drone expert, was shot dead in December 2016 near the city of Sfax. Tunisian authorities said they had arrested 10 Tunisians but that two foreigners suspected of plotting the killing had escaped.\nHamas blamed Israel for the killing of Zawari, who had been a member of its organisation for 10 years, it said.\nPolice in Croatia arrested a Bosnian citizen wanted by Tunisia for the same assassination in March.\nA Croatian court ruled last week that he could be extradited to Tunisia, although his lawyers said they would appeal.
