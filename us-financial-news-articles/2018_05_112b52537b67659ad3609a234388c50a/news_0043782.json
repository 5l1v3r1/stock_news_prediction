The Condor GR4 is a single slot, SWaP-conscious card designed for today’s rugged Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) applications such as avionics, manned and unmanned video streaming and security/surveillance.\nSelwyn L. Henriques, president and CEO of EIZO Rugged Solutions, commented, “The Condor GR4 3U VPX card is the perfect solution for today’s ISR market that is transitioning to 3G-SDI. Our ISR customers typically have 3-4 sensors per gimbal and have been demanding a single slot, SWaP-conscious card that does everything – ingest information from the sensors, output this high definition data over 3G-SDI, process it using the GPU and then encode each stream using the onboard H.265/H.264 encoder.\n“The Condor GR4 3U VPX product provides all this in a single slot solution and has already been integrated into a few large-scale ISR programs,” added Mr. Henriques. “We are now working with several other partners to bring this proven technology to those that may have similar requirements.”\nThe Condor GR4 3U VPX offers four 3G-SDI inputs and four 3G-SDI outputs and a DisplayPort output. With NVIDIA GPUDirect™ Direct Memory Access (DMA) support, the captured video data is transferred directly into GPU memory for processing or display, both resulting in extremely low latency. The MIL-STD-810G compliant card supports PCI Express 3.0 (up to 8 lanes) and is available in conduction-cooled and air-cooled variants.\n“NVIDIA Pascal GPU technology has been gaining popularity due to its high-performance graphics and GPGPU computing using CUDA or OpenCL,” added Selwyn L. Henriques. “As the sensor resolutions increase to HD and Ultra HD resolutions, the volume of computations for such image processing is significantly higher. For example, customers need a way to get full frame rate 3G-SDI video into the GPU, perform analysis and process the data with low latency.”\nThe Condor GR4 3U VPX graphics and video capture card comes with an option of either the Pascal architecture-based NVIDIA® Quadro P5000 or Quadro P3000. The boards have 16 GB and 6 GB GDDR5 graphics memory and 192 or 168 GB/s memory bandwidth on P5000 and P3000 products respectively. GPGPU computing and input processing tasks are simplified through an API provided by EIZO.\nEIZO Rugged Solutions has built a reputation for its flexibility and responsiveness to customer requirements, offering engineering support pre- and post-sale as well as a genuine willingness to modify designs to fit specific and unique customer needs.\nEIZO Rugged Solutions designs all its ITAR-free graphics and video products – Condor, Tyton, Hydra, and Adapt – at its headquarters in Altamonte Springs, Florida, USA. These rugged graphics, video capture, video conversion, video management, encoding and streaming solutions, serve customers in the defense, security, aerospace, avionics, transportation, maritime, and industrial markets. All products are manufactured in the USA.\nEIZO Rugged Solutions will be showcasing its Condor GR4 3U VPX card in booth 1251 at SOFIC (Special Operations Forces Industry Conference) from May 21-24 in Tampa, Florida, USA.\nFor more information on the Condor GR4 3U VPX card or any other product from EIZO Rugged Solutions, please visit www.eizorugged.com , email condor@eizo.com or call +1 (407) 262-7100.\nMedia photo:\nhttp://www.eizorugged.com/press/releases/images/Condor_GR4_3U_VPX_press.jpg\nProduct datasheet:\nhttp://www.eizorugged.com/support/brochures/pdfs/Condor_GR4_3U_VPX.pdf\n-ends-\nAbout EIZO Rugged Solutions\nEIZO Rugged Solutions Inc. has been developing graphics and video solutions for air traffic control, military, and embedded applications for over 30 years.
