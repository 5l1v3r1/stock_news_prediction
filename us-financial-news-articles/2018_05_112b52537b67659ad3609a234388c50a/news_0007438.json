Maybe you've been working toward this goal since you took your first job and it's finally on the horizon. But what happens if you don't have enough money saved to retire?\nYou don't want to be stuck working forever, but do you have a choice if the investments in your portfolio aren't enough to support you? The good news is, there are things you can do if you are in this situation, but you need to act now. You need to explore your options, understand what you can do to make a positive impact to your financial situation, and focus on what you can control.\n1. Change your retirement timeline. It might not be ideal, but you can still have the retirement you want if you're willing to work a little longer for it. Working an extra five years can have a massive impact on your nest egg. Since the last years of your career are also usually your highest-earning years, this could help you make the catch-up contributions you need to make your nest egg large enough to fund your retirement.\nIf the thought of five more years of your existing job is unbearable, consider how you could improve the situation. Could you reduce your hours? Request flex time? Work from home some (or all) days each week? Talk to your supervisor about your options, and get creative to make a few extra years feel a little less like work.\nMore from Fixed Income Strategies:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T16:04:20.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
