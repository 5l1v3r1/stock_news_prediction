His 12-month stock price target of $65 implies more than 18 percent upside over the next year.\nThough Square said it sold a total of $34.1 million in bitcoin in the first quarter, it initially spent $33.9 million to purchase the cryptocurrency, netting a final adjusted revenue of just $200,000.\nShares of Square were up 1.9 percent Wednesday morning.\nDespite issuing guidance that fell short of Wall Street's expectations earlier this month, Square has outperformed the broader stock market over the past year, up 57 percent since January and 168 percent year over year.\nIn its first-quarter earnings report earlier in May, the payments company said it will continue to reinvest, focusing on revenue growth over profit expansion.\n\"Given the significant market opportunity ahead of us, we will continue to reinvest in our business to drive future growth,\" it said in a statement this month.\nGross payment volume grew 31 percent to $17.8 billion for the quarter, in line with the growth rate seen in the fourth quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:51:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
