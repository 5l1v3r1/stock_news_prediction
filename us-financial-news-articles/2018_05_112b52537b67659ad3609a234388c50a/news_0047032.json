Tennis - ATP World Tour Masters 1000 - Italian Open - Foro Italico, Rome, Italy - May 20, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates after winning the final against Germany's Alexander Zverev REUTERS/Tony Gentile\nThe win gave the Spaniard his 56th title on clay and he will reclaim the world number one ranking from Roger Federer when the revised ATP standings are released on Monday.\n“My first victory here in 2005 was one of the most beautiful victories of my career,” Nadal said after collecting his eighth title in Rome, yet his first since 2013. “To have this trophy again with me after so many years is really very special.”\nNadal made a shaky start, losing his serve in the opening game before bouncing back.\nThe 31-year-old top seed broke Zverev to level the score and then turned up the heat, striking eight winners and making only four unforced errors to his opponent’s 10 to take the opener.\nZverev regrouped, holding for the first time in the match at the start of the second set before breaking Nadal to lead 2-0.

COMEBACK\nThe Spaniard broke back immediately after the restart to draw level at 3-3 and then held to 15 to get his nose in front.\nScenting blood, Nadal did what he does best, hounding Zverev into coughing up another break point that he claimed with a stunning crosscourt backhand volley.\nHis confidence soaring, Nadal served for the match, gaining two match points with a trademark forehand winner.\nZverev saved the first, but could do nothing about the second as Nadal dropped a short volley over the net to claim the title.\n“You’re the greatest clay court player of all time and I think everybody saw that today,” Zverev said.
