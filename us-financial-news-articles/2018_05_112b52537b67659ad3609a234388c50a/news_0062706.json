Excluding the paper business, adjusted operating profit rose 7 percent.\nFull-year revenue rose 7 percent to 494 million pounds, and the company kept its full-year dividend per share at 25 pence.\n“There are encouraging signs that growth is starting to appear in areas of the business where investment has been made,” Investec analysts wrote in a note, keeping their “buy” rating on the stock.\nProceeds of 60 million pounds from the paper unit sale, along with a huge reduction in pension liabilities due to a change in the inflation measure the company uses to calculate the deficit, helped De La Rue more than halve its net debt to 49.9 million pounds, its lowest in five years.\n“What we like to do is to use the proceeds of the paper sale ... to drive strategic growth going forward organically and maybe inorganically,” Sutherland told analysts on the call when asked about his priorities for the company’s cash pile. “We are not going to give it back to shareholders.”\nDe La Rue lost the contract for Britain’s new post-Brexit blue passports to Franco-Dutch digital security group Gemalto , leading to a 3.7 million-pound write-off.\nThe company’s troubles were compounded by the resignation of chief financial officer (CFO) Jitesh Sodha in March. Helen Willis, most recently CFO of electronics distributor Premier Farnell, has taken over as interim finance chief.\n$1 = 0.7543 pounds Additional reporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
