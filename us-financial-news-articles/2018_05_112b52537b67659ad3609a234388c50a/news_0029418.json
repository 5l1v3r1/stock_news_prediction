Frank Augstein/pool via Reuters “It’s likely over the course of the next year rates will go up, likely by the end of the year... that’s the most likely thing to happen,” Mr Carney said in an interview with the BBC.\n“If the economy slows... then we will adjust policy,” he said.\nEarlier on Thursday the BoE left rates steady and said weak growth during a snowy start to 2018 was likely to be temporary, but it wanted to be sure the economy was picking up in coming months before raising borrowing costs.\nSterling fell heavily after the BoE announcement but trimmed its losses after Carney’s comments to the BBC.\nReporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by William Schomberg\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:09:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
