A Boral spokeswoman declined to comment.\n“Shareholders have longer memories now. If a director had a problem or let them down in one board then it will have consequences for another boards,” said Vas Kolesnikoff, the Australian head of proxy adviser ISS.\nAustralia’s central bank issued a warning on Tuesday about broader impacts from the Royal Commission, saying revelations of misconduct in the banking sector could hurt house price growth and household spending.\nReporting by Paulina Duran in Sydney and Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:30:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
