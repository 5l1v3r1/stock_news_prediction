(Oceanwide) Refiled Their Joint Voluntary Notice With The Committee On Foreign Investment In The United States (CFIUS) U.S. Mortgage Insurance (MI) Adjusted Operating Income Of $111 Million, Increased 52 Percent Compared To First Quarter Of 2017 U.S. MI's PMIERs 1 Sufficiency Ratio At 124 Percent, In Excess Of $600 Million Above Requirements Strong Performance For Canada MI, Adjusted Operating Income Of $49 Million, Up 28 Percent 2 Versus First Quarter Of 2017 U.S. Life Insurance Adjusted Operating Loss Of $(5) Million Compared To Adjusted Operating Income Of $53 Million In First Quarter Of 2017 Holding Company Cash And Liquid Assets Of Approximately $1.2 Billion Reflecting Recently Completed $450 Million Senior Secured Term Loan\nGenworth Financial, Inc. (NYSE: GNW) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The company reported net income 3 of $112 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared with net income of $155 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted operating income 4 for the first quarter of 2018 was $125 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with adjusted operating income of $143 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nGenworth's effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28 percent. Beginning January 1, 2018, the company taxed its international businesses at their local statutory rates and its domestic businesses at the new enacted tax rate of 21 percent. However, gains on forward starting swaps settled prior to the change in the corporate tax rate will continue to be tax effected at 35 percent as they are amortized into net investment income.\nStrategic Update\nGenworth and Oceanwide continue to work towards closing their previously announced proposed transaction as quickly as possible.\nIn order to allow for additional time for regulatory reviews of the transaction, Genworth and Oceanwide agreed to a fourth waiver and agreement of each party's right to terminate the previously announced merger agreement, extending the deadline to July 1, 2018.\nDue to the delay in receiving necessary regulatory approvals, Genworth successfully closed a $450 million senior secured term loan in March. The proceeds of the term loan will be used, together with cash on hand, to repay existing indebtedness due May 2018. Oceanwide was the lead investor in the term loan with a $60 million allocation as it remains committed to supporting Genworth.\nAs announced on April 24, 2018, Genworth and Oceanwide have re-filed their joint voluntary notice with CFIUS to provide CFIUS additional time to review and discuss the proposed transaction between Genworth and Oceanwide. In connection with the re-filing, CFIUS has agreed to proceed directly to a 45-day investigation period following a one-day review period. Additional information about the CFIUS review process can be found in the definitive proxy statement filed by Genworth with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 25, 2017. There can be no assurances that CFIUS will ultimately agree to clear the transaction.\nIn addition to clearance by CFIUS, the closing of the proposed transaction remains subject to the receipt of required regulatory approvals in the U.S., China, and other international jurisdictions and other closing conditions. Genworth and Oceanwide continue to be actively engaged with the relevant regulators regarding the pending applications.\n\"Genworth's continued strong operating performance and progress against our strategic initiatives is a result of our unwavering focus on maximizing the company's value,\" said Tom McInerney, president and CEO of Genworth. \"We continue to believe the transaction with Oceanwide represents the greatest and most certain value for our stockholders, and are encouraged by the meaningful progress we have made towards achieving the necessary regulatory approvals.\"\nLU Zhiqiang, chairman of Oceanwide, added: \"Oceanwide continues to work diligently with Genworth towards closing the transaction as soon as possible. We remain committed to the transaction, which would provide Oceanwide with the opportunity to enhance our global insurance expertise and bring better insurance market solutions to China.\"\nFinancial Performance\nConsolidated Net Income &\nAdjusted Operating Income\nThree months ended March 31\n2018\n2017\nPer\nPer\ndiluted\ndiluted\nTotal\n(Amounts in millions, except per share)\nTotal\nshare\nTotal\nshare\n% change\nNet income available to Genworth's common stockholders\n$\n112\n$\n0.22\n$\n155\n$\n0.31\n(28)%\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n125\n$\n0.25\n$\n143\n$\n0.29\n(13)%\nWeighted-average diluted shares\n502.7\n501.0\nAs of March 31\n2018\n2017\nBook value per common share\n$\n26.00\n$\n25.68\nBook value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss)\n$\n20.76\n$\n19.47\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 was reduced by net investment losses, net of taxes and other adjustments, of $13 million in the quarter.

Net investment income decreased versus the prior quarter due to lower income from limited partnerships and increased versus prior year from higher average invested assets.

The loss ratio in the current quarter was nine percent, down 13 points sequentially and down eight points from the prior year. Losses in the quarter benefitted from lower new delinquencies, seasonally higher cures and favorable aging. Results in the quarter also benefitted from a lower corporate tax rate. There were no material incremental incurred losses from areas impacted by hurricanes in the quarter, although the company had reserved approximately $5 million pre-tax for hurricane-related delinquencies in the prior quarter.\nFlow New Insurance Written (NIW) of $9.0 billion decreased 12 percent from the prior quarter primarily from a seasonally smaller purchase originations market and lower refinance originations, and increased 18 percent versus the prior year primarily from a larger mortgage insurance market. During the first quarter of 2018, the company's concentration of single premium flow NIW was down four points from the prior quarter and down slightly from the prior year as it continues its selective participation in this market. U.S. MI's flow insurance in force increased 12 percent versus the prior year driven primarily by strong NIW and persistency.\nCanada Mortgage Insurance\nOperating Metrics\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\nQ1 18\nQ4 17\nQ1 17\nAdjusted operating income\n$\n49\n$\n43\n$\n36\nNew insurance written\nFlow\n$\n2,500\n$\n3,600\n$\n2,300\nBulk\n$\n900\n$\n800\n$\n8,000\nLoss ratio\n13%\n9%\n16%\nCanada MI reported adjusted operating income of $49 million versus $43 million in the prior quarter and $36 million in the prior year.

Results in the quarter also reflected a lower effective tax rate of approximately 27 percent.\nFlow NIW was down 31 percent 2 sequentially primarily from a seasonally smaller originations market and up four percent 2 from the prior year.

The prior quarter results included a $141 million unfavorable impact from an annual review of its premium earnings pattern. Results in the quarter also reflected a lower effective tax rate of approximately 30 percent.\nThe loss ratio in the quarter was 30 percent. The change in the premium earnings pattern reduced the prior quarter loss ratio by 35 points. Excluding this impact, the loss ratio was up two points sequentially from delinquency aging and lower seasonal cures and down five points from the prior year primarily from a higher level of earned premiums.\nFlow NIW was down 19 percent 2 sequentially from lower activity with certain customers and down 20 percent 2 from the prior year primarily from lower market penetration.\nU.S. Life Insurance\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\n(Amounts in millions)\nQ1 18\nQ4 17\nQ1 17\nAdjusted operating income (loss)\nLong Term Care Insurance\n$\n(32)\n$\n17\n$\n14\nLife Insurance\n(1)\n(85)\n16\nFixed Annuities\n28\n(1)\n23\nTotal U.S. Life Insurance\n$\n(5)\n$\n(69)\n$\n53\nLong Term Care Insurance\nLong term care insurance reported an adjusted operating loss of $32 million, compared with adjusted operating income of $17 million in the prior quarter and adjusted operating income of $14 million in the prior year. Results versus the prior quarter reflected lower earnings from the acquired block, higher utilization of available benefits and lower renewal premiums due to the timing of policy anniversary dates partially offset by seasonally higher active policy and existing claim termination experience. Prior quarter results included an after-tax reduction to claim reserves of $20 million primarily driven by assumption changes related to claims administrative expenses. Compared to the prior year, results reflected less favorable existing claims performance, including higher utilization of available benefits, and lower earnings from the acquired block, partially offset by higher in-force rate action premiums. Results in the prior year included a $14 million after-tax accrual for state guaranty fund assessments relating to the Penn Treaty Network American Insurance Company and American Network Insurance Company plan of liquidation.\nThe change in the corporate tax rate had a negative impact on the results given LTC had a pre-tax loss for the quarter. In addition, current quarter results also include an incremental tax expense of $5 million above the 21 percent corporate tax rate related to the amortization of forward starting swap gains settled prior to the change in the corporate tax rate.\nLife Insurance\nLife insurance reported an adjusted operating loss of $1 million, compared with an adjusted operating loss of $85 million in the prior quarter and adjusted operating income of $16 million in the prior year. During the prior quarter, the company completed its annual review of life insurance assumptions and recorded an after-tax charge of $74 million primarily driven by assumption changes due to emerging mortality experience as well as adjustments from lower forward interest rates. Results versus the prior quarter also reflect higher seasonal premiums in the company's term life block of business offset by unfavorable mortality in the company's universal life insurance block of business. Compared to the prior year, the current quarter reflected higher lapses resulting in lower insurance premiums and accelerated write-off of deferred acquisition costs (DAC) primarily associated with the large 20-year term life insurance blocks entering their post-level premium periods and unfavorable mortality in the company's universal life insurance block of business.\nFixed Annuities\nFixed annuities reported adjusted operating income of $28 million, compared with an adjusted operating loss of $1 million in the prior quarter and adjusted operating income of $23 million in the prior year. Current quarter results reflect favorable mortality and a lower tax rate. Results in the prior quarter included a net after-tax charge of $30 million from loss recognition testing and assumption updates.\nRunoff\nRunoff reported adjusted operating income of $10 million, compared with $13 million in the prior quarter and $14 million in the prior year, reflecting unfavorable equity market performance supporting the company's variable annuity business versus the prior quarter and prior year.\nCorporate And Other\nCorporate and Other reported an adjusted operating loss of $59 million, compared with adjusted operating income of $390 million in the prior quarter and an adjusted operating loss of $46 million in the prior year. Given the change in the corporate tax rate, the current period results reflect a lower tax benefit offsetting the Corporate and Other pre-tax loss. Results in the prior quarter included a net favorable impact of $456 million related to deferred taxes due to the combination of tax reform, business forecast improvements and other items. Results in the prior quarter also included an unfavorable $11 million tax charge related to the Australia MI premium earnings pattern review. The first quarter of 2017 included a favorable $7 million after-tax correction to the company's Tax Matters Agreement liability.\nCapital & Liquidity\nGenworth maintains the following capital positions in its operating subsidiaries:\nKey Capital & Liquidity Metrics\n(Dollar amounts in millions)\nQ1 18\nQ4 17\nQ1 17\nU.S. MI\nConsolidated Risk-To-Capital Ratio 5\n12.5:1\n12.7:1\n13.6:1\nGenworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation Risk-To-Capital Ratio 5\n12.7:1\n12.9:1\n13.7:1\nPrivate Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs) Sufficiency Ratio 6\n124\n%\n121\n%\n118\n%\nCanada MI\nMinimum Capital Test (MCT) Ratio 5\n170\n%\n172\n%\n162\n%\nAustralia MI\nPrescribed Capital Amount (PCA) Ratio 5\n185\n%\n193\n%\n171\n%\nU.S. Life Insurance Companies\nConsolidated Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Ratio 5\n280\n%\n282\n%\n326\n%\nHolding Company 7 Cash and Liquid Assets 8\n$\n1,204\n$\n870\n$\n999\nKey Points\nU.S. MI's PMIERs sufficiency ratio increased to 124 percent as an increase in operating cash flows and lower non-performing required assets were partially offset by higher required assets associated with strong new business written. The PMIERs sufficiency ratio remained negatively impacted by approximately four points related to the incremental hurricane delinquency inventory; Canada MI's MCT ratio as of March 31, 2018 is estimated to be 170 percent, above both the regulatory minimum requirement of 150 percent and an operating range of 160 to 165 percent; Australia MI's capital levels decreased sequentially to 185 percent driven primarily by lower levels of reinsurance and capital returns to shareholders; and The holding company ended the quarter with $1,204 million of cash and liquid assets, of which approximately $600 million is dedicated to pay the May 2018 debt maturity.\nAbout Genworth Financial\nGenworth Financial, Inc.

The webcast will also be archived on the company's website for one year.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures entitled \"adjusted operating income (loss)\" and \"adjusted operating income (loss) per share.\" Adjusted operating income (loss) per share is derived from adjusted operating income (loss). The chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income (loss). The company defines adjusted operating income (loss) as income (loss) from continuing operations excluding the after-tax effects of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, net investment gains (losses), goodwill impairments, gains (losses) on the sale of businesses, gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt, gains (losses) on insurance block transactions, restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non-operating items. Gains (losses) on insurance block transactions are defined as gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of non-recourse funding obligations, early termination fees for other financing restructuring and/or resulting gains (losses) on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business. The company excludes net investment gains (losses) and infrequent or unusual non-operating items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the company's segments and Corporate and Other activities. A component of the company's net investment gains (losses) is the result of impairments, the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles. In addition, the size and timing of other investment gains (losses) can be subject to the company's discretion and are influenced by market opportunities, as well as asset-liability matching considerations. Goodwill impairments, gains (losses) on the sale of businesses, gains (losses) on the early extinguishment of debt, gains (losses) on insurance block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) because, in the company's opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends. Infrequent or unusual non-operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) if, in the company's opinion, they are not indicative of overall operating trends.\nWhile some of these items may be significant components of net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the company believes that adjusted operating income (loss) and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income (loss), including adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis, are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income (loss) attributable to the ongoing operations of the business. Management also uses adjusted operating income (loss) as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts. However, the items excluded from adjusted operating income (loss) have occurred in the past and could, and in some cases will, recur in the future. Adjusted operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders or net income (loss) available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company's definition of adjusted operating income (loss) may differ from the definitions used by other companies.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate federal income tax rate to 21 percent effective for taxable years beginning on January 1, 2018 and migrated the worldwide tax system to a territorial international tax system. Therefore, beginning on January 1, 2018, the company taxed its international businesses at their local statutory tax rates and its domestic businesses at the new enacted tax rate of 21 percent. The company allocates its consolidated provision for income taxes to its operating segments. The company's allocation methodology applies a specific tax rate to the pre-tax income (loss) of each segment, which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign income. The difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in Corporate and Other activities.\nThe annually-determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment's provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company assumed a tax rate of 21 percent on certain adjustments to reconcile net income available to Genworth Financial Inc.'s common stockholders and adjusted operating income and in the explanation of specific variances of operating performance (unless otherwise indicated). In the prior year, the company assumed a tax rate of 35 percent, the previous U.S. corporate federal income tax rate prior to the enactment of the TCJA, on certain adjustments to reconcile net income available to Genworth Financial Inc.'s common stockholders and adjusted operating income and in the explanation of specific variances of operating performance. These adjustments are also net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests and net investment gains (losses) are adjusted for DAC and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves.\nThe company recorded a pre-tax expense of $1 million in the first quarter of 2017 related to restructuring costs as the company continued to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses. There were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from adjusted operating income during the periods presented.\nThe tables at the end of this press release provide a reconciliation of net income available to Genworth Financial, Inc.'s common stockholders to adjusted operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, as well as for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and reflect adjusted operating income (loss) as determined in accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting.\nThis press release includes the non-GAAP financial measure entitled \"core yield\" as a measure of investment yield. The company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio. Management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company. However, core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the company's definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies. A reconciliation of core yield to reported U.S. GAAP yield is included in a table at the end of this press release.\nDefinition of Selected Operating Performance Measures\nThe company reports selected operating performance measures including \"sales\" and \"insurance in force\" or \"risk in force\" which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance.\nManagement regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period. Sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance. The company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company's operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period, rather than a measure of the company's revenues or profitability during that period.\nManagement regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force. Insurance in force for the company's mortgage insurance business is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date. Risk in force for the company's U.S. mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance. The company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period, rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period.\nManagement also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company's businesses. For the mortgage insurance businesses, the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums. For the long term care insurance business, the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of the businesses.\nThese operating performance measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"will\" or words of similar meaning and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the outlook for the company's future business and financial performance.
