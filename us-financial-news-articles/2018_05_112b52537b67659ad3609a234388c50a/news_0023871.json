Based on the current situation, production curbs will be on a regular basis in more regions,” said Xu Bo, analyst at Haitong Futures.\nA large accumulation of iron ore inventories has also reduced the need for imports.\nStockpiles of iron ore at Chinese ports climbed by 1 million tonnes in the week to May 4 to 160.28 million tonne, consultants SteelHome reported. Inventories have declined from a record 161.68 million tonnes in late March.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Tom Daly in BEIJING, and Manolo Serapio Jr in MANILA Editing by Joseph Radford and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:21:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
