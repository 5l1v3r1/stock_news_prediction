Tech companies like Square have begun offering Bitcoin services to their customers, and the commodity exchanges in Chicago started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin futures contracts in December.\nBut until now, regulated financial institutions have steered clear of Bitcoin, with some going so far as to shut down the accounts of customers who traded Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously called it a fraud, and many other bank chief executives have said Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble.\nMs. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be \"mined\" in a complex, virtual system.\n\"It resonates with us when a client says, 'I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,'\" she said.\nMs. Yared said the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted Bitcoin millionaires and didn't know how to handle them. The ultimate decision to begin trading Bitcoin contracts went through Goldman's board of directors.\nThe step comes with plenty of uncertainties. Bitcoin prices are primarily set on unregulated exchanges in other countries where there are few measures in place to prevent market manipulation.\nSince the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged — and recovered significantly — as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies.\n\"It is not a new risk that we don't understand,\" Ms. Yared said. \"It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.\"\nGoldman has already been doing more than most banks in the area, clearing trades for customers who want to buy and sell Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\nIn the next few weeks — the exact start date has not been set — Goldman will begin using its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of clients. It will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients.\nThe bank's first \"digital asset\" trader, Justin Schmidt, joined Goldman two weeks ago to handle the day-to-day operations, a hiring that was first reported by Tearsheet . In his last job, Mr. Schmidt, 38, was an electronic trader at the hedge fund Seven Eight Capital. In 2017, he left that job to trade virtual currencies on his own.\nHe will initially be placed on Goldman's foreign currency desk because Bitcoin trading has the most similarity to movements in emerging market currencies, Ms. Yared said.\nMr. Schmidt is looking at trading actual Bitcoin — or physical Bitcoin, as it is somewhat ironically called — if the bank can secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and New York authorities.\nThe firm also has to find a way to confidently hold Bitcoin for customers without its being stolen by hackers, as has happened to many Bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Yared said the current options for holding Bitcoin for clients did not yet meet Wall Street standards.\nGoldman is known for pushing the envelope in the trading of complicated products. The firm faced significant criticism after the financial crisis for its profitable trading of so-called synthetic derivatives tied to the subprime mortgage markets.\nSince the crisis, Goldman has made a big push to position itself as the most technologically sophisticated firm on Wall Street. Among other things, it has started an online lending service, known as Marcus , that has brought the firm into contact with retail customers for the first time. The virtual currency trading, though, will be available only to big institutional investors.\nMr. Schmidt said Goldman's sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world.\n\"In terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading — but it didn't exist,\" he said.\nFollow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpop", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html", "http://www.tearsheet.co/blockchain-crypto/goldman-sachs-has-hired-a-crypto-trader", "https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-to-offer-an-online-lender-for-the-masses.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/style/bitcoin-millionaires.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/nyregion/new-york-today-living-on-bitcoin.html"], "published": "2018-05-03T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T14:58:49.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
