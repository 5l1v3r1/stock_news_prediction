Mandatory Credit: Terrence Lee-USA TODAY Sports Never before had Winnipeg thrown such a bash and with good reason.\nThis is uncharted air space for the Jets and tens of thousands of their fans were drawn to the downtown core of the city to be a part of the achievement.\nA well-deserved victory over the expansion Golden Knights also gave Winnipegers a prime time stage to hit back at all the punchlines and jabs they have absorbed over the decades.\n“Winter-Peg”, “Windy-Peg”, weary Winnipegers have heard them all but on Saturday the Jets and their supporters reminded an ice hockey mad country that “The Peg” is Canada’s last hope this season to end a 25-year Stanley Cup drought.\n“We’ve been the gum on Canada’s shoe for a long time, everyone looks down on Winnipeg,” said fan Adam Williscroft, decked out in his Jets jersey with the accessory of the day - a can of beer in hand. “But not now, not today.\n“Today we are in the limelight.”\nThe National Hockey League’s smallest market Winnipeg sits at what is recognized as the crossroads of Canada, “Portage and Main”, which is often referred to as the nation’s coldest and windiest corner.\nMay 12, 2018; Winnipeg, Manitoba, CAN; Winnipeg Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck (37) makes a save against Vegas Golden Knights center Cody Eakin (21) in the third period in game one of the Western Conference Final of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs at Bell MTS Centre.

A Stanley Cup party will require three more Jets victories to lock up the best-of-seven series.\n“Best fans in the league by far,” praised Jets forward Mark Scheifele, who had a goal and set up another. “We feed off them.\n“They are a big part of why we are here. We live it.\n“Hopefully we can give them a lot more to cheer about.”\nSlideshow (13 Images) The buzz began early as a trickle of fans ambled towards party central — the Bell MTS Place.\nBy mid-afternoon, the trickle had turned into a flood as white clad fans packed the core for what has become known as “The WhiteOut”.\nWith each Jets victory officials have had to add blocks and blocks to the fan zone around the arena to accommodate revelers.\nFearing the street party had reached a critical point the city made Saturday’s event an invitation only affair for 25,000 who would need a ticket to enter the fun zone.\nThose free tickets were scooped up in a matter of minutes and were soon appearing online with sellers asking $25 or more.\nJust 65 seconds after the puck dropped the party kicked into overdrive when Dustin Byfuglien took a drop pass from Scheifele and rifled it past Las Vegas netminder Marc-Andre Fleury.\nPatrik Laine and Joel Armia added quick fire goals 46 second apart to put Winnipeg up 3-0 before the midway mark of the first period.\nThe Golden Knights pulled one back before the end of the period on a goal from Brayden McNabb that trimmed the deficit to two but they would get no closer.\nThe teams traded goals in a more even second period Scheifele, counting for the Jets and William Karlsson for Las Vegas, before Winnipeg netminder Connor Hellebuyck shut door in a scoreless third.\nAdditional reporting by Rod Nickle; Editing by Peter Rutherford\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
