And the Qatar central bank suffered a 53 percent loss in reserves due to large capital outflows following the imposition of sanctions by other Arab states.\nThe Kuwait Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund, lost its top 10 position, falling one place to 11th, with assets down 11 percent or $68 billion. It was replaced in the top 10 by South Korea’s National Pension Service, which enjoyed asset growth of 16 percent.\nAsia remained the largest region for assets, holding $13.8 trillion or 38 percent of the total, with year-on-year growth of $948 billion or 7 percent.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority topped the table of biggest risers, with assets up $73.3 billion or 19 percent.\nInfrastructure and real estate remained in favor, with a respective 70 percent and 45 percent of investors surveyed planning to increase their holdings in these segments.\nThe shift to real assets by long-term investors is a multi-year trend reflecting a search for higher yields against a backdrop of depressed global bond yields.\nThe growing importance of China’s renminbi in international financial transactions was also reflected in the survey, with 18 percent of poll participants planning to increase their renminbi exposure over the next 12-24 months, the highest response for all currencies.\nReporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:05:34.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
