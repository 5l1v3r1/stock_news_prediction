The company moved the leader of its Messenger service , David Marcus, to the new blockchain unit that he will oversee.\nFacebook did not say what it plans to do with its blockchain unit, but Marcus said that the company would be “starting from scratch.” Marcus, who is no stranger to online payments, was once the president of PayPal (pypl) and he’s also a board member of the Coinbase cryptocurrency trading service.\nA Facebook spokesperson told Fortune in an email, “Like many other companies Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology.”\n“This new small team will be exploring many different applications,” the spokesperson said. “We don’t have anything further to share.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nShe said that blockchain technology could be beneficial for privacy concerned people who want to better understand how their data is being used and shared via different advertising services “or on the personal side.”\n“So I think it’s a technology that fits very well with some of the business model challenges that they’re actually facing, and I think they’re very right to take this very seriously,” van Kralingen said.
