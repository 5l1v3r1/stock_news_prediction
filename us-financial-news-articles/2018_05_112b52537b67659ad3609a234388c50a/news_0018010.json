That is exerting huge pressure on emerging markets, pushing currencies lower and bond yields higher.\nArgentina, one of the worst-hit countries, has been forced to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund.\nThe IIF predicts emerging bond markets to be worst hit, with inflows of $255 billion this year, down from last year’s record $315 billion. Monthly inflows so far this year averaged $13 billion through April, it noted, half year-ago levels.\nA 100 basis-point rise in U.S. yields would cut flows to emerging debt by $20 billion, the IIF suggested, noting that huge inflows to the sector last year had made it a relatively crowded trade.\nIt also cut forecasts for equity flows to $94 billion for 2018 but noted this would still be $8 billion above last year.\nThe group remains optimistic on future prospects, however, predicting the developing world to receive inflows of $1.35 trillion next year, thanks to still-firm strong economic growth and trade.\nAnother bright spot is “direct”, bricks-and-mortar investment or FDI, which makes up 40 percent of emerging markets’ capital flows. The IIF revised up previous forecasts for 2018 FDI by $43 billion to $523 billion, the highest in three years.\n“The robust growth differential between emerging and mature markets will be supportive, while the modest recovery in commodity prices has been another key factor,” it added.\nWith overall capital inflows holding steady at last year’s levels and most emerging central banks reluctant to intervene in currency markets, the IIF said it expected their hard currency reserves to rise in 2018 by $220 billion, most of it in China.
