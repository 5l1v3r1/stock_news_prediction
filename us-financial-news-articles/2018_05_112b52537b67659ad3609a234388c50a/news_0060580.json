But Cottarelli has so far failed to form a viable cabinet.\nDi Maio, whose 5-Star emerged from the inconclusive March 4 elections as the largest single party, urged Salvini to drop his insistence on Savona for the economy portfolio and agree to give him another post in the next government.\n“Di Maio - Salvini: the Final Deal,” was the headline in Corriere della Sera newspaper, echoing the national feeling of crisis put into a holding pattern.\nSalvini cancelled his scheduled appointments in northern Italy to fly to Rome and was expected to have a private meeting with Di Maio, a political source said.\nOpinion polls show Salvini’s League would see huge gains in any early elections while the 5-Star would remain steady.\nItalian stocks were trading higher as signs emerged of a compromise to avoid snap elections that could be dominated by the issue of euro membership, calming investors.\nBorrowing costs meanwhile edged lower. Italy’s 2-year government bond yield, which has been the focus of a recent selloff, was down as much as 95 basis points at 1.40 percent.\nThe latest development came amid a general calming of financial markets after Tuesday’s rout, when investor concerns prompted the biggest one-day rise since 1992 in Italian two-year bond yields and dented the euro’s exchange rate.\n“I have lost my patience. I have had enough, that is the truth,” said exasperated Rome resident Teresa Gallo as she was walking to a market for her regular morning shopping.\nTwo polls released on Wednesday night showed that between 60-72 percent of Italians want the country to remain part of the euro while 23-24 percent would choose to drop the common currency.\nLupo Rattazzi, a prominent Italian businessman, ran a full-page advertisement in several national newspapers addressed to Salvini and Di Maio, warning their electorate of the dire consequences of leaving the euro.
