(NASDAQ:ESEA), an owner and operator of drybulk and container carrier vessels and provider of seaborne transportation for drybulk and containerized cargoes, announced today its results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nTotal net revenues of $12.9 million. Net loss of $3.2 million; net loss attributable to common shareholders (after a $0.5 million of dividend on Series B Preferred Shares) of $3.7 million or $0.33 loss per share basic and diluted. Adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders 1 for the period was $3.8 million or $0.34 loss per share basic and diluted. Adjusted EBITDA 1 was $(0.2) million. An average of 17.0 vessels were owned and operated during the first quarter of 2018 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $9,167 per day. The Company declared its seventeenth dividend of $0.5 million on its Series B Preferred shares; the dividend was paid in-kind by issuing additional Series B Preferred Shares.\nFleet Developments\nOn May 7, 2018, the Company took delivery of newbuilding M/V Ekaterini, a 82,000 dwt drybulk vessel. As previously announced, the vessel entered into a two-year charter immediately after its delivery at a rate of $13,000 per day. The Company also reported that its containership, M/V EM Astoria, suffered propeller damage and will require repairs that will prevent the vessel from trading. The Company is making every possible effort for the vessel to resume trading in the shortest possible time.\nDrybulk Fleet Spin-off\nThe Company announced that it filed a registration statement on Form F-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to spin-off the Company’s drybulk fleet into a separate company, EuroDry Ltd., which has applied for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\n1 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net loss and Adjusted loss per share are not recognized measurements under GAAP. Refer to a subsequent section of the Press Release for the definitions and reconciliation of these measurements to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAristides Pittas, Chairman and CEO of Euroseas commented: “Although our revenues continued to increase in Q1 following the continued improvement in both drybulk and container markets we registered a loss during the first quarter of 2018, mainly due to the disproportionate number of drydocks we had to pass during the quarter. We expect both sectors to continue to register positive results in the future if the markets maintain their current levels and the company to revert to profitability for the remainder of the year.\n“However, from our perspective, the most significant development during the quarter was our decision to spin-off our drybulk fleet into a separate publicly listed company, EuroDry Ltd. We believe that separate drybulk and containership investment options will give our shareholders the flexibility to adjust their holdings, if they so wish, between the two sectors. We also anticipate that the creation of sector-focused companies will allow the capital markets to appreciate the value that our public platforms can create as consolidators in their respective fields: EuroDry Ltd., a middle range drybulk owner that owns six vessels, three of which are newbuildings, one ultramax and two kamsarmaxes, built according to our specifications in the last two years and three high-quality Panamax vessels Japanese-built post-2000; and Euroseas Ltd., the only feeder containership public company, with a fleet of eleven vessels that are proven workhorses of the sector. We also expect that both EuroDry and Euroseas will trade much closer to their net asset value, like their peers, than the combined company does now.\n“We plan to take advantage of growth opportunities in each of the two sectors to increase the size of each respective company as we believe that they are both well positioned to do so both in terms of their capital structure and their contract mix. Each of them being a public company with a cost-effective operating structure could be attractive to other small or large private fleets looking for opportunities to engage in transactions with acquirors. We plan to discuss in more detail the spin-off and the opportunities it may generate in a separate conference call on Monday, May 14, 2018 at 10 am EDT.”\nTasos Aslidis, Chief Financial Officer of Euroseas commented: “The results of the first quarter of 2018 reflect the improved rates most of our vessels earned as a result of the recovering state of the drybulk and container markets. Comparing our results for the first quarter of 2018 with the same period of 2017, our net revenues increased by about $4.6 million and we also incurred $0.7 million lower voyage expenses. Operating expenses, including management fees and general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was mainly due to the operation of 17.0 vessels during the first quarter of 2018 versus 13.38 vessels during the same period of last year; on a per-vessel-per-day basis, operating expenses, including management fees and general and administrative expenses increased by 19% during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 which was primarily attributable to certain expenses budgeted for 2018 occurring in the first quarter, the different mix of vessels we had in 2018 and costs related to the spin-off of our drybulk fleet under way. We believe that we continue to maintain one of the lowest operating cost structures amongst the public shipping companies which is one of our competitive advantages. Also, during the first quarter of 2018, three of our vessels completed their special surveys with a total cost of $2.2 million not including time lost due to drydockings.\n“Adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of 2018 was $(0.2) compared to $0.2 million achieved for the first quarter of last year. Finally, as of March 31, 2018, our outstanding debt (excluding the unamortized loan fees) is about $71.2 million versus restricted and unrestricted cash of about $10.4 million.“\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results:\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company reported total net revenues of $12.9 million representing a 55.9% increase over total net revenues of $8.3 million during the first quarter of 2017. The Company reported a net loss for the period of $3.2 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3.7 million, as compared to a net loss of $2.2 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.6 million respectively for the first quarter of 2017. Depreciation expense for the first quarter of 2018 amounts to $2.1 million remaining unchanged compared to the same period of 2017. Although the average number of vessels increased, the new vessels acquired have a lower average daily depreciation charge as a result of their lower initial values (acquisition price) and greater remaining useful life compared to the remaining vessels. On average, 17.0 vessels were owned and operated during the first quarter of 2018 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $9,167 per day compared to 13.38 vessels in the same period of 2017 earning on average $7,268 per day. In the first quarter of 2018 three vessels completed their special surveys with a total cost of $2.2 million. In the same period of 2017 one vessel completed an in-water survey with a cost of $0.1 million. The results for the first quarter of 2017 also include a $0.5 million of gain on sale of M/V RT Dagr compared to the same period of 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $(0.2) million, compared to $0.2 million achieved for the first quarter of 2017. Please see below for Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation to net loss and cash flow provided by operating activities.\nBasic and diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.33, calculated on 11,133,764 weighted average number of shares outstanding compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.24 for the first quarter of 2017, calculated on 10,999,554 weighted average number of shares outstanding.\nExcluding the effect on the loss for the quarter of unrealized gain on derivatives and the realized loss on derivatives, the adjusted loss per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 would have been $0.34 per share basic and diluted, compared to the loss of $0.29 per share basic and diluted for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Usually, security analysts do not include the above items in their published estimates of earnings per share.\nFleet Profile:\nThe Euroseas Ltd. fleet profile is as follows:\nName Type Dwt TEU Year\nBuilt Employment (*)\nTCE Rate\n($/day) Dry Bulk Vessels XENIA Kamsarmax 82,000 2016 TC 'til Jan-2020\n+ 1 year in\nCharterers’ Option $14,100\n$14,350 EIRINI P Panamax 76,466 2004 TC ‘til Sep-18 103.25%\naverage BPI(**)\n4 TC PANTELIS Panamax 74,020 2000 TC ‘til Jun-18 $10,000 & a\nGross Ballast\nBonus of\n$525,000 (total\nequivalent to\nabout $8,650) TASOS Panamax 75,100 2000 TC ‘til Jun-18 $12,300 ALEXANDROS P.

We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession including off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydockings or special or intermediate surveys or days of vessels in lay-up. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during that period.\n(3) The scheduled off-hire days including vessels laid-up are days associated with scheduled repairs, drydockings or special or intermediate surveys or days of vessels in lay-up.\n(4) Available days. We define available days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession net of scheduled off-hire days. We use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels were available to generate revenues.\n(5) Commercial off-hire days. We define commercial off-hire days as days a vessel is idle without employment (this definition has been revised starting from April 1, 2017 to exclude from commercial off-hire days, days the vessel is sailing for repositioning purposes; previous periods' commercial off-hire has been adjusted accordingly if necessary).\n(6) Operational off-hire days. We define operational off-hire days as days associated with unscheduled repairs or other off-hire time related to the operation of the vessels.\n(7) Voyage days. We define voyage days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession net of commercial and operational off-hire days. We use voyage days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues or are sailing for repositioning purposes.\n(8) Fleet utilization. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our voyage days during a period by the number of our available days during that period. We use fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons such as unscheduled repairs or days waiting to find employment.\n(9) Fleet utilization, commercial. We calculate commercial fleet utilization by dividing our available days net of commercial off-hire days during a period by our available days during that period.\n(10) Fleet utilization, operational. We calculate operational fleet utilization by dividing our available days net of operational off-hire days during a period by our available days during that period.\n(11) Time charter equivalent, or TCE, is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE is determined by dividing revenue generated from charters net of voyage expenses by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract. TCE is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot voyage charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our definition of TCE may not be comparable to that used by other companies in the shipping industry.\n(12) Daily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs and management fees are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period. Drydocking expenses are reported separately.\n(13) Daily general and administrative expense is calculated by dividing general and administrative expense by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(14) Total vessel operating expenses, or TVOE, is a measure of our total expenses associated with operating our vessels. TVOE is the sum of vessel operating expenses excluding drydocking expenses and general and administrative expenses. Daily TVOE is calculated by dividing TVOE by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(15) Drydocking expenses, which include expenses during drydockings that would have been capitalized and amortized under the deferral method divided by the fleet calendar days for the relevant period. Drydocking expenses could vary substantially from period to period depending on how many vessels underwent drydocking during the period.\nConference Call and Webcast:\nToday, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time, the Company's management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results.\nConference Call details:\nParticipants should dial into the call 10 minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers: 1 (866) 819-7111 (from the US), 0(800) 953-0329 (from the UK) or (+44) (0) 1452 542 301 (from outside the US).

Euroseas also computes Adjusted EBITDA by adding the net cash flow provided by / (used in) operating activities, the changes in operating assets / liabilities of the period, the realized loss or (gain) on derivatives, the share based compensation of the period and the net interest of the period. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is included herein because it is a basis upon which the Company assesses its financial performance and liquidity position and because the Company believes that it presents useful information to investors regarding a company's ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. The Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as that used by other companies in the shipping or other industries.\nEuroseas Ltd.\nReconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted net loss\n(All amounts expressed in U.S. Dollars except share data and per share amounts)\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2017 Three Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018 Net loss (2,189,830 ) (3,230,361 ) Unrealized gain on derivatives (5,072 ) (131,350 ) Realized loss on derivatives 331 51,208 Gain on sale of vessel (516,561 ) - Adjusted net loss (2,711,132 ) (3,310,503 ) Preferred dividends (437,732 ) (460,033 ) Adjusted net loss available to\ncommon shareholders (3,148,864 ) (3,770,536 ) Adjusted net loss per share, basic\n& diluted (0.29 ) (0.34 ) Weighted average number of\nshares, basic & diluted 10,999,554 11,133,764\n“Adjusted net loss” and “Adjusted net loss per share” Reconciliation:\nEuroseas Ltd. considers “Adjusted net loss” to represent net loss before gain / loss on derivatives and gain on sale of vessel. “Adjusted net loss” and “Adjusted net loss per share” is included herein because we believe it assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of the Company's fundamental performance from period to period by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of gain / loss on derivatives and gain on sale of vessel, which items may significantly affect results of operations between periods.\n“Adjusted Net loss” and “Adjusted net loss per share” do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or loss per share, as determined by U.S. GAAP, The Company's definition of “Adjusted net loss” and “Adjusted net loss per share” may not be the same as that used by other companies in the shipping or other industries.\nAbout Euroseas Ltd.\nEuroseas Ltd. was formed on May 5, 2005 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to consolidate the ship owning interests of the Pittas family of Athens, Greece, which has been in the shipping business over the past 140 years.
