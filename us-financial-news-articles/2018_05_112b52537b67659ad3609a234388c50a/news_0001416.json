(NASDAQ:PXLW), a leading provider of power efficient visual processing solutions, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nShipped volume production orders in support of recently launched Xiaomi Blackshark’s gaming smartphone Further expanded the number of engagements with mobile OEMs to incorporate Iris display processor Unveiled full feature set of 4 th generation Iris mobile display processor Announced collaboration with Wanda Film Group to establish Film Innovation & Ecosystem Lab in China and develop new technologies for film production and cinema displays Satisfied all remaining convertible debt obligations from the 2017 acquisition of ViXS Systems\nPresident and CEO of Pixelworks, Todd DeBonis, commented, “First quarter revenue was at the high-end of our guidance range, reflecting solid performance across our business and expected seasonality in the digital projection market. Favorable product mix contributed to better than anticipated gross margin, and our continued focus on operational efficiencies helped to drive lower than expected operating expenses. As a result, we delivered sequential bottom-line improvement despite the first quarter traditionally being a seasonally soft quarter.\n“Since the start of the year, we have made notable progress on our mobile initiative, as highlighted by our recent win for Pixelworks 3 rd generation Iris display processor in the Xiaomi Blackshark smartphone. Additionally, today we formally unveiled the full features and advanced video capabilities of our 4 th generation mobile display processor, for which we already have multiple active customer engagements. During the first quarter, we also continued to advance the development project with our video delivery customer in Japan, where we are seeing increased traction for consumer electronics applications that leverage Pixelworks XCode family of advanced decoding and transcoding SoCs.\n“The relevance of Pixelworks advanced display processing and video delivery technology continues to grow with the prevailing demand for higher quality displays, and we are experiencing increased customer interest across all of our end markets. In addition to our extensive efforts to capitalize on this momentum and drive further adoption of our existing solutions, we are continuing to make meaningful investments in product development as part of cultivating potential expanded opportunities. As a result of our ongoing efforts and progress, we are increasingly confident that Pixelworks is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and increased profitability in the coming quarters.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue in 2018 was $15.3 million, compared with revenue of $18.4 million in the prior quarter and $22.7 million in 2017. The fourth and first quarters of 2017 included approximately $1.0 million and $9.2 million of legacy end-of-life (EOL) product revenue, respectively. The sequential decrease in first quarter 2018 revenue reflects typical seasonality in the Company’s digital projection business.\nOn a GAAP basis, gross profit margin in 2018 was 51.0%, compared with 49.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 54.6% in 2017. First quarter 2018 GAAP operating expenses were $9.1 million compared with $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.0 million in the year-ago quarter.\nFor 2018, the Company recorded a GAAP net loss of $598,000, or $(0.02) per share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $3.6 million, or $(0.10) per share, in the prior quarter and GAAP net income of $2.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, first quarter 2018 gross profit margin was 54.2%, compared with 56.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 54.8% in the year-ago quarter. First quarter 2018 non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.8 million, compared with $10.6 million in the prior quarter and $8.3 million in 2017. First quarter 2018 operating expenses, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, included the recognition of approximately $2 million of offsets to R&D related to the Company’s ongoing co-development project with a large digital projector customer.\nFor 2018, non-GAAP net income was $38,000, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $379,000, or $(0.01) per share, in the previous quarter and non-GAAP net income of $3.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 was $1.3 million, compared to $778,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $5.0 million in 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nPixelworks expects revenue to be between $18.0 million and $19.0 million for the second quarter of 2018. Additional guidance will be provided as part of the Company’s earnings conference call.\nOn April 27, 2018, Pixelworks’ Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to further streamline the Company’s operations and increase efficiencies in certain areas of the business. The Company expects this restructuring to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter ending September 30, 2018, and anticipates related charges totaling approximately $2.0 million to be recorded during the second and third quarters of 2018.\nConference Call Information\nPixelworks will host a conference call today, May 2, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, which can be accessed by calling 877-359-9508 and using passcode 5398377.

The Company’s 20 year history of Image Processing innovation has yielded 500+ patents covering Display Processing and Video Delivery. The Company is headquartered in San Jose, CA. For more information, please visit the Company’s web site at www.pixelworks.com .\nNote: Pixelworks and the Pixelworks logo are registered trademarks of Pixelworks, Inc.\nThis earnings release makes reference to non-GAAP gross profit margins, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, which exclude amortization of deferred revenue fair value adjustment, inventory step-up and backlog amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expenses, fair value adjustment on convertible debt conversion option, discount accretion on convertible debt fair value, gain on extinguishment of convertible debt and a tax benefit associated with new tax treatment under the tax reform, which are all required under GAAP as well as the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments. The press release also makes reference to and reconciles GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, which Pixelworks defines as GAAP net income (loss) before interest expense and other, net, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, as well as the specific items listed above.\nPixelworks management uses these non- internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business and establish its operational goals, review its operations on a period to period basis, for compensation evaluations, to measure performance, and for budgeting and resource allocation. Pixelworks management believes it is useful for the Company and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information and non- to help assess the performance of Pixelworks’ continuing businesses and to evaluate Pixelworks’ future prospects. These non-GAAP measures, when reviewed together with the GAAP financial information, provide additional transparency and information for comparison and analysis of operating performance and trends. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items to facilitate management’s review of the comparability of our core operating results on a period to period basis.\nIn calculating the above non-GAAP results, management specifically adjusted for certain items related to the acquisition of ViXS Systems, Inc., including amortization of acquired intangible assets, impact of inventory step up and deferred revenue both related to fair valuing the items, acquisition and integration related costs such as accounting and legal fees and CEO severance, restructuring expenses related to a reduction in workforce, accretion on convertible debt of ViXS fair value adjustments on embedded derivative features of such convertible debt and extinguishment of such convertible debt. Management considers these items as either limited in term or having no impact on Pixelworks’ cash flows, and therefore has excluded such items to facilitate a review of current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\nBecause the Company’s non- are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non- should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial results as presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- is included in this earnings release which is available in the investor relations section of the Pixelworks' website.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements may be identified by use of terms such as “begin,” “continue,” “will,” “expect”, “believe,” “anticipate” and similar terms or the negative of such terms, and include, without limitation, statements about the Company’s digital projection, mobile and OTA businesses, including market movement and demand, customer engagements, and growth in the mobile and video delivery markets, synergies and additional guidance. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of this release, including any projections of revenue or other financial items or any statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. Such statements are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve numerous risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Actual results could vary materially from those contained in forward looking statements due to many factors, including, without limitation: whether the Company will be able to implement the restructuring program as planned, whether the expected amount of the costs associated with the restructuring program will differ from or exceed the Company's estimates and whether the Company will be able to realize the full amount of estimated savings from the restructuring program or within the timeframe expected; our ability to execute on our strategy, including the integration of ViXS; competitive factors, such as rival chip architectures, introduction or traction by competing designs, or pricing pressures; the success of our products in expanded markets; current global economic challenges; changes in the digital display and projection markets; seasonality in the consumer electronics market; our efforts to achieve profitability from operations; our limited financial resources and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. More information regarding potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results and could cause actual results to those discussed in the forward-looking statements is included from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as well as subsequent SEC filings.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this release speak as of the date of this release, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n[Financial Tables Follow]\nPIXELWORKS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Revenue, net (1) $ 15,292 $ 18,448 $ 22,710 Cost of revenue (2) 7,490 9,288 10,318 Gross profit 7,802 9,160 12,392 Operating expenses: Research and development (3) 4,463 6,695 4,906 Selling, general and administrative (4) 4,614 5,068 4,139 Restructuring 19 439 — Total operating expenses 9,096 12,202 9,045 Income (loss) from operations (1,294 ) (3,042 ) 3,347 Interest income (expense) and other, net (5) 972 (919 ) (93 ) Income (loss) before income taxes (322 ) (3,961 ) 3,254 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (6) 276 (409 ) 433 Net income (loss) $ (598 ) $ (3,552 ) $ 2,821 Net income (loss) per share: Basic $ (0.02 ) $ (0.10 ) $ 0.10 Diluted $ (0.02 ) $ (0.10 ) $ 0.09 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 35,183 34,359 29,283 Diluted 35,183 34,359 31,146 (1) Includes deferred revenue fair value adjustment $ — $ 68 $ — (2) Includes: Amortization of acquired intangible assets 298 298 — Inventory step-up and backlog amortization 122 949 — Stock-based compensation 66 64 53 (3) Includes stock-based compensation 595 527 314 (4) Includes: Stock-based compensation 539 556 422 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 101 101 — Acquisition and integration — (45 ) — (5) Includes: Gain on debt extinguishment (1,272 ) (29 ) — Discount accretion on convertible debt fair value 69 124 — Fair value adjustment on convertible debt conversion option — 621 — (6) Includes benefit related to tax reform — (343 ) —\nPIXELWORKS, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION *\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit GAAP gross profit $ 7,802 $ 9,160 $ 12,392 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 298 298 — Inventory step-up and backlog amortization 122 949 — Stock-based compensation 66 64 53 Deferred revenue fair value adjustment — 68 — Total reconciling items included in gross profit 486 1,379 53 Non-GAAP gross profit $ 8,288 $ 10,539 $ 12,445 Non-GAAP gross profit margin 54.2 % 56.9 % 54.8 % Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses GAAP operating expenses $ 9,096 $ 12,202 $ 9,045 Reconciling item included in research and development: Stock-based compensation 595 527 314 Reconciling items included in selling, general and administrative: Stock-based compensation 539 556 422 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 101 101 — Acquisition and integration — (45 ) — Restructuring 19 439 — Total reconciling items included in operating expenses 1,254 1,578 736 Non-GAAP operating expenses $ 7,842 $ 10,624 $ 8,309 Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP net income (loss) GAAP net income (loss) $ (598 ) $ (3,552 ) $ 2,821 Reconciling items included in gross profit 486 1,379 53 Reconciling items included in operating expenses 1,254 1,578 736 Reconciling items included in interest expense and other, net (1,203 ) 716 — Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments 99 (157 ) 155 Benefit related to tax reform — (343 ) — Non-GAAP net income (loss) $ 38 $ (379 ) $ 3,765 Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.00 $ (0.01 ) $ 0.13 Diluted $ 0.00 $ (0.01 ) $ 0.12 Non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 35,183 34,359 29,283 Diluted 37,306 34,359 31,146 *Set forth above are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
