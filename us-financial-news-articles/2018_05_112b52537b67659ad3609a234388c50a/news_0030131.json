As India imports a lot of oil, high crude prices usually hurt its economy.\nArgentina’s battered peso was starting the week near record lows meanwhile, following its 12-percent slump this month.\nIts central bank has raised interest rates to 40 percent and has been intervening heavily in foregin exchange markets in recent weeks to try to prevent a return to full-blown crisis. But even talks for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing line have failed to bring calm.\nMany Argentines blame IMF-backed policies of the late 1990s for the country’s 2001/02 economic meltdown. Some opposition politicians and activists have voiced concerns that the deal being drawn up in Washington will require painful fiscal belt tightening.\nIndustrial leaders and owners of small and medium-sized businesses, represented by a chamber known as CAME, met with President Mauricio Macri on Friday to discuss the upcoming IMF deal.\n“He assured us that the resources will be used to calm the market and reactivate the economy,” CAME said a statement. “The president gave us a lot of reassurance in terms of the scope and conditions of the agreement with the IMF.”\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see)\nAdditional reporting by Claire Milhench\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-14T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:24:45.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
