The index lost 0.37 percent last week, its second straight weekly fall.\n“Market is searching for directions,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings.\n“After a long time, we saw the turnover crossing 1 billion rupees thanks to a block deal. We also saw some buying interest in banking sector which is a good sign for the market.”\nShares of Nestle Lanka Plc fell 2.2 percent, while conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc ended 0.3 percent down and Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Plc closed 0.5 percent lower.\nUnion Assurance Plc, which accounted for 24 percent of the day’s turn over, closed 2.6 percent higher.\nFitch Ratings has said that recent political developments in Sri Lanka have created some uncertainty over reform momentum and fiscal consolidation, and prolonged upheaval could undermine investor confidence ahead of large external debt maturities in 2019-22.\nTurnover stood at 1.2 billion rupees ($7.60 million), its highest since April 4 and more than this year’s daily average of 1.03 billion rupees.\nForeign investors bought a net 86.8 million rupees worth of equities on Wednesday, but the market has seen a net foreign outflow to 400.2 million rupees worth of equities so far this year.
