This figure excludes the one time impact of $1.0 million of non-recurring deal costs related to the Pioneer transaction which were expensed during the quarter. Total revenue increased 3.5% to $24.0 million as compared to the same prior year period Average first quarter price realized excluding the impact of hedging and fixed price physical delivery contracts was $64.80 per barrel and $46.54 per Boe. Average first quarter price received per barrel was $55.15 and per Boe was $40.59. Cash operating costs increased 38.4% to $20.61/Boe for the quarter, as compared to $14.89/Boe for the same prior year period. The increase was driven by higher Lease Operating Expenses of $11.25/boe primarily due to workover expenses and conversion of wells from rod to gas lift. As of May 14, 2018, the Company’s oil hedges covered a total of 3.9 million bbls through 2023 with a weighted average floor of $50.34 and ceiling of $57.61. Hedging covered approximately 54% of 2018 and ~17% of 2019 forecast production.\nOperational Highlights\nFirst quarter net production increased 5% to 630,183 Boe, or 7,002 Boe/day as compared to the same period in the prior year and decreased 18% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company did not bring any new wells into production during the quarter, but it drilled two gross (1.9 net) wells. The Paloma Ranch 7H and Peeler Ranch EFS 9HC had lateral lengths of 7,799 feet and 6,025 feet, respectively. In addition, as of quarter end the Company was in the process of drilling a third (1.0 net) well at quarter‐end, the Peeler Ranch 8HC with a lateral length of 5,778 ft. Drilling was completed on 12 April 2018. First quarter development and production related expenditures totaled $8.3 million.\nPioneer Natural Resources Joint Venture Acquisition and Guidance\nDuring the quarter, the Company announced it had entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire approximately 21,900 net acres and 1,700 Boe/d of production in the Eagle Ford from a joint venture operated by Pioneer Natural Resources, USA, Inc. for cash consideration of US$221.5 million, subject to post‐closing adjustments. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, this acquisition successfully closed as outlined in the Company’s 26 April, 2018 release. To fund the acquisition, the Company raised US$260.0 million of new equity. In addition, the Company refinanced its existing credit facility contemporaneous with the acquisition closing. Inclusive of the acquisition, the Company anticipates average production for the first half of 2018 to be 7,000-7,500 boe/d with significant development activities in the second half of the year increasing full year 2018 production to 9,000-10,000 boe/d. The Company’s two rig development plan calls for the drilling of 30 - 40 new wells per twelve month period. The Company anticipates Capital Expenditures of $175 – 190 million in 2018 and $200 – 220 million in 2019. The Company began drilling the H Harlan Bethune 25H, 26H and 27H subsequent to quarter end and anticipates mobilizing a second rig late in the second quarter to the acquired assets. The Company anticipates Lease Operating Expenses to increase slightly in the second quarter due to the assumption of Pioneer’s existing midstream contracts for acquired existing production, before decreasing as additional production come online at more market rates. The Company has issued EBITDAX guidance of $100 - 110 million and $250 - 275 million for full years 2018 and 2019 respectively.\nThe following tables present certain production, per unit metrics and Adjusted EBITDAX that compare results of the corresponding quarterly reporting periods:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Unaudited 2018 2017 % Change Net Sales Volumes Oil (Bbls) 365,241 398,634 -8 % Natural gas (Mcf) 884,423 770,845 15 % NGL (Bbls) 79,513 68,046 17 % Total Boe 592,158 595,154 -0.5 % Average Daily Volumes Average daily production (Boe), including flared gas (1) 7,002 6,685 5 % Product Price Received Total price received (per Boe) $ 40.59 $ 39.04 4 % Total realized price (per Boe) (2) $ 37.92 $ 38.11 -0.5 % (1) Includes flared gas of 228,150 Mcf and 38,862 Mcf for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
