Over the last 16 months, the funds have pulled in nearly $67 billion, according to Lipper.\nRising oil prices should be helping the developing markets, which include some of the biggest crude producers, yet May is on pace to deliver their first month of withdrawals of 2018.\nRecent days brought news including Argentina’s move to seek financing from the International Monetary Fund to calm volatile markets. That adds to pressures including the trade conflict between the United States and China.\nU.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday said interest rate hikes the Fed has planned may not pose as big a risk for emerging-market economies as many have thought.\nRising rates make bonds more attractive to foreign buyers, who sell assets in other currencies to buy dollar-denominated Treasuries.\nThat helps lift the greenback, making it harder for emerging market countries to repay debts or import goods priced in dollars. The trade-weighted U.S. currency is up more than 3 percent over the last month.\nRising rates have helped short-dated debt buyers. The notes now offer plumper yields and in general lack the interest-rate sensitivity of longer-dated bonds. Investors can also use the bonds to hide from greater volatility in stocks.\nCorporate bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on the short-term segment of the market pulled in $1.1 billion during the week, the most new cash for the category since September 2017, Lipper data showed.\nInvestors are also rewarding smaller U.S.-listed companies seen as sheltered from trade disputes and benefiting from corporate tax cuts. Small-cap funds tracked by Lipper pulled in $1.2 billion during the week, a fifth straight week of inflows.
