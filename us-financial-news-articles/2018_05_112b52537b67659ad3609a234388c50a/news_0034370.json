JFE owns a 15 percent stake in JSW.\nAsked if JFE would consider providing finance for the deal or look at taking a direct stake in Essar if JSW succeeded in it bid, Hayashida said: “If JSW becomes a buyer of Essar, we may have to consider doing something, but it’s too early to comment on any concrete measure.\n“India is very attractive as a production base and as a market. We have a great interest in India,” he added.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Tom Hogue and Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:25:18.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
