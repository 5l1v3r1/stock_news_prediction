The company can also offset some future taxes using losses not booked in previous years and use the extra cash to repurchase its shares.\nThe cable TV provider, which is expected to complete a spinoff from European telecom company Altice NV ( ATCA.AS ) next month, has been stepping up efforts to cushion the impact of “cord-cutting” as viewers drop cable packages and move to streaming services such as Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ).\nAltice USA is working to expand in high-speed internet as well as by offering “skinny bundles” of fewer channels to subscribers at lower prices.\nAltice USA’s shares could reach the “high 20s,” according to Barron’s, after closing at $18.48 on Friday. The paper did not give a timeframe for such an increase.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:36:01.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
