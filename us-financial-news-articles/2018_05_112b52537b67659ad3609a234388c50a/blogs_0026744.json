The group is targeting areas like diabetes management, care for mothers and infants and aging, said the people, who asked not to be named because the work is confidential. Taking on digital health\nOther key members include Missy Krasner, who joined Amazon last year after leading industry initiatives at Box and Google , and Larry Ockene, a 10-year veteran engineer at Amazon. Yvonne Chou, who has worked at Amazon for eight years across Prime, fashion and retail, is one of the three managers under Jiang.\nWithin the Alexa unit, the team falls under a group called Alexa Domains, according to the internal document.\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment. show chapters 7:33 AM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 | 02:08\nKrasner moved to Alexa in recent months from a stealthy group led by Babak Parviz that operates under the various monikers AmazonX, Grand Challenges and 1492. Krasner, who played an instrumental role in obtaining HIPAA compliance at Box, is leading business development and strategy, the people said.\nWhile Amazon isn't talking publicly about the health and wellness group, its existence is the clearest indication of the company's plan to bring Alexa voice technology to the rapidly growing field of digital health. Having the right compliance and regulatory licenses in place would allow Alexa-powered devices and apps to share and upload sensitive health data with medical professionals and patients. It would also enable integrations with third-party apps.\nIn the summer of 2017, the company worked with drugmaker Merck to offer a prize to developers building Alexa \"skills\" to help people with diabetes manage all aspects of their care. In recent months, Amazon has been looking more closely at how to help new mothers, a group that already relies heavily on Amazon for diapers and other supplies.\nAmazon has numerous other projects underway that are focused on taking a slice of the multitrillion-dollar health-care industry.\nAmazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division, has a team dedicated to serving health and pharmaceutical companies. On the e-commerce side, the marketplace group is reportedly looking at multiple ways to get into drug distribution.\nThe company's most public pronouncement came earlier this year when it formed a joint initiative with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan aimed at improving health-care services. And there's the mysterious Grand Challenge team, which people familiar with the project say is interested in both hardware, diagnostics and the aging population.
