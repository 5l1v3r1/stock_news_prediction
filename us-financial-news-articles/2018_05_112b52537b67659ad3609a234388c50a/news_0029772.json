(Nasdaq:LIFE), a biotherapeutics company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative medicines based on novel immunological pathways, today announced operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company also announced a corporate restructuring plan to streamline its operations as it focuses its development efforts on the further clinical advancement of ATYR1923.\nProgram Prioritization and Corporate Restructuring\naTyr has decided not to proceed with IND-enabling activities, including GMP manufacturing, for the panel of antibodies identified in its ORCA program, as pre-clinical data generated over the last month did not show sufficient efficacy to justify further development at this time. In light of this, the Company has implemented a corporate restructuring based on the resources necessary to continue to develop ATYR1923 and pursue additional research efforts for the ORCA program. The corporate restructuring includes an immediate workforce reduction of approximately 30% as well as additional cost saving measures.\n“This has been a very difficult process and we regret the impact this business decision has on our departing employees and their families. We are grateful for the many contributions of our impacted employees and I want to sincerely thank them for all their hard work and commitment to aTyr,” commented Sanjay Shukla, M.D., M.S., President and CEO of aTyr. “Going forward, we are primarily focused on ATYR1923 and designing a future patient trial which will be influenced by data from our ongoing Phase I trial, translational activities and research related to the role of the receptor for ATYR1923.”\nKey Research Finding: Identification of Receptor for ATYR1923\nThe Company has identified Neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) as a binding partner for ATYR1923 from a screen of greater than 4,500 human membrane proteins. NRP-2 is a pleiotropic receptor that can bind to a number of different ligands. It has a well-established role in the development of the neural and lymphatic systems and an emerging role in the adult immune system. aTyr is currently evaluating the role of NRP-2 interactions in the control of immune responses, and designing optimal therapeutic approaches to modulate this newly-discovered receptor in the Resokine pathway. The Company believes the discovery of this receptor will aid in the clinical development of the ATYR1923 program.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results and Cash Position\nResearch and development expenses were $6.2 million and $9.2 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease of $3.1 million was due primarily to a $1.9 million decrease related to the completion of ATYR1940 clinical studies and a decrease of $1.1 million related to lower product manufacturing costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.1 million and $4.0 million for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $74.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments and 41.2 million shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis (includes 29.8 million shares of common stock and 11.4 million shares of common stock if converted from Class X Preferred stock).\nConference Call and Webcast Details\naTyr Pharma will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time to discuss the results and the recent announcements.
