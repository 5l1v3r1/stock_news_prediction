The cruises business saw first half profit rise 23 percent.\nJoussen said TUI was seeing an opportunity in new customer groups for cruises, such as families and younger couples, but that growth was still coming from the traditional audience of older travellers.\nTUI’s board has therefore approved construction of a third expedition cruise ship for its Hapag-Lloyd luxury cruise brand, coming on top of another ship ordered for TUI Cruises earlier in the year.\n“The cruises market has changed a lot, it’s growing incredibly fast,” Joussen said.\nOverall, the group reported a narrower operating loss of 125 million euros ($148 million) for the quarter, which is traditionally loss-making, and confirmed a target for full-year underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) to rise by at least 10 percent at constant currencies.
