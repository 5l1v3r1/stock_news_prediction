If something happens great, if not we can live with that too.\"\nAsked by Recode's Kara Swisher about what those discussions entailed, he said: \"About putting them onto our network.\"\nKhosrowshahi added: \"They are an incredible technology provider out there — they're building, they're serious about autonomous to the extent that that technology could show up on our network, it's a good thing. Now it's up to them whether they want to do it or not.\"\nHis comments follow a grueling legal battle with Waymo over allegations that Uber stole trade secrets from the firm related to its autonomous driving technology. That lawsuit was settled earlier this year, and Uber paid out a 0.34 percent equity stake to Waymo.\nThe race towards developing driverless cars has become fiercely competitive, with multiple players aiming to be involved.\nTech giants such as Apple , Samsung and Tesla — as well as Uber and Waymo — are all pursuing the technology, while established automakers like Volkswagen and Nissan have their own driverless ambitions.\nChinese tech firms are also pushing for self-driving cars. Didi Chuxing, which bought Uber's Chinese unit in 2016, was recently given a permit to test self-driving cars in California.\nBut these driverless ambitions are facing significant hurdles. High-profile fatal accidents involving self-driving vehicles made by Uber and Tesla have heightened safety concerns.\nNotably in March, one of Uber's self-driving cars hit and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona. The firm ended driverless operations in the state following the tragic incident.\nSpeaking about that incident, Khosrowshahi said: \"We've got to get back on the road, but we have to be absolutely satisfied that we're getting back on the road in the safest manner possible. That's my focus right now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:26:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
