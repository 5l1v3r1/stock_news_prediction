The spread between Italy's 10-year bund and its German equivalent grew further to touch more than 270 basis points from Monday's 235 close, its highest since September, 2013.\nshow chapters BaFin president: Always a risk of contagion between euro zone banks 10 Hours Ago | 01:26 The continuing uncertainty in the euro zone's third biggest economy also helped the euro tumble to fresh multi-month lows.
