(FCOB), holding company of 1 st Colonial Community Bank, today reported net income of $1.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $977 thousand, or $0.22 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The earnings per diluted share were adjusted to give effect to the 5% stock dividend distributed to shareholders on April 16, 2018.\nGerry Banmiller, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are very pleased to announce our 11% growth in net income for the first quarter of 2018. Prudent loan growth and pricing similarly contributed to an 11% increase in net interest income, which is the driver of our earnings. Investments in our residential mortgage unit and our commercial lending group have us well positioned for prompt loan decisioning and continued growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nHighlights for the three months ended March 31, 2018, included:\nBalance Sheet Trends:\nAt March 31, 2018, total assets were $526.7 million and grew $23.2 million, or 4.6% from $503.5 million at March 31, 2017. Total loans were $383.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $20.8 million, or 5.7%, from $362.3 million at March 31, 2017. Increases were recognized in commercial loans secured by real estate and home equity loans. Total deposits were $475.1 million at March 31, 2018 and increased $12.1 million, or 2.6%, from $463.0 million at March 31, 2017. In 2017, we ran a successful certificates of deposit promotion which helped grow such deposits by $56.7 million during the past year. Municipal deposits and brokered deposits declined $13.4 million and $14.0 million, respectively. Total shareholders’ equity was $39.4 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $4.1 million, or 11.6%, from $35.3 million at March 31, 2017. 1 st Colonial's non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $2.4 million compared to $2.7 million at March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets to total assets at March 31, 2018 were 0.45% compared to 0.53% at March 31, 2017.\nIncome Statement and Other Highlights:\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $433 thousand, or 10.9%, to $4.4 million from $4.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The growth in net interest income was primarily related to an increase in interest income on loans and in the average yield earned on average interest-earning assets. During the past twelve months, the 75 basis point increase in the fed funds rate since March 2017 has had a positive impact on our variable rate loans and our interest-earning deposits. The improvement in interest income was partially offset by an increase in the interest paid on certificates of deposit. The net interest margin was 3.43% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.32% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest margin was directly related to an increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded a provision to the allowance for loan losses of $278 thousand compared to $100 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the quarter over quarter provision was related to an increase in specific reserves required on impaired loans. The loss allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.33% at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.28% at March 31, 2017. Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $645 thousand, a decrease of $233 thousand, or 26.5%, from $878 thousand for the first quarter of 2017. Gains on the sale of small business administration (“SBA”) loans and the sale of residential mortgages declined $158 thousand and $50 thousand, respectively, due to a decline in the volume of loans sold. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2017, we sold a property that was a former branch location and recorded a gain of $29 thousand as a result of the sale. There were no such sales in the first quarter of 2018. Non-interest expense was $3.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and increased $92 thousand, or 2.9%, from $3.2 million for the comparable period in 2017. Contributing to the increase in non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was a $95 thousand increase in salaries and benefits related to an increase in headcount in the lending support and compliance functions. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, income tax expense was $388 thousand compared to $570 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The $182 thousand decrease in tax expense was related to H.R.1 (originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”) which was enacted on December 22, 2017. H.R. 1 lowered the maximum federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nHighlights as of March 31, 2018 and 2017, and a comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2018 to the three months ended March 31, 2017 include the following:\n1 st COLONIAL BANCORP, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited, dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018\n2017\nInterest income $ 5,207 $ 4,511 Interest expense 793 530 Net Interest Income 4,414 3,981 Provision for loan losses 278 100 Net interest income after provision for loan losses 4,136 3,881 Non-interest income 645 878 Non-interest expense 3,304 3,212 Income before taxes 1,477 1,547 Income tax expense 388 570 Net Income $ 1,089 $ 977 Earnings Per Share – Basic (1) $ 0.25 $ 0.23 Earnings Per Share – Diluted (1) $ 0.24 $ 0.22 SELECTED PERFORMANCE RATIOS:\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nReturn on Average Assets 0.83 % 0.82 % Return on Average Equity 11.36 % 11.86 % At March 31, 2018\nAt March 31, 2017\nBook value per share (1) $ 8.97 $ 8.17 Capital ratios: Tier 1 Leverage 7.36 % 6.92 % Total Risk Based Capital 12.61 % 11.92 % Common Equity Tier 1 11.36 % 10.67 % (1) Adjusted to give effect to the 5% stock dividend distributed to shareholders on April 16, 2018. 1 st COLONIAL BANCORP, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited, in thousands) At March 31, 2018 At March 31, 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,328 $ 17,182 Total investments 113,376 109,540 Mortgage loans held for sale 4,356 5,069 Total loans 383,103 362,331 Less Allowance for loan losses (5,106 ) (4,643 ) Loans and leases, net 377,997 357,688 Bank owned life insurance 8,494 8,251 Premises and equipment, net 963 919 Other real estate owned, net - 57 Accrued interest receivable 1,596 1,235 Other assets 3,556 3,605 Total Assets $ 526,666 $ 503,546 Total deposits $ 475,124 $ 463,000 Other borrowings 10,437 3,479 Other liabilities 1,746 1,813 Total Shareholders’ Equity 39,359 35,254 Total Liabilities and Equity $ 526,666 $ 503,546 1 st COLONIAL BANCORP, INC.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN\n(Unaudited, in thousands, except percentages)\nFor the three months ended For the three months ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Average\nBalance\nInterest Yield Average\nBalance\nInterest Yield Cash and cash equivalents $ 22,791 $ 76 1.35 % $ 16,325 $ 24 0.60 % Investment securities 116,314 512 1.79 % 112,503 382 1.38 % Mortgage loans held for sale 5,816 47 3.28 % 5,419 38 2.77 % Loans 377,313 4,572 4.91 % 352,156 4,067 4.68 % Total interest-earning assets 522,234 5,207 4.04 % 486,403 4,511 3.76 % Non-interest earning assets 12,323 12,849 Total average assets $ 534,557 $ 499,252 Interest-bearing deposits\nNOW and money markets $ 233,099 $ 182 0.32 % $ 247,639 $ 179 0.29 % Savings 61,008 67 0.45 % 69,322 77 0.45 % Certificates of deposit 132,812 540 1.65 % 84,250 269 1.29 % Total interest-bearing deposits 426,919 789 0.75 % 401,211 525 0.53 % Borrowings 3,327 4 0.49 % 3,560 5 .57 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 430,246 793 0.75 % 404,771 530 0.53 % Non-interest bearing deposits 64,313 58,616 Other liabilities 1,420 1,580 Shareholders' equity 38,578 34,285 Total average liabilities and equity $ 534,557 $ 499,252 Net interest income $ 4,414 $ 3,981 Net interest margin 3.43 % 3.32 % Net interest spread 3.30 % 3.23 % 1st Colonial Community Bank, the subsidiary of 1 st Colonial Bancorp, provides a range of business and consumer financial services, placing emphasis on customer service and access to decision makers.
