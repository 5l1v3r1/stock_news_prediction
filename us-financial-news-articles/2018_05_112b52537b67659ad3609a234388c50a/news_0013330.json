Our operating business is strong. We achieved significant growth by adding more than 50,000 customers in Germany,” Chief Financial Officer Marc Spieker said.\nE.ON said its German retail business was instrumental in lifting the segment’s first-quarter profit by 23 percent to 392 million euros, beating the 377 million euros average analyst forecast.
