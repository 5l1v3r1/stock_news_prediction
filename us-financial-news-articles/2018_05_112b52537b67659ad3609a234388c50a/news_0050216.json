REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco\nBefore becoming president, Duterte promised to revive a stuttering peace process to end nearly five decades of conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people.\nBut that effort has been fraught with problems and he abandoned talks in November, complaining of duplicity and repeated rebel attacks.\nOn Thursday, Duterte said he had invited Jose Maria Sison, founder and leader of the Communist Party of the Philippines, to return after three decades in exile to restart the stalled negotiations.\n“He has agreed, and I gave him a window of two months, very small,” he said.\n“I will see to it and will personally escort him to the airport,” Duterte added, promising to let Sison return to exile in the Netherlands, regardless of the outcome.

This week, he told ABS-CBN news he was willing to come home to resume talks.\nThe government has asked a court to declare Sison and hundreds of CPP and NPA members “terrorists”. It is not clear if Duterte’s latest olive branch will affect that request.
