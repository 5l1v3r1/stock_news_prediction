(“Navios Partners” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NMM), an international owner and operator of container and drybulk vessels, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAngeliki Frangou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Navios Partners stated, “I am pleased with the results for the first quarter of 2018, during which we reported net income of $5.5 million. During the quarter, we reinstated distributions at $0.08 per unit annually, representing an annualized current yield of about 4.0%. Our initial quarterly distribution of $0.02 cents per unit will be payable on May 14, 2018 to unitholders of record as of May 10, 2018.”\nAngeliki Frangou continued, “Over the past couple of years, we used our cash flow to solidify our balance sheet and to renew and expand our drybulk fleet. Today we have a 33-vessel drybulk fleet that is larger and younger, on average, than it was only a couple of years ago. We have also used excess cash flow to reduce leverage, extend debt maturities and form a container focused entity that should provide us further upside. Overall, we believe we have established a unique growth platform in the drybulk sector that is capable of generating significant cash flow.”\nCash Distribution\nThe Board of Directors of Navios Partners declared a cash distribution for the first quarter of 2018 of $0.02 per unit. The cash distribution is payable on May 14, 2018 to unitholders of record as of May 10, 2018.\nDrybulk fleet renewal and expansion\nIn 2018, Navios Partners agreed to acquire from unrelated third parties:\nTwo 2006-built Panamax vessels of approximately 74,500 dwt each, the Navios Altair I and the Navios Symmetry, for a total purchase price of $22.0 million. The vessels are expected to be delivered to Navios Partners’ owned fleet during the second quarter of 2018. A 2005-built Panamax vessel of approximately 87,000 dwt, the Navios Apollon I, for a purchase price of $13.0 million. The vessel is expected to be delivered to Navios Partners’ owned fleet within May 2018.\nDuring 2017 through today, following the above acquisitions, Navios Partners has added a net total of nine vessels in its drybulk fleet, increasing the capacity of the drybulk fleet by 40% and reducing the average age by 12%.\nSale of Vessels\nOn April 27, 2018, Navios Partners agreed to sell the YM Utmost and the YM Unity, two 2006-built Container vessels of 8,204 TEU each, to its affiliate, Navios Maritime Containers Inc. (“Navios Containers”) for a total sale price of approximately $67.0 million. The transaction was unanimously approved by the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of Navios Partners. The Company is expected to recognize a book loss from the sale of the two vessels of approximately $37.6 million in the second quarter of 2018. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of May 2018.\nPrivate Placement of Navios Containers\nOn March 13, 2018, Navios Containers closed a private placement of 5,454,546 shares at a subscription price of $5.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $30.0 million. Navios Partners invested $14.5 million and received 2,629,095 shares. Navios Partners also received 370,909 warrants, with a five-year term. Following this transaction, Navios Partners owns approximately 36.0% of Navios Container’s equity.\nLong-Term Cash Flow\nNavios Partners has entered into medium to long-term time charter-out agreements for its vessels with a remaining average term of approximately 2.0 years. Navios Partners has currently contracted out 72.9% of its available days for 2018, 19.2% for 2019 and 16.2% for 2020, including index-linked charters, expecting to generate revenues (excluding index-linked charters) of approximately $121.7 million, $55.5 million and $65.9 million, respectively. The average expected daily charter-out rate for the fleet is $17,561, $23,706 and $29,992 for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nEARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the following results and the selected financial data presented herein, Navios Partners has compiled consolidated statements of operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The quarterly information was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective periods. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Earnings per Common unit, Net Income and Operating Surplus are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be used in isolation or substitution for Navios Partners’ results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).\n(in $‘000 except per unit data) Three Month\nPeriod Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n(unaudited)\nThree Month\nPeriod Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(unaudited)\nTime charter and voyage revenues $ 53,052 $ 42,411 Net income/ (loss) $ 5,478 $ (5,655 ) (1 ) Net cash provided by/ (used in) operating activities $ 6,427 $ (2,180 ) EBITDA $ 30,911 $ 22,654 Adjusted EBITDA $ 31,525 (2 ) $ 25,873 (3 ) Earnings per Common unit (basic and diluted) $ 0.03 $ (0.06 ) (1) Operating Surplus $ 17,460 $ 17,566 Maintenance and Replacement Capital expenditure reserve $ 6,062 $ 3,265 Net loss and Earnings per Common unit for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 included a $3.2 million write-off of deferred finance fees and discount related to the refinancing of the Term Loan B Facility, a $1.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts, a $1.3 million loss related to the disposal of one of our vessels and a $0.5 million equity compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 has been adjusted to exclude a $0.6 million equity compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 has been adjusted to exclude a $1.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts, a $1.3 million loss related to the disposal of one of our vessels and a $0.5 million equity compensation expense.\nThree month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nTime charter and voyage revenues for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 increased by $10.6 million, or 25.1%, to $53.1 million, as compared to $42.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in time charter and voyage revenues was mainly attributable to: (i) the increase in revenue following the acquisition of seven vessels in 2017; and (ii) the increase in Time Charter Equivalent rate per day (“TCE”) to $16,108 per day for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, from $14,671 per day for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. That increase was partially mitigated by the decrease in revenue due to the sales of the MSC Cristina, the Navios Apollon and the Navios Gemini S in 2017. The available days of the fleet increased to 3,186 days for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 2,794 days for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, mainly due to the increased fleet.\nEBITDA for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 was negatively affected by the accounting effect of a $0.6 million equity compensation expense. EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was negatively affected by the accounting effect of a: (i) $1.5 million allowance for doubtful accounts; (ii) $1.3 million loss on the disposal due to the sale of one of our vessels; and (iii) $0.5 million equity compensation expense. Excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5.7 million to $31.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $25.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to a: (i) $10.6 million increase in revenue; and (ii) $1.0 million increase in equity in net earnings of affiliated companies. The above increase was partially mitigated by a: (i) $0.3 million increase in time charter and voyage expenses; (ii) $2.3 million increase in management fees due to the increased fleet; (iii) $0.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses; (iv) $2.5 million decrease in other income; and (v) $0.6 million increase in other expenses.\nThe reserve for estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was $6.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively (please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 3).\nNavios Partners generated an operating surplus for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 of $17.5 million, as compared to $17.6 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. Operating Surplus is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions (please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 3).\nNet Income for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $5.5 million as compared to a net loss of $5.7 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The increase in Net Income of $11.1 million was due to : (i) an $8.3 million increase in EBITDA; (ii) a $0.1 million decrease in direct vessel expenses; (iii) a $1.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense; (iv) a $0.5 million decrease in interest expense and finance cost, net; and (v) a $0.4 million increase in interest income.\nFleet Employment Profile\nThe following table reflects certain key indicators of Navios Partners’ core fleet performance for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree Month Three Month Period Ended\nPeriod Ended March 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017 (unaudited)\n(unaudited) Available Days (1) 3,186 2,794 Operating Days (2) 3,142 2,790 Fleet Utilization (3) 98.63 % 99.83 % Time Charter Equivalent Combined (per day) (4) $ 16,108 $ 14,671 Time Charter Equivalent Drybulk (per day) (4) $ 12,265 $ 9,421 Time Charter Equivalent Containers (per day) (4) $ 31,700 $ 32,290 Vessels operating at period end 36 31\n(1 ) Available days for the fleet represent total calendar days the vessels were in Navios Partners’ possession for the relevant period after subtracting off-hire days associated with scheduled repairs, dry dockings or special surveys and ballast days relating to voyages. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a relevant period during which a vessel is capable of generating revenues.\n(2 ) Operating days are the number of available days in the relevant period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a relevant period during which vessels actually generate revenues.\n(3 ) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that Navios Partners’ vessels were available for revenue generating available days, and is determined by dividing the number of operating days during a relevant period by the number of available days during that period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure efficiency in finding employment for vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs, dry dockings or special surveys.\n(4 ) TCE rate: Time Charter Equivalent rate per day is defined as voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during the period. The TCE rate per day is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to present the actual daily earnings generated by vessels on various types of charter contracts for the number of available days of the fleet.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income/(loss) attributable to Navios Partners’ unitholders before interest and finance costs, before depreciation and amortization (including intangible accelerated amortization) and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before equity compensation expense, loss on sale of vessel, impairment losses and allowance for doubtful accounts, reactivation costs, write-off of deferred finance charges and gain on change in control. Navios Partners uses Adjusted EBITDA as a liquidity measure and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA in this document is calculated as follows: net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of: (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets; (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities; (iii) net interest cost; (iv) amortization and write-off of deferred finance charges and other related expenses; (v) allowance for doubtful accounts; (vi) equity in net earnings of affiliated companies; (vii) payments for drydock and special survey costs; (viii) gain/(loss) on sale of assets/subsidiaries; (ix) impairment charges; (x) non-cash accrued interest income and amortization of deferred revenue; (xi) gain/(loss) on debt repayments; (xii) equity compensation expense; (xiii) gain on change in control; and (xiv) noncontrolling interest. Navios Partners believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are each the basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and presents useful information to investors regarding Navios Partners’ ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and make cash distributions. Navios Partners also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used: (i) by potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding certain items, as described under “Earnings Highlights.”\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Partners’ results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Partners’ performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\n2. Operating Surplus\nOperating Surplus represents net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash interest expense, estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures and one-off items. Maintenance and replacement capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain over the long term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, Navios Partners’ capital assets.\nOperating Surplus is a quantitative measure used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Operating Surplus is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered a substitute for net income, cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\n3. Available Cash\nAvailable Cash generally means for each fiscal quarter, all cash on hand at the end of the quarter:\nless the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Directors to: provide for the proper conduct of Navios Partners’ business (including reserve for maintenance and replacement capital expenditures); comply with applicable law, any of Navios Partners’ debt instruments, or other agreements; or provide funds for distributions to the unitholders and to the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters; plus all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. Working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under any revolving credit or similar agreement used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners.\nAvailable Cash is a quantitative measure used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership’s ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Available cash is not required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered a substitute for net income, cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.\n4.
