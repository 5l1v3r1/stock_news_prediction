We definitely have the capacity locally to supply them and it can be turned on particularly quickly with basic commodity items such as underwear,” a textile industry source said.\nThe source said discussions were also underway with Australian no-frills chain Cotton On and Zara, the world’s biggest fashion retailer owned by Inditex, to source products locally.
