BP-Russia relationship is 'good' The Sunday Telegraph reported Russian authorities were looking for ways to oust Dudley, and about 150 other Western executives, from the country. It was then suggested that Russian intelligence agency FSB decided to administer a harmful toxin into Dudley's bloodstream.\nWhen asked how he would describe BP's relationship with Russian partners in light of recent reports, Gilvary replied: \"TNK-BP was a great (and) very successful joint venture but it could be noisy at times with some of our partners. I think the difference today is actually the relationship is with oil and gas people. It's Rosneft — it's an oil and gas company and we have a very good working relationship on the ground.\n\"But the relationship is good… and it is very different to what we had with TNK-BP.\"\nAround five years after Dudley left Russia, TNK-BP was sold to Rosneft.\nIn return, BP was paid a £12 billion ($16.3 billion) lump sum and given a 12.5 percent stake in the state-owned company.", "external_links": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/29/bp-chief-poisoned-russia-plot-claims-former-colleague/"], "published": "2018-05-01T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T16:08:35.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
