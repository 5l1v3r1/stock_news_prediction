The total value of deals is up 33.6 percent over the same period last year.\n\"HUGE GAME CHANGER\"\nCollectible toys maker, The Loyal Subjects' Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Cathey said he has seen an increase in interest since the bankruptcy, and has had at least two potential buyers pursue his California-based company. Chief Executive Officer Jay Foreman of Florida-based toy maker Basic Fun! said talks of consolidation between his firm and smaller players have \"easily tripled\" since September.\n\"Toys 'R' Us is really a huge game changer,\" Foreman said, whose firm bought K'Nex and Geoworld since Toys 'R' Us went bust. The toy retailer's bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of its over 700 U.S. stores in March was the largest collapse in a year that saw record store closures and a fundamental shift in once-reliable brick-and-mortar retail models.\n\"More companies are now questioning, where are the biggest opportunities to sell toys,\" said Kate Clark, founder and president of Paddington bear toy maker, Yottoy Productions Inc.\n\"Unfortunately, some toy companies may struggle greatly and some may not survive.\"\nAccording to market research firm NPD Group, U.S. toy sales topped $20 billion last year. Mattel and Hasbro together accounted for 25 percent and small players made up as much as 40 percent.\nToys 'R' Us alone had accounted for 12 percent of all toy sales nationwide, according to NPD Group.\nBut toy sales in the U.S. have been slowing and with Toys 'R' Us gone, toy makers have lost an incubator for new and experimental toys that other retailers were not willing to bet on.\n\"As an entrepreneur who was starting a toy company, they (Toys 'R' Us) were always the one that were willing to take chances and buy a broader array of products,\" said Michael Rinzler, founder of Wicked Cool Toys that makes Cabbage Patch Kids and Teddy Ruxpin bears.\nIndustry observers say that points to the power lying firmly with a handful of big players in the sector.\n\"When you're a smaller sized company ... do you say that maybe it's a better strategy (to) merge with another company or to perhaps to be acquired so that you get more scale?\" said Bob Wann, who is the chairman of the Toy Association in the United States and the CEO of toy company PlayMonster.\n\"I think more companies will think about considering that than perhaps they did in the past.\"\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Uday Sampath Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:20:26.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
