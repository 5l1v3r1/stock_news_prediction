And if you can steal somebody's email and extort that person in an anonymous currency, that's a challenge for us.\"\n\"We're making it easier to make money off computer intrusions,\" Mandia warned.\nAs cybersecurity companies like Mandia's in turn make money off protecting people from those intrusions, budding issues like overlapping products and services start to emerge.\nBut in an increasingly digital — and thus increasingly risky — age, the more protection, the better, the CEO told Cramer.\n\"You can't just be good at network security or just good at endpoint or just good at asset discovery. You've got to be good at email security, endpoint security and network security. You want to bring it all together,\" Mandia said.\nHe referred to FireEye's product as a second layer, or \"layer two\" to things like firewalls and built-in email security.\n\"We're detecting millions of attacks a week, and when we detect them, that's a problem,\" the CEO said. \"We're the second goalie in the net. So attacks are still real. We've got to bring network, email and endpoint together. Just going solo with one of those is not a layered defense.\" Watch Cramer's full interview with Kevin Mandia here: show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T01:49:08.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
