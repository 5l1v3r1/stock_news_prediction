With China’s rising economic clout, and the growing importance of the Renminbi, increasing foreign inflows will be the norm,” Fang told a financial forum in Shanghai.\n“Under such circumstances, it’s important to maintain stability of the financial markets ... and ensure there are no price bubbles in various financial assets including stocks, bonds, loans, and derivatives.”\nFang said financial deregulation in other developing countries has offered China a wealth of lessons.\n“If financial markets are healthy, short-term fluctuations in cross-border capital flows would not turn into a lasting tide, so that disturbance to the (domestic) financial system is temporary and limited. Otherwise, a small, unexpected incident could potentially destroy an edifice built on sand.”\nUnderscoring regulators’ commitment to further opening, Fang said a planned stock link between Shanghai and London is on track.\nCSRC is “working hard” on the Shanghai-London Stock Connect, and aims to roll out the first product under the scheme by the end of this year, he said.\nMeanwhile, overseas-listed Chinese tech firms will soon issue China depositary receipts (CDRs) on Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, Fang said.\nCommenting on the MSCI entry, which will see 234 China-listed big cap stocks included in MSCI’s emerging markets benchmark on June 1, Fang said “China’s stock market will embrace the most forceful and sustainable participation from global institutional investors.”\nAs China promotes cross-border financial investments, CSRC is also stepping up cooperation with regulators in other markets to reduce financial risks.\nFor example, CSRC and Hong Kong’s securities regulator has signed a memorandum of understanding on the supervision of cross-border derivative products, in expectation of an increase in such instruments, Fang said.\nA transcript of Fang’s speech was posted on the CSRC website.
