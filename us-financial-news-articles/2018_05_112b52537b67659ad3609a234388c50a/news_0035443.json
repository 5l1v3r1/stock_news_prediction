The outbreak appears to have erupted in early April in forested villages reachable only by helicopter or motorbikes near the town of Bokoro. Health officials fear the virus could be spreading to more populous areas.\nThe outbreak is in Equateur province near the Congo River, a major transport route for the country’s riverside capital of Kinshasa, and the neighboring Republic of Congo’s Brazzaville.\nThe World Health Organization, in its latest update Monday , said two probable cases had been identified in the Wangata region close to the port city Mbandaka, population 1.2 million.\nMore\nEbola Funds Pledged for Recovery Are Slow to Come Ebola Vaccines Show Promise in New Study Are We Now Ready for Ebola? How the 2014 Ebola Crisis Unfolded Health officials are following up with at least 390 people who have been identified as contacts of Ebola patients. The virus is transmitted by contact with the blood or fluids of an infected person.\nWith the outbreak spreading, officials are eager to inoculate health-care workers, family members and others in contact with the individuals who are sick, to stop the spread of the virus in a strategy known as “ring vaccination.” But it will still take several days for the vaccine to be distributed, WHO and Congo officials say.\nThe shipment of about 4,000 vaccine doses will come from a stockpile that Merck previously supplied to the World Health Organization for storage in Geneva, Switzerland, to be used for a “rapid response to any outbreak,” Merck spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said. Merck plans to send an additional 4,300 doses to WHO to support the response, she said.\nThat means distribution to the affected areas could happen early next week, said Jessica Ilunga, communications officer for Congo’s public-health ministry.\nMerck has maintained a 300,000-dose stockpile in the U.S. and Europe since 2016 under an agreement struck with GAVI, the international vaccine alliance. GAVI supplied $1 million to cover costs of the vaccine rollout, Chief Executive Seth Berkley said.\nMerck’s and other experimental Ebola vaccines haven’t received official marketing approval from U.S. or other government regulators, despite the acceleration in vaccine research and development after the 2014-2015 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people.\nAs a result, countries can’t order experimental vaccines and keep them on hand. Use of the Merck vaccine requires special approval, which can take time.\nOnce regulators approve a vaccine for marketing, it can be shipped quickly—usually within 48 hours—to an outbreak, said Dr. Berkley of GAVI.Then it can be used pre-emptively, to inoculate health-care workers and others who are likely to come in contact with Ebola patients, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Policy and Research at the University of Minnesota. Currently, use of the experimental vaccine is generally limited to people who come into contact with infected individuals, he said.\nWith an approved vaccine, “we could have an Ebola-prepared Africa, where the vaccine is really promoted among health-care workers, emergency responders and burial workers and we could pre-deploy it,” he said.\nMerck, based in Kenilworth, N.J., licensed the rights to further develop and market an experimental vaccine in 2014 from NewLink Genetics Corp. , of Ames, Iowa, which had previously licensed it from the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine, code-named V920 , was effective in preventing Ebola virus disease among people who had come into contact with infected people in Guinea in 2015 and 2016, according to a study published in The Lancet.\nBoth U.S. and European regulators have designated the vaccine a high priority.\nUnder Merck’s original timetable, the company planned to apply to U.S. government regulators for marketing approval of the vaccine by the end of 2017. That would have set up the possibility of getting U.S. Food and Drug Administration or European Union marketing approval sometime this year.\nMerck hasn’t filed because it has encountered “unforeseen facility and engineering issues” at a manufacturing plant it’s building in Burgwedel, Germany, where it plans to make the vaccine, Ms. Eisele said. It also is awaiting results from other clinical studies. Merck plans to file for regulatory approvals in 2019, she said.\nGlaxoSmithKline PLC, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and Johnson & Johnson are among other entities developing other Ebola vaccines. A J&J spokeswoman said the company is maintaining a stockpile of two million dosing regimens of its experimental Ebola vaccine, and is ready to provide them whenever needed. A spokesman for GSK, which co-developed a vaccine with the NIH, said it has stockpiled doses and is closely monitoring the situation.\nThe Congo government issued import permits for doses of the Merck vaccine last week, shortly after confirmation of the outbreak. The country has set up storage facilities to keep the vaccine doses at the required temperatures of as low as minus-80 degrees Celsius.\nCongo has experience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks. The country has had nine in the past four decades, most recently in May 2017 in a remote location in the Bas-Uele province near the Ebola River, after which the virus was named in 1976. The government didn’t use the experimental vaccine in the 2017 outbreak partly because it hadn’t yet reviewed a study protocol necessary for its use and the outbreak fizzled out quickly.\nThis time, the government is better prepared, Ms. Ilunga said. “After last year’s outbreak, government has been putting in place more preventive measures,” she said.\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com , Nicholas Bariyo at nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com and Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T00:07:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
