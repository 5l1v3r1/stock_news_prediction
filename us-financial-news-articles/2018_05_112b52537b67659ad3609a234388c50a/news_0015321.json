Rosenblatt, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Universal Display. “Over the last decade, OLEDs have penetrated an estimated 10%+ of the consumer electronics display market. This, we believe, is just the beginning of the technology’s promising potential as panel makers further improve OLED mobile’s competitiveness, OLED TVs continue to gain market share, and foldable development work accelerates.”\nRosenblatt continued, “With respect to the multi-year OLED capex growth cycle we are in, while we are seeing some capacity digestion this year, we also believe there is a significant amount of capacity being built. The first half of the year is being impacted by the soft premium smartphone market, but in the second half, we expect to see a pick-up in OLED panel demand. As new OLED capacity ramps, we continue to expect 2019 to be a meaningful year of growth. Based on current production timelines, we expect the installed capacity base, as measured in square meters, to increase by approximately 50% by the end of 2019, as compared to the end of 2017.”\nFinancial Highlights for the First Quarter of 2018\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the financial results of the first quarter of 2018 with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. Under this transition method, we applied the standard only to contracts that were not complete at the initial adoption date.\nTotal revenue decreased 22% to $43.6 million 2018, compared with $55.6 million 2017, driven by lower material sales, partially offset by higher royalty and license fees. The Company believes that these results were due to three factors: First, the premium smartphone market declined faster and to a greater extent than anticipated. The Company believes that this resulted in weaker-than-expected material sales demand for OLED panels. The second factor was ASC Topic 606. Under ASC Topic 605, total revenue would have been $68.2 million 2018. And thirdly, the Company believes that there were material inventory pre-purchases that occurred in 2017. Revenue from material sales decreased 46% to $25.3 million in the first quarter, compared with $46.6 million 2017. The Company believes that the decline was due to weaker-than-expected material sales demand for OLED panels, resulting from the softness in the premium smartphone market, and the estimated material inventory pre-purchases that occurred in 2017. Revenue from royalty and license fees increased 126% to $15.9 million in the first quarter, compared with $7.0 million 2017. Cost of materials decreased 53% to $5.7 million in the first quarter, compared with $12.1 million 2017. Cost of materials was not affected by the adoption of ASC Topic 606. Operating income decreased by $7.6 million to $4.5 million in the first quarter, compared with $12.1 million 2017. Under ASC Topic 605, operating income would have been $29.2 million 2018. Net income decreased by $4.4 million to $6.0 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the first quarter, compared with $10.4 million or $0.22 per diluted share 2017. Under ASC Topic 605, net income would have been $25.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, 2018.\nRevenue Comparison\n($ in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Material sales $ 25,250 $ 46,637 Royalty and license fees 15,911 7,025 Contract research services 2,411 1,904 Total revenue $ 43,572 $ 55,566 Cost of Materials Comparison\n($ thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Material sales $ 25,250 $ 46,637 Cost of material sales 5,690 12,099 Gross margin on material sales 19,560 34,538 Gross margin as a % of material sales 77 % 74 % Topic 606 versus 605 Adjusted Results\nFor the three-months (in thousands)\nAs reported Adjustment Balances without\nadoption of Topic\n606\nRevenue $ 43,572 $ 24,653 $ 68,225 Gross margin 36,114 24,653 60,767 Operating income 4,519 24,653 29,172 Net income 5,959 19,969 25,928 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.13 $ 0.43 $ 0.55 2018 Revised Guidance\nAlthough the OLED industry is still at an early state where many variables can have a material impact on its growth, and the Company thus caveats its financial guidance accordingly, the Company now believes that its revenue will be in the range of $280 million to $310 million for fiscal 2018. Both the initial guidance and this revised guidance were prepared utilizing accounting standard ASC Topic 606. Under the prior accounting standard ASC Topic 605, the Company estimates that its 2018 revenues would be approximately 10% to 15% higher.\nDividend\nThe Company also announced a second quarter cash dividend of $0.06 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on June 29, 2018 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nIn conjunction with this release, Universal Display will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
