(NASDAQ:ADMA) (“ADMA” or the “Company”), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided an update on its operations and corporate objectives.\n“During the first quarter, we achieved several internal goals regarding the improvement of our quality systems and manufacturing processes, including a significant regulatory milestone with the commercial product release of Nabi-HB®,” stated Adam Grossman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The recently commercialized batch of Nabi-HB® was sourced and manufactured under our ownership, resulting in increased quarter-over-quarter revenues.”\nMr. Grossman continued, “Also during the quarter, we successfully qualified the filling and packaging process for Bivigam®, our Intravenous Immunoglobulin (“IVIG”) product, and filled three conformance batches, along with the production and filling of three RI-002 conformance batches. The filled Bivigam® and RI-002 batches are currently undergoing stability testing, as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and results are planned to be used to support our anticipated Prior Approval Supplement (“PAS”) for Bivigam® and Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for RI-002. These batches are the first conformance lots manufactured using our improved, optimized IVIG production process. We anticipate that upon FDA approval of the regulatory filings, we will have the ability to use these conformance batches as commercial product. We continue to believe that our regulatory timelines established at the beginning of 2018 remain on track, and we look forward to providing further updates as they occur.”\n2018 Anticipated Goals and Milestones\nContinuous Improvement to our Overall Corporate Quality Systems\nComplete FDA inspection process and receive feedback from the Agency\nSubmit PAS for optimized Bivigam®/IVIG manufacturing process\nRespond to complete response letter and resubmit BLA for RI-002\nResume supply of marketed products\nObtain FDA approval for our third plasma collection center\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nADMA reported total revenues of $4.0 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.6 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, representing an increase of $1.4 million, or approximately 54%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the accretive nature of assets and commercial product rights acquired from the Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation Therapy Business Unit (“BTBU”), which was completed in June 2017.\nThe consolidated net loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $17.8 million, or $(0.39) per basic and diluted share, as compared to a consolidated net loss of $6.5 million, or $(0.51) per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net loss of $11.3 million was primarily attributable to increased product revenue costs of $10.6 million, which included unabsorbed manufacturing costs of $5.2 million at our plasma fractionation facility acquired in the BTBU transaction, $2.5 million of costs related to the production of RI-002 and $1.1 million of costs related to the production of Bivigam, among other product revenue related revenue costs. Other costs attributable to the increased net loss include higher employee related costs of approximately $1.6 million as part of the BTBU acquisition. Included in the net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were non-cash expenses of $1.6 million for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest expense.\nAt March 31, 2018, ADMA had cash and cash equivalents of $26.1 million, as compared to $43.1 million at December 31, 2017. ADMA’s net working capital as of March 31, 2018 was $37.0 million, as compared to $53.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAbout ADMA Biologics, Inc.
