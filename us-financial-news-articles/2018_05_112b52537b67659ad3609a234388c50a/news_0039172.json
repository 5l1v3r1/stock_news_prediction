The government declared three days of mourning.\nTurkey has expelled Israel’s ambassador and recalled its ambassadors from Tel Aviv and Washington. It has called for an emergency meeting of Islamic nations on Friday.\nOn Wednesday, Israel protested what it called Turkey’s “unbecoming treatment” of its expelled ambassador, after the envoy was shown on Turkish media being patted down by airport security in Istanbul in public view.\nIn response to Ambassador Eitan Naveh’s treatment, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it summoned the Turkish embassy’s charge d’affaires.\nThe Turkish ambassador to Israel was recalled to Ankara for consultations on Monday.\nIsrael expelled the Turkish consul-general in Jerusalem, and Erdogan exchanged heated words on Twitter with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry said the Turkish Consul-General in Jerusalem had been summoned and told to return to Turkey “for consultations for a period of time.”\nThe dispute appears to mark the worst diplomatic crisis between the two regional powers since Israeli marines stormed an aid ship to enforce a naval blockade of Gaza in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists and prompting a downgrade in diplomatic ties that lasted until 2016.
