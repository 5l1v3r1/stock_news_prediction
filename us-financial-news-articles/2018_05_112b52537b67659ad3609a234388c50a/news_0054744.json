Analysts had forecast a decline of about 8 percent and a rise of 5 percent respectively.\nMeanwhile, like-for-like sales fell 8.0 percent at Castorama but were up 0.8 percent at Brico Depot.\nLaury said market conditions continue to be mixed.\n“The UK is uncertain, as demonstrated by recent weak retail sales data; France is encouraging, but volatile; whilst Poland continues to be supportive,” she said.\nShares in Kingfisher, down 18 percent over the last year prior to Thursday’s update, reversed early falls and were flat at 0850 GMT, valuing the business at 6.4 billion pounds.\n“We expect Kingfisher to recover some but not all of the seasonal weakness and see consensus profit before tax downgrades (for 2018-19) in the order of 2-3 percent,” RBC Europe analyst Richard Chamberlain, said.\nLast month Kingfisher’s UK rival Homebase/Bunnings, owned by Australia’s Wesfarmers, reported a 13.9 percent slump in same store sales in its latest quarter.\nAnalysts say Kingfisher would be a major beneficiary if Wesfarmers quits the UK after its disastrous 2016 purchase of Homebase. In February, Wesfarmers took a $1 billion writedown on Homebase and said it was reviewing its future. It will update the market on June 7.\nMedia reports have said Wesfarmers is prepared to pay a dowry to a new owner to rid itself of the business.
