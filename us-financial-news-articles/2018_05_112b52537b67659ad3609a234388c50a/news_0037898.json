Col. Martin O’Donnell, spokesman for U.S.-led international forces in Afghanistan .\nIt wasn’t immediately known whether the ease with which the Taliban left the city, located near the Iranian border, resulted from an explicit agreement between commanders on both sides. Breaking off fighting to avoid further bloodshed is a time-honored and frequently practiced tradition in civil conflicts in Afghanistan.\nAbdul Basir Salangi, the provincial governor, said the Taliban were “shamefully defeated” in their attempt to capture the city.\nRelated Coverage\nTaliban Attack Tests Afghan Forces Near Iran Border Coordinated Suicide Bomb Attacks in Kabul Kill at Least Six People America’s $78 Billion Afghan Security Force Is Shrinking Afghan President Offers Opening to Talks With Taliban Mr. Salangi said more than 300 Taliban fighters were killed or wounded in the fighting. Among government soldiers and police, 10 were killed and another 10 wounded. Three civilians also died, he said. The casualty figures couldn’t be independently verified. The extent of property damage in Farah wasn’t clear.\nThwarted in their original aim to seize control of Farah, the Taliban, in the aftermath of the fighting, sought quickly to redefine success.\nThey issued a statement describing their fighters’ departure from the city as a strategic retreat ordered by commanders. They also said they had accomplished their goals of seizing weapons and ammunition, and briefly holding key government installations, claims that couldn’t be independently verified.\nYet while a clear setback for the Taliban, the battle to dislodge the insurgents from Farah wasn’t an unalloyed success for the government of President Ashraf Ghani.\nThe initial Taliban assault on Farah, which was led by suicide bombers driving Humvees loaded with explosives, penetrated the city limits quickly, showing that the country’s largest insurgency remains a formidable foe, despite the efforts of better-armed government forces.\nAshraf Ghani, Afghanistan's president, speaking at an event in Herat in February.
