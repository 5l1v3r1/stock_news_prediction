REUTERS/Toby Melville Peugeot-manufacturer PSA, one of the big European businesses with operations in the country, said it hoped the European Union would adopt a common position on Iran.\n“Like other economic players, we are following the evolution of the matter, and are also following the EU’s official position on this topic,” said a spokesman for PSA, adding that PSA hoped the EU would adopt its own independent position regarding Iran.\nSiemens said it would also closely monitor the situation.\n“We are assessing the implications of the Iran decision,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told reporters.\n“Of course we will always comply with export control regulations, and we would look at how different governments set the rules. We have a firm grip on our position,” added Thomas.\nFILE PHOTO: People pass Siemens flags ahead of the company's annual shareholders meeting in Munich, Germany, January 31, 2018.
