Investors were also cautious about developments on the Korean peninsula, after North Korea cancelled high-level talks with Seoul, denouncing military exercises between South Korea and the United States.\nThat has raised doubts about the planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart leader Kim Jong Un scheduled next month\nWednesday’s big losers included Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which slumped more than 5 percent after the bank’s annual net profit missed analyst estimates and on disappointment over the size of a share buyback plan.\nSuruga Bank, whose shares have fallen 45 percent this year on worries about its loans to retail investors for property investments, tumbled 10 percent after the bank said that many employees knew about improper lending.\nMetal shares were lower after gold shed 1.7 percent and hit the lowest this year at $1,288.31 in the previous session, before edging up in Asian trade.\nSumitomo Metal Mining shed 2.2 percent.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.2 percent to 1,801.62.
