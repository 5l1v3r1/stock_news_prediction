He reportedly took Israeli citizenship earlier this week.\n“Chelsea Football Club announces today that it has put its new stadium project on hold. No further pre-construction design and planning work will occur,” Chelsea said in a statement.\n“The club does not have a time frame set for reconsideration of its decision.
