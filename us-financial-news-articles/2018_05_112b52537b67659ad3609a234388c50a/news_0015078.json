Virgin Money shareholders would receive 1.13 new CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share.\nAnalysts said the deal, made public on Monday, made logical sense, combining CYBG’s more extensive branch network with Virgin’s stronger brand, but that the initial offer was too low and would likely be rejected.\n“We think Virgin shareholders will be lukewarm on the proposal,” said analyst John Cronin at Irish broker Goodbody, adding that he expected a protracted takeover battle could now happen as the two parties jockey over price.\nVirgin Money, founded and partly owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson, is investing heavily in a new digital offering while CYBG already has a digital and mobile banking platform called ‘B’.\nVirgin said on Monday its board was reviewing the CYBG offer. $1 = 0.7372 pounds Reporting By Lawrence White and Sinead Cruise.
