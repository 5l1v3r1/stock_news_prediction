It added that the suspected cases will be confirmed in the coming days.\nGuillain-Barre, in which the immune system attacks part of the nervous system, causes gradual weakness in the legs, arms and upper body and sometimes leads to total paralysis.\nFour of the patients who are suspected to have the syndrome in Peru need respirators to support their breathing, the ministry said.\nResearchers have found a close association between an increased number of mosquito-born Zika infections and increases in Guillain-Barre.\nThere were some 500 confirmed cases and 5,269 suspected cases of Zika in Peru last year, up from a combined total of 1,651 suspected and confirmed cases in 2016, according to health ministry data.\nThe health ministry said between 3 percent and 5 percent of Guillain-Barre cases are fatal.
