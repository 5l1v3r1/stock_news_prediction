That was the biggest gain since February 2017 and followed a 1.7 percent rise in February, the Commerce Department said on Monday.\nThe PCE index, excluding volatile food and energy components, increased by 1.9 percent on a 12-month basis through March, marking the biggest gain since February 2017. This compared with a 1.6 percent increase in February.\nFed policymakers have said they expect year-over-year PCE increases to reach 2 percent.\nThey are scheduled to meet for two days starting on Tuesday and are expected to leave interest rates unchanged in the current range of 1.50-1.75 percent.\nCurrently, interest rates futures imply traders have priced in a 45 percent chance the U.S. central bank will raise short-term borrowing costs three more times in 2018 with the next hike at its June 12-13 meeting, CME Group’s FedWatch program showed.\nAt 8:56 a.m. (1256 GMT), the 10-year inflation breakeven rate, or the yield gap between 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and regular 10-year Treasury notes, was 2.17 percent, down 0.05 basis point from late on Friday, Tradeweb data showed.
