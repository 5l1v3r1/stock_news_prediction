(NYSE: SERV), a leading provider of essential residential and commercial services, today announced unaudited first-quarter 2018 results.\nFor the first quarter, the company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of five percent. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by nine percent organic growth at American Home Shield (“AHS”) and 14 percent organic growth at Franchise Services Group (“FSG”). First-quarter 2018 net income was $40 million, or $0.30 per share, versus $39 million, or $0.29 per share, in the same period in 2017. First-quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, a year-over-year increase of $7 million, or five percent, primarily driven by a $5 million increase at Terminix despite the impact of unfavorable weather conditions on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2018. First-quarter 2018 adjusted net income was $59 million, or $0.44 per share versus $46 million, or $0.34 per share, for the same period in 2017. Adjusted net income was $14 million or 30% higher in the first quarter of 2018 due to a lower effective income tax rate from the enactment of tax reform, and higher year-over-year Adjusted EBITDA.\n“In the first quarter, we made solid progress executing on our strategies to drive long-term growth and deliver value for shareholders,” said Chief Executive Officer Nik Varty. “Strong revenue increases at American Home Shield and the Franchise Services Group reflect our continued focus on generating growth through improving and investing in customer service. In addition, we continued to make progress on the Terminix transformation across our branches, enabling route technicians to deliver exceptional customer experience as evidenced by continued improvement in net promoter scores. These efforts were supported by a significant improvement in aligning our field incentive pay programs with critical performance metrics,” said Varty.\n“During the quarter, we also closed the Copesan transaction as planned, providing Terminix with improved capabilities in commercial pest management through the addition of Copesan’s significant expertise, system capabilities and processes for delivering pest management solutions to sophisticated, national commercial customers,” Varty added. “Finally, our previously announced spin-off of AHS is moving forward and remains on track for the third quarter of 2018.”\nConsolidated Performance\nThree Months Ended March 31, $ millions 2018 2017 B/(W) Revenue $ 675 $ 643 $ 32 YoY growth — 5.0 % Gross Margin 313 297 17 % of revenue 46.4 % 46.2 % 0.3 pts SG&A (197 ) (186 ) (11 ) % of revenue 29.2 % 28.9 % (0.2 ) pts Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 54 62 (7 ) % of revenue 8.1 % 9.6 % (1.5 ) pts Net Income 40 39 1 % of revenue 5.9 % 6.1 % (0.1 ) pts Adjusted Net Income (2) 59 46 14 % of revenue 8.8 % 7.2 % 1.7 pts Adjusted EBITDA (1) 141 134 7 % of revenue 20.9 % 20.8 % 0.1 pts Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations 142 126 15 Free Cash Flow (3) 119 109 10 Segment Performance Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment and Corporate were as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Revenue Adjusted EBITDA $ millions 2018 B/(W) vs. PY 2018 B/(W) vs. PY Terminix $ 368 $ 2 $ 86 $ 5 YoY growth / % of revenue 0.6 % 23.4 % 1.1 pts American Home Shield 247 20 32 2 YoY growth / % of revenue 8.6 % 13.1 % (0.3 ) pts Franchise Services Group 60 10 23 1 YoY growth / % of revenue 20.6 % 37.8 % (5.5 ) pts Corporate (4) — — — — Total $ 675 $ 32 $ 141 $ 7 YoY growth / % of revenue 5.0 % 20.9 % 0.1 pts Reconciliations of net income to adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow, are set forth below in this press release.\nTerminix\nTerminix reported a one percent year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting an increase in termite renewals and wildlife exclusion, offset, in part, by a decline in termite completion and other services revenue, driven primarily by unfavorable weather conditions in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased six percent, or $5 million, versus prior year, largely reflecting a $3 million reduction in bad debt expense driven by enhanced credit policies and collection rates, a $2 million decrease in chemicals and materials costs due to sourcing savings, a $1 million increase in revenue conversion and a $1 million decrease in production labor costs, offset by a $3 million increase in sales and marketing costs due to targeted marketing investments to drive sales growth and a change in the timing of our recognition of sales costs, driven by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards. We estimate that the revenue increase would have been approximately $3 million, or 1%, higher if not for the unfavorable weather conditions in 2018.\nAmerican Home Shield\nAmerican Home Shield reported a nine percent year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2018 driven by new unit sales growth and improved price realization. Adjusted EBITDA increased six percent versus prior year, primarily reflecting a $13 million increase from the conversion of higher organic revenue, offset, in part, by a $6 million increase in claims costs due primarily to higher incidence rates for heating systems driven by significantly colder winter temperatures in 2018, a $3 million increase in sales and marketing costs and a $2 million increase in customer care center costs. The increase in sales and marketing costs was driven by targeted spending to drive sales growth, primarily in the direct to consumer channel, and the increase in customer care center costs was to deliver a new level of customer experience.\nFranchise Services Group\nThe Franchise Services Group reported a 21 percent year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2018 driven by higher royalty fee revenue related to disaster restoration services and janitorial national accounts revenue, as well as the recognition of $3 million of national advertising fund franchisee contributions pursuant to our adoption of a new accounting rule regarding revenue recognition that took effect on January 1, 2018. Prior to 2018, contributions to the national advertising fund made by our franchisees were treated as an offset to advertising expense. The adoption of this accounting standards change, therefore, increased revenue by $3 million but had no impact on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased five percent, or $1 million, versus prior year, primarily reflecting $2 million from increased revenues, offset, in part, by a $1 million increase in general and administrative costs.\nCash Flow\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations increased to $142 million from $126 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet cash used for investing activities from continuing operations was $112 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net cash used for investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2018, included $92 million of payments for the Copesan acquisition, net of cash acquired.\nNet cash used for financing activities from continuing operations was $93 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $60 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, we used $79 million to repay our 2018 Notes which matured during the quarter. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used $51 million to purchase 1.3 million shares of company stock.\nFree cash flow (3) was $119 million for three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $109 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. No federal income tax payments were made in the first quarter of 2018, so there was no impact from tax reform on net cash provided from operating activities or Free Cash Flow.\nFull-Year 2018 Outlook\nThe 2018 outlook assumes AHS remains with the company for the full year and excludes the impact of any increases to operating costs related to the planned separation of AHS in the third quarter of 2018 and any future potential acquisitions.\nThe company now expects full-year 2018 revenue to range from $3,085 million to $3,115 million, or an increase of six to seven percent compared to 2017. The increase in the revenue outlook primarily reflects the projected impact of the Copesan acquisition at Terminix and also includes the adoption of a new accounting rule regarding revenue recognition as of January 1, 2018, at FSG. Full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to now range from $695 million to $710 million, or an increase of between two percent and five percent compared to 2017, primarily due to the projected impact of the Copesan acquisition.\nThe company expects organic revenue growth at Terminix to range from one percent to two percent for full-year 2018 compared to prior year. The company expects high single-digit organic revenue growth at AHS and mid-single-digit organic revenue growth at the FSG for full-year 2018 compared to prior year. Organic revenue growth excludes revenue from acquired customers for 12 months following the acquisition date.\nA reconciliation of the forward-looking 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook to net income is not being provided as the company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation.\nOther Matters\nAmerican Home Shield Spin-Off\nOn July 26, 2017, the company announced that it intends to separate its AHS business from its Terminix and Franchise Services Group businesses by means of a spin-off of the AHS business to company shareholders, resulting in two publicly traded companies. The spin-off is designed to create two independent companies each with an enhanced strategic focus, simplified operating structure, distinct investment identity and strong financial profile. The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form 10, receipt of a favorable ruling from the IRS concerning certain tax matters and final approval by the company’s board of directors, and it is intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to the company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nCopesan Services, Inc. Transaction\nOn March 30, 2018, the company announced the closing of its transaction with Copesan Services, Inc., one of the largest national providers of commercial pest management in the country. This combination will significantly improve Terminix’s capabilities in commercial pest control as Copesan, under its brand, provides us with significant expertise, reputation and processes for delivering pest management solutions to sophisticated commercial customers. This reinforces the strong commitment ServiceMaster has made to focus on and grow the Terminix commercial pest control business.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 23, 2016, the company’s board of directors authorized a three-year share repurchase program, under which the company may purchase up to $300 million of outstanding shares of common stock. No shares were repurchased during the first-quarter 2018. As of March 31, 2018, we have repurchased 3.9 million outstanding shares at an aggregate cost of $145 million under this program.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nThe company will discuss its first-quarter 2018 financial and operating results during a conference call at 8 a.m. central time (9 a.m. eastern time) today, May 1, 2018.
