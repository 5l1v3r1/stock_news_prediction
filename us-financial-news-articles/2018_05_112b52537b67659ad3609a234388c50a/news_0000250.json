(UEI), (NASDAQ: UEIC) reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nPaul Arling, UEI’s chairman and CEO, stated, “The audio-video industry is transforming again; this time next-generation platforms are adopting advanced, intuitive 2-way home entertainment systems enabling one-touch view and connected voice. Our customers are working feverishly to bring automatic speech recognition (ASR) and voice navigation capabilities to their users. Some are in the design stages; some are testing; and some have already launched award-winning voice-enabled devices and system control solutions using UEI’s technology. Similar to prior technology sea changes – such as the historical shifts from analog to digital, from non-DVR to DVR and from standard definition to high definition – we expect this transition to span more than a few years. During this transition, we will continue to innovate, create more industry leading technology and improve our operations, all of which will contribute to shareholder value.”\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31: 2018 Compared to 2017\nGAAP net sales were $164.7 million, compared to $161.4 million; Adjusted Non-GAAP net sales were $170.6 million, compared to $162.3 million. GAAP gross margins were 22.6%, compared to 25.4%; Adjusted Non-GAAP gross margins were 25.6%, compared to 26.7%. GAAP operating income was $0.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $0.4 million; Adjusted Non-GAAP operating income was $11.3 million, compared to $11.8 million. GAAP net loss was $0.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $0.1 million or $0.01 per diluted share; Adjusted Non-GAAP net income was $8.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $9.2 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. At March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $40.2 million.\n“During the first quarter of 2018, as expected, our revenue grew year-over-year and our gross margin percentage increased sequentially as a result of process improvements made at our China factories. We also signed several more PayTV and TV OEM advanced device projects that will drive growth,” stated UEI’s CFO Bryan Hackworth. “Although certain customers are currently reducing orders to rebalance inventory levels, preserve capital and/or manage their platform transitions, our long-term outlook is still strong based on a growing list of customer engagements.”\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the company expects GAAP net sales to range between $158 million and $166 million, compared to $177.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. GAAP loss per diluted share for the second quarter of 2018 is expected to range from $0.18 to $0.28, compared to GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.32 in the second quarter of 2017.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the company expects Adjusted Non-GAAP net sales to range between $158 million and $166 million, compared to $177.9 million in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share are expected to range from $0.35 to $0.45, compared to Adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.78 in the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter Adjusted Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share estimate excludes $0.63 per share related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, changes in contingent consideration relating to acquisitions, effects of foreign currency fluctuations and the related tax impact of these adjustments.\nConference Call Information\nUEI’s management team will hold a conference call today, Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT, to discuss its first quarter 2018 earnings results, review recent activity and answer questions. To access the call in the U.S. please dial 877-843-0414, and for international calls dial 315-625-3071 approximately 10 minutes prior to the start of the conference. The conference ID is 6098323. The conference call will also be broadcast live at www.uei.com where it will be available for replay for one year. In addition, a replay will be available via telephone for two business days beginning two hours after the call. To listen to the replay, in the U.S. please dial 855-859-2056, and internationally dial 404-537-3406. The access code is 6098323.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, UEI provides Adjusted Non-GAAP information as additional information for its operating results. References to Adjusted Non-GAAP information are to non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not required by, in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. UEI’s management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of UEI, for budget planning purposes, and for making operational and financial decisions and believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, helps investors evaluate UEI’s core operating and financial performance and business trends consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. Additionally, management believes these measures facilitate comparisons with the core operating and financial results and business trends of competitors and other companies.\nWe present certain elements of our results of operations excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (constant currency). To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the average exchange rate in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. We believe that presenting constant currency results of operations provides useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-to-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.\nAdjusted Non-GAAP net sales is defined as net sales excluding the impact of stock-based compensation for performance-based warrants, the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (“ASC 606”) and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Adjusted Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as gross profit excluding stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense related to the increase in fixed assets from cost to fair market value resulting from acquisitions, amortization of intangibles acquired, excess manufacturing costs, the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Adjusted Non-GAAP operating expenses are defined as operating expenses excluding amortization of intangibles acquired, stock-based compensation expense, employee related restructuring costs, changes in contingent consideration related to acquisitions, the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Adjusted Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding the aforementioned items, foreign currency gains and losses, and the related tax effects of all adjustments. Adjusted Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated using Adjusted Non-GAAP net income. A reconciliation of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of this press release.\nAbout Universal Electronics\nUniversal Electronics Inc. is the worldwide leader in universal control and sensing technologies for the smart home.
