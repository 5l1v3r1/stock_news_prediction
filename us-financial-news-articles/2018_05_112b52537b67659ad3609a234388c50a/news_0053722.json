States with big trading volumes like California, Texas and New York, benefit from big and diverse economies that diminish their vulnerability to trade wars. On the local level, manufacturing hubs such as Detroit, Greenville, South Carolina; and Peoria, Illinois, and cities with big port operations like Laredo, Texas; Longview, Washington, and New Orleans have exposure to significant trade changes.\nMoody’s said states and cities with hefty reserves and the ability to raise revenue and cut spending would be in a better position to deal with severe trade disruptions.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:20:14.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
