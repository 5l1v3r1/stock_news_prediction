Including other bad loans, the gross non-performing loan ratio shot up to 8.84 percent from 7.82 percent at the end of December.\nDomestic loans were up 15 percent year-on-year at the end of March, and Kochhar said the aim would be to increase the overall domestic loan book by 15 percent a year, with retail loans growing at above 20 percent until March 2020.\nAhead of the results, ICICI Bank shares closed 2.5 percent higher, outperforming the main Mumbai market index which gained 0.9 percent.\nAxis Bank posted its first ever quarterly loss last month as its bad loans surged. Major state-run lenders are due to report March quarter earnings later this month. $1 = 67.1300 Indian rupees Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy and Vishal Sridhar; Additional reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T18:25:57.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
