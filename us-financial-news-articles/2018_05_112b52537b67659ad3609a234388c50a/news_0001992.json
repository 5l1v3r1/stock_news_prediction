The ECB targets inflation at close to 2 percent.\nThe ECB’s favoured core inflation measure, which strips out volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, is forecast to rise 1.2 percent. A another core gauge that also excludes alcohol and tobacco and is closely tracked by many economists, is estimated at 0.9 percent.\nIn early trade, most 10-year bond yields in the region were 1 to 2 basis points higher on the day. Sentiment was supported by an overnight fall in U.S. bond yields after a quarterly refunding program came in short of expectations, while the U.S. Federal Reserve left policy unchanged at a meeting.\n“We expect the euro zone CPI (consumer price index) to deliver another blow to the odds of ECB tightening,” said Antoine Bouvet, a rates strategist at Mizuho.\n“While the headline number is likely to turn out weaker than consensus, in light of the individual member states’ releases, we think the most potent market mover would be another disappointment in core inflation.”\nConsumer prices in Germany, Italy and Portugal grew less than expected in April, data showed on Monday.\nExpectations the ECB will lift interest rates towards the middle of next year remain realistic, because worries about an end of the euro zone’s economic expansion are overblown, German central bank chief Jens Weidmann said on Wednesday.\nStill, a market gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the euro zone has pulled back from 8-week highs hit last week to trade around 1.70 percent.\nMoney market pricing also suggests investors have tamed bets on rate hike around the middle of next year.\nEonia forward rates dated to the ECB’s meeting in June 2019 suggest roughly a 80 percent chance of a 10 basis point rate rise is priced in. Just over a week ago, more than a 90 percent chance of such a move was anticipated.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Keith Weir\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr"], "published": "2018-05-03T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:33:48.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
