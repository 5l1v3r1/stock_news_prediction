He struck out six. It was only the second time Atlanta has been shutout this season.\nIt was the second time Straily has beaten the Braves this season; he threw five innings in last week’s 6-3 victory in Miami. Straily improved to 4-2 in his career against Atlanta.\nKyle Barraclough pitched a scoreless eighth inning, and Brad Ziegler worked a scoreless ninth for his eighth save. Ziegler allowed a single to Nick Markakis, but induced Tyler Flowers into hitting into a game-ending double play. It was Ziegler’s ninth save in 10 opportunities against Atlanta.\nThe second game of the series will be played Saturday. Atlanta leads the season series 3-2.\nThe Marlins got their two runs in the sixth inning off Matt Wisler (1-1). Martin Prado singled and came around to score when J.T. Realmuto blasted a triple that hit the base of the wall and bounced away from center fielder Ender Inciarte.\nStarlin Castro followed that with a line-drive double to right field that scored Realmuto.\nWisler was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett to make the start in place of rookie Mike Soroka, who was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Wisler pitched 5 1/3 innings and allowed two runs on five hits and two walks. He struck out five.\nWisler is winless in eight career games, five starts, against Miami.\nStraily’s biggest test came in the fourth inning. Atlanta had runners at second and third after a walk to Freddie Freeman and a double by Nick Markakis. But Straily got Flowers to pop out, intentionally walked Inciarte and struck out Jose Bautista. He ended the threat by getting Johan Camargo to fly out.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T15:16:12.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
