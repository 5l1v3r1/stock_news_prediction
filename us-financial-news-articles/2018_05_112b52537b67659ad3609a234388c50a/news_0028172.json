REUTERS/Slawomir Kaminski/Agencja Gazeta\nThe parliament adopted the bill on Thursday with a majority of 240 votes, while the main opposition parties abstained, state news agency PAP reported.\nThe bill will cut MPs’ remuneration from the present level of 10,000 zloty ($2,802) per month after former prime minister Beata Szydlo last year decided to pay herself and her cabinet ministers bonuses worth more than 10 average monthly salaries.\nSince then, support for the ruling party has weakened, influenced also by other factors.\nParty leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski last month called on ministers to give their financial rewards to charity and announced pay cuts for parliament members.
