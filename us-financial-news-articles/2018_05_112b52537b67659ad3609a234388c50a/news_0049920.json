I hope the love and energy that permeated this work can continue to inspire change with love and optimism at the helm.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Reporting by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:34:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
