Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports Castellanos was hit in the first inning by a pitch from Seattle starter Felix Hernandez. The 26-year-old had his hand checked out by a trainer before heading to first base. He remained in the game in right field for the top of the second inning before being pinch-hit for by Victor Reyes in the bottom of the frame.\nThe Tigers announced the injury as a bruise of the left pinkie, in which Castellanos fractured a bone in late in the 2016 season, missing a little more than a month.\nCastellanos, 26, is hitting .326 with three home runs and 23 RBIs on the season. He went 2-for-4 in the Tigers’ 4-3 win over the Mariners earlier Saturday.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-13T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:07:45.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
