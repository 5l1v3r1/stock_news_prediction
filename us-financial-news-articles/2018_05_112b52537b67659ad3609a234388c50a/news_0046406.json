Justify is quickly galloping to join that exclusive club.\nAt a rain-soaked and foggy Pimlico Race Course on Saturday, Kentucky Derby champion Justify splashed to victory in the Preakness Stakes, setting up a bid for racing immortality in the Belmont Stakes on June 9.\nIt was only three years ago that American Pharoah snapped a 37-year Triple Crown drought , by sweeping the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont. The common thread for Justify and American Pharoah is trainer Bob Baffert, who won the Preakness for the seventh time on Saturday and tied D. Wayne Lukas’s record of 14 career wins in a Triple Crown race.\nBaffert is now 5-for-5 when running a Derby winner two weeks later at Pimlico, with Silver Charm (1997), Real Quiet (1998), War Emblem (2002), American Pharoah and Justify all hitting the winner’s circle.\nThe Preakness had always looked like a two-horse race, with the Derby runner-up Good Magic as the only rival with the speed to challenge the Derby champion. After looming as a threat at the top of the stretch at Churchill Downs, Good Magic finished 2½ lengths behind Justify in the Run for the Roses.\nOn Saturday, the horses dueled almost immediately from the start, with Good Magic and jockey Jose Ortiz refusing to hand Justify and jockey Mike Smith an easy lead.\nThe rivals matched steps as they passed the Pimlico grandstand for the first time, covering the first quarter mile in 23.1 seconds and a half-mile in 47.19 seconds.\n“It was a nail-biter. They put it to us,” Baffert said. “It was like they had their own private match race.”\nAs the field approached the top of the home stretch, Justify emerged from the fog with a slim lead, with Smith giving his mount a few nudges of encouragement.\n“Although he got tired today, he was also looking around a bit at the end,” Smith said.\nLike he did in the Derby, Justify found another gear to take control approaching the finish, holding off a late-charging Bravazo, who finished a half-length behind in second. Tenfold was a neck back in third, while Good Magic faded to fourth.\nJustify completed the 1 3/16-mile race in 1:55.93. A $2 win bet on the 2-5 favorite paid $2.80.\nJustify, in foreground, fended off a challenge by Kentucky Derby runner-up Good Magic along the final stretch at Pimlico Race Course.

If the son of Scat Daddy and the mare Stage Magic is able to sweep the Triple Crown, he’ll accomplish something that was once viewed as impossible for a lightly-raced horse. After only making his racing debut on Feb. 18, Justify has now won five races in a span of 90 days. He has already shattered the Apollo Curse and became the first horse in 136 years to win the Derby after not racing as a 2-year-old. Three weeks from now, Justify will be running for another piece of history.\n“He has to show us, he has to come out of this race well, and he’s got to be training really well,” Baffert said. “[He] has to be 100%.”\nA fan dressed in a horse costume walks through the mud in the infield prior to the 143rd running of the Preakness Stakes.

But the 143rd Preakness ran under a cloud of uncertainty about the future of the race at Pimlico. First opened in 1870, Pimlico is the second oldest racetrack in the U.S. but a report by the Maryland Stadium Authority said it would take $300 million to refurbish. A second phase of the Pimlico study is set to be released by the end of the year.\nThe Stronach Group, the company that owns Pimlico, said it is committed to the future of horse racing in Maryland and will await the next stage of the report.\nBelinda Stronach, chairman and president of the Stronach Group, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week that all options for Pimlico will be explored.\n“Everybody recognizes that Pimlico is an aging venue,” Stronach said. “But how do we modernize the sport of horse racing while keeping the traditions alive that are so dear to everybody?”\nA move to Laurel Park, a track about 30 miles from Pimlico and owned by the Stronach Group, has been mentioned as an alternative.\nWrite to Jim Chairusmi at jim.chairusmi@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T03:04:16.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
