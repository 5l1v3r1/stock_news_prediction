(TSX.V:VRR) (FSE:5VR) (OTCBB:VRRCF), the \" Company \", or “ VR ”, is pleased to announce the acquisition of the Kraut property, to expand its epithermal gold exploration strategy within the southern part of the Walker Lane belt in west-central Nevada.\nFigure 1. Location of Kraut and Danbo mineral properties, VR Resources Ltd., Nye County, Nevada.\nAs shown on Figure 1 , the Kraut property is located approximately 5 kilometres northwest of the Company’s Danbo property in Nye County, Nevada. Kraut and Danbo are located in the southern part of the Monitor Range, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Tonopah. Cost effective exploration is afforded by road access from Highway 82, with actively used historic ranch and mine roads throughout both properties.\nThe Kraut Property consists of 6 mineral claims in one contiguous block covering 124 acres (50 hectares). The broad terms of the proposed acquisition include:\nAgreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Kraut property (“the acquisition”) from Nevada Select Royalty, Inc. (“Nevada Select”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ely Gold & Minerals Inc. (“Ely Gold”) (TSX-V: ELY, OTC: ELYGF), pursuant to a binding acquisition agreement dated April 27, 2018; An initial payment of USD$10,000 and the issuance of 50,000 common shares in the capital of VR to Ely Gold on closing of the Acquisition (“the Closing”); An additional payment of USD$50,000 and issuance of 50,000 common shares in the capital of VR to Ely Gold upon commencement by VR of a diamond drill program on the property; The acquisition agreement includes a defined Area of Interest extending from the existing claims; Nevada Select will be granted a Net Smelter Returns royalty of 2% on Closing, and; Closing is subject to acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange.\nThe Company intends to commence surface exploration at Kraut early this summer. The work will be a natural extension of its work at Danbo during the past two years. There are accounts of periodic historic exploration at Kraut in the late 1950’s, early 1980’s and early 1990’s, including some shallow air-track drilling. The Company will leverage an improved understanding of the nearby Round Mountain gold deposit since that time, and recent innovations in exploration technologies for Tertiary epithermal gold systems in general in the Walker Lane Belt in Nevada in order to evaluate the large area of alteration and surface gold geochemistry evident at Kraut.\nCommenting on the news today, VR’s CEO Dr. Gunning stated: “ While the Company gears up for its upcoming follow-up drill program at Bonita, we are excited about the opportunity this acquisition provides to apply our exploration experience at Danbo to the large alteration system at Kraut. The drill permitting process is underway at Danbo, and we will look forward to providing details on summer exploration at Kraut when plans are in place. ”\nPlease see the Company’s website at www.vrr.ca for more complete information on the Danbo property. Technical information for this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101, and reviewed on behalf of the Company by Dr. Michael Gunning P.Geo., a non-independent Qualified Person.\nAbout VR Resources\nVR is a new listing in the junior exploration space (TSX.V:VRR) (Frankfurt:5VR) (OTCBB:VRRCF). The diverse experience and proven track record of its Board in early-stage exploration and discovery is the foundation of VR.
