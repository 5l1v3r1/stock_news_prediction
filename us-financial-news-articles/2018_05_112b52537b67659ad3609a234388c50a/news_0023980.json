It also deployed new defences and mobilized some reservist forces.\nIsrael’s government was a strong supporter of, and advocate for, Trump’s decision to quit the Iran nuclear deal and has been readying itself for a possible regional flare-up.\nIn the run-up to Trump’s decision, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised presentation last week that Israel had obtained tens of thousands of pages of what he described as Iran’s “secret atomic archives” from what looked from the outside to be a dilapidated Tehran warehouse.\nIran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah have been helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad beat back a seven-year-old rebellion. Israel has carried out repeated air strikes against them, hoping to stop the formation of a Lebanese-Syrian front to its north.\nOn Tuesday Syrian state media accused Israel of launching missiles at a target near Damascus, shortly after Trump’s announcement. Syrian air defences fired at two Israeli missiles, destroying both, Syrian state news agency SANA.\nAn Israeli military spokeswoman said at the time that “we do not respond to such foreign reports.”\nReporting by Stephen Farrell; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:24:31.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
