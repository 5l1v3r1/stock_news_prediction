It does for now, in terms of trade wars, put that risk away,\" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.\nThe energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last week voiced concern about recent oil market volatility and plan to meet Russian counterpart Alexander Novak in St Petersburg to continue consultations.\n\"It's worth watching St Petersburg at the end of this week, that could provide the key input for the next few weeks,\" Jakob said.\nSaudi Arabian minister of energy Khalid al-Falih and the UAE's Suhail al-Mazroui will attend the St Petersburg Economic Forum this week, along with OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo and corporate heavyweights Bob Dudley and Ben van Beurden, the chief executives of BP and Royal Dutch Shell , respectively.\nBP's Dudley told Reuters he expected a flood of U.S. shale and a possible reopening of OPEC taps to cool oil markets after crude rose above $80 a barrel last week.\nDudley said he saw oil prices falling to between $50 and $65 a barrel due to surging shale output and OPEC's capacity to boost production to replace potential falls in Iranian supplies due to sanctions.\nOil prices are within sight of last week's November 2014 highs, but many traders and analysts say they believe there is enough supply to meet demand despite ongoing production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plunging output in crisis-struck Venezuela and looming U.S. sanctions against major oil producer Iran.\n\"Without a further escalation in geopolitical risk, oil might be due a pullback,\" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\nFund managers cut their holdings of U.S. crude to the lowest level this year, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.
