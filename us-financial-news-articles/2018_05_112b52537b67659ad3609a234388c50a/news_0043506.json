The largest independent provider of population health and care management solutions, Medecision helps its clients – 100 health plans and care delivery systems -- improve outcomes and lower the cost of care for more than 50 million consumers with Aerial ™, the nation’s most progressive cloud-based platform for consumer engagement, provider enablement and care management.\nAveus has served a broad client portfolio across industries as well as deep engagement in healthcare. Current and former clients include HealthPartners, Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts, Blue Cross Blue Shield Louisiana, Prime Therapeutics, and Heraeus Medical Components. Aveus will operate as a separate division of Medecision under the leadership of Chris LaVictoire Mahai who has led Aveus as an owner and managing partner for more than 18 years. An author, consultant and advisor to executive teams globally, Chris will join Medecision as President of Aveus, a division of Medecision. Duane White , a partner, owner of Aveus since 2012, will join Medecision as EVP & Chief Product Officer.\nThis acquisition expands Medecision’s ability to deliver on its purpose of “liberating” healthcare from traditional, complex and costly fee-for-service delivery, care management strategies and operating models. Powerful economic, regulatory and social forces are driving our clients to develop new strategies, new programs and new systems to help consumers, enable providers and connect communities of care and support organizations. The new Aveus division will bring advisory capabilities and years of operating and business transformation experience to help industry leaders navigate these significant changes.\nThe Aveus team will be augmented with consultants from Medecision’s current team, including Dr. Tamara Cull , a national expert in population health operations and alternative payment models. The combined advisory teams will offer strategy, innovation and customer experience consulting as well as best-practice clinical workflow design, medical and utilization management program optimization, government-program compliance under programs such as STARS and accreditation compliance with NCQA, URAC and others.\n“To succeed in value-based care, health plans and care delivery organizations are adapting their strategies and operations to optimize use of services and intervene earlier so consumers and their care teams have the best outcomes,” said Medecision President & CEO, Deborah Gage. “But transformation at this scale isn’t easy: the majority of executives in our health plan and care delivery clients cite personal risk and fear of change as they analyze, procure and manage holistic business shifts.”\nGage continued, “We are excited to welcome the Aveus team and expand our Advisory capability to offer the market services to define new vision and strategies for managing risk. The acquisition will allow us to broaden the support we provide as our clients’ processes align and implement the changes in the people, processes and technology necessary to achieve our healthcare system transformation. Implementing a longer-term, ecosystem-level view of strategy to manage risk bring changes at every level of a Company: modernized technology platforms, data inter-operability investments, mobility and intelligent workflow applications all required to span a fragmented healthcare system and impact each employee within the progressive clients that are implementing these changes.”\nAveus specializes in helping complex organizations assess, implement and manage these types of business shifts. “For two decades, our work has focused on helping leaders transform their business. Our Bold Leadership framework identifies those characteristics and leaders that accelerate change – and now we’re joining an organization with a bold mission,” said Chris Mahai. “The Aveus team and I all believe Medecision is well positioned to truly transform healthcare and we’re excited to become Medecision Liberators.”\nIn October of 2017, Medecision acquired the platform business of AxisPoint Health, a company that provided care management services and platforms. Many of the clients whose platforms were acquired by Medecision have begun transitioning or are evaluating a transition to Medecision’s platform, Aerial and its robust suite of workflow and engagement applications. Aerial offers all risk-bearing healthcare organizations an affordable and secure cloud-base, SaaS-delivered platform with a flexible suite of workflow and engagement applications for clinicians, care givers, consumers and physicians. Aerial can be operational quickly and with minimal disruption so that organizations can respond to the needs of their markets, users and regulators.\nThe acquisition closed yesterday and terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nFor more information about Aveus, click here .\nAbout Medecision\nLeading health plans and risk-bearing providers depend on Medecision's cloud-based Aerial platform to deliver personalized, predictive and prescriptive decision support for their clinicians, physicians, consumers and their caregivers.
