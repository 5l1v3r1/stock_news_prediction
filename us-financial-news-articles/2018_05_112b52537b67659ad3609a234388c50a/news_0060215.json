The posting led ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co, to cancel its hit revival of her “Roseanne” sitcom.\nJarrett said Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger called her before ABC announced the show’s cancellation.\nTrump on Wednesday night tweeted that Iger never apologized to him for “the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.”\nOn Thursday, he targeted the executive again on Twitter: “Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!”\nThe president singled out Ross, an ABC News journalist who reported erroneously in December that Trump’s fired national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was prepared to testify that Trump had asked him to contact Russian officials during his presidential campaign. The report came out after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians.\nThe White House said on Wednesday it did not defend the racist tweet by Barr, a Trump supporter. Trump has remained silent on that topic.\nIn the past, the Republican president has cited the program’s popularity as evidence that his supporters, who include Barr, want shows that speak to their concerns.
