On March 9, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition (the “RSI Acquisition”) of RSI Communities, a Southern-California and Texas-based homebuilder, and three related real estate assets (together, “RSI Communities”). The Company’s consolidated ended March 31, 2018 include the financial results of RSI Communities from the date of acquisition.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights (Comparison to 2017 First Quarter)\nNet income available to common stockholders of $8.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share Adjusted net income available to common stockholders of $10.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to $4.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the prior period, up 167% and 145%, respectively Pre-tax income of $15.4 million, up 123% Adjusted pre-tax income of $18.5 million, up 169%, which excludes transaction expenses of $3.1 million, before tax New home deliveries of 740 homes, up 48% Net new home orders of 1,106, up 28% Dollar value of orders of $602.7 million, up 33% Dollar value of homes in backlog of $752.1 million, up 19% Units in backlog of 1,460, up 33% Average sales locations of 84, up 2% Active sales locations of 105 as of March 31, 2018 Average sales price (ASP) of new homes delivered of $503,200, down 3% Home sales revenue of $372.4 million, up 44% Homebuilding gross margin percentage of 17.5% Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage of 22.7% SG&A percentage of 12.7%, compared to 13.0% Adjusted EBITDA of $41.7 million, up 108%\n“We executed on several strategic initiatives during the first quarter of 2018, including the closing of the RSI acquisition, marking our entry into Texas and enhancing our presence in Southern California, while meaningfully expanding our exposure to the attractive entry-level buyer segment, and executing a high-yield offering to fund a portion of the acquisition purchase price and refinance our nearest term senior notes maturities,” said Matthew R. Zaist, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We also experienced a strong start to the spring selling season and delivered another quarter of year-over-year improvement in net new home orders, which increased 28% to 1,106, and represents a monthly absorption rate of 4.4 net new home orders per community, and an associated dollar value of orders of $602.7 million, a 33% increase over the same period last year. This strong trend continued into April, with 481 net new home orders, or a monthly absorption rate of 4.5.”\nMr. Zaist continued, “We are very pleased with our overall financial results for the quarter, with significant improvements in homebuilding revenues to $372.4 million, up 44%, adjusted pre-tax income of $18.5 million, up 169%, adjusted net income of $10.9 million, up 167%, and adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.27, up 145%.”\nMr. Zaist added, “The strong start to 2018 and strategic execution of the RSI acquisition position us well to achieve our goals for the year, and our expectations for the full year include new home deliveries of approximately 4,400 to 4,750 units, home sales revenue of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, and pre-tax income before non-controlling interest of approximately $175 million to $185 million, inclusive of RSI transaction expenses and purchase accounting.”\nHome sales revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $372.4 million, as compared to $258.9 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 44%, which was driven by an increase in deliveries of 48% to 740, partially offset by the decrease in average sale price to $503,200, from $518,700, driven in part by the contribution from lower priced communities associated with RSI projects for the three weeks at the end of the quarter. Average sales price for William Lyon Homes’ stand-alone business for the first quarter was approximately $530,000. Contributions from the RSI Acquisition for the last 23 calendar days of the first quarter consisted of 80 new home deliveries and 101 net new home orders.\nHomebuilding gross margin percentage for homes closed during the first quarter of 2018 was 17.5%, up 190 basis points from prior year. Excluding closings from the RSI Acquisition, homebuilding gross margin percentage was 17.8%, up 220 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted homebuilding gross margin percentage for the quarter was 22.7%.\nSales and marketing expense during the first quarter of 2018 was 6.1% of homebuilding revenue, compared to 5.7% in the year-ago quarter, which is primarily driven by the impact of the adoption of ASC 606, which was adopted on January 1, 2018, requiring the Company to record certain selling costs that were previously recorded as cost of sales to sales and marketing expense. General and administrative expenses were 6.6% of homebuilding revenue, compared to 7.3% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe dollar value of homes in backlog was $752.1 million as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 19% compared to $634.2 million as of March 31, 2017. The increase is driven by a 33% increase in units in backlog to 1,460 units compared to 1,099 in the prior year. The average sales price of homes in backlog decreased to $515,200 from $577,100 in the prior year, due to a higher number of homes in backlog from entry level buyers, which represent 46% of homes in backlog.\nRSI Communities Acquisition and Senior Notes Issuance\nOn March 9, 2018, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of RSI Communities, a Southern California- and Texas-based homebuilder, and three additional related real estate assets, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $475 million, which included working capital adjustments upon closing. The Company incurred certain costs in the first quarter related to the transaction, in an amount of approximately $3.1 million on a pre-tax basis, and an amount of approximately $2.6 million on an after-tax basis.\nAlso on March 9, 2018, the Company issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Notes due September 1, 2023. The Company used the proceeds from the offering to finance a portion of the RSI Acquisition as described above, as well as to repay all of the Company’s outstanding principal amount of $150.0 million 5.75% Senior Notes due 2019. With this most recent refinancing transaction, the Company’s next maturity date for Senior Notes is August 2022.\nBalance Sheet Update\nAt quarter end, totaled $50.5 million, owned real estate inventories totaled $2.1 billion, total assets were $2.6 billion and total equity was $853.7 million. Total debt to book capitalization was 60.4%, and net debt to net book capitalization was 59.5% at March 31, 2018, compared to 60.1% and 59.2% at March 31, 2017, and 54.5% and 49.6% at December 31, 2017, respectively.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results today, Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The call will be available via both the telephone at (855) 851-4524 or (720) 634-2900, conference ID #6481508, or through the Company’s website at www.lyonhomes.com in the Investor Relations section of the site.\nA replay of the call will be available through May 15, 2018 by dialing (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406, conference ID #6481508.

For the 2017 period presented, the Company reported in six segments: California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Washington, and Oregon. (2) Adjusted homebuilding gross margin is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. It is used by management in evaluating operating performance and in making strategic decisions regarding sales pricing, construction and development pace, product mix and other operating decisions. We believe this information is meaningful as it isolates the impact that interest and purchase accounting adjustments have on homebuilding gross margin and allows investors to make better comparisons with our competitors.
