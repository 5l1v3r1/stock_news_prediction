(NASDAQ:SITO), an insights-driven Consumer Behavior and Location Sciences™ company, announced today its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial and Recent Business Highlights\nMedia Placement Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 71% to $11.1 million compared to $6.5 million for the corresponding period of 2017 Gross profit increased 41% for the first quarter of 2018 to $4.4 million, or 40% of total revenue, compared to $3.2 million, or 48% of total revenue, for the corresponding period of 2017 Net loss of $5.2 million in first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $3.1 million in the corresponding period of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA* for the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of $3.3 million Closed a $14.8 million public equity offering, strengthening SITO’s capital position and balance sheet Terminated IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and settled all related litigations for $3.5 million Appointed Bruce Rogers, former Chief Insights Officer and veteran of Forbes Media, as SITO’s Head of Marketing Launched Institute for Consumer Behavior and Location Sciences, a new thought leadership and membership initiative devoted to education and advocacy for the advancement of location data intelligence as a core component of the modern marketing organization Subsequent to quarter end, appointed Gabriel Sandoval as SITO’s Chief Data Privacy Officer\nTom Pallack, SITO’s Chief Executive Officer commented, “This was a strong start to 2018, demonstrating that our initiatives to advance our consumer insight-driven data offering with new customers is accelerating and SITO is on the right path. During the first quarter, we delivered strong top line growth and bolstered our balance sheet, eliminating additional legacy issues and positioning SITO for a strong future.”\n“We believe that, based on our maturing pipeline, we will deliver growth in the second quarter,” Pallack added. “We continue to advance larger, multi-year opportunities with Fortune 500 customers, leveraging our proprietary data. Due to the size and complexity of these new opportunities, and the size of the customers, timing on these transactions are difficult to predict, but we are progressing successfully through the process of insight and data validation with these customers. We are believe that 2018 will be a year of substantial growth and meaningful strategic progress, but as this strategy continues to gain market adoption, the quarter-to-quarter progress is more challenging to predict. SITO has successfully repositioned its technology to attract top-tier customers and larger revenue opportunities, which we believe differentiates us within the industry.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nTotal revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 70%, or $4.5 million, to $11.1 million compared to $6.6 million in the corresponding period of 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of campaigns and the execution of larger deals as the Company expands its direct sales force and increases its customer base.\nGross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $4.4 million, or 40% of total revenue, compared to $3.2 million, or 48% of total revenue, in the corresponding period of 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to a change in our media mix that included lower gross margin agency revenue.\nLoss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.9 million compared to a loss from operations of $2.8 million in the corresponding period of 2017. The increase in loss from operations is due primarily to a $1.8 million increase in sales and marketing expenses related to the implementation of the Company’s 2017 stock incentive plan, expansion of the Company’s direct sales force and customer management personnel, a $2.6 million increase in general and administrative expenses related to increases in non-cash executive compensation expense, and the implementation of the Company’s 2017 stock incentive plan, which was partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in gross profit.\nNet loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.2 million, or ($0.22) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $3.1 million, or ($0.15) per basic and diluted share, in the corresponding period of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA* for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was a loss of $3.3 million compared to a loss of $1.1 million in the corresponding period of 2017.\n* SITO Mobile has presented Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, because many of our investors use these non-GAAP measures to monitor the Company’s performance. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a quantitative assessment of a Company’s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. It should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance . Please refer to the financial tables included below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.\nCash used in operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.5 million compared to $786,000 for the corresponding period in 2017. This is inclusive of the $3.5 million cash payment made during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to terminate the IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and settle all related litigation.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $11.9 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2017. On February 9, 2018, the Company closed a $14.8 million public offering; and terminated the IP revenue sharing agreement with TAR SITO LendCo LLC and settled all related litigations for $3.5 million. The net effect of these events strengthens SITO’s capital position and balance sheet. Management believes current cash levels and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs, anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the next 12 months.\nConference call information:\nDate: Monday, May 14, 2018\nTime: 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (ET)\nDial in Number for U.S. & Canadian Callers: 877-407-8293\nDial in Number for International Callers (Outside U.S. & Canada): 201-689-8349\nThe conference call will also be webcasted live on the Investor Relations section of SITO’s IR web site at http://ir.sitomobile.com/ir-calendar .\nA replay will be available for two weeks starting on May 14, 2018 at approximately 8 p.m. ET.

We define EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and Adjusted EBITDA, as EBITDA before stock based compensation and certain non-recurring professional expenses related to pending or threatened litigation matters. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful performance measures used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance and earnings on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) can provide alone. The non-GAAP measures included in this release, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the financial tables included below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains .
