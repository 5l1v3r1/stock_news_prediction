REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal/File Photo Though permitted to re-open the bidding, Fortis had not yet made a decision on the matter, a spokesperson told Reuters.\nThe board of the cash-strapped company approved the consortium’s offer to invest 18 billion rupees ($266.9 million) earlier this month.\nHowever, investors have been wary of the board’s selection, given the consortium’s offer was much lower than those of Manipal Hospitals Enterprises or Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare Bhd ( IHHH.KL ).\nIn a letter to the company’s board on Monday, the Hero-Burman group acknowledged stakeholders’ preference for re-opening the bidding process.\n“We believe that this situation may have arisen largely on account of the lack of information available to stakeholders,” Hero-Burman said.\nDisapproval from shareholders became evident after they voted out a director last week. Three other directors had resigned ahead of the vote.\nFortis has been in the middle of a five-way bidding war with local and international suitors wanting to invest in the firm or buy it. Manipal sweetened its offer for a fifth time after the Hero-Burman offer was selected, and IHH extended the acceptance period for its offer.\nReporting by Tanvi Mehta in BENGALURU and Zeba Siddiqui in MUMBAI; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T10:36:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
