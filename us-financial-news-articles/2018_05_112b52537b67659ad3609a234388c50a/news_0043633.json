While Qualcomm remains committed to the consummation of its acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (\"NXP\"), it is uncertain if the Acquisition will be consummated on or before June 1, 2018. The four series of outstanding notes are intended to finance the Acquisition and contain provisions that will require Qualcomm to redeem such notes if the Acquisition has not been consummated on or before June 1, 2018 or if the related purchase agreement is terminated beforehand. As a result, Qualcomm is offering to certain holders of such notes the opportunity to tender those notes for cash.\nOnly holders who are not \"qualified institutional buyers\" and who are not non-U.S. persons (other than \"retail investors\" in the European Economic Area and investors in Canada who are not both \"accredited investors\" and \"permitted clients\") are eligible to participate in this transaction, as more fully described below. Concurrently with this transaction, Qualcomm also announced today the commencement of a transaction to exchange such four series of notes pursuant to private exchange offers (each, an \"Exchange Offer\" and collectively, the \"Exchange Offers\") open to certain investors.\nThe tender transaction consists of four separate offers to purchase for cash (each, a \"Cash Offer\", and collectively, the \"Cash Offers\"), any and all of the outstanding notes listed in the table below (collectively, the \"Old Notes\"), which have a special mandatory redemption (\"SMR\") provision, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated May 21, 2018 (the \"Offer to Purchase\" and, together with the certification to participate in the Cash Offers and the instructions for such certification, the notice of guaranteed delivery, the \"Cash Offer Documents\").\nIf the Acquisition is not completed on or prior to June 1, 2018, Qualcomm will redeem any Old Notes not tendered in these Cash Offers or exchanged in the Exchange Offers in accordance with the terms of the Old Notes, including, with respect to the Floating Rate Notes due 2019 (the \"Old 2019 Floating Rate Notes\") and the Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the \"Old 2020 Floating Rate Notes\", and together with the Old 2019 Floating Rate Notes, the \"Old Floating Rate Notes\"), pursuant to the applicable SMR provisions at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Old Floating Rate Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption, or as described in the immediately following paragraph.\nIn accordance with their terms, Qualcomm may redeem the 1.850% Notes due 2019 (the \"Old 2019 Fixed Rate Notes\") and the 2.100% Notes due 2020 (the \"Old 2020 Fixed Rate Notes\", and together with the \"Old 2019 Fixed Rate Notes\", the \"Old Fixed Rate Notes\") at any time under the \"make whole\" optional redemption provision. Assuming Qualcomm does not determine that all conditions to the closing of the Acquisition as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, dated October 27, 2016 (as amended, the \"Purchase Agreement\"), by and between Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm and NXP are reasonably likely to be satisfied or waived on or before June 1, 2018, Qualcomm intends to exercise, on or after May 31, 2018, Qualcomm's right to redeem the Old Fixed Rate Notes that are not accepted by Qualcomm in the Exchange Offers or in the Cash Offers under the \"make whole\" optional redemption provision. According to Qualcomm's current calculations, and subject to changes in interest rates that may occur after the date hereof, Qualcomm expects the redemption price under any such optional redemption to be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Old Fixed Rate Notes to be redeemed.\nThe Cash Offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 25, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated by Qualcomm (the \"Cash Offer Expiration Date\"). Tenders of Old Notes submitted in the Cash Offers may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on May 25, 2018, subject to any extension by Qualcomm, but thereafter will be irrevocable, except in certain limited circumstances where additional withdrawal rights are required by law (as determined by Qualcomm). The \"Cash Offer Settlement Date\" will be promptly following the Cash Offer Expiration Date and is expected to be May 31, 2018.\nTitle of Series of Old Notes to be Purchased\nPrincipal Amount\nOutstanding\n(mm)\nCUSIP/ISIN\nMaturity Date\nTotal\nConsideration (1)\nFloating Rate Notes due 2019\n$ 750.00\n747525AN3; US747525AN39\nMay 20, 2019\n$1,002.50\nFloating Rate Notes due 2020\n$ 500.00\n747525AQ6; US747525AQ69\nMay 20, 2020\n$1,002.50\n1.850% Notes due 2019\n$ 1,250.00\n747525AM5; US747525AM55\nMay 20, 2019\n$1,002.50\n2.100% Notes due 2020\n$ 1,500.00\n747525AP8; US747525AP86\nMay 20, 2020\n$1,002.50\n(1) Total Consideration payable, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in cash per $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and accepted for purchase.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Cash Offer Documents, Cash Offer Eligible Holders (as defined below) who (i) validly tender and who do not validly withdraw Old Notes at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date or (ii) deliver a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required documents at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date and tender their Old Notes pursuant to the Cash Offers at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second business day after the applicable Cash Offer Expiration Date pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, expected to be May 30, 2018, subject in each case to the delivery of the certification to participate in the Cash Offers and the tender in the applicable minimum denominations, and whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase by Qualcomm, will receive the applicable Total Consideration specified in the table above.\nIn addition to the applicable Total Consideration, Cash Offer Eligible Holders whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on such Old Notes to, but not including, the Cash Offer Settlement Date.

Qualcomm will terminate a Cash Offer for a given series of Old Notes if it terminates the Exchange Offer for such series of Old Notes, and Qualcomm will terminate the Exchange Offer for a given series of Old Notes if it terminates the Cash Offer for such series of Old Notes. The Exchange Offer Completion Condition may not be waived by Qualcomm.\nOnly holders of Old Notes who are not (i) \"qualified institutional buyers\" as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and who are not (ii) non-U.S. persons (as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act) located outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act, other than \"retail investors\" (as defined below) in the European Economic Area, or investors located or resident in a province of Canada, who are not both \"accredited investors\", as such term is defined in National Instrument 45-106 – Prospectus Exemptions and section 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and \"permitted clients\", as such term is defined in National Instrument 31-103 – Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, are eligible to participate in the Cash Offers (the \"Cash Offer Eligible Holders\").
