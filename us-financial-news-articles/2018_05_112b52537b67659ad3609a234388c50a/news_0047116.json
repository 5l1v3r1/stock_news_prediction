Police say the true figure is more likely to be in the tens of thousands.\nThe NCA received 5,145 reports of suspected slavery victims in 2017, up from 3,804 in 2016, with abuse in nail bars, building sites, factories, farms and hand car washes.\nForced labor accounts for about a third of slavery victims in Britain - mostly men from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, the GLAA said.\nThe week-long series of raids was the latest operation in Britain’s law enforcement response to slavery and trafficking, backed up by prevention efforts to protect vulnerable people.\nPolice and anti-slavery officials have posted advice on social media in several languages on how to spot the signs of slavery and to help victims, visited building sites to offer guidance to employers, and carried out checks on fishing boats.\n“Though we have had a week of action to highlight the issue, the GLAA and others are involved in these type of activities every single day,” said Ian Waterfield, a director at the GLAA.\nRegarded as a leader in the global drive to end slavery, Britain passed the Modern Slavery Act in 2015 to crack down on traffickers, force businesses to check their supply chains for forced labor, and protect people at risk of being enslaved.\nWriting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
