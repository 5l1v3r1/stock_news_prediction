In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, revenue decreased by 2% to $1.5 billion on a reported basis and was down 7% in constant currency, driven by initiatives to increase quality of sales, reduce promotional activity, and elevate our distribution, as well as brand exits and lower consumer demand.\nThe fourth quarter revenue decline was better than our guidance of an 8%-10% constant currency revenue decline. Foreign currency benefited revenue growth by approximately 440 basis points in the fourth quarter, above our guidance of 330 basis points of benefit, as foreign exchange rates moved favorably during the quarter.\nRevenue performance for the Company’s reportable segments in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period was as follows:\nNorth America Revenue. North America revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 14% on both a constant currency and reported basis to $759 million. The decline was due to lower sales in the wholesale channel, driven by distribution and brand exits, strategic reductions in shipments and promotional activity to increase quality of sales, as well as lower consumer demand. In retail, comparable store sales in North America were flat in constant currency, as a 6% increase in brick and mortar stores was offset by an 18% decrease in ralphlauren.com , primarily due to a planned reduction in promotion frequency and depth. Europe Revenue. Europe revenue in the fourth quarter increased 13% to $420 million on a reported basis and declined 1% in constant currency. On a constant currency basis, comparable store sales in Europe were down 6%, driven by an 8% decline in brick and mortar stores and partially offset by an 8% increase in digital commerce. Brick & mortar comparables were pressured by traffic challenges in select markets, continued quality of sales initiatives, and planned inventory reductions. Average unit retail and gross margins were both up in the fourth quarter as a result of our quality of sales initiatives. Asia Revenue. Asia revenue in the fourth quarter increased 17% to $257 million on a reported basis and increased 11% in constant currency, driven by strength in both retail and wholesale channels. Comparable store sales increased 4% in constant currency driven by improved average unit retail and the number of transactions.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 was $909 million on a reported basis, including inventory-related charges of $6 million, and gross margin was 59.4%. Adjusted gross profit, excluding such charges, was $915 million and adjusted gross margin was 59.8%, 440 basis points above the prior year, excluding inventory-related charges from both periods.\nThe gross margin increase was driven by initiatives to improve quality of sales through reduced promotional activity, favorable geographic and channel mix shifts, and improved product costs and product mix. Foreign currency benefited gross margin by 90 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nOperating Expenses. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 were $883 million on a reported basis, including $54 million in restructuring-related and other charges. On an adjusted basis, excluding such charges, operating expenses were $829 million, up from the prior year, as savings from expense initiatives funded an over 50% increase in planned marketing investment. Excluding the planned increase in marketing and the impact of currency, SG&A expenses were approximately flat to last year.\nAdjusted operating expense rate was 54.2%, 550 basis points above the prior year period, excluding restructuring-related and other charges from both periods. This increase was due to the increased marketing investment and an unfavorable geographic and channel mix shift, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our international retail businesses, which typically carry a higher operating expense rate.\nOperating Income. Operating income for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 was $25 million on a reported basis, including restructuring-related and other charges of $61 million, and operating margin was 1.7%. Adjusted operating income was $86 million and adjusted operating margin was 5.6%, 110 basis points below the prior year, excluding restructuring-related and other charges from both periods, as expense deleverage more than offset gross margin expansion due to increased marketing investment.\nOn a constant currency basis, adjusted operating margin was down 240 basis points. This was at the top end of the Company’s guidance of down 240-260 basis points in constant currency. The currency impact of 130 basis points was above our guidance of 90 basis points of benefit as exchange rates moved favorably during the quarter.\nNorth America Operating Income. North America operating income in the fourth quarter was $128 million on a reported basis and $132 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted North America operating margin was 17.4%, flat with last year, with gross margin improvement offset by higher operating expense as a percent of sales due to higher marketing investment in the quarter. Europe Operating Income. Europe operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million on a reported basis and $85 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted Europe operating margin was 20.1%, which was 20 basis points higher than the prior year period. In constant currency, the adjusted operating margin declined by 220 basis points, as gross margin improvement was more than offset by the increased marketing investment in the quarter. Asia Operating Income. Asia operating income in the fourth quarter was $36 million on a reported basis and $39 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted Asia operating margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points to the prior year and 80 basis points higher in constant currency, driven by gross margin improvement.\nNet Income (Loss) and EPS. On a reported basis, net income in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 was $41 million or $0.50 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $75 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, excluding restructuring-related, tax reform and other charges. This compared to a net loss of $204 million, or ($2.48) per diluted share on a reported basis, and net income of $74 million, or $0.89 per diluted share on an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017.\nIn the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, the Company had an effective tax rate of (66%) on a reported basis and 13% on an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring and related other charges, which was above the Company’s guidance of 3%, primarily due to higher-than-expected pretax income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates and timing of certain audit settlements. This compared to a reported and an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% and 27%, respectively, in the prior year period.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Income Statement Review\nNet Revenues. For Fiscal 2018, revenue decreased 7% to $6.2 billion on a reported basis and decreased 8% in constant currency, consistent with our guidance.\nNorth America Revenue. For Fiscal 2018, North America revenue decreased 15% on both a reported and constant currency basis to $3.2 billion, primarily due to lower sales in the wholesale channel, as well as comparable store sales. Europe Revenue. For Fiscal 2018, Europe revenue increased 3% to $1.6 billion on a reported basis. In constant currency, revenue declined 3% on a planned reduction in promotional activity. Asia Revenue. For Fiscal 2018, Asia revenue increased 6% on both a reported and constant currency basis to $934 million.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2018 was $3.8 billion on a reported basis, including $8 million in inventory-related charges and gross margin was 60.7%.

North America operating income in Fiscal 2018 was $678 million and operating margin was 21.0%, on a reported basis, including approximately $7 million in restructuring-related and other charges. On an adjusted basis, North America operating income in Fiscal 2018 was $685 million and operating margin was 21.2%, a 100 basis point improvement over last year. Europe Operating Income. Europe operating income in Fiscal 2018 was $357 million and operating margin was 22.5%, on a reported basis, including restructuring-related and other charges. On an adjusted basis, Europe operating income in Fiscal 2018 was $359 million and operating margin was 22.7%, 140 basis points above last year. Asia Operating Income.

On an adjusted basis, Asia operating income in Fiscal 2018 was $141 million and operating margin was 15.1%, 450 basis points above last year.\nNet Income (Loss) and EPS. In Fiscal 2018, on a reported basis, net income was $163 million or $1.97 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $498 million, or $6.03 per diluted share, excluding restructuring-related, tax reform, and other charges. This compared to a net loss of $99 million, or ($1.20) per diluted share on a reported basis, and net income of $477 million, or $5.71 per diluted share, excluding restructuring-related and other charges, for Fiscal 2017.\nFor Fiscal 2018, on a reported basis, the Company had an effective tax rate of 67% as compared to 5% in the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 24%, excluding restructuring-related, tax reform, and other charges. This compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28% for Fiscal 2017. The reduction is primarily driven by a higher mix of pretax income from jurisdictions with lower tax rates as well as the lower U.S. federal statutory rate.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Review\nThe Company ended Fiscal 2018 with $2.1 billion in cash and short and long term investments and $596 million in total debt, compared to $1.4 billion and $588 million, respectively, at the end of Fiscal 2017.\nInventory at the end of Fiscal 2018 was $761 million, down 4% compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by improvement in operating processes, including a proactive pullback in receipts and moving towards a demand driven supply chain.\nThe Company had $162 million in capital expenditures in Fiscal 2018, compared to $284 million in the prior year period, primarily related to our global retail and department store renovations, new store openings, and the continued enhancements to our global information technology systems.\nFull Year Fiscal 2019 and First Quarter Outlook\nThe full year Fiscal 2019 and first quarter guidance excludes restructuring-related and other charges.\nFor Fiscal 2019, net revenue is expected to decrease low single-digits in constant currency. Foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in Fiscal 2019.\nThe Company expects operating margin for Fiscal 2019 to be up slightly in constant currency driven by gross margin expansion.

Adjustments for impairment-related charges are recorded within impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations. Adjustments for enactment-related charges recorded in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") and other income tax-related adjustments are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the consolidated statement of operations. Adjustments for all other charges are recorded within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations. (b) Adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include (i) charges of $23.9 million recorded in connection with the Way Forward plan, consisting of restructuring charges, impairment of assets, and inventory-related charges; (ii) additional impairment of assets of $14.4 million related to underperforming shop-within-shops as a result of on-going store portfolio evaluation; (iii) an intangible asset impairment charge of $8.8 million; and (iv) net other charges of $13.8 million related to depreciation expense associated with the Company's former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City and its pending customs audit. The income tax benefit (provision) reflects the reversal of enactment-related charges of $9.9 million recorded in connection with the TCJA. (c) Adjustments for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 include (i) charges of $102.9 million recorded in connection with the Way Forward plan, consisting of restructuring charges, impairment of assets, inventory-related charges, and accelerated stock-based compensation expense; (ii) additional impairment of assets of $25.2 million related to underperforming stores and shop-within-shops as a result of on-going store portfolio evaluation; (iii) an intangible asset impairment charge of $8.8 million; and (iv) net other charges of $28.8 million primarily related to depreciation expense associated with the Company's former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, its pending customs audit, the departure of Mr. Stefan Larsson, and the reversal of reserves associated with the settlement of certain non-income tax issues. The income tax provision reflects enactment-related charges of $221.4 million recorded in connection with the TCJA. (d) Adjustments for the three-month and twelve-month periods ended April 1, 2017 include charges of $326.5 million and $726.5 million, respectively, incurred in connection with our restructuring plans, consisting of restructuring charges, impairment of assets, and inventory-related charges. Additionally, both the three-month and twelve-month periods ended April 1, 2017 include (i) additional impairment of assets of $14.0 million related to underperforming stores that were subject to potential future closure; (ii) a goodwill impairment charge of $5.2 million; and (iii) other charges of $24.6 million recorded in connection with the anticipated settlement of certain non-income tax issues and the departure of Mr. Stefan Larsson. The income tax benefit (provision) for both the three-month and twelve-month periods ended April 1, 2017 includes the reversal of a $15.9 million income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nSince Ralph Lauren Corporation is a global company, the comparability of its operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which it transacts change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on the Company’s reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), the Company’s discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. The Company presents constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to its reported operating results. The Company uses constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in the Company’s businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdditionally, this earnings release includes certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures relating to charges recorded in connection with the Company’s restructuring plans, as well as depreciation expense associated with the Company’s former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City recorded after the store closed during the first quarter of Fiscal 2018 in connection with the Way Forward plan. Although the Company is no longer generating revenue or has any other economic activity associated with its former Polo store, it continues to incur depreciation expense due to its involvement at the time of construction. Adjustments also include additional impairment of assets related to underperforming stores and shop-within-shops, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, and net other charges associated with other non-recurring events, as described in the footnotes to the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above. The income tax benefit (provision) has been adjusted for the tax-related effects of these charges, which were calculated using the respective statutory tax rates for each applicable jurisdiction. The income tax benefit (provision) for both the three-month and twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2018 has also been adjusted for enactment-related charges recorded in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, the income tax benefit (provision) for both the three-month and twelve-month periods ended April 1, 2017 has been adjusted for the reversal of an income tax reserve resulting from a change in tax law that impacted an interest assessment on a prior year withholding tax. Included in this earnings release are reconciliations between the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures before and after these charges. The Company uses non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, among other things, to evaluate its operating performance and in order to represent the manner in which the Company conducts and views its business. The Company believes that excluding items that are not comparable from period to period helps investors and others compare operating performance between two periods. The Company’s full year Fiscal 2019 and first quarter Fiscal 2019 guidance excludes restructuring-related charges, as previously described. While the Company considers the non-U.S. GAAP measures useful in analyzing its results, they are not intended to replace, nor act as a substitute for, any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures reported by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523005391/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nEvren Kopelman, 212-813-7862\nor\nCorporate Communications:\nLindsay Knoll, 212-650-4401\nrl-press@ralphlauren.com\nSource: Ralph Lauren Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&esheet=51810536&newsitemid=20180523005391&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&index=2&md5=c3df681a8e690b94eabe9c5ee3dc098b", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&esheet=51810536&newsitemid=20180523005391&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&index=3&md5=0ac4b05d59072b4d667d4bc54ec7b604", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&esheet=51810536&newsitemid=20180523005391&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&index=1&md5=991ff677d7718aadb3dc22436e3954e9", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180523005391/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&esheet=51810536&newsitemid=20180523005391&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestor.ralphlauren.com&index=4&md5=d1c82cc50287e4b24c697966a5d05039"], "published": "2018-05-23T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:26:22.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
