In such cases the funds will be donated to charity, according to the letter.\nA spokesman for RBS confirmed the new policy. $1 = 0.7420 pounds Reporting By Emma Rumney and Lawrence White Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Jane Merriman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:06:52.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
