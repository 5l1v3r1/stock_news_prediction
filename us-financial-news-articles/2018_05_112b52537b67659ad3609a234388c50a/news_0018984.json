(\"MAXIM\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX:MXG) announced today the release of financial and operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, accompanying notes and Management Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) will be available on SEDAR and on MAXIM's website on May 7, 2018. All figures reported herein are Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nThe Financial Highlights below include the results from MAXIM's continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. Refer to MAXIM's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and MD&A for further details on discontinued operations.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31 ($ in thousands except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Revenue from continuing operations $ - $ 1,979 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders Continuing operations (3,539 ) (4,511 ) Discontinued operations - 926 Total (3,539 ) (3,585 ) Total per share – basic and diluted $ (0.06 ) $ (0.07 ) Total assets $ 168,237 $ 213,211\nOPERATING RESULTS\nMAXIM’s continuing operations are comprised of the HR Milner generating facility (“Milner”) and MAXIM’s corporate activities. Milner has not generated electricity since April 2017 due to low Alberta power prices. Accordingly, results for the first quarter of 2018 reflect limited activities compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, net loss attributable to shareholders from continuing operations decreased in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to 2017. The change in this financial measure was primarily due to operating cost savings from cost cutting initiatives and the temporary suspension of operations at Milner. This was partially offset by realized gains on commodity risk management activities in the first quarter of 2017.\nINTENTION TO RESUME OPERATIONS AT MILNER\nAs previously reported, MAXIM has been monitoring both settled and forward power and gas prices with a view of resuming operations at Milner in 2018. Alberta forward power prices have improved since the start of 2018 and MAXIM currently intends to restart Milner mid-2018. To this end, MAXIM has recalled certain staff and is completing outage work at Milner in preparation for the restart.\nAbout MAXIM\nBased in Calgary, Alberta, MAXIM is an independent power producer which acquires or develops, owns and operates innovative and environmentally responsible power and power related projects. MAXIM currently owns and operates one power plant in Alberta, having 150 MW of electric generating capacity. MAXIM trades on the TSX under the symbol \"MXG\".
