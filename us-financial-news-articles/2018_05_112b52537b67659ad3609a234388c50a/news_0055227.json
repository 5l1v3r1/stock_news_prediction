Happ pitched into the seventh inning Sunday afternoon as the visiting Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 5-3.\nBy taking the rubber match of the three-game interleague set, the Blue Jays won their first series since April 30-May 2 against the Minnesota Twins, also on the road. It was a stretch of seven winless series.\nHapp (7-3) allowed three runs (two earned), six hits and two walks in 6 2/3 innings. The left-hander struck out eight in earning his third straight win.\nRyan Tepera pitched around a leadoff walk in the ninth to earn his second save of the season and his second of the series.\nPhillies starter Nick Pivetta (4-3), a Canadian from Victoria, British Columbia, allowed two runs, four hits and two walks while striking out seven in five innings.\nThe Blue Jays scored twice in the second. Russell Martin and Smith walked with one out, advanced on a wild pitch and came home on a double by Travis.\nAfter Pivetta left in favor of a pinch hitter in the bottom of the fifth, Tommy Hunter took over for Philadelphia in the top of the sixth.\nHunter walked Smoak with one out, Yangervis Solarte singled, and with two outs, Martin singled to load the bases. Smith cued a two-run double down the third base line.\nThe Phillies came back with three runs in the bottom of sixth, helped by two Blue Jays errors.\nMaikel Franco singled with one out. A throwing error by Toronto third baseman Josh Donaldson on Carlos Santana’s infield single put runners at second and third. Aaron Altherr singled to center and moved to second on Kevin Pillar’s error as two runs scored. Nick Williams followed with an RBI single, cutting the lead to 4-3.\nSeunghwan Oh replaced Happ with two outs and no one on in the seventh and finished the inning, then tossed a perfect eighth.\nGranderson hit his fourth homer of the season in the ninth against Hector Neris.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:30:28.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
