Copper had rallied at the start of the week after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the prospect of a U.S.-China trade war, following the imposition of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium, was \"on hold\". Industrial metals are suffering \"under the risk-off tone in the markets, following signs that trade negotiations between the United States and China are not progressing as well as initially thought,\" ANZ wrote in a note. Copper is the \"commodity most leveraged to the global economic cycle,\" it said.
