(NYSE AMER:MTNB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling the delivery of life-changing medicines using its proprietary lipid nano-crystal (LNC) platform technology, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call with live audio webcast today, May 10, 2018 at 8:30 AM EDT (details below).\n“Since I was appointed CEO in March, we have conducted a strategic review and prioritized the development of MAT2203 as well as the expansion of our platform technology into new and exciting areas of medicine. We believe our proprietary and highly differentiated LNC platform can be leveraged to drive shareholder value through the development of Matinas-owned as well as partnered molecules,” commented Jerome D. Jabbour, Chief Executive Officer of Matinas. “We continue to advance our strategy to collaborate with established pharmaceutical companies to expand the utilization of our LNC platform technology and expect to execute on collaborations over the course of this year. Additionally, we are making progress in the clinical development of our lead product, MAT2203, having streamlined the development path towards addressing a significant unmet medical need in the prevention of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.”\nLNC PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY: STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS UPDATE\nThe Company believes that its unique and proprietary LNC delivery technology platform can be used to formulate and thereby re-design a wide variety of molecules and drugs which, (i) require delivery technology to improve the stability of molecules inside and outside of the body, (ii) could benefit from efficient delivery and cellular uptake by target cells, and (iii) are currently only available in IV formulations or (iv) otherwise experience significant toxicity-related adverse events. Leveraging its LNC delivery technology, the Company believes it can develop a pipeline of product candidates, both internally and through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Matinas has already demonstrated efficacy of a range of pharmaceutical compounds reformulated by its LNC delivery technology in proof-of-concept animal studies, including small molecule drugs, oligonucleotides (mRNA, siRNA, DNA plasmids), vaccines, peptides, proteins, anti-inflammatory agents, NSAIDs and anti-microbials.\nMatinas continues to advance discussions with strategic partners and expects to finalize one or more collaborative agreements in areas of innovative medicine over the course of 2018.\nMAT2203 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT UPDATE\nThe Company's lead product candidate, MAT2203, utilizes its proprietary LNC formulation technology for the safe and effective delivery of the broad-spectrum fungicidal agent, amphotericin B. Based on the positive patient clinical data reported in 2017 and a recent positive face-to-face interaction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Matinas is preparing for a potential Phase 2 pivotal trial of MAT2203 for prevention of IFIs in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\nMatinas expects to commence its pivotal Phase 2 adaptive-designed study following its next interaction with the FDA in the first half of 2019. The Company will position MAT2203 for approval with a targeted indication for prevention of IFIs in ALL patients. The first aspect of this pivotal Phase 2 trial will be an evaluation of the PK/PD and tolerability of MAT2203 in leukemia patients. The second part of this study will evolve to become an evaluation of PK/PD, efficacy and safety of MAT2203 versus placebo in ALL patients, where there is no standard of care in prevention of IFIs. Due to significant drug-drug interactions or the lack of an oral dosing mode, there is limited utility of currently approved antifungal therapies for the prevention of IFIs. The Company believes that orally-administered MAT2203 has the potential to become a highly differentiated therapy in the antifungal field.\nThe FDA has granted MAT2203 designations for Fast Track and Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis and for the prevention of IFIs in patients on immunosuppressive therapy.\nQ1 2018 SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of approximately $4.3 million, or a net loss per share basic and diluted of $0.05, compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of approximately $21.4 million, or a net loss per share basic and diluted of $0.25, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to ongoing research and development activities related to the Company’s MAT2203 antifungal product candidate as well as the costs associated with operating as a public company. The Company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.3 million.\nBased on management’s current projections, the Company believes that cash on hand is sufficient to fund operations into September 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST DETAILS\nAs previously announced, Matinas will host a live conference call and webcast for investors, analysts and other interested parties today, Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. EDT.\nTo participate in the call, please dial (877) 407-5976 (domestic) or (412) 902-0031 (international).
