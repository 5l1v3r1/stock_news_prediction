The stock has risen 13.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.8 percent fall in the benchmark index in the same period.\nMagna expects to grow sales faster than vehicle production through 2020 as it launches new programs, such as its autonomous car agreement with Lyft, even as demand is expected to soften in the key North American market this year.\nSales at the business that assembles cars under contract from manufacturers rose more than three-fold to $1.66 billion in the first quarter ended March 31.
