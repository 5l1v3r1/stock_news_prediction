Two community leaders were killed this week, according to local media reports.\nThe government has said it is stepping up efforts to punish those responsible and is sending more state prosecutors to Colombia’s south and Pacific regions - former FARC rebel strongholds - to investigate killings.\nThe IACHR, which monitors human rights across the Americas, and is part of the Organization of American States, has granted dozens of precautionary measures in recent years, including to at-risk activists in Colombia.\nActivists have been particularly at risk in regions that were vacated by rebel fighters following the peace accord, leaving a power vacuum that crime gangs have sought to fill, the United Nations (U.N.) human rights office in Colombia has said.\nLocal groups say community leaders who speak out against abuses and land rights campaigners are targeted by organized crime groups who believe they threaten their economic interests.\nThe petition also asked the IACHR to appoint experts to monitor the dangers faced by activists and that crimes are investigated properly.\nThe U.N. in March reiterated its concern about the dangers activists face, as 121 human rights defenders were killed in Colombia last year and hundreds more attacked, the majority in areas formerly held by FARC rebels.\nColombian authorities have handed down at least 15 convictions since 2015, including five last year, for crimes against rights defenders.\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Katy Migiro.
