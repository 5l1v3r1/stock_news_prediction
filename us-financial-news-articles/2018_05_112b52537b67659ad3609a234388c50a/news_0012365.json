Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C and D.\n\"We are pleased with our solid performance in the first quarter,\" said Allen Nye, chief executive of Oncor. \"During the quarter, we successfully closed the transaction with Sempra Energy and completed our leadership succession as planned. We look forward to continuing our strong financial and operational performance in 2018 as we continue to deliver our customers the lowest rates of any investor-owned utility in Texas.\"\nOperating Highlights\nOn March 9, after receiving final regulatory approvals, Sempra Energy completed its acquisition of an approximate 80 percent ownership interest in Oncor. With the closing of the Sempra Energy transaction, Oncor now has a financially strong and dynamic majority owner who will partner with Oncor in our efforts to continue to provide the safest, most reliable and affordable electric service to our customers.\nEffective with the closing of the Sempra Energy transaction on March 9, Oncor implemented its previously-announced leadership succession plan. Allen Nye, who had been serving as Oncor's senior vice president and general counsel, became Oncor's chief executive, succeeding Robert S. Shapard, who became Oncor's chairman.\nIn April 2018, Sempra Energy and our other member contributed a total of $144 million in cash proportionate to their equity ownership interests to Oncor. Completion of this additional equity investment satisfies one of the regulatory commitments made by Sempra Energy and Oncor in their change-in-control proceeding.\nSempra Energy Internet Broadcast Today\nSempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) will broadcast a live discussion of its reported results over the Internet today 12 p.m. EDT with senior management of Sempra Energy and Oncor.
