As cyberattacks against critical infrastructure and manufacturing concerns accelerate, Weinstein brings the balanced, global expertise to analyze risks and threats, not only from the perspective of actors and methods, but also the ramifications for policy and response.\nDave Weinstein, Vice President of Threat Research, Claroty\nPrior to being appointed CTO, where he led a cabinet-level agency of more than 600 technologists and was responsible for managing and securing a massive enterprise of infrastructure assets, Weinstein served as the state’s first cybersecurity advisor. During this time, he holds the distinction of having formed the nation’s first state-level information sharing and analysis organization (ISAO), the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC), aimed at promoting shared and multisector situational awareness of cyberthreats and best practices. Prior to this, Weinstein served at the U.S. Cyber Command from 2010 to 2013, where he planned cyber operations in close coordination with interagency and international partners. He also spent time as a cyber risk consultant at Deloitte, and currently serves as a non-resident Cybersecurity Policy Fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, New America.\n“Whether a direct attack for the purposes of sabotage, or spillover events like ransomware, the ripple effect caused by impedance or interruption of control systems is becoming too frequent and too costly to ignore,” said Dr. Benny Porat, CTO and Co-founder of Claroty. “Dave has lived in the shadow of these risks, and his understanding and experience will not only bring our threat research team a perfect leader and partner, but will also help our customers to better understand their risk, responsibilities and recourse in this increasingly volatile landscape.”\nClaroty’s comprehensive cybersecurity platform provides deep visibility into industrial networks and combines secure remote access with continuous monitoring for threats and vulnerabilities – enabling industrial control system operators the ability to protect these important networks. The company now has production installations across six continents in nine vertical markets, including oil and gas, electric utilities, manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, water, food and beverage, and mining, and strategic ICS partnerships with key players including Rockwell Automation, Schneider Electric and Leidos (formerly SAIC).\n“Given Claroty’s deep and rich visibility of the cyberthreats facing the world’s most critical infrastructures, it is incumbent upon us to contribute our insights and analytics not only to our customers, but also to a global community of operators and researchers who share our values for a secure and resilient Industrial Internet of Things,” commented Weinstein. “I look forward to leading this mission for Claroty and working with our partners across all sectors and industries.”\nAbout Claroty\nHeadquartered in New York and launched as the second startup from the famed Team8 foundry, Claroty combines elite management and research teams and deep technical expertise from both IT and OT disciplines, with backing from premier investors such as Bessemer Venture Partners and Innovation Endeavors. With an unmatched understanding of ICS, SCADA and other essential OT/IIoT systems, the Claroty team is building an unparalleled suite of integrated products addressing the full spectrum of cybersecurity protection, control, detection and response requirements.
