REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration U.S. benchmark 10-year yields US10YT=RR hit a high of 3.122 percent on Thursday, the highest in nearly seven years. Since the beginning of the year, U.S. 10-year yields have increased by more than 50 basis points, on track for their largest rise in eight years.\n“The upside pressure on the dollar has been dramatic as the dollar has not declined consistently in a period which should be seeing dollar weakness,” John Taylor, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York, said.\nRising yields reflect continued optimism about the U.S. economy, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise borrowing rates at least two more times this year.\nThe dollar rose to its strongest level versus the Japanese yen since Jan. 23 at 110.80 yen.

Investors are betting U.S. interest rates will need to rise further, while other central banks are postponing monetary tightening.\nThat has forced investors who took big positions against the dollar anticipating a fall in 2018 to unwind and cover their positions, pushing the greenback even higher.\n“This sense of a market that is not particularly well prepared for a euro decline is supported by the benign valuations still evident in the pricing of six-month and 12-month implied volatility,” BNY Mellon analysts said in a note, referring to prices of a measure of expected swings in the value of the euro.\nSterling gave up earlier gains after the British government dismissed a media report that Britain wanted to stay in the European Union’s customs union after Brexit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:41:03.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
