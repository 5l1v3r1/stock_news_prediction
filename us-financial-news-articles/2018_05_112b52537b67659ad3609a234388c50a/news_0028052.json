(NASDAQ:JYNT), a national operator, manager and franchisor of chiropractic clinics, reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights: 2018 Compared to 2017\nIncreased gross system-wide sales 32%, to $37.0 million. Grew system-wide comp sales 1 26%. Increased revenue 29% to $7.1 million. Improved net loss $1.4 million to $(387,000). Posted positive Adjusted EBITDA of $156,000, an improvement of $753,000 from the first quarter of 2017. Achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter. Opened 7 new franchised clinics and no clinics closed, increasing total clinics to 406 as of\nMarch 31, 2018. Reinitiated the corporate owned or managed clinic growth program with the acquisition of one previously-franchised clinic in April 2018.\nPeter D. Holt, president and chief executive officer of The Joint Corp, said, “Our disciplined business strategy, improved operations and enhanced marketing together drove another quarter of strong growth. Additionally, the time for reaching the break-even point for new clinics continues to decrease.\n“We are proud to contribute to our patients’ well-being and will continue our pursuit to deliver quality, convenient and affordable chiropractic care. Many industry studies indicate the number of people experiencing pain and actively looking for drug-free management is increasing. We are perfectly positioned to meet this increasing demand. By broadening our footprint through accelerating our franchise sales, expanding our regional developer program and adding corporate owned or managed clinics in a strategic and measured fashion, we expect to continue to deliver shareholder value.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Results: 2018 Compared to 2017\nRevenue grew 29% to $7.1 million, compared to $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to increased sales at company owned or managed clinics and a greater number of franchised clinics.\nCost of revenue was $1.0 million, up 40% compared to the first quarter of 2017, due to higher regional developer royalties from increased gross sales in regional developer territories.\nGross profit was $6.1 million dollars, increasing 27% from $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nSelling and marketing expenses were $1.1 million, up from $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting higher marketing expenses related to our company owned or managed clinics. expenses were $5.1 million, up 11% compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to increased payroll, which was partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses.\nNet loss was $(387,000), or $(0.03) per share. First quarter of 2017 net loss, including a charge of $418,000 related to the disposition/impairment of non-operating leases, was $(1.8) million, or $(0.14) per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA income was $156,000, an improvement of $753,000, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(597,000) in the same quarter last year. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses, bargain purchase gain, loss on disposition or impairment, and stock-based compensation expenses. The company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses.\nBalance Sheet Liquidity\n were $4.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $4.2 million at December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s credit agreement, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company borrowed a required $1.0 million on its line of credit, which remains unused as part of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2018.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nManagement reiterates its full year 2018 financial guidance and franchise opening expectations as set forth below:\nRevenue is expected to be between $31 million and $32 million, up from $25.0 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, improving from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(214,000) in 2017. Total new clinic openings are expected to be in the range of 40 to 52 including 40 to 50 new franchised clinics, up to two corporate-owned or managed greenfield clinics and up to three purchases of previously-franchised clinics, which when acquired from franchisees do not change the total clinic count.\nConference Call\nThe Joint Corp. management will host a conference call at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday, May 10, 2018, to discuss the first quarter 2018 results.

These are presented because they are important measures used by management to assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more transparent view of the Company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends. Reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the table below. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses, bargain purchase gain, loss on disposition or impairment, and stock-based compensation expenses. The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as measures of financial performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements.
