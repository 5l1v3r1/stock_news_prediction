REUTERS/Joe Skipper\nMusk’s antics on the weird name pushed the electrical car maker’s shares down on Thursday, with a number of analysts making scathing feedback and not less than three brokerages chopping value targets on the inventory.\n“The ‘dry’ questions weren’t requested by buyers, however moderately by two sell-side analysts who had been making an attempt to justify their Tesla quick thesis.
