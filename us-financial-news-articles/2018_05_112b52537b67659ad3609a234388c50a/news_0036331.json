Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports Tatar, 27, took part in line rushes and worked on the second power-play unit during the team’s morning skate.\nVegas trails the best-of-seven series against the Winnipeg Jets 1-0.\n“He’s scored goals in the past and he’s getting a chance here and hopefully he runs with it,” Vegas forward James Neal told NHL.com. “Whether he’s on (the power play) or not, I think he does a great job of getting open and he’s been in that place throughout the year and he has done a good job of putting the puck in the net.”\nTatar was acquired from the Detroit Red wings on Feb. 26 for three draft picks, including a first-round selection in this summer’s draft. However, he has not played since Game 4 of the Western Conference Second Round against the San Jose Sharks on May 2, and has no points in four playoff games.\nTatar did have 34 points (20 goals, 14 assists) in 82 combined games for the Golden Knights and Red Wings during the regular season. That includes six points (four goals, two assists) in 20 games with Vegas.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
