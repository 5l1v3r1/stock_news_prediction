(NYSE: NSM), with its Mr. Cooper operations, reported first quarter GAAP net income of $160 million, or $1.61 per diluted share. This compared to a fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income of $41 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported earnings $44 million, or $0.44 per diluted share.\n\"Nationstar is off to a strong start in 2018,” said Jay Bray, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"The Servicing segment continues to perform in-line with expectations. Despite a challenging mortgage originations environment, funded volume held flat and Xome® increased third-party property inflows. We operate at tremendous scale and we have a compelling opportunity for significant cost savings to be achieved across the platform in the next two years. Our best-in-class platform, complemented by technology investments and the power of a rising rate environment, should continue to build value for our stockholders over the long term.\"\nServicing\nThe Servicing segment earned $220 million GAAP pretax income or $69 million adjusted pretax income (5.5 basis points), compared to 5.0 basis points in the prior year. From the prior quarter, the 30-year mortgage rate increased over 40 basis points contributing to a two CPR reduction in prepayment speeds, net of recapture and a 13% decline in amortization.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q4'17 Q1'18 $ BPS $ BPS Operational revenue $ 284 21.2 $ 291 23.1\nAmortization (55 ) (4.1 ) (48 ) (3.8 ) Mark-to-market — — 152 12.0\nTotal revenues 229 17.1 395 31.3 Expenses (173 ) (12.9 ) (182 ) (14.5\n) Total other income (expenses), net 21 1.5 7 0.6 Income before taxes (GAAP) 77 5.7 220 17.4\nMark-to-market — — (152 ) (12.0\n) Adjustments 1 0.1 — — Adjusted pretax income $ 78 5.8 $ 69 5.5 While total revenues in the servicing segment grew by 3%, expenses increased by 5% from the prior quarter. The expense increase was driven by a temporary rise in staffing costs to optimize advance recoveries. This allows the Company to shorten collection timelines and reduce our financing costs while improving overall liquidity. Nationstar ended the first quarter with a $500 billion portfolio. The pipeline consists of both mortgage servicing rights and subserviced loans and we expect to end the year over $530 billion.\nQuarter Ended Q4'17 Q1'18 Ending UPB ($B) $ 508 $ 500 Average UPB ($B) $ 536 $ 504 60+ day delinquency rate 3.4 % 3.2 % Annualized CPR 12.7 % 10.7 % Annualized CPR, net of recapture 11.0 % 8.9 % Modifications and workouts 29,905 19,950 The Company is targeting adjusted servicing profitability in excess of 6.0 basis points on average for the full year 2018 propelled by improved prepayment speeds and cost savings initiatives.\nOriginations\nOriginations serves as an organic source of servicing assets at attractive margins. Volume is created through three primary channels: a consumer direct channel focused on existing customers, new customer acquisitions, and correspondent originations. The segment earned $19 million GAAP pretax income or $25 million adjusted pretax income, a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 26% resulting from the shift in interest rates and composition mix.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q4'17 Q1'18 Income before taxes (GAAP) $ 30 $ 19 Adjustments 4 5 Adjusted pretax income $ 34 $ 25 Nationstar funded approximately 23,000 loans totaling $5.1 billion, including $2.8 billion primarily related to retaining customers from the servicing portfolio. Correspondent loans totaled $2.3 billion in the first quarter, up 10% from the prior quarter. The Company has identified nearly 750,000 customers with substantial home equity combined with high interest rate consumer debt. We have executed initiatives to shift organic growth from an interest-rate driven rate-term refinance product to a debt consolidation refinance value proposition for many of our 3.2 million customers. These tailored solutions are improving cash flow and consolidating debt for our customers and serving as a powerful growth engine for our new customer acquisition channel.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q4'17 Q1'18 Total pull through adjusted volume $ 4,796 $ 4,862 Funded volume $ 5,152 $ 5,087 Recapture percentage 26 % 27 % Purchase volume as a percentage of funded volume 37 % 40 % The Company is targeting Originations adjusted pretax income of $140 million for the full year 2018.\nXome\nXome provides real estate solutions including property disposition, asset management, title, close, valuation, and field services to Nationstar and third-parties. The Xome segment earned $22 million GAAP pretax income or $14 million adjusted pretax income. Xome achieved 17% quarter-over-quarter adjusted pretax income growth, primarily from third-party growth.\nCustomers are consolidating their vendor footprint to high performers with national scale and expanding business with vendors who offer comprehensive solutions across the mortgage lifecycle. Third-party volume accounted for 36% of total inflows and third-party customers are replacing Nationstar volume. The Exchange business sold over 2,800 properties in the quarter, a 6% sequential increase. The adjusted pretax income margin was 22%, driven by an increase in third-party property sales and effective cost management, particularly with respect to personnel costs.\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions) Q4'17 Q1'18 Income before taxes (GAAP) $ 12 $ 22 Adjustments — (8 ) Adjusted pretax income $ 12 $ 14 Adjusted pretax income margin 18 % 22 %\nXome executed a strategic transaction during the quarter. In 2014 the Company acquired Real Estate Digital “RED”, a data provider and aggregator powering online real estate for Xome and many third parties. The first quarter adjustment of $8 million was related primarily to the strategic decision to sell RED’s non-core brokerage web hosting business. Xome will retain ownership of Xome’s proprietary data.\nQuarter Ended Q4'17 Q1'18 Default property listings sold 2,725 2,880 Default property listings at period end 6,886 6,849 Referral program property listings 734 977 Referral program property listings sold 409 322 Xome services completed orders 96,281 111,339 Percentage of revenue earned from third-party customers 25 % 27 % The Company re-entered the field services business and has begun capturing property inspection and preservation orders.

The adjusted financial measures facilitate a meaningful analysis and allow more accurate comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to the Company’s and our business segments’ core operating performance, and are better measures for assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operational and planning decisions and evaluating the Company’s and our business segment’s ongoing performance. Adjusted earnings (loss) in the servicing segment eliminates the effects of mark-to-market adjustments which primarily reflects unrealized gains or losses based on the changes in fair value measurements of MSRs and their related financing liabilities for which a fair value accounting election was made. These adjustments, which can be highly volatile and material due to changes in credit markets, are not necessarily reflective of the gains and losses that will ultimately be realized by the Company. Adjusted earnings (loss) also eliminates in each segment, as applicable, transition and integration costs, gains (losses) on sales of fixed assets, certain settlement costs that are not considered normal operational matters, and other adjustments based on the facts and circumstances that would provide investors a supplemental means for evaluating the Company’s core operating performance.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements in this release that are not historical or current facts are forward looking statements.
