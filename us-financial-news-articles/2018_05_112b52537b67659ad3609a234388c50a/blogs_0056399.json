Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOS. Europe’s new privacy law, known as GDPR, is set to take effect today, an event representing the culmination of a months-long or years-long effort to get cloud and analytics policies in line with a much stricter regulatory environment. But for many CIOs tasked with driving digital strategy across the company, May 25 is just another deadline. It’s an important one, and much work remains , but with automation, AI, cybersecurity, various blockchain projects and talent issues pressing for attention, CIOs are not allowed to stop.\nHow do they do it? CIO Journal’s Kim S. Nash attended the MIT Sloan CIO Symposium in Cambridge, Mass., this week where attendees told her that they increasingly must rely on their non-tech capabilities to drive change. Highlights below.\nEncourage a sense of mission. Harmeen Mehta, global CIO and head of digital at Bharti Airtel Ltd ., tells CIO Journal that she often will talk with individual coders or engineers about their part in a larger project and about what the company is trying to accomplish for customers. Working for a clear purpose, not a cog in a technology wheel, “gives a sense of achievement,” she said.\nUnderstand the power dynamics. Atefeh Riazi, chief information technology officer at the United Nations said understanding unwritten power structures can help a technology leader know when to nurture or push new ideas. “Our job as CIO is [to be] a priest. We can’t shy away from it,” she said.\nUse tech to relieve stress. Adeel Saeed, CIO of corporate technology services and interim chief security officer at State Street Corp. , said in an interview that he is working to reduce stress among his staff in part by developing chatbots to handle routine tasks such as finding forms and helping employees adhere to security policies.\nMORE FROM CIO JOURNAL\nFrom left to right: Mara Lemos Stein, reporter for WSJs Risk & Compliance Journal; Theresa Payton, president and CEO of Fortalice Solutions; Meerah Rajavel, CIO at Forcepoint; James Stickland, CEO at Veridium.

Employers on the hunt for excellent cybersecurity analysts don’t necessarily need to look for technical talent. What’s overlooked is the importance of diversity in soft skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and a willingness to continuously learn, a group of cybersecurity firm executives told WSJ’s Cybersecurity Executive Forum on Thursday .\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators inspected the self-driving Uber vehicle after the fatal crash in Tempe, Ariz. Photo: NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD/REUTERS\nSelf-driving Uber not set up to stop . U.S. safety investigators said the Uber Technologies Inc . self-driving car involved in a fatal accident in Arizona this spring determined the need to apply emergency braking a little more than a second before impact, but wasn’t set up to automatically do so, the Journal’s Tim Higgins and Austen Hufford write .\nAmazon Alexa-powered device shared user’s conversation without permission.

The company said that the Echo device misunderstood pieces of a conversation as commands, causing it to think it was being instructed to send the message.\nFeds target bitcoin manipulation . The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies, Bloomberg reports , citing four sources familiar with the matter. Investigators are focused on illegal practices that can affect prices, such as flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling.\nAlso of note : According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, criminals have stolen about $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies since the beginning of 2017. Reuters has more .\nEurope: the Goldilocks of tech regulation? French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday said Europe should set global standards for tougher tech regulation, saying the United States was too lax while China was too restrictive, Reuters reports . “For me, the U.S. model is not sustainable because there’s no political accountability,” he said. China, he continued, was “over-centralized.”\nRetailers push back on card companies’ payment initiative . Representatives for large retailers including Walmart Inc . and Home Depot Inc . met with federal regulators to raise concerns about an initiative from Visa Inc . and Mastercard Inc . that would combine their individual payment buttons on merchants’ online checkout pages, the Journal’s AnnaMaria Andriotis writes .

The Journal’s Tim Higgins has more .\nBill moves to block U.S. from buying Chinese surveillance equipment. The Journal’s Dan Strumpf reports that the House bill, which passed on a 351-66 vote, is the latest U.S. measure to take aim at Chinese technology companies, which have raised fears over national security. A spokesperson for surveillance equipment maker Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co ., which is 42%-owned by the Chinese government, said the vote “was made without a complete accounting of the facts and with no evidence to justify the claims of its sponsors.”\nWHAT YOUR CEO IS READING\nThe grave marker of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda Fitzgerald is seen at St. Mary's Church Cemetery May 9, 2013 in Rockville, MD. Photo: Matt McClain / Associated Press\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\nIntroducing the F. Scott Fitzgerald test for AI. Quartz’s Paul Sonderegger says he found the perfect test for artificial intellegence from some lines written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1936: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” Mr. Fitzgerald ended up failing the test, washing out in Hollywood. And much of today’s AI may be heading along the same path, minus the martinis. “They offer a cheap imitation of a life well-lived, but only from a narrow perspective,” Mr. Sonderegger writes. “They are unable to hold two opposing thoughts at once, instead needing to exist in a state where decisions are made with one model or another, but not debate between the two.”\nBill Gates has your summer reading. Hide that copy of Vanity Fair you saved for the beach. Here comes the Microsoft Corp . co-founder with a ton–literally a ton– of summer beach reads , including “Leonardo da Vinci”, by Walter Isaacson and “Origin Story: A Big History of Everything,” by David Christian, “which tells the story of the universe from the big bang to today’s complex societies, weaving together insights and evidence from various disciplines into a single narrative.” Looks like it’s going to be another summer spent indoors.\nFace-fashion must-have for open-office alpha-dogs. Funny how most stories on the deconstructed, espresso-machine-outfitted, zeppelin-hanger-sized open office plan fail to mention the cacophony of noise from employees yammering on their iPhones. Introducing Bloxvox, a new “voice privacy tool” worn on the face that lets employees carry on conversations without annoying everyone else. The muzzle-like design may take some getting used to. “Yes, it sounds weird, and I’m not going to spend any more time explaining it,” David Carnoy writes in CNet . “However, I will point out that there’s a little air hole in the front that allows you to breathe and have some air circulate in the muzzle.”\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW\nPresident Donald Trump says he has canceled the planned June 12 summit with North Korea, citing the “anger and open hostility” in a recent North Korean statement.
