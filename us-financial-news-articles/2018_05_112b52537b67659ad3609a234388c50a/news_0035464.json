Wade Davis earned his 15th save. Makita (0-1) took the loss.\nAnderson and Padres rookie left-hander Joey Lucchesi were matched for the third time this season. Lucchesi, who didn’t yield an earned run to the Rockies in 11 innings before Monday, gave up three runs on six hits and a walk with two strikeouts in five innings.\nTwo of the hits Lucchesi allowed were solo homers in the fifth by second baseman Daniel Castro and right fielder Noel Cuevas. It was the first of the season for Castro and a career first for Cuevas. The blasts gave Colorado a 3-2 lead.\nCastro was starting because the Rockies placed DJ LeMahieu on the 10-day disabled list Monday due to a left thumb sprain.\nThe Padres tied the game in the bottom of the fifth on an RBI double by Eric Hosmer, but Parra broke the game open an inning later.\nColorado took a 1-0 lead in the third when Anderson drew a walk and came around on singles by Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado.\nThe Padres tied the game in the bottom of the inning on a Freddy Galvis double and an RBI bunt single by Manuel Margot.\nA fourth-inning throwing error by Rockies shortstop Trevor Story gave San Diego a 2-1 lead.\nGalvis scored the Padres’ final run in the bottom of the sixth — tripling with two outs and scoring on a single by A.J. Ellis.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
