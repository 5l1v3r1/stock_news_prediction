The process to recruit a successor has commenced and a further announcement will be made in due course.\nMr. Kavanagh has been CFO of Mainstay since 2013.

Hugh provided financial leadership for the Company through the development phase of ReActiv8 and to its commercialization in Europe.\nJason Hannon, CEO of Mainstay, said: “On behalf of Mainstay’s Board, management team and staff, I would like to thank Hugh for his substantial contribution to the growth of the Company. This is an exciting time for the Company as we look forward to results from our US IDE Study of ReActiv8 and as the Company increases its focus on preparing for commercialization in the US market. The Company plans to announce the appointment of a new CFO in the coming months. We are pleased that Hugh will continue to support the Company through this transition. We wish him all the best for the future.”\n- End –\nAbout Mainstay\nMainstay is a medical device company focused on bringing to market an innovative implantable restorative neurostimulation system, ReActiv8 ® , for people with disabling Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP). The Company is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. It has subsidiaries operating in Ireland, the United States, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands, and is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (MSTY.PA) and the ESM of Euronext Dublin (MSTY.IE).\nAbout Chronic Low Back Pain\nOne of the recognized root causes of CLBP is impaired control by the nervous system of the muscles that dynamically stabilize the spine in the low back, and an unstable spine can lead to back pain. ReActiv8 is designed to electrically stimulate the nerves responsible for contracting these muscles and thereby help to restore muscle control and improve dynamic spine stability, allowing the body to recover from CLBP.\nPeople with CLBP usually have a greatly reduced quality of life and score significantly higher on scales for pain, disability, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Their pain and disability can persist despite the best available medical treatments, and only a small percentage of cases result from an identified pathological condition or anatomical defect that may be correctable with spine surgery. Their ability to work or be productive is seriously affected by the condition and the resulting days lost from work, disability benefits and health resource utilization put a significant burden on individuals, families, communities, industry and governments.\nFurther information can be found at www.mainstay-medical.com\nCAUTION – in the United States, ReActiv8 is limited by federal law to investigational use only.\nForward looking statements\nThis announcement includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements.
