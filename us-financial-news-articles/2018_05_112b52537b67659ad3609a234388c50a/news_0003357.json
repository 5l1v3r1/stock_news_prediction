It was not immediately possible to get Iranian reaction to the Moroccan accusation. Iran has backed Polisario in the past.\nThe Western Sahara region has effectively been split by an earthen wall separating an area controlled by Morocco that it claims as its southern provinces and territory controlled by the Polisario, with a U.N.-mandated buffer zone between them.\nIn 2009, Morocco cut diplomatic links with Iran, accusing it of questioning Sunni rule of Bahrain, a Gulf Arab island that has a Shi’ite majority. Ties were gradually restored around 2014, but they were never strong, with Rabat backing Tehran’s arch-rival, Saudi Arabia.\nReporting by Ahmed ElJechtimi, writing by Ulf Laessing; editing by Gareth Jones, Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T18:19:49.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
