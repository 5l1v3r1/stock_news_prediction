It is now running into macro headwinds - crude, spike in the 10-year yield, valuations on market-end as a whole are high,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer, Sanctum Wealth Management.\nThe broader NSE index was down 0.09 percent at 10,729.60 as of 0552 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.02 percent higher at 35,169.13.\nStock markets were closed on Tuesday for a public holiday.\nShares of Bajaj Auto Ltd gained as much as 3.1 percent after the company posted a 26 percent jump in total vehicle sales for April, while Tata Motors Ltd rose up to 3.3 percent after reporting an 86 percent surge in domestic sales of commercial and passenger vehicles last month.\nDabur India Ltd climbed 3.7 percent to a record after posting a 19 percent rise in its fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday.\nPublic sector banks fell on non-performing asset woes, Sharma said. The Nifty PSU bank index dropped 1.8 percent with Indian Bank shedding 2.3 percent.\nHowever, private sector lenders inched higher with Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd accounting for most of the gains on both indexes. Kotak shares gained over 5 percent after the lender posted a 15 percent rise in March-quarter profit on Monday.\nHCL Technologies fell as much as 5 percent to its lowest since Oct. 26 after its March-quarter profit came in below analysts’ estimates.
