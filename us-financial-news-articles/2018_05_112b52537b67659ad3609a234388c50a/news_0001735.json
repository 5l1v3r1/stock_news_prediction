Pincus is also moving to become nonexecutive chairman from his executive chairman role, Zynga said. Shares in Zynga ZNGA, +3.41% rose 1.4% in after-hours trading.\nCompanies use multiple share-class structures to give founders and early investors more control when they go public, even while allowing them to partially cash out.
