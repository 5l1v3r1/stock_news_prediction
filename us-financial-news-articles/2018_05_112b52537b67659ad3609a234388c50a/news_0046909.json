Grylls and his wife, Shara Cannings Knight, have three sons.\nAnd Grylls used to do a lot more than just drive the car. \"I used to sleep in the back a lot,\" he says of the period when he first bought the car. \"In fact it was the only place I slept in those days.\"\nWhile serving in the army, Grylls tells CNBC Make It, he would regularly sleep in the back of the cab when he was traveling and away from the army barracks. \"If I was traveling around, that's where I would sleep, in the back, and we'd go off climbing,\" he says. \"I'm not the first person to have slept in the back of a van or car.\n\"That was my home, as well,\" he says. \"I spent loads of nights in it.\"\nshow chapters Pitbull spent his first $1,500 paycheck on a car for his mom 9:00 AM ET Fri, 11 May 2018 | 01:37 So, how did the survival expert make himself comfortable in the back of a cab? \"I used to be able to put the seats down in the back,\" he says. \"You know, the London cabs where they have flip-down seats? And I put a board and a mattress and it was like a double bed in the back of a cab, so it was good.\"\nOf course, over the past couple of decades, Grylls has experienced enough success that he no longer has to worry about sleeping in the back of his car — though, he's certainly slept in weirder places on TV. He's even getting ready to open a 86,000-square-foot, $26 million adventure theme park in the U.K. later this year.\nBut Grylls says he's kept his first car for nostalgic reasons. \"I still have it because it's an old friend, you know,\" he says. \"And it's not worth anything in financial terms, but it's worth a lot to me and our boys love it.\"\nAnd, for what it's worth, Grylls says he hardly ever gets mistaken for an active cab driver anymore. \"We live right out in the middle of nowhere, so luckily it doesn't get flagged down,\" he says of his London black cab. \"But when I used to have it in London, people always were jumping in the back and then realizing, when they saw my stuff everywhere, like 'Oh, sorry!'\"\nDon't Miss:\nWhy John Cena still drives the 1989 Jeep he bought with his first WWE paycheck\n'Deadpool 2' star Ryan Reynolds' first acting job paid $150 and he 'felt like a gazillionaire'\nLike this story?
