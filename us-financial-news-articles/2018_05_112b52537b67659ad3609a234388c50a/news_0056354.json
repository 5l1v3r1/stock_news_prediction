U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for Memorial Day.\nThe risk-off attitude fueled demand for safer asset classes, including U.S. Treasurys. The rate on the U.S. 10-year note fell to 2.77 percent Tuesday, down from highs above 3.1 percent in recent weeks.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.4 percent, weighed down by a 2.6 percent drop in Italy's FTSE MIB and a 2.5 percent decline in Spain's IBEX 35.

Morgan Co-president Daniel Pinto, who revealed Tuesday that trading revenue in the second quarter will probably be flat from a year ago.\n\"Overall, markets revenue as we see it today will be flat year on year,\" Co-president Daniel Pinto said Tuesday during a conference in New York. \"The core activities will be up let's say mid single digits. Then we have a series of one-offs that overall take that back down to flat.\"\nMorgan Stanley, meanwhile, clinched its worst day since June 2016, down 5.75 percent.

That could be \"fiscally dangerous, given how much debt Italy already has.\"\nThe latest developments have spurred previously dormant fears concerning the stability of the eurozone and default risk concerning Italy's €2.3 trillion ($2.68 trillion) in debt.

Yields move inversely to prices.\n\"I think default risk, however, is still extremely low,\" Kelly added. \"Italy could not possibly default on their debt without an entire collapse of their economy.
