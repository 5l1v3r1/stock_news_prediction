The U.S. trade deficit dropped to $49 billion in March as exports hit record high, from a $57.7 billion gap in February.\nAs result, U.S. benchmarket 10-year yields rose slightly to 2.945 percent from 2.943 percent just before the dataâ€™s release.\nU.S. two-year yields were up at 2.480 percent after the data, from 2.476 percent before the number.
