More than 66 percent of voters wanted an end to the ban.\nThe outcome was a historic victory for women's' rights in a traditionally Catholic country. The size of the win exceeded expectations and will make it much easier for Irish women to obtain abortions legally for the first time.\nThe vote removes a 1983 amendment that required Irish authorities to defend the lives of a woman and a fetus equally on almost all abortions", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T12:33:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
