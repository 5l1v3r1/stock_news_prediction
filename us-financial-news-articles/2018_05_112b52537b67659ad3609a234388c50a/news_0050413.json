Twenty-one people sought treatment for exposure to fumes from the blaze.\nThe evacuation ended after officials set fire to the storage trailers to burn up all of the peroxides.\nThe board, which has no enforcement or regulatory authority, recommended Arkema develop plans for flood risks at its plants and put in place multiple, redundant systems for storing chemicals.\nThe CSB also recommended that the American Institute of Chemical Engineers’ Center for Process Safety develop guidelines so plants can evaluate risk from extreme weather.\nThe board said Harris County, Texas, should update training and protective equipment to emergency responders to prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals.\nMany of those exposed to the fumes from the fire were emergency responders.
