Nestle will continue to pay royalties to Starbucks after the initial fee.\n\"For Starbucks, the deal will help to drive brand recognition outside of its core North American and European markets as Nestle ramps up expansion using its distribution capacity,\" Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, told CNBC via email.\nStarbucks has struggled with slow sales in the U.S. for several quarters and relinquishing its retail business to another company allows it to focus more on its cafes.\nIn addition, Nestle has agreed to take on about 500 Starbucks employees who work in the consumer packaged goods segment as part of the deal.\n\"While Nestle's coffee business is immense, its product line didn't really align with the U.S. consumer market and Nestle lacked the star power that Starbucks brings,\" David Henkes, principal at Technomic, told CNBC via email. \"In my mind this is really about giving Nestle a much better foothold in the U.S. coffee market and creating a counterweight to JAB Holdings, which through its acquisition of Keurig/Green Mountain, Mondelez's coffee business and others has come to be the primary coffee source for millions of consumers each day.\"\nJAB Holding, a privately held company and investment arm of the wealthy Reimann family, owns such brands as Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Peet's Coffee & Tea. The company, which has been steadily building a coffee and breakfast empire over the last five years, scooped up Panera Bread for $7.5 billion last year.\nNestle has made plans to focus on higher-growth areas like pet care, infant nutrition and coffee. It sold its U.S. candy business to Italy's Ferrero for about $2.8 billion in January.\n\"Look, we are excited about pet food, too,\" Mark Schneider, CEO of Nestle, told CNBC. \"This is one of the other growth categories we are very much involved in that market. So a lot of interesting things underway there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T17:40:44.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
