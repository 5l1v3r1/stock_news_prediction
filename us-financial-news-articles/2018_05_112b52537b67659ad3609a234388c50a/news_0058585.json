Five Star Movement and Lega\nItaly has been without a government since an inconclusive vote in early March, with the president finally nominating former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister until a snap poll is held sometime between September and spring 2019.\nThe decision to appoint Cottarelli prompted the populist Five Star Movement (M5S) and the right-wing Lega party (League) to switch back into campaign mode.

Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union\nWhen asked whether he shared some sympathy with the core messages of Italy's populist groups, Jennings replied: \"These parties and others are taking some of our analysis but twisting it and distorting it for their political message. We don't like the populist parties because it is a step away from hate, it's a step away from xenophobia (and) it's a step away from some of the fascist tendencies that we see.\"\n\"We feel that democracy in Europe is going through a very difficult phase, if not, a crisis â€¦ Because, at the end of the day, I don't think these (populist) parties have an economics agenda,\" he added.
