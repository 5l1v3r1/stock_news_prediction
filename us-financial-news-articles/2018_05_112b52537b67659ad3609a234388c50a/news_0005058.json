He said that he would trust the legal process to “fairly consider all the facts.”\nRoss said Schedler, who lived in the same residential complex as she did, would observe her movements and comment on them the next day. He also propositioned her at work for a decade in the face of her rejections, and even surveilled a man she was dating.\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, had called on Schedler to resign in February.\n“In light of the additional information that has been disclosed, I believe this is the best course of action for Tom, his family, and the state of Louisiana,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. Local news outlets have published emails obtained from Schedler’s work account in recent days in which he makes sexual overtures to Ross.\nRoss’s lawyer, Jill Craft, said Ross was never in a consensual relationship with Schedler.\n“When we have elected officials who represent us they need to be held to at least the same standard as those in private industry, if not to a higher standard,” Craft said in a telephone interview.\nSchedler’s last day will be May 8, and his replacement will be found through a special election.
