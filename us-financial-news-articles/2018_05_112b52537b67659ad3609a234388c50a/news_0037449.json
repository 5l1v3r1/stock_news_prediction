Mitsui & Co ( 8031.T ) purchased some of the sorghum from that vessel, the source said.\n“The cargo has arrived at Kashima port and also stopped at Mizushima and Shibushi ports to offload some of the supply, with unloading work to be completed this week,” the source said.\nAnother source said the vessel arrived at Kashima late last month.\nOther buyers include Zen-Noh, a Japanese farmers’ cooperative, and a pair of trading companies - Toyota Tsusho Corp ( 8015.T ) and Itochu Corp ( 8001.T ), four sources said.\n“There may be another vessel coming to Japan if Marubeni Corp ( 8002.T ) succeeds in striking a deal with a partner of another country,” one of the sources added.\nOfficials from Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Zen-Noh, Toyota Tsusho, Itochu and Marubeni all declined to comment.\nData from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Thomson Reuters Interactive Map shows the cargo that offloaded at Kashima port in late April left Archer Daniel Midland Co’s Galveston elevator around March 7. Another vessel that arrived at Kashima port on May 16 departed Cargill’s Houston elevator at the end of March.\nTo view a graphic on Japanese grain buyers purchase at least three cargoes of distressed U.S. sorghum shipments, click: reut.rs/2Ky5EoR\nONE-OFF?\nWhile some early offers for the distressed cargoes came in as low as $160-$170 per ton just after China’s announcement, the Japanese buyers paid more than that but “still much lower than the pre-mid-April levels,” another source said.\nTraders said Japanese firms had paid around $230 per ton for sorghum before Beijing announced the deposit.\nJapan’s sorghum imports have been declining since 2012 as cheaper alternatives took a greater share of livestock feed. Sorghum’s blending ratio slid to 2.3 percent in the 2016/17 financial year from 7.7 percent in 2012/13, said Commodity Intelligence, a Japanese commodity market research company.\nIn 2017/18, Japan imported about 365,830 tonnes of grain sorghum, down from 1.46 million tonnes in 2012/13, according to government data.\nJapan’s increased sorghum purchases may mean reduced imports of other commonly used feed grains like corn, barley and wheat or less use of locally-grown feed rice, a source said.\nIn the longer term, a lack of Chinese buyers could put pressure on sorghum prices, increasing its share of the Japanese feed market.\n“Many believe that this is a one-off thing, but if the U.S. producers sell sorghum at cheaper prices than corn, Japanese feedmakers may buy more sorghum and buy less corn or wheat,” the source said.\nReporting by Yuka Obayashi; Editing by Gavin Maguire, Richard Pullin and Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:22:56.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
