As noted below, the increase was primarily due to the Company's anesthesia acquisitions completed mid-year in 2017; however, there were a number of factors which impacted the change in revenue between the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017. The $3.5 million increase in revenue from the prior period is reflective of the following:\ngrowth through acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2018 contributed $7.4 million of the increase when comparing the two periods. This is comprised of growth from acquisitions completed in 2017 ($7.3 million) and growth from acquisitions completed in 2018 ($0.1 million); the impact of the CMS final fee schedule resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $2.0 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017; executing contracts with non-contracted payors, primarily related to entities acquired in 2016, decreased revenue by $1.4 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017; the change in payor mix between federal and commercial decreased revenue by approximately $0.1 million; a negative adjustment as a result of the change in the impact of revenue estimates of $0.7 million, which includes $0.3 million of non-recurring items, when compared to 2017; and revenue growth from our exclusive agreement to develop and manage a monitored anesthesia care program with Puget Sound Gastroenterology of approximately $0.3 million.\nAs adjusted operating expenses are largely fixed in nature, changes in revenue primarily drive changes in operating income and adjusted operating EBITDA.\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2018, the anesthesia services segment serviced 57,657 patient cases compared to 42,363 patient cases during the three months March 31, 2017.\nWe had previously reported that the CMS final rule, implemented effective January 1, 2018, would impact our revenue per case by approximately 12.0%. Actual results to date have shown an impact of approximately 10.5%. In addition, we had reported at year end that the revenue per case we receive from our commercial payors would decrease approximately 5% as we contract with payors for acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018 the Company did not enter into any material contracts with commercial payors. We expect the total impact to revenue from these reductions in the anesthesia revenue per case to be offset through organic growth in patient cases and revenue generated through the deployment of available capital for future acquisitions as we progress through the year.\nRevenues from product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2,556,876 compared to $2,776,315 for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 reflected higher than normal quarterly sales for this segment; hence the decrease when compared to 2018. The Company continues to successfully execute on the Company's direct to physician program that allows physicians to purchase our hemorrhoid banding technology, treatment protocols, marketing and operational experience. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has trained 2,744 physicians to use the O'Regan System, representing 1,054 clinical practices. This compares to 2,490 physicians trained, representing 963 clinical practices, as of March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total adjusted operating expenses were $12,251,814 compared to $10,320,844 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Increases in adjusted operating expenses are primarily related to adjusted operating expenses in the anesthesia services business. Factors impacting the fluctuation of total adjusted operating expenses are consistent with those impacting operating expenses.\nAnesthesia services adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $10,416,049, compared to $8,299,328 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Anesthesia services adjusted operating expenses primarily include labor related costs for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists and MD anesthesiologists, medical drugs and supplies, and billing and management related expenses. The Company's first anesthesia acquisition was in the fourth quarter of 2014, with fifteen further acquisitions completed in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. As a result, the first quarter of 2018 is not directly comparable to 2017, with the majority of the increase relating to operating expenses for acquired companies. Though quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly, quarterly adjusted operating expenses, which are primarily employee related costs, due to their fixed nature, are not expected to fluctuate materially. These expenses are primarily impacted by the Company's acquisition strategy.\nProduct sales adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $1,092,835 compared to $1,036,979 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Though sales have decreased from the first quarter of 2017, costs have not decreased as much of the cost base for the product segment is fixed. Employment and related costs have remained consistent with the first quarter of 2017, with the increase relating to higher product support costs, specifically travel costs relating to marketing and training. Product sales expenses primarily include employee wages, product cost and support, marketing programs, office expenses, professional fees, and insurance. In the future, the Company expects adjusted operating expenses to increase as the Company continues to invest in activities aimed at increasing demand for training and use of the CRH O'Regan System.\nCorporate adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $742,930 compared to $984,537 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in corporate adjusted operating expense is a reflection of lower professional fees, employee related costs, and travel expenses when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The reduction in professional fees reflects decreased corporate activity in 2018; similarly travel expenses reflect the same. The decrease in employee related costs is reflective of the additional employer payroll liabilities incurred in 2017 as a result of the vesting of restricted share units.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA attributable to shareholders of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $8,231,336, an increase of $512,030 from the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA attributable to shareholders is primarily a reflection of the contributions from acquisitions completed in 2017, offset by the impacts of the CMS final rule, and the impact of moving from non-contracted to in contract status for commercial payors.\nAdjusted operating EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest was $4,182,351 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This comprises the non-controlling interests' share of revenues of $6,942,480 and adjusted operating expenses of $2,760,129.\nTotal adjusted operating EBITDA was $12,413,687 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $1,365,879 from the same period in 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $4,832,332 in cash and cash equivalents compared to $12,486,884 at the end of 2017. The decrease in cash and equivalents is primarily a reflection of cash generated from operations, less cash used to finance normal course issuer bid repurchases, the Shreveport Sedation Associates acquisition and debt repayments during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nWorking capital was $11,409,331 compared to working capital of $20,102,948 at December 31, 2017. The Company expects to meet its short-term obligations, including short-term obligations in respect of its notes payable and deferred consideration through cash earned through operating activities. The average number of days receivables outstanding at March 31, 2018 was 51 days. At December 31, 2017, the average number of days receivables outstanding was 42 days. Traditionally, the receipt of payments is slower in the first quarter of the year as patients have not met insurance deductibles. Also impacting the days receivable outstanding as of March 31, 2018 is the implementation of the new CMS billing codes which resulted in delays in the processing of payments by payors.\nConference Call\nCRH will host a conference call to discuss its results on May 1, 2018, at 11:00 am EST (08:00 am PST).

These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. When used, these measures are defined in such terms as to allow the reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure. These measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses of the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS measures such as operating expenses – adjusted and operating EBITDA to provide investors with a supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management also believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets, and to assess its ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditure, and working capital requirements.\nThe non-IFRS measures are reconciled to reported IFRS figures in the tables below:\nAdjusted operating EBITDA\nFor the three months ended\n2018\n2017\n2016\n(USD in thousands)\nMar\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nAdjusted operating EBITDA attributable\nto:\nShareholders of the Company\n8,231\n11,489\n7,775\n7,352\n7,719\n10,281\n9,122\n7,054\n5,914\nNon-controlling interest\n4,182\n5,473\n3,119\n2,878\n3,328\n4,219\n2,533\n1,518\n848\nTotal adjusted operating EBITDA\n12,414\n16,963\n10,894\n10,230\n11,047\n14,500\n11,655\n8,572\n6,762\nAmortization expense\n(6,994)\n(7,169)\n(5,897)\n(5,603)\n(5,059)\n(4,715)\n(4,711)\n(2,925)\n(2,475)\nDepreciation and related expense\n(23)\n(25)\n(22)\n(20)\n(13)\n(30)\n(31)\n(30)\n(15)\nStock based compensation\n(828)\n(799)\n(968)\n(781)\n(906)\n(525)\n(297)\n(290)\n(264)\nAcquisition expenses\n(109)\n(97)\n(355)\n(88)\n(127)\n(58)\n(21)\n(286)\n(62)\nImpairment of inventory\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nImpairment of intangible assets\n-\n(6,653)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOperating income\n4,460\n2,219\n3,652\n3,738\n4,946\n9,172\n6,595\n5,041\n3,946\nNet finance income (expense)\n(585)\n9,834\n400\n(3,571)\n(1,246)\n(1,175)\n(1,381)\n(2,156)\n289\nIncome tax (expense) recovery\n(694)\n(5,755)\n(604)\n453\n(397)\n(1,643)\n(188)\n(1,219)\n(1,205)\nNet and comprehensive income\n3,182\n6,298\n3,448\n620\n3,302\n6,354\n5,026\n1,666\n3,030\nAdjusted operating expenses (1)\nFor the three months ended\n2018\n2017\n2016\n(USD in thousands)\nMar\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nDec\nSep\nJun\nMar\nAnesthesia services - adjusted\noperating expense\n10,416\n11,411\n9,177\n8,712\n8,299\n8,121\n7,666\n5,378\n4,670\nAmortization expense\n6,993\n7,169\n5,897\n5,603\n5,056\n4,715\n4,711\n2,925\n2,475\nDepreciation and related expense\n1\n3\n2\n3\n2\n1\n3\n2\n2\nStock based compensation\n123\n71\n100\n106\n149\n120\n38\n27\n17\nAcquisition expenses\n109\n97\n356\n87\n127\n58\n21\n286\n62\nImpairment of intangible assets\n-\n6,653\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAnesthesia services expense\n17,642\n25,404\n15,532\n14,511\n13,633\n13,014\n12,439\n8,618\n7,226\nProduct sales - adjusted operating\nexpense\n1,093\n1,295\n1,094\n1,142\n1,037\n1,083\n974\n1,004\n998\nAmortization expense\n1\n1\n1\n1\n5\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDepreciation and related expense\n16\n16\n14\n12\n8\n15\n15\n15\n1\nStock based compensation\n107\n95\n90\n76\n110\n125\n90\n99\n84\nImpairment of inventory\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nProduct sales expense\n1,217\n1,408\n1,199\n1,231\n1,160\n1,223\n1,079\n1,118\n1,083\nCorporate - adjusted operating\nexpenses\n743\n882\n994\n844\n985\n746\n684\n853\n754\nAmortization expense\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(4)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDepreciation and related expense\n5\n6\n6\n5\n3\n14\n14\n13\n13\nStock based compensation\n599\n633\n777\n599\n647\n280\n169\n164\n162\nCorporate expense\n1,347\n1,521\n1,776\n1,448\n1,630\n1,040\n867\n1,030\n929\nTotal adjusted operating expense\n12,252\n13,588\n11,265\n10,698\n10,321\n9,950\n9,325\n7,235\n6,422\nTotal operating expense\n20,205\n28,332\n18,507\n17,190\n16,423\n15,278\n14,386\n10,766\n9,238\n(1)\nFiscal years 2017 and 2016 are restated for the adoption of IFRS 15, effective January 1, 2018.

we are dependent on complex information systems; we may be subject to criminal or civil sanctions if we fail to comply with privacy regulations regarding the protection, use and disclosure of patient information; we have a legal responsibility to the minority owners of the entities through which we own our anesthesia services business, which may conflict with our interests and prevent us from acting solely in our own best interests; a significant number of our affiliated physicians could leave our affiliated Ambulatory Surgical Centers; if regulations or regulatory interpretations change, we may be obligated to re-negotiate agreements of our anesthesiologists or other contractors; the continuing development of our products and provision of our services depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with physicians; we operate in an industry that is subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations; unfavorable changes or conditions could occur in the states where our operations are concentrated; government authorities or other parties may assert that our business practices violate antitrust laws;
