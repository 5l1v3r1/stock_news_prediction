Blank as President of the Maryland-based homebuilding brand. Blank brings a unique perspective on the company’s operations at both a divisional and corporate level, most recently serving as Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary at TRI Pointe Group. Blank played a strategic role in the company’s fast-paced growth following the 2014 Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company merger, which brought Winchester Homes and four other homebuilding brands into TRI Pointe’s family of homebuilders.\nIn his new role, Blank will focus on innovation with particular emphasis on enhanced design and the adoption of new technology\n“Brad’s intimate knowledge and firsthand experience of TRI Pointe Group’s strategies at a national and regional level, coupled with his understanding of both operational goals and corporate culture, make him perfectly suited to step into this leadership role at Winchester Homes,” said TRI Pointe Group CEO Doug Bauer.\n“I’m thrilled to be joining the Winchester team and look forward to accelerating the company’s performance and growth in the coming years,” said Blank. “Buyer sentiment is improving in the region and I’m encouraged by the trends we’re seeing at Winchester’s communities.”\nDemand in the Maryland and Northern Virginia markets continues to grow. Single-family home permits have increased to 14,499, up 9% from 13,270 one year ago 1 , demonstrating the increased production schedule of regional builders.\nDuring this period of regional growth, Blank will focus on innovation with particular emphasis on enhanced design and the adoption of new technology, and continue the company’s culture of valuing existing business and community relationships. Blank aims to grow the company’s market segments, including the expansion of its 55+ community offerings, which currently includes the actively selling Bungalows at Two Rivers and Vistas at Lansdowne communities, and the Birchwood at Brambleton community coming soon.\nUnder Blank’s direction, these new offerings will enhance the reputation Winchester Homes has earned designing, developing, and building high-quality master planned and infill communities in the Maryland and Northern Virginia markets.\n1 John Burns Real Estate Consulting, Metro Analysis and Forecast 2018\nAbout Winchester® Homes\nFor 35 years, Winchester Homes, Inc. has successfully provided homebuyers with the “Your Home, Your Way®” homebuilding experience.
