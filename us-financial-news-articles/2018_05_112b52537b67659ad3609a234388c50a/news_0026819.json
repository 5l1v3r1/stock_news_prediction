It’s essential that we provide services that will tempt people out of their cars,” chief executive David Brown said in a statement.\nGo-Ahead Group provides nearly a quarter of London’s regular buses.\nTransport companies and carmakers are launching new services as modern competitors from Alphabet’s Google to Uber shake up the traditional automotive industry and firms seek to appeal to young urbanites who have increasingly shunned vehicle ownership.\nEarlier this year, London approved plans by Ford to operate its Chariot minibus service.
