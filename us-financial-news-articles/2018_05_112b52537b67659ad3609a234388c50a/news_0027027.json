(Nasdaq:RCMT), a premier provider of business and technology solutions designed to enhance and maximize the operational performance of its customers through the adaptation and deployment of advanced engineering, specialty health care and information technology services, today announced financial results for the thirteen week period ended March 31, 2018.\nRCM Technologies reported revenues of $50.8 million for the thirteen week period ended March 31, 2018, a 9.6% increase as compared to $46.3 million for the thirteen week period ended April 1, 2017 (the comparable prior year period). Gross profit was $12.6 million for the thirteen week period ended March 31, 2018, a 6.8% increase as compared to $11.8 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company experienced operating income of $1.7 million in the current quarter, a 65.7% increase as compared to $1.0 million for the comparable prior year period. Net income was $1.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the current quarter, a 91.1% increase as compared to net income of $0.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year period.\nRocco Campanelli, President and Chief Executive Officer of RCM Technologies, commented, “We are very pleased with our results in the first quarter of 2018 as revenue, gross profit and operating income grew by approximately 10%, 7% and 66%, respectively, as compared to first quarter 2017. Our Specialty Health Care segment again set a new record for quarterly revenues, growing by 22% over first quarter 2017, primarily from growth in our school contracts. Our first quarter Engineering segment revenues grew by 11% as compared to first quarter 2017. We are very excited about or progress integrating our Serbian engineering office. We upgraded the management and sales team for our Information Technology segment and expect positive results in the near term. We continue to believe that fiscal 2018 will be a strong year for RCM.”\nKevin Miller, Chief Financial Officer of RCM Technologies, added, “Our first quarter growth in gross profit and operating income really illustrates the potential operating leverage at RCM. We expect to improve these results in the second quarter and beyond. However, we did experience several discrete but fixable issues in collecting our accounts receivables. We expect our ratio of accounts receivables to quarterly revenues in the second quarter to rebound to levels we experienced in fiscal 2017 and to continue to improve throughout fiscal 2018.”\nConference Call\nOn Thursday, May 10, 2018, RCM Technologies will host a conference call to discuss these results. The call will begin at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
