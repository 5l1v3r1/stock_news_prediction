That could potentially allow it to match people more effectively than rival sites with less data at their fingertips. But privacy concerns surrounding the technology behemoth could discourage some from embracing such a service, some analysts said.\nDaniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company, also cited the difficulty of creating a popular dating site, cautioning that it was not an overnight project and one that requires much more than sheer machine learning.\n“I think the reaction is a combination of the Facebook news along with concerns that Match was getting toppy,” or expensive, Kurnos told Reuters. “I can’t see Facebook supplanting Match any time soon – too big a moat.”\nFacebook connects friends and acquaintances but until now, has not delved into the domain of match-making, where a host of competitors offer services, from privately held eHarmony to IAC-owned OkCupid and PlentyOfFish.\nOne problem for Tinder is that their users can log in to their accounts using Facebook.\nThat has been one way Tinder has assured that their users are real people, noted Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi.\n“When you’re a Facebook user, and over time you became aware of a comparable service, then it’s less likely that you will go on to Tinder,” Mogharabi noted.\nOn the other hand, the lower average age of Tinder users could be a competitive advantage for the Match company, he added.\nData from research firm eMarketer shows that approximately 27 percent of smartphone users are single, a number expected to grow to 35 percent in the next five years.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Writing by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T16:10:32.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
