Net Product Sales: There were net product sales of $6.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in the period was due to continued growth in SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO sales. ARYMO ER was launched at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Due to the adoption of the ASC 606, net product sales in quarter ended March 31, 2018 reflect shipments to customers compared to net product sales for the same period in 2017, which reflected prescriptions dispensed to patients. Cost of Sales (excluding product rights amortization) : Cost of sales was $2.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and $1.3 million for the same period in 2017. Cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 reflected the average cost of inventory shipped to customers and charges related to the minimum manufacturing requirements for ARYMO ER. Cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 reflected the average cost of inventory produced and dispensed to patients and included a write down of SPRIX Nasal Spray inventory. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $7.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $8.5 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in the period was driven primarily by decreased salary and stock-based compensation expense and decreased legal fees. S&M Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses were $9.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $9.3 million for the same period in 2017. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $1.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $6.5 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease in the period was driven primarily by decreased costs for the development of Egalet-002, ARYMO ER and OXAYDO. Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability and Derivative Liability: Change in fair value of warrant liability and derivative liability was $5.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $12,000 for the same period in 2017. The change in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability of $3.2 million, associated with the July 2017 equity and warrant issuance, and a decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the 6.50% convertible notes of $1.5 million. Interest Expense: Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $3.6 million compared to interest expense of $4.5 million for the same period in 2017. Interest expense in the first quarter 2018 included non-cash interest of $450,000 compared to $1.7 million in the same period in 2017. Net Loss: Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was ($12.4 million), or ($0.26) per share, compared to a net loss of ($25.4 million), or ($1.02) per share for the same period in 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nEgalet's management will host a conference call to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results today:\nDate:\nTuesday, May 8, 2018\nTime:\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nWebcast (live and archive):\negalet.com (Events & Webcasts, Investor page)\nDial-in numbers:\n1-888-346-2615 (domestic)\n1-412-902-4253 (international)\nReplay numbers:\n1-877-344-7529 (domestic)\n1-412-317-0088 (international)\nConference number:\n10117571\nAbout Egalet\nEgalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Egalet has three approved products: ARYMO ® ER (morphine sulfate) extended-release tablets for oral use —CII, developed using Egalet's proprietary Guardian™ Technology, OXAYDO ® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only —CII and SPRIX ® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. Using Guardian Technology, Egalet is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, product candidates for which we are seeking partners including Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles.\nFor full prescribing information on ARYMO ER, including the boxed warning and medication guide, please visit arymoer.com .
