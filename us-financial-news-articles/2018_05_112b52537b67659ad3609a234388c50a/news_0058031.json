Portuguese news agency Lusa, quoting national broadcaster TVM, said two children were among those beheaded but this could not be independently verified.\nPalma district administrator David Machimbuko told the station that authorities had moved security teams to areas where further attacks were feared. Police spokesman Inacio Dina said officers were gathering information from a team dispatched to the north.\nLocal media have reported a series of attacks carried out by Islamists since October last year, when police stations were attacked in the north, a predominantly Muslim region.\nMozambique has not been a focal point of Islamist militant activity in the past and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists.\nMuslims make up about 18 percent of Mozambique’s population. Roman Catholics form the largest single religious grouping, with about 30 percent of its 30 million people.\nThe gas project is located in the Rovuma basin off the northern coast of Mozambique, an area where oil firms are exploring. Experts say the reserves are enough to supply energy to Britain, France, Germany and Italy for over 20 years.\nReporting by Manuel Mucari, Writing by James Macharia, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:28:31.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
