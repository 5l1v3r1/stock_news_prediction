(NYSE American:URG TSX:URE) (\"Ur-Energy\" or the \"Company\") has filed the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml and with Canadian securities authorities on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nChairman of Ur-Energy, Jeff Klenda said, \"Delivering purchased pounds into our 2018 term contracts has permitted us to grow our inventory while also having strong cash flow. In the first quarter, we purchased 370,000 pounds at an average cost of $25.00 per pound, which allowed us to increase our ending inventory by 74,000 pounds and led to gross profits $9.9 million, or gross profit margins of approximately 50%. Our strategy has allowed us to retain our most experienced operators, build inventory, and preserve our resources. In what we are convinced is a changing uranium market, this will position us to be able to quickly ramp up production to respond to improved market conditions at a time where operational and production leverage will have primary importance.\nLost Creek Uranium Production and Sales\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, a total of 84,047 pounds of U 3 O 8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant. 79,961 pounds were packaged in drums and 73,515 pounds of the drummed inventory were shipped to the conversion facility. We sold 380,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 during the period of which 370,000 pounds were purchased.

The expenses are calculated on a straight line basis so the expenses are typically constant for each quarter.

We made one spot sale during the quarter for 10,000 pounds at $23.75 to establish our taxation basis for calculating severance and ad valorem taxes. The 370,000 pounds sold under term contracts were purchased for an average price of $25.00 per pound. For the quarter, our cost of sales totaled $9.8 million at an average cost of $25.68 per pound.\nOn a cash basis, the average cost per pound sold was $25.16, which yielded average cash margins of $26.58 per pound and generated cash gross profits of $10.1 million during the quarter. The average cash cost per pound sold was composed of produced and purchased pounds. The cash cost per produced pound sold was $31.20 and the cash cost per purchased pound sold was $25.00. Total gross profit was $9.9 million, or a gross profit margin of approximately 50%.\nTotal Cost Per Pound Sold\nReconciliation\nUnit\n2018 Q1\n2017 Q4\n2017 Q3\n2017 Q2\nAd valorem & severance taxes\n$000\n$\n179\n$\n160\n$\n119\n$\n227\nWellfield costs\n$000\n$\n1,074\n$\n1,260\n$\n1,473\n$\n1,379\nPlant and site costs\n$000\n$\n1,718\n$\n1,703\n$\n1,614\n$\n1,761\nDistribution costs\n$000\n$\n19\n$\n48\n$\n24\n$\n26\nInventory change\n$000\n$\n(2,483)\n$\n(2,795)\n$\n5,731\n$\n(1,690)\nCost of sales - produced\n$000\n$\n507\n$\n376\n$\n8,961\n$\n1,703\nCost of sales - purchased\n$000\n$\n9,251\n$\nâ€”\n$\n2,196\n$\n4,870\nTotal cost of sales\n$000\n$\n9,758\n$\n376\n$\n11,157\n$\n6,573\nPounds sold produced\nlb\n10,000\n-\n180,000\n31,000\nPounds sold purchased\nlb\n370,000\n-\n109,000\n210,000\nTotal pounds sold\nlb\n380,000\n-\n289,000\n241,000\nAverage cost per pound sold - produced (1)\n$/lb\n$\n50.70\n$\n-\n$\n49.78\n$\n54.93\nAverage cost per pound sold - purchased\n$/lb\n$\n25.00\n$\n-\n$\n20.15\n$\n23.19\nTotal average cost per pound sold\n$/lb\n$\n25.68\n$\n-\n$\n38.61\n$\n27.27\n1\nThe cost per pound sold reflects both cash and non-cash costs, which are combined as cost of sales in the statement of operations included in this filing. The cash and non-cash cost components are identified in the above inventory, production and sales table.\nThe cost of sales includes ad valorem and severance taxes related to the extraction of uranium, all costs of wellfield, plant and site operations including the related depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, reclamation and mineral property costs, plus product distribution costs. These costs are also used to value inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to cost of sales.\nContinuing Guidance for 2018\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2018, the average spot price of U 3 O 8 , as reported by Ux Consulting Company, LLC and TradeTech, LLC, was approximately $21.05 per pound. Market fundamentals have not changed sufficiently to warrant the accelerated development of MU2. We anticipate completing the third planned header house in MU2 in early May 2018, which will allow us to meet our projected production level of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds drummed for the year.\nThrough March 31, 2018, we sold 370,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 under term contracts at an average price of approximately $52.50 per pound and 10,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 under a spot sale for $23.75 per pound. We purchased 370,000 pounds at an average cost of $25.00 per pound. The remaining 10,000 pounds were delivered from our produced inventory. We have one final term contract sale for 100,000 pounds at $37.90 scheduled to take place in early June 2018 for which we have a U 3 O 8 purchase contract for 90,000 pounds at $22.25 per pound.\nWe expect to bring the third MU2 header house on line in Q2 2018 and the production target for that same period is between 85,000 and 95,000 pounds U 3 O 8 dried and drummed. Full year 2018 guidance, similar to 2017, estimates production of between 250,000 and 300,000 pounds, but our production rate may be adjusted based on operational matters and other indicators in the market.\nAs at May 2, 2018, our unrestricted cash position was $6.3 million.\nAbout Ur-Energy\nUr-Energy is a uranium mining company operating the Lost Creek in-situ recovery uranium facility in south-central Wyoming.
