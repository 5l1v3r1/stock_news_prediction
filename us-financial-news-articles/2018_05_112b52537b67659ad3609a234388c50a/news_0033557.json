REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files Non-oil domestic exports were expected to have risen 5.4 percent in April from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in the survey of 10 economists.\nThe upturn was seen likely to come from exports of the city-state’s tech products.\n“Tech demand is the main driver of Singapore’s export\nperformance,” Moody’s said in a research note to clients, warning of the “downside risk” from a U.S.-China trade dispute affecting Singapore’s export outlook.\n“Singapore is at the whim of global demand,” Moody’s said.\nBooming demand has benefited Singapore and other trade-dependent Asian economies in the past year, particularly makers of electronics products and components such as semiconductors, but growth has started to moderate this year.\nOn a seasonally adjusted basis, non-oil domestic exports were seen down 0.2 percent from March, the poll found, which would be the third consecutive monthly decline.\nIn March Singapore’s exports fell both year-on-year and month-on-month, by 2.7 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.\nA ship docks at PSA's Tanjong Pagar container port in Singapore April 18, 2016.
