These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company's results of operations are impacted by certain non-recurring charges, including equity based compensation, acquisition related expenditures, and other non-recurring charges that may not be indicative of the Company’s financial performance. Management believes that adjusting its operating expenses, operating income, net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove non-recurring charges provides a useful perspective with respect to our operating results and provides supplemental information to both management and investors by removing items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated. PAR believes the adjustments provide a useful comparison.\nDuring , the Company recorded $297,000 of expenses related to the Company’s previously disclosed internal investigation into conduct at its China and Singapore offices.
