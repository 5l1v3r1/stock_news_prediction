Christian Villanueva then hit a fly deep toward the right field corner. After a long run, Bryce Harper had the ball hit off his glove, allowing Hosmer and Cordero to score.\nAt first, the play was ruled a double, then changed to an error on Harper, then eventually changed back to a double.\nMatt Adams homered off Ross leading off the bottom of the seventh for the Nationals’ lone run. Adams finished with three hits.\nRoss (4-3) allowed five hits and a walk while striking out nine (tying for his second-highest total in 2018). He lowered his earned run average to 3.13. Before Adams’ homer, Ross had retired eight consecutive batters.\nLeft-hander Brad Hand entered the game with one out in the eighth to face left-handers Juan Soto and Harper and recorded his first five-out save of the season, his 15th of the season overall.\nIn the ninth, Hand gave up a leadoff double to Anthony Rendon and a single to pinch hitter Mark Reynolds. Hand then struck out Michael Taylor and got catcher Spencer Kieboom to ground into a game-ending, around-the-horn double play.\nFedde (0-1), the Nationals’ first-round pick in the 2014 draft, gave up three runs on five hits and a walk with six strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:21:43.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
