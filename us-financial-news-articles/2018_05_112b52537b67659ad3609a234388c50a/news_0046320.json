Farley will be the SPAC’s chief executive officer, president and chairman of the board. Reuters first reported Third Point’s plans earlier this month. Far Point plans to make a purchase within 24 months.\nBut the SPAC is also bracing for competition from private investors and other blank check companies for attractive targets and is not required to put the money to work.\nA SPAC uses proceeds from its initial public offering, together with borrowed funds, to acquire companies that are usually privately held. Investors in the IPO do not know in advance which company a SPAC will buy.\nThird Point’s decision to create a SPAC is a low-risk way to add to its revenue stream, which has been largely generated by large, long-term activist campaigns including bets on Sotheby’s ( BID.N ) Dow Chemical Co and Nestle SA ( NESN.S ) over the last years.\nThird Point is in the black for 2018 and has long generated some of the hedge fund industry’s highest returns, delivering an average 18.5 percent return per year over its lifetime.\nThe firm’s activist plays at large publicly traded companies can be time-consuming and difficult. But buying a privately held company might make for a simpler way to create strong returns.\nDavid Bonanno, who has worked for Third Point since 2008, will become the SPAC’s chief financial officer and will spend time researching potential targets.\nRetired U.S. Army general Stanley McChrystal, attorney and board director Nicole Seligman and former chief financial officer at home sharing company Airbnb Laurence Tosi will become board members at the SPAC.\nBefore sponsoring its own SPAC, Third Point invested in Nomad Foods Limited, a SPAC launched by consumer industry veterans Martin Franklin and Noam Gottesman in 2014. Hedge funds are often eager to invest in SPACs.\nReporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Joshua Franklin; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T20:10:35.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
