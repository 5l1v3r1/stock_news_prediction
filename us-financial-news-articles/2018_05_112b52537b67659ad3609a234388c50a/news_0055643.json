An additional two rate hikes this year, including one in June, are widely expected.\nStronger demand for U.S. bonds may help the Treasury sell $30 billion in seven-year notes on Thursday, the final sale of $99 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week.\nDealers have taken a larger-than-usual share for the two previous auctions, showing that the market is struggling to absorb larger auction sizes.\nThursday’s seven-year sale is $2 billion larger than the size of the auction in January and $1 billion larger than last month.\nReporting by Karen Brettell; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:21:28.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
