While Unitrends MSP will continue to design and deliver product variants that are customized to the need of MSPs.\nUnitrends will continue to operate out of its Burlington, Mass. headquarters with plans to invest and expand its workforce. Kaseya and Unitrends will continue to operate under their respective brands, and both companies remain a part of the Insight Venture Partners portfolio.\n“The decision to merge with Unitrends was a no-brainer for us,” said Fred Voccola, CEO, Kaseya. “Over a year ago, we embarked on a journey to provide our customers with the best BCDR solution for their needs. After working with Unitrends to launch the Kaseya Unified Backup offering to our MSP customers, as well as introducing the core Unitrends product to our enterprise customer base, we witnessed the explosive adoption of these solutions and decided that it just made sense to further our relationship and to bring our two companies together.\n“The powerful combination of our IT Complete platform with Unitrends’ industry leading BCDR solutions means we can now bring unparalleled innovation to market and set the bar even higher for the value and service we deliver to our customers and partners worldwide. Without a doubt, we believe Unitrends is the market leader in BCDR. Its technology leadership successfully spans both enterprise backup and DRaaS with the industry recognition to prove it. Unitrends is one of only two vendors recognized in both the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Center Backup and Recovery and Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service. With its technologies, we will open up new markets for our MSPs to meet the increasingly complex requirements of larger customers and deliver enterprise-class disaster recovery as-a-service.”\n“We’re excited to share this news with our customers and partners,” said Paul Brady, CEO, Unitrends. “The scale of our combined company brings additional resources and talent that we can apply to our award-winning technology. The pairing of Kaseya and Unitrends means an expanded market for Unitrends into the MSP landscape and the further expansion of the Kaseya IT Complete Platform into the Unitrends enterprise customer market allowing our customers to further strengthen their IT infrastructure.\n“Our customers remain at the heart of Unitrends, and we’re proud to have earned their trust with a 98 percent customer satisfaction rating. The combined commitment of Kaseya and Unitrends to those customers and to our channel partners remains unwavering as we move into this next, exciting phase of Unitrends as part of the Kaseya family.”\nAbout Kaseya\nKaseya is the leading provider of complete IT management solutions for managed service providers (MSPs) and midsized enterprises.
