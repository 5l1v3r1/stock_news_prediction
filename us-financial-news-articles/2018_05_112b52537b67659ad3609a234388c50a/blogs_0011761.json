Claims dropped to 209,000 in the prior week, which was the lowest level since December 1969.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 225,000 in the latest week. The labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, close to the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.\nThe U.S. central bank on Wednesday left interest rates unchanged. The Fed said policymakers expected \"economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.\"\nThe Labor Department said claims for Maine and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year.\nThe four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,750 to 221,500 last week, the lowest level since March 1973.\nWhile the claims report has no bearing on April's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, filings for jobless benefits declined during the month. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 192,000 jobs in April after rising 103,000 in March.\nThe claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 77,000 to 1.76 million in the week ended April 21, the lowest level since December 1973. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 15,500 to 1.83 million, also the lowest level since December 1973.
