We’ve got to do our work and if we do that well, the other teams will have to worry about Argentina.”\nHaving had to adapt to three different coaches since they reached the 2014 World Cup final, which they lost 1-0 after extra time to Germany, Argentina were in danger of a faux pas as they sought to settle into Sampaoli’s all-out attacking tactics.\n“When you get a match like Spain, lots of things are put in doubt but if we trust in the class of players we have, the coach’s ideas will show clearly,” said Romero, who was injured conceding Spain’s opening goal and made way for Willy Caballero.\n“Things didn’t go as we expected from the start and going home with a 6-1 defeat was not at all nice but we know it’s good this happened in a friendly which is when you try out tactics and players, something you have to do with a World Cup close.\n“A kid playing (for a club) in Argentina that you want to see how he responds in an international match could turn out to be excellent and you find a fundamental piece (for the team).” Reporting by Rex Gowar; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:47:43.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
