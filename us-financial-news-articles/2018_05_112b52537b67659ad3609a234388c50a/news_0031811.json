The Federation did not say exactly how the goal would be achieved, nor did it give costs.\nSome countries such as Germany impose high deposits on bottles to encourage recycling. Britain plans this year to introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use drink containers.\nThe Federation also said it would work with the recycling industry “to use at least 25 percent recycled PET in its water bottles by 2025, as an EU average”. It says that the average EU citizen drinks about 110 liters of bottled water a year.
