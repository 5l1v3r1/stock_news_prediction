Per share information reflects the Company's 1-for-4 reverse split effective April 6, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights vs. Year-Ago Quarter:\nNet revenue increased 185% to $40.9 million; Gross margin more than doubled to 36.8% versus 15.4%; Net income up significantly to $2.0 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a net loss of $9.9 million, or $(0.81) per share; Adjusted EBITDA increased $11.4 million to $5.3 million versus $(6.2) million; and Net revenue, gross margin, net income and adjusted EBITDA were the highest levels for any first quarter since becoming public in 2014.\n\"As indicated in our pre-announcement, we delivered substantial growth in our first quarter, both relative to last year and our prior outlook,\" said Juergen Stark, CEO, Turtle Beach. \"This growth was due to market share gains on top of a very strong overall market, propelled by the successes of Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, as these games have driven new gamers into the market and much higher headset attach rates than we have historically experienced.\n\"The strong market, and our significant outperformance, can be seen in NPD's latest North American console headset update. Year-to-date through March 2018, we grew our revenue share 720 basis points to 45.9% from 38.7% in the same period in 2017. In addition, while the market was up 77.6% on a sell-through basis during the same time, Turtle Beach was up 110.3%. In fact, this 110% revenue growth was nearly double the 57% growth experienced by the rest of the market as our strong brand and quality products had us well positioned to leverage the opportunity.\n\"We expect the momentum from this strong market to continue and have raised our 2018 financial outlook accordingly. In addition, we were pleased to have facilitated a set of transactions in late April to retire the Series B Preferred Stock at a discount of more than 50% relative to its redemption value. This was a nearly $20 million liability growing at 8% per year. On top of the March amendments to our term loan, revolver, and subordinated notes, this represents another substantial balance sheet improvement and is expected to result in a material reduction in non-cash interest expense going forward. Given these positive developments, we believe 2018 is off to a very strong start and better positions us to make selective growth investments and further reduce our debt over time.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenue in the first quarter of 2018 increased 185% to a record $40.9 million compared to $14.4 million in the year-ago quarter. This was due to the Company's increase in market share on top of higher volumes driven by high-performing game releases fueling stronger consumer demand.\nGross margin in the first quarter of 2018 more than doubled to a record 36.8% compared to 15.4% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to a less promotional environment as compared to the prior-year period and higher volumes driving fixed-cost leverage.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 increased 9% to $11.2 million compared to $10.3 million in the 2017 period due primarily to an increase in revenue-related sales costs and an increase in marketing costs relative to last year.\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 increased significantly to a record $2.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $9.9 million, or $(0.81) per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was driven by the significant revenue and gross margin growth.\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") in the first quarter of 2018 increased $11.4 million to a record $5.3 million compared to $(6.2) million in the year-ago quarter.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $4.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $3.6 million one year ago. As a result of its borrowings under a $60 million revolving credit facility, Turtle Beach generally does not maintain a large cash balance.\nTotal outstanding debt principal at March 31, 2018, was $34.5 million compared to $34.4 million at March 31, 2017. The debt at March 31, 2018, consisted of $22.6 million in subordinated debt, $9.2 million in term loans, and $2.6 million of revolving debt. The Company's senior debt leverage ratio, defined as total term loans outstanding and average trailing twelve-month revolving debt, divided by consolidated trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA, improved significantly to 1.0x at March 31, 2018, compared to 2.1x at December 31, 2017, and 6.8x a year ago.\nIncreased 2018 Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, Turtle Beach expects net revenue to increase 151% to approximately $48 million compared to $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net loss is expected to improve to approximately $(0.05) per share compared to a net loss of $(0.57) per share in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to improve to approximately $2.5 million compared to $(2.8) million in the second quarter of 2017. Other than the aforementioned reduction in non-cash interest expense, the second quarter 2018 earnings per share estimate excludes any other effects of the accounting treatment for the retirement of the Series B Preferred Stock, which the Company does not expect to have an adverse effect on net income or adjusted EBITDA.\nFor the full year 2018, Turtle Beach now expects net revenue to increase 37% to approximately $205 million (up from $157 million in its March outlook) compared to $149.1 million in 2017. The Company is approaching its full year outlook estimating second half sell-through will be roughly in-line with last year, which the Company expects is appropriately conservative as it continues to track the year-to-date sell through increases and refines its view of the expected longer-term impact. Net income in 2018 is now expected to improve to approximately $0.95 per share (up from a net loss of $(0.12) per share in its March outlook) based upon 14.2 million estimated fully diluted shares outstanding. This is compared to a net loss of $(0.26) per share in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 is now expected to more than double to approximately $26 million (up from $12 million in its March outlook) and includes several million dollars of expected investments intended to drive future growth. This compares to $11.6 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2017. Other than the aforementioned reduction in non-cash interest expense, the full year 2018 earnings per share estimate excludes any other effects of the accounting treatment of the retirement of the Series B Preferred Stock in the second quarter of 2018, which the Company does not expect to have an adverse effect on net income or adjusted EBITDA.\nA table summarizing this outlook has been provided at the end of this release.\nWith respect to the Company's adjusted EBITDA outlook for the second quarter and full year 2018, a reconciliation to its net loss outlook for the same periods has not been provided because of the variability, complexity, and lack of visibility with respect to certain reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and net loss, including other income (expense), provision for income taxes and stock-based compensation. These items cannot be reasonably and accurately predicted without the investment of undue time, cost and other resources and, accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company's adjusted EBITDA outlook to its net loss outlook for such periods is not available without unreasonable effort. These reconciling items could be material to the Company's actual results for such periods.\nConference Call Details\nTurtle Beach Corporation will hold a conference call today, May 9, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern) to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.\nCEO Juergen Stark and CFO John Hanson will host the call, followed by a question and answer session.\nConference Call Details:\nDate: Wednesday, May 9, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT\nToll-Free Dial-in Number: (877) 303-9855\nInternational Dial-in Number: (408) 337-0154\nConference ID: 9889426\nFor the conference call, please dial-in 5-10 minutes prior to the start time and an operator will register your name and organization.

See a reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted EBITDA included below for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nAbout Turtle Beach Corporation\nTurtle Beach ( www.turtlebeach.com ) has been revolutionizing console multiplayer gaming since the very beginning with its wide selection of industry leading, award-winning gaming headsets.
