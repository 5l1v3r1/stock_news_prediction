The source said Renova was discussing obtaining a stake in Gazprom Energoholding, which would be small and not big enough to allow it to influence decision making at the Gazprom unit.\nA fourth source said Renova had made an offer to Gazprom to buy out T Plus, but Gazprom was not “greatly interested in the deal”.\nOne of the sources also said Vekselberg had reluctantly initiated the talks as “sanctions bite”.\nRenova and Gazprom declined to comment.\nVekselberg was placed under sanctions in a U.S. crackdown on President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle as retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nThe firms in which Vekselberg holds stakes have experienced varying fallouts since Washington announced impending Russian sanctions.\nKommersant business daily reported earlier this month that Renova was ready to resume talks with Gazprom as a way of protecting it from the sanctions.\nT Plus owns power stations with around 16 gigawatts in combined capacity, or around 6 percent of Russia’s total. It has 134 billion roubles ($2.2 billion) in debt, according to its officials. $1 = 61.4470 roubles Writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Susan Fenton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:53:23.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
