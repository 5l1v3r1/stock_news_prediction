Thursday morning, its executives told analysts that for the quarter there were roughly a dozen stores on Instacart. It expects to ramp up the partnership \"fairly quickly.\"\n\" ...Any time you switch over, there's always going to be timing differences to grow the business. But we're very confident that throughout this year, we'll grow this business in a similar fashion, if\nnot better than what we had with our previous relationship and the markets that we operated in,\" according to an initial transcript from Factset.\nSprouts said the transition to Instacart, along with lower-than-expected inflation, will hurt its forecast for same-store sales. The grocer revised its 2018 growth estimate to between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, from a range of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.\nShares of the grocer were down nearly 13 percent in mid-afternoon trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T20:26:44.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
