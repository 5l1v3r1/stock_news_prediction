(‘Solar Alliance’ or the ‘Company’) (TSX-V:SOLR) reports that it has filed its audited consolidated financial statements and related management discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017. Both are available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nKey results show a significant increase in revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as the result of construction of several projects in the Company’s expanding commercial project pipeline. The Company recorded $2,110,390 in revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $574,103 for the previous quarter. The revenue increase is the result of the Company’s increased focus on commercial and industrial (“C&I”) solar projects following the acquisition of a commercial solar company in November 2017 and its first contract with a Fortune Global 500 customer.\n“We start 2018 poised to scale our business significantly. We have expanded our technical capabilities and elevated our performance for the sales and installation cycle of larger solar projects. Our expansion into the development and sale of larger solar projects has translated into a significant increase in revenue in just one quarter,” said Chairman and CEO Jason Bak. “We will be allocating more resources to these larger scale solar projects for 2018 as we grow and leverage off a significant pipeline and an excellent track record for our commercial team.”\nSolar Alliance expects to announce additional C&I projects in the coming months as pipeline opportunities are converted to revenue.\nJason Bak, Chairman and CEO\nFor more information:\nSolar Alliance\nMyke Clark\n604-288-9051\nmclark@solaralliance.com\nAbout Solar Alliance Energy Inc.
