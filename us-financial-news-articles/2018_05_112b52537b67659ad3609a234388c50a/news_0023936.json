A combination of eight photographs shows eight separate house doors in London, Britain January 19, 2017. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth\nThe Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ (RICS) house price balance fell to -8 last month from zero in March, the weakest reading since November 2012 and dragged down again by London.\nA Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a much smaller decline to -1.\nNew buyer enquiries and sales were broadly flat during the month, according to the survey of property valuers.\nOverall, the report chimed with other signs of a muted housing market and it added to a run of downbeat data that means the BoE is likely to leave interest rates on hold when it announces its decision at 1100 GMT.\nIn London, nearly two-thirds of property surveyors said they saw prices fall rather than rise in April - the biggest proportion since February 2009, around the depths of Britain’s last recession.\nNearly a third of surveyors said they expected house prices nationally to be higher in a year’s time, RICS said.\nEarlier this week mortgage lender Halifax reported a particularly sharp drop in house prices last month.\nRespondents in the RICS survey had fairly flat expectations for sales over the next 12 months. Those in Scotland were the most upbeat.
