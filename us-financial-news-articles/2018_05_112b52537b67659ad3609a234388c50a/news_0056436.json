Schumacher won in Belgium in 1995 with a famously defensive drive on dry tyres in the wet.\n“I had half the power it seemed and I felt like it was going to come to a stop,” said Ricciardo. “For a few seconds I just wanted to close my eyes and start crying.”\nLOSS OF POWER Ricciardo had made a clean start and, controlling the race, looked as much of a nailed-on certainty for victory as ever exists on Monaco’s treacherous metal-fenced streets.\nAnd then he reported a loss of power.\n“OK mate, we can see what’s going on,” his race engineer replied after a pause. “You just need to keep it smooth, keep focused.”\n“Will it get better?” enquired the Australian. “Negative,” came the reply.\nFrom then on, Ricciardo — with Vettel looming in his rearview mirrors — was a model of consistency on a track where overtaking is a challenge for even the greatest of talents. For lap after lap, he kept the gap.\n“Absolutely amazing, I don’t know how you did that, Daniel,” said engineer Simon Rennie.\n“We had problems. We had a lot to deal with during the race. I felt a loss of power and I thought the race was done. I got home just using six gears,” Ricciardo told reporters later. “Thanks to the team. We got it back. I’m stoked.\n“From two years ago I feel we got some redemption now, we can put 2016 behind us,” he added.\nVettel said it had been a tricky race and “Daniel had the answer at all times.”\nA largely processional race — “boring” according to Hamilton, who said he would “have been asleep on the couch” if watching at home — saw a virtual safety car needed in the closing laps.\nThat was triggered by Sauber’s Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc, the first local F1 driver in 24 years to compete on his home streets, having piled into the back of New Zealander Brendon Hartley’s Toro Rosso at the tunnel exit.\nFerrari’s Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth, ahead of fellow Finn Valtteri Bottas for Mercedes.\nFrench driver Esteban Ocon took his Force India to sixth place, ahead of compatriot Pierre Gasly in a Toro Rosso and Renault’s Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo’s Dutch team mate Max Verstappen, who started last after crashing in Saturday’s final practice, stayed out of trouble and stood out for the right reasons with impressive overtakes to finish ninth.\nVerstappen also set a race lap record with a one minute 14.260 second effort on lap 60, improving on Mexican Sergio Perez’s 2017 best of 1:14.820.\nRicciardo had already smashed the all-time track record repeatedly in practice before qualifying in 1:10.810.\nSpaniard Carlos Sainz took the final point for Renault.
