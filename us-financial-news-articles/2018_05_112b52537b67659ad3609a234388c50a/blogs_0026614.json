This is one of those moments,” said Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries.\nGermany is the biggest deal in this deal, as it will help Vodafone take on the country’s biggest beast, incumbent Deutsche Telekom. The combined operation will still only be half the size of Telekom’s, Fries said.\nEurope-wide, though, Vodafone will end up with 54 million cable TV and broadband customers. Sky, by way of comparison, has just 23 million subscribers.\nVodafone is buying Unitymedia’s debt as part of the deal. “As currently structured, upon closing, a change of control will be triggered with respect to Unitymedia’s debt, and lenders and bondholders will have an option to put their debt to Vodafone,” Liberty Global said.\nFries noted that Liberty Global had generated more than six times its initial investment in Germany.\nLiberty Global is getting $12.7 billion in cash out of the Vodafone deal. So where’s it going? The company said it would reveal more in due course, but it would help “optimize growth and shareholder returns.”\nAccording to The Guardian , Malone might now try to buy out the British broadcaster ITV, in which it already owns a 9.9% stake.
