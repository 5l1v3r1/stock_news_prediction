It floated it on the stock exchange in 2015 but retained a 20 percent stake.\nAccording to bookrunners, the 22 million PBB shares were placed at 12.95 euros apiece in the accelerated bookbuilding, a 4 percent discount to Tuesday’s closing price of 13.50 euros.\n“The proceeds of the stock market flotation and this share placement total around 2.5 billion euros, exceeding the 2.3 billion euros granted to PBB by the FMS (financial market stability fund),” Jutta Doenges, managing director of Germany’s Finance Agency, said in a statement.\n“That is a considerable success in the re-privatisation of PBB,” she said.\nThe government will remain invested in PBB for the medium to long term via HRE’s remaining 3.5 percent stake, the Finance Agency said.\nShares in PBB fell 3.4 percent to 13.04 euros by 0710 GMT on Wednesday, while the German mid-cap index was flat.
