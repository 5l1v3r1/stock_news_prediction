Performance from Enterprise Networks and Network & Cloud more than offset a lower quarter in CPE sales. Overall our results demonstrated good progress toward our goals of driving profitable growth by diversifying into higher-margin products, expanding internationally and broadening the capabilities of ARRIS to deliver innovative services to address the explosive demand for bandwidth capacity.\n\"With respect to the second quarter 2018, we expect revenues will be in the range of $1.760 billion to $1.810 billion, GAAP net income per diluted share in the range of $0.24 to $0.29, and adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $0.72 to $0.77. The strong start to the year creates good momentum to achieve our full year targets.\"\nOn December 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Ruckus Networks, and, as a result, comparisons to prior year periods are materially affected.\nRevenues in the first quarter 2018 of $1.578 billion were up $95 million, or 6%, as compared to first quarter 2017 revenues of $1.483 billion. First quarter revenues were down $161 million, or 9%, as compared to fourth quarter 2017 revenues of $1.739 billion.\nGAAP net loss in the first quarter 2018 was ($0.07) per diluted share. First quarter 2017 GAAP net loss was ($0.21) per diluted share, and fourth quarter 2017 GAAP net income was $0.07 per diluted share.\nAdjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) in the first quarter 2018 was $0.73 per diluted share, as compared to $0.40 per diluted share for the first quarter 2017, and the fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income of $0.88 per diluted share.\nA reconciliation of adjusted net income to GAAP net loss is attached to this release and can also be found on the Company's website ( www.arris.com ).\nCash resources of the Company at the end of the first quarter, 2018 were $543 million of cash resources as compared to $511 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2017. The Company generated $96 million of cash from operating activities during the first quarter 2018, as compared to generating $250 million during the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company repurchased approximately 986,000 ordinary shares for $25 million during the first quarter. Since the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately 895,000 additional ordinary shares for $24 million. As of May 1, 2018, the Company has $476 million remaining in available share repurchase authorization.\nOrder backlog at the end of the first quarter 2018 was $1.293 billion, as compared to $1.304 billion and $1.121 billion at the end of the first quarter 2017 and the fourth quarter 2017, respectively. The Company's book-to-bill ratio in the first quarter 2018 was 1.11, as compared to the first quarter 2017 of 1.13 and the fourth quarter 2017 of 1.02.\nARRIS management will conduct a conference call at 5:00 pm EDT, today, Tuesday, May 1, 2018, to discuss these results in detail.

the United States (\"GAAP\" or referred to herein as \"reported\"). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide management and other users with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items, as well as the related income tax effects:\nReduction in Revenue Related to Warrants: We entered into agreements with two customers for the issuance of warrants to purchase up to 14.0 million of ARRIS's ordinary shares. Vesting of the warrants is subject to certain purchase volume commitments, and therefore the accounting guidance requires that we record any change in the fair value of warrants as a reduction in revenue. Until final vesting, changes in the fair value of the warrants will be marked to market and any adjustment recorded in revenue. We have excluded the effect of the implied fair value in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of these items on our total revenues and gross margin.\nAcquisition Accounting Impacts Related to Deferred Revenue: In connection with the accounting related to our acquisitions, business combination rules require us to account for the fair values of deferred revenue arrangements for post contract support in our purchase accounting. The non-GAAP adjustment to our sales and cost of sales is intended to include the full amounts of such revenues as if these purchase accounting adjustments had not been applied. We believe the adjustment to these revenues is useful as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business. We historically have experienced high renewal rates related to our support agreements, and our objective is to increase the renewal rates on acquired post contract support agreements. However, we cannot be certain that our customers will renew their contracts.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income (loss) measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we continue to evaluate our business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. We record non-cash compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock units. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of the grants, the non-cash compensation expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods.\nAcquisition Accounting Impacts Related to Inventory Valuation: In connection with the accounting related to our acquisitions, business combinations rules require the acquired inventory be recorded at fair value on the opening balance sheet. This is different from historical cost. Essentially, we are required to write the inventory up to the end customer price less a reasonable margin as a distributor. We have excluded the resulting adjustments in inventory and cost of goods sold as the historic and forward gross margin trends will differ as a result of the adjustments. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of this on cost of goods sold and margin.\nIntegration, Acquisition, Restructuring and Other Costs: We have excluded the effect of acquisition, integration, and other expenses and the effect of restructuring expenses in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. We incurred expenses in connection with the Pace and Ruckus Networks acquisitions, which we generally would not otherwise incur in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. Acquisition and integration expenses consist of transaction costs, costs for transitional employees, other acquired employee related costs, and integration related outside services. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance, abandoned facilities, product line disposition and other exit costs. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We have excluded the effect of the estimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although an impairment does not directly impact the Company's current cash position, such expense represents the declining value of the business, technology and other intangible assets that were acquired. We exclude these impairments when significant and they are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets: We have excluded the effect of amortization of intangible assets in calculating our non-GAAP operating expenses and net income (loss) measures. Amortization of intangible assets is non-cash, and is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. Amortization of intangible assets will recur in future periods.\nNoncontrolling Interest share of Non-GAAP Adjustments: The joint venture formed for the ActiveVideo acquisition is accounted for by ARRIS under the consolidation method. As a result, the consolidated Statements of Income include the revenues, expenses, and gains and losses of the noncontrolling interest. The amount of net income (loss) related to the noncontrolling interest are reported and presented separately in the consolidated Statements of Operations. We have excluded the noncontrolling share of any non- GAAP adjusted measures recorded by the venture, as we believe it is useful to understand the effect of excluding this item when evaluating our ongoing performance.\nImpairment (Gain) on Investments: We have excluded the effect of other-than-temporary impairments and certain gains on investments in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this non-cash item in our other expense (income).\nDebt Amendment Fees: In 2017 and 2015, the Company amended its credit agreement. This debt modification allowed us to improve the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, extend the maturities of certain loan facilities, increase the amount of the revolving credit facility, and add new term loan facility. We have excluded the effect of the associated fees in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effect of this item in our other expense (income).\nRemeasurement of Deferred Taxes: The Company records foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses related to deferred tax liabilities in the United Kingdom. The foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses derived from the remeasurement of the deferred income taxes from GBP to USD. We have excluded the impact of these gains and losses in the calculation of our non-GAAP measures. We believe it is useful to understand the effects of this item on our total other expense (income).\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit): We have excluded the tax effect of the non-GAAP items mentioned above. Additionally, we have excluded the effects of certain tax adjustments related to tax and legal restructuring, state and non-US valuation allowances, benefits for releases of uncertain tax positions due to settlement, change in law or statute of limitations and provision to return differences.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arris-announces-preliminary-and-unaudited-first-quarter-2018-results-300640488.html\nSOURCE ARRIS", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/arris", "http://www.arris.com/arriseverywhere/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arris-announces-preliminary-and-unaudited-first-quarter-2018-results-300640488.html", "http://www.arris.com/"], "published": "2018-05-02T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T02:56:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
