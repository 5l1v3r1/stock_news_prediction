Some analysts, however, do not expect Mariner East 2 to enter service until the third quarter.\nIn an analyst call following the release of its earnings in April, Antero said if Mariner East 2 does not come online when expected and is delayed until the end of the year, it would cost the company about $30 million in cash flow.\nReporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T19:29:38.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
