Owings broke a 4-for-51 skid with his third homer of the season.\nAhmed had two hits and four RBIs and Owings had three RBIs and scored three times as Arizona won for just the third time in 18 games while returning home after an 1-8 road trip. The Diamondbacks scored 13 runs in their previous seven games and 34 runs in the previous 17 while falling out of first place in the NL West.\nAdam Duvall had two hits and four RBIs, Eugenio Suarez had four hits and an RBI and Scooter Gennett had three hits for Cincinnati, which has lost three of four.\nArizona right-hander Matt Koch (3-3) got the victory while giving up 11 hits and five runs in five innings. He walked one and had no strikeouts.\nCincinnati starter Homer Bailey (1-7) gave up six hits and eight runs (six earned) in four-plus innings. He struck out three and walked one, victimized by a defense that committed three errors.\nGennett and Suarez singled to open the second inning before Gennett scored on Duvall’s one-out single for a 1-0 lead. Duvall had one hit in his previous 21 at-bats.\nDescalso tripled to open the Diamondbacks’ four-run second inning and Owings walked with one out before shortstop Jose Peraza committed an error on a routine grounder that could have been an inning-ending double play.\nDescalso scored, and Ahmed followed with his three-run homer to make it 4-1. He has eight homers, one short of his career high set in his first full season in 2015.\nMurphy homered in the fourth inning and Owings made it 6-1 later in the inning after reaching on third baseman Suarez’s fielding error and scoring on second baseman Gennett’s throwing error.\nThe Reds scored four in the fifth inning and had the tying run thrown out at the plate. Peraza and Joey Votto singled and Suarez had an RBI double before Scott Schebler walked and Duvall lined a three-run double to the fence in left-center to make it 6-5.\nBailey then hit a grounder off third baseman Jake Lamb’s glove that rolled toward shortstop, and Ahmed picked it up and threw out Duvall attempting to score from second.\nKetel Marte and Paul Goldschmidt had RBIs in the sixth inning for an 11-5 lead and Jake Lamb walked with the bases loaded to force in a run in the eighth for the final margin.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:20:54.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
