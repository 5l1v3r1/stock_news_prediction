We’ve found the right cocktail, the good mix between youth and experience,” said coach Gernot Rohr after Nigeria finished five points clear at the top of their qualifying group.

He has also elevated emerging talent quickly into key roles in the team.\n“We decided to integrate a lot of young people; players like Alex Iwobi, Kelechi Iheanacho and others who were already at big clubs,” he said. “With these new players and some old ones, we built a team that is solid.”\nAs part of a smoother, stronger administrative set-up this time around, Nigeria have implemented an extensive World Cup warm-up schedule, which includes a match against England at Wembley on June 2.\nThey have also attempted to head off the distractions that have hampered previous campaigns, notably arguments over money.\nBut the team always carry an unrealistic burden of expectation when they go to the World Cup, with the vast majority of Nigeria’s population of 186 million demanding some measure of success.\nNigeria have advanced past the first round three times but never reached the last eight –- which remains the benchmark of African achievement at the World Cup.
