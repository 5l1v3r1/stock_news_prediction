The right-hander gave up three runs on four hits in the first inning and then retired 18 of the final 20 batters he faced.\nOverall, Hess (1-0) allowed three runs on six hits in six innings. He struck out three without a walk and threw just 78 pitches.\nTanner Scott (1 1/3 innings) and Mychal Givens (1 2/3 innings) took care of the final three innings. Givens earned his first career save.\nRays starter Chris Archer (2-3) gave up all six runs Baltimore scored in seven innings. He allowed seven hits and couldn’t hold the early 3-0 lead.\nMatt Duffy and the Rays gave Hess a rude welcome to the big leagues in the first. After the Rays got a pair of one-out singles, Duffy then crushed the first pitch from Hess and sent it into the Oriole bullpen in left-center for the 3-0 lead.\nBut the Orioles scored three in the second and then went ahead for good with two more in the third.\nSchoop hit a solo homer off Archer in the second, and Chance Sisco added an RBI double. Sisco later stole home on the back end of a double-steal, tying the game at 3-3.\nManny Machado and Schoop then hit back-to-back solo homers in the third to give the Orioles a 5-3 lead. Machado now has four homers in his last three games.\nThe Orioles added one more when Mark Trumbo scored on an Archer wild pitch in the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-13T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:08:43.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
