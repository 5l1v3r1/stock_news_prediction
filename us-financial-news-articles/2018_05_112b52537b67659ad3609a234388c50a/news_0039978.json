The Pirates have won seven of their past eight games and boast a 14-6 record at home.\nThe White Sox have lost nine of 10 games. At 10-29, they own the worst record in baseball.\nSean Rodriguez drove in a pair of runs for the Pirates, who won despite tallying only four hits.\nLeury Garcia and Yolmer Sanchez each hit a solo home run for Chicago.\nEdgar Santana (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings out of the bullpen to earn his first career win in 37 games. Santana relieved starter Jameson Taillon, who limited the White Sox to two runs on five hits in 5 2/3 innings.\nJoakim Soria (0-2) took the loss after surrendering Bell’s go-ahead hit. His performance spoiled a solid start by Hector Santiago, who allowed two runs on two hits in five innings.\nFelipe Vazquez pitched a scoreless ninth inning to record his eighth save.\nChicago opened the scoring on a solo shot by Garcia in the second inning. The blast to right-center field marked Garcia’s second homer of the season and only the 13th of his six-year career.\nPittsburgh quickly answered to grab a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the second. After Corey Dickerson and Elias Diaz reached base, Rodriguez slammed a two-run double to deep left field.\nIn the fifth, the White Sox tied the score at 2. Sanchez pulled a pitch over the right field wall for his second homer. He has hit safely in 11 of his past 12 contests.\nPittsburgh pulled ahead 3-2 in the seventh. Diaz hit a leadoff double and came around to score on Bell’s single to left field three batters later.\nWhite Sox manager Rick Renteria held shortstop Tim Anderson out of the starting lineup for the first time this season. Chicago is in a stretch of playing 16 consecutive games between off days.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:36:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
