Excluding the impact of adopting the new revenue standard, ASC 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers, net revenue decreased 1%. GAAP Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 14% to $0.72 per share from $0.63 per share in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606, Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.32 per share. EBITDA increased 9% to $37.9 million compared to $34.8 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of adopting ASC 606, decreased to $21.3 million from $34.8 million in the same quarter last year (see table at the end of this release). Net cash was $187.6 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of $4.3 million during the quarter. The Company continues to expect full year 2018 Adjusted net revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and adoption of ASC 606, to be between -2% and 2% compared to 2017 and Adjusted EBITDA to be between $150 and $160 million. (see Financial Expectations – Continuing Operations section below for related explanations and additional financial guidance).\n“In the first quarter, we expanded our innovator portfolio with the addition of two new late-stage projects, both with the potential to generate more than $10 million in peak API sales. We also saw an increase in orders for generic APIs. We are committed to investing in additional manufacturing and laboratory capacity to meet growing demand, and our ongoing expansion projects are progressing according to plan,” commented Steven M. Klosk, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations and the outsourcing market continues to benefit from favorable market dynamics and strong fundamentals. We are confident that we will meet our financial guidance for the year.”\nBasis of Reporting\nThe Company has provided a reconciliation of GAAP amounts to adjusted (i.e. Non-GAAP) amounts at the end of this press release. Cambrex management believes that the adjusted amounts provide useful information to investors due to the magnitude and nature of certain amounts recorded in the GAAP amounts.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results – Continuing Operations\nNet revenue was $141.1 million, an increase of $36.1 million, or 34%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Excluding a 3% favorable impact of foreign exchange compared to the first quarter of 2017, net revenue increased 31%. The increase primarily reflects higher volumes and the adoption of ASC 606, which accelerated revenue recognition for a portion of Cambrex’s portfolio, enabling revenues for certain products to be recognized over time, rather than upon delivery to the customer. Cambrex elected the modified retrospective method which did not require prior periods to be restated. Excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606, net revenue decreased 1%.\nGross margin decreased to 36% from 45% compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by certain inventory charges due to batch failures, unfavorable manufacturing variances and product mix. Excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606, gross margin was 33%.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $16.9 million, compared to $15.4 million in the same quarter last year. This increase was primarily due to certain consulting costs, foreign currency and due diligence costs related to mergers and acquisition activities.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.6 million, compared to $3.9 million in the same quarter last year. This decrease was primarily driven by higher absorption of expenses into inventory and cost of goods sold as a result of increased revenue generating activity, partially offset by higher personnel costs.\nOperating profit was $30.4 million compared to $27.6 million in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606, operating profit was $13.8 million. The decrease was primarily the result of lower gross profit and higher operating expenses as described above. Adjusted EBITDA was $21.3 million compared to $34.8 million in the same quarter last year (see table at the end of this press release).\nIncome tax expense was $5.8 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 19% compared to $5.8 million and an effective tax rate of 22% in the same quarter last year. The favorable impact of immediately recognizing certain effects of share-based compensation was negligible in the current quarter, but significant in the prior year. The adoption of ASC 606 had a negligible impact on the effective tax rate.\nIncome from continuing operations was $24.2 million or $0.72 per share compared to $21.1 million or $0.63 per share in the same quarter last year. Excluding the impact of adopting ASC 606, Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.32 per share.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations was $12.5 million or $0.37 per share, compared to $20.0 million or $0.60 per share in the same quarter last year (see table at the end of this press release).\nCapital expenditures were $23.8 million and depreciation and amortization was $7.5 million compared to $12.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively, in the same quarter last year.\nNet cash was $187.6 million at the end of the first quarter, an increase of $4.3 million during the quarter.\nFinancial Expectations – Continuing Operations\nThe following table shows the Company’s current expectations for its full year 2018 financial performance:\nExpectations Adjusted net revenue growth -2% - 2% Adjusted EBITDA $150 - $160 million Adjusted income from continuing operations per share $2.80 - $3.03 Free cash flow $35 - $45 million Capital expenditures $70 - $80 million Depreciation and amortization $33 - $37 million Adjusted effective tax rate 23% - 25% Consistent with the Company’s usual guidance practices, these financial expectations are for continuing operations and exclude the impact of any potential acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring activities, outcomes of tax disputes and the adoption of ASC 606 which became effective January 1, 2018. Adjusted net revenue growth expectations exclude the impact of foreign exchange and adoption of ASC 606. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted income from continuing operations per share for 2018 will be computed on a basis consistent with the reconciliation of the first quarter financial results in the tables at the end of this press release. Free cash flow is defined as the change in debt, net of cash during the year. Adjusted effective tax rate excludes certain effects of share-based payments that were possibly deferred under the previous guidance. The tax rate will be sensitive to the Company’s geographic mix of income, changes in the tax laws or rates within the countries in which the Company operates and the effects of certain share-based payments.\nThe financial information contained in this press release is unaudited, subject to revision and should not be considered final until the Company’s Form 10-Q for first quarter 2018 is filed with the SEC.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 results will begin at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on May 3, 2018 and can be accessed by calling 1-877-260-1479 for domestic and +1-334-323-0522 for international.

These and other may be identified by the fact that they use words such as “guidance,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimates,” “believes” or similar expressions. Any contained herein are based on current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to current expectations. The factors described in Item 1A of Part I of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017 captioned “Risk Factors,” or otherwise described in the Company’s filings with the SEC provide examples of such risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company’s actual results to the expectations the Company describes in its , including, but not limited to, customer and product concentration, the Company’s ability to win new customer contracts and renew existing contracts on favorable terms, significant declines in sales of products to our customers, pharmaceutical outsourcing trends, competitive pricing or product developments, market acceptance and adoption rate of its customers’ products, government legislation and regulations (including those pertaining to environmental issues), tax rate, interest rate, technology, manufacturing and legal issues, including the outcome of outstanding litigation, environmental matters, changes in foreign exchange rates, uncollectible receivables, the timing and/or volume of orders or shipments and the Company’s ability to meet its production plan and customer delivery schedules, expected timing of completion of capacity expansions, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, loss on disposition of assets, cancellations or delays in renewal of contracts, lack of suitable raw materials, the Company’s ability to receive regulatory approvals for its products, continued demand in the U.S. for late stage clinical products and the successful outcome of the Company’s investment in new products.\nFor further details and a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, investors are encouraged to review the Cambrex Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, including the Forward-Looking Statement and Risk Factors sections therein, and other filings with the SEC. The Company cautions investors and potential investors not to place undue reliance on the contained in this press release and to give careful consideration to the risks and uncertainties listed above and contained in the Company’s SEC filings. The in this press release speak only as of the date of this document, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. These financial non-GAAP measures exclude the adoption of ASC 606. The Company defines EBITDA as operating profit plus depreciation and amortization expense and Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of any potential acquisitions and restructuring activities. Adjusted effective tax rate excludes certain effects of share-based payments that were possibly deferred under the previous guidance. Adjusted income from continuing operations is calculated in a manner consistent with that shown in the table at the end of this press release. Other companies may have different definitions of Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations should not be considered alternatives to measurements required by U.S. GAAP, such as net revenue, net income or operating profit, and should not be considered a measure of Cambrex’s liquidity. Cambrex uses Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations among several other metrics to assess and analyze its operational results and trends. Cambrex also believes Adjusted net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted effective tax rate and Adjusted income from continuing operations are useful to investors because they are common operating performance metrics as well as metrics routinely used to assess potential enterprise value. Cambrex has provided a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts at the end of this press release.\nCAMBREX CORPORATION Statements of Profit and Loss For the Quarters Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per share data) 2018\n2017\n% of % of Amount Net Revenue Amount Net Revenue Gross Sales $ 139,130 $ 103,711 Commissions, Allowances and Rebates 209 594 Net Sales 138,921 103,117 Other Revenues, Net 2,176 1,889 Net Revenue 141,097 105,006 Cost of Goods Sold 90,242 64.0 % 58,131 55.4 % Gross Profit 50,855 36.0 % 46,875 44.6 % Operating Expenses: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 16,855 11.9 % 15,391 14.7 % Research and Development Expenses 3,619 2.6 % 3,890 3.7 % Total Operating Expenses 20,474 14.5 % 19,281 18.4 % Operating Profit 30,381 21.5 % 27,594 26.3 % Other Expenses: Interest Expense, Net 82 266 Other Expenses, Net 264 401 Income Before Income Taxes 30,035 21.3 % 26,927 25.6 % Provision for Income Taxes 5,786 5,812 Income from Continuing Operations $ 24,249 17.2 % $ 21,115 20.1 % Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (191 ) (1,250 ) Net Income $ 24,058 17.1 % $ 19,865 18.9 % Basic Earnings/(Loss) per Share of Common Stock: Income from Continuing Operations $ 0.74 $ 0.65 Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax $ (0.01 ) $ (0.04 ) Net Income $ 0.73 $ 0.61 Diluted Earnings/(Loss) per Share of Common Stock: Income from Continuing Operations $ 0.72 $ 0.63 Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax $ (0.00 ) $ (0.03 ) Net Income $ 0.72 $ 0.60 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding Basic 32,894 32,454 Diluted 33,621 33,365\nCAMBREX CORPORATION Consolidated Balance Sheets As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (in thousands) March 31, December 31, Assets 2018 2017 Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 187,568 $ 183,284 Trade Receivables, Net 55,166 75,144 Contract Assets 88,990 - Other Receivables 21,866 20,891 Inventories, Net 104,544 138,542 Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets 4,607 4,217 Total Current Assets 462,741 422,078 Property, Plant and Equipment, Net 270,378 254,299 Goodwill 44,372 43,626 Intangible Assets, Net 13,442 13,868 Deferred Income Taxes 1,822 3,198 Other Non-Current Assets 3,465 3,496 Total Assets $ 796,220 $ 740,565 Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity Accounts Payable $ 43,932 $ 35,017 Contract Liabilities, Current 6,721 4,707 Taxes Payable 8,162 43 Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities 32,938 42,774 Total Current Liabilities 91,753 82,541 Contract Liabilities, Non-Current 39,000 39,000 Deferred Income Taxes 7,129 7,806 Accrued Pension Benefits 40,633 41,141 Other Non-Current Liabilities 24,968 25,213 Total Liabilities $ 203,483 $ 195,701 Stockholders’ Equity $ 592,737 $ 544,864 Total Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity $ 796,220 $ 740,565\nCAMBREX CORPORATION Impact of Adopting ASC 606 For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands) Income Statement First Quarter 2018 First Quarter 2017 As Reported Effect of\nChange\nHigher/(Lower)\nAmount\nWithout\nAdoption of\nASC 606 As Reported Gross Sales $ 139,130 $ 37,280 $ 101,850 $ 103,711 Net Revenue 141,097 37,280 103,817 105,006 Cost of Goods Sold 90,242 20,699 69,543 58,131 Gross Profit 50,855 16,581 34,274 46,875 Operating Profit 30,381 16,581 13,800 27,594 Provision for Income Taxes 5,786 3,171 2,615 5,812 Income from Continuing Operations 24,249 13,410 10,839 21,115 Net Income 24,058 13,410 10,648 19,865 Diluted Earnings per Share 0.72 0.40 0.32 0.63 Balance Sheet March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 As Reported Effect of\nChange\nHigher/(Lower)\nBalances\nWithout\nAdoption of\nASC 606 As Reported Current Assets Trade Receivables $ 55,166 $ - $ 55,166 $ 75,144 Contract Assets 88,990 88,990 - - Inventory 104,544 (51,886 ) 156,430 138,542 Current Liabilities Contract Liabilities, Current 6,721 - 6,721 4,707 Taxes Payable 8,162 7,819 343 43 Stockholders' Equity Retained Earnings 470,103 29,629 440,474 429,826\nCAMBREX CORPORATION Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Results For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands) First Quarter 2018 First Quarter 2017 Operating Profit $ 30,381 $ 27,594 Depreciation and Amortization 7,517 7,185 EBITDA 37,898 34,779 Impact of Adopting ASC 606 (16,581 ) - Adjusted EBITDA $ 21,317 $ 34,779\nFirst Quarter 2018 First Quarter 2017 Diluted\nEPS Diluted\nEPS Income from Continuing Operations $ 24,249 $ 0.72 $ 21,115 $ 0.63 Impact of Adopting ASC 606 (13,410 ) (0.40 ) - - Stock-Based Compensation 1,650 0.05 1,786 0.05 Stock-Based Compensation Tax 1.
