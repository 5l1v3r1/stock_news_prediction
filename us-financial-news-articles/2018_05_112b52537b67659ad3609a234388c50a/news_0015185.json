With a 3-3 tie in the eighth against reliever George Kontos (2-3), he drove in Domingo Santana, who doubled to open the inning, and Eric Sogard, who drew a two-out walk.\nThe Brewers will go for a weekend series win Sunday after dropping the opener.\nThe Pirates forged 1-1 and 3-3 ties but could not overcome a third deficit.\nThey have lost five of their past six overall and nine of their past 10 road games.\nJhoulys Chacin, who got the start for Milwaukee after Zach Davies went on the disabled list Thursday because of a right rotator cuff issue, allowed one run and three hits in six innings, with two walks and four strikeouts.\nReliever Josh Hader (1-0) pitched the final two innings and gave up two runs on Starling Marte’s homer but was bailed out by Braun.\nPittsburgh starter Jameson Taillon, who entered on a three-game losing streak, left with a no-decision. He gave up one run and six hits in five innings, with two walks and one strikeout.\nThe Brewers took a 1-0 lead in the fourth when Travis Shaw walked and, an out later, scored on Hernan Perez’s double to left.\nPittsburgh tied it in the sixth. Adam Frazier and Gregory Polanco opened with singles, Frazier going to third. Marte drove in Frazier with a sacrifice fly.\nIn the seventh, Christian Yelich hit an RBI single for a 2-1 Brewers lead after Sogard and Lorenzo Cain walked. Cain scored on a passed ball to make it 3-1.\nThe Pirates tied it once more in the eighth when Marte hit a two-run homer to right, his fifth, after Polanco drew a one-out walk. It came a night after Marte hit an inside-the-park homer.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-06T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:53:45.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
