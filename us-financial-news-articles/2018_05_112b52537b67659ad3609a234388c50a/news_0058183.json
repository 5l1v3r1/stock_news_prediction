None of the soldiers was injured.\nHostilities over the Israel-Gaza frontier have soared since Palestinians began mass-demonstrations on March 30, which Israel deems to be cover for attempts to breach the border fence.\nAt least 116 Palestinians have been killed and thousands hurt by army gunfire in the protests, drawing foreign censure.
