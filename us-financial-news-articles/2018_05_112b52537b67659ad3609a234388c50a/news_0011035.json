See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for further details. Recent Highlights\nStrategic\nIn February 2018, we entered into two LNG Sale and Purchase Agreements (“SPAs”) with PetroChina International Company Limited, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation, for the sale of approximately 1.2 million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of LNG through 2043, with a portion of the supply beginning in 2018 and the balance beginning in 2023. In January 2018, we entered into a 15-year LNG SPA with Trafigura Pte Ltd for the sale of approximately 1 mtpa of LNG beginning in 2019.\nOperational\nAs of April 30, approximately 90 cargoes have been produced, loaded, and exported from the SPL Project (defined below) in 2018. To date, approximately 350 cumulative LNG cargoes have been exported from the SPL Project, with deliveries to 26 countries and regions worldwide. During the first quarter 2018, we delivered 30 cargoes totaling over two million tonnes of LNG exported from the SPL Project and sold by our integrated marketing function.\nFinancial\nFor the first quarter of 2018, we achieved Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of over $900 million and Distributable Cash Flow of approximately $270 million. In March 2018, the date of first commercial delivery (“DFCD”) was reached under the 20-year SPA with GAIL (India) Limited relating to Train 4 of the SPL Project. In April 2018, we engaged financial institutions to assist in the structuring and arranging of up to $6.4 billion of credit facilities for Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings, LLC through an amendment and upsize of its existing credit facilities, the proceeds of which will be used to fund a portion of the costs of developing, constructing, and placing into service three natural gas liquefaction trains (“Trains”) and related facilities of the CCL Project (defined below), and the related pipeline being developed near Corpus Christi, Texas and for related business purposes. In April and May 2018, we acquired a total of 21,453,482 common shares of Cheniere Energy Partners LP Holdings, LLC (“Cheniere Partners Holdings”) (NYSE American: CQH) in a series of privately negotiated transactions pursuant to share purchase and exchange agreements, in exchange for a total of 10,278,739 unregistered shares of Cheniere. Subsequent to the completion of these transactions, our ownership of Cheniere Partners Holdings is approximately 91.9%.\nLiquefaction Projects Update\nSPL Project CCL Project Liquefaction Train Trains 1-4 Train 5 Train 6 Trains 1-2 Train 3 Project Status Operational Under\nConstruction\nPermitted Under\nConstruction\nPermitted\nLNTP Issued (1)\nExpected Substantial Completion Complete 1H 2019 — T1 - 1H 2019\nT2 - 2H 2019\n— Expected DFCD Window Start Complete 2H 2019 — T1 - 1H 2019\nT2 - 1H 2020\n— (1) Limited Notice to Proceed (“LNTP”) Cheniere Energy, Inc. (“Cheniere”) (NYSE American: LNG) reported net income 1 of $357 million, or $1.52 per share—basic and $1.50 per share—diluted, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $54 million, or $0.23 per share (basic and diluted), for the comparable 2017 period. The increase in net income was primarily due to increased income from operations as a result of additional Trains in operation at the SPL Project, increased derivative gain associated with our interest rate swap position, and decreased loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by increased allocation of net income to non-controlling interest and increased interest expense, net of amounts capitalized.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA 2 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $907 million, compared to $483 million for the comparable 2017 period. The increase in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to increased income from operations.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, 67 LNG cargoes were exported from the SPL Project, none of which were commissioning cargoes. Three cargoes exported from the SPL Project and sold on a delivered basis were in transit as of March 31, 2018.\n“Our record first quarter 2018 results are the product of a robust LNG market and superior execution throughout the company, and we are raising our full year 2018 guidance to reflect our year to date performance coupled with LNG market pricing that is stronger and more durable than we previously forecast,” said Jack Fusco, Cheniere’s President and CEO. “Solid LNG market fundamentals and the strategic positioning of our world-class LNG platform reinforce my confidence in our long-term growth prospects. We continue to progress Train 3 at Corpus Christi and expect to make a positive Final Investment Decision on that project in the coming weeks.”\nLNG Volume Summary\nThe following table summarizes the volumes of operational and commissioning LNG that were loaded from the SPL Project and for which the financial impact was recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements during the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 (in TBtu) Operational Commissioning Volumes loaded during the current period 241 — Volumes loaded during the prior period but recognized during the current period 43 — Less: volumes loaded during the current period and in transit at the end of the period (11 ) — Total volumes recognized in the current period 273 — In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recognized the financial impact of volumes of 11 TBtu on our Consolidated Financial Statements related to LNG cargoes sourced from third parties.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nOur financial results are reported on a consolidated basis. Our ownership interest in Cheniere Energy Partners, L.P. (“Cheniere Partners”) (NYSE American: CQP) as of March 31, 2018 consisted of 100% ownership of the general partner of Cheniere Partners and 82.7% ownership interest in Cheniere Partners Holdings which owned a 48.6% limited partner interest in Cheniere Partners on March 31, 2018.\nTotal revenues increased $1.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total operating costs and expenses increased $660 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increases in revenues and total operating costs and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, were primarily driven by the timing of completion of Trains at the SPL Project and the length of each Train’s operations within the periods being compared.\nSelling, general and administrative expense included share-based compensation expenses of $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $12 million for the comparable 2017 period.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest increased $124 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a higher non-controlling percentage interest due to the conversion of Cheniere Partners’ Class B units to common units in August 2017 and an increase in income recognized by Cheniere Partners and Cheniere Partners Holdings, partially offset by the impact of amortization of the beneficial conversion feature on Cheniere Partners’ Class B units, which increased net income attributable to non-controlling interest during the three months ended March 31, 2017 but had no impact in the comparable 2018 period.\nCapital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $715 million available to us. In addition, we had current and non-current restricted cash of $1.7 billion designated for the following purposes: $561 million for the SPL Project, $83 million for the CCL Project, $916 million for restricted purposes under the terms of Cheniere Partners’ credit facilities and $147 million for other restricted purposes.\nLiquefaction Projects\nSPL Project\nThrough Cheniere Partners, we are developing up to six Trains at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal adjacent to the existing regasification facilities (the “SPL Project”). Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG and an adjusted nominal production capacity of approximately 4.3 to 4.6 mtpa of LNG. Trains 1 through 4 are operational, Train 5 is under construction, and Train 6 is being commercialized and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place.\nCCL Project\nWe are developing up to three Trains near Corpus Christi, Texas (the “CCL Project”). Each Train is expected to have a nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 4.5 mtpa of LNG. Trains 1 and 2 are under construction, and Train 3 has been commercialized, is in the process of being financed, and has all necessary regulatory approvals in place. We expect to make a positive Final Investment Decision with regard to Train 3 of the CCL Project in the first half of 2018.\nCorpus Christi Expansion Project\nWe are developing up to seven midscale liquefaction trains adjacent to the CCL Project (the “Corpus Christi Expansion Project”), each with an expected nominal production capacity, which is prior to adjusting for planned maintenance, production reliability, and potential overdesign, of approximately 1.4 mtpa of LNG. The total expected nominal production capacity of the seven midscale Trains is approximately 9.5 mtpa of LNG. We have initiated the regulatory approval process with respect to the Corpus Christi Expansion Project.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our financial and operating results for the first quarter on Friday, May 4, 2018, at 10 a.m. Eastern time / 9 a.m. Central time. A listen-only webcast of the call and an accompanying slide presentation may be accessed through our website at www.cheniere.com .

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nRegulation G Reconciliations\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the accompanying news release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures that we use to facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our U.S. GAAP measures of performance and the financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA represents net income attributable to Cheniere before net income attributable to the non-controlling interest, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain non-cash items, other non-operating income or expense items, and other items not otherwise predictive or indicative of ongoing operating performance, as detailed in the following reconciliation. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA provides relevant and useful information to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our operating performance in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. We believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization which vary substantially from company to company depending on capital structure, the method by which assets were acquired and depreciation policies. Further, the exclusion of certain non-cash items, other non-operating income or expense items, and items not otherwise predictive or indicative of ongoing operating performance enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking net income attributable to common stockholders before net income attributable to non-controlling interest, interest expense, net of capitalized interest, changes in the fair value and settlement of our interest rate derivatives, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusting for the effects of certain non-cash items, other non-operating income or expense items, and other items not otherwise predictive or indicative of ongoing operating performance, including the effects of modification or extinguishment of debt, impairment expense and loss on disposal of assets, changes in the fair value of our commodity and foreign currency exchange (“FX”) derivatives and non-cash compensation expense. We believe the exclusion of these items enables investors and other users of our financial information to assess our sequential and year-over-year performance and operating trends on a more comparable basis and is consistent with management’s own evaluation of performance.\nDistributable Cash Flow is defined as cash received, or expected to be received, from Cheniere’s ownership and interests in CQP, CQH and Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings, LLC, cash received (used) by Cheniere’s integrated marketing function (other than cash for capital expenditures) less interest, taxes and maintenance capital expenditures associated with Cheniere and not the underlying entities. Management uses this measure and believes it provides users of our financial statements a useful measure reflective of our business’s ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable GAAP measure.\nWe believe Distributable Cash Flow is a useful performance measure for management, investors and other users of our financial information to evaluate our performance and to measure and estimate the ability of our assets to generate cash earnings after servicing our debt, paying cash taxes and expending sustaining capital, that could be used for discretionary purposes such as common stock dividends, stock repurchases, retirement of debt, or expansion capital expenditures. Management uses this measure and believes it provides users of our financial statements a useful measure reflective of our business’s ability to generate cash earnings to supplement the comparable GAAP measure. Distributable Cash Flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operations or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nNon-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or in lieu of an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, and should be evaluated only on a supplementary basis.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nThe following table reconciles our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to U.S. GAAP results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 357 $ 54 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 243 118 Income tax provision 15 — Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 216 165 Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 42 Derivative gain, net (77 ) (1 ) Other income (7 ) (2 ) Income from operations $ 747 $ 376 Adjustments to reconcile income from operations to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Depreciation and amortization expense 109 70 Loss from changes in fair value of commodity and FX derivatives, net 37 33 Total non-cash compensation expense 14 4 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 907 $ 483 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nThe following table reconciles our actual Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net income attributable to common stockholders for first quarter 2018 and forecast amounts for 2018 (in billions):\n1Q 2018 Prior 2018 Revised 2018 Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 0.36 $ 0.1 - $ 0.1 $ 0.2 - 0.4 Net income attributable to non-controlling interest 0.24 0.6 - 0.7 0.7 - 0.7 Income tax provision (benefit) 0.02 0.0 0.0 Interest expense, net of capitalized interest 0.22 0.9 0.9 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 0.00 0.0 0.0 Derivative gain, net (0.08 ) 0.0 0.0 Other expense (income) (0.01 ) (0.0 ) (0.0 ) Income from operations $ 0.75 $ 1.5 - $ 1.7 $ 1.8 - $ 2.0 Adjustments to reconcile income from operations to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA: Depreciation and amortization expense 0.11 0.5 0.5 Loss from changes in fair value of commodity and FX derivatives, net 0.04 0.0 0.0 Total non-cash compensation expense 0.01 0.0 0.0 Impairment expense and loss on disposal of assets 0.00 0.0 0.0 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA $ 0.91 $ 2.0 - $ 2.2 $ 2.3 - $ 2.5 Distributions and dividends to CQP / CQH non-controlling interest (0.15 ) (0.6 ) (0.60 ) SPL and CQP cash retained and interest expense (0.47 ) (1.2 ) (1.30 ) Cheniere interest expense and income tax (0.03 ) (0.0 ) (0.05 ) Cheniere Distributable Cash Flow $ 0.27 $ 0.2 - $ 0.4 $ 0.35 - $ 0.55 Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding.
