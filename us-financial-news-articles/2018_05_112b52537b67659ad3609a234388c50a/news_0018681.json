(NASDAQ:XOG) (“Extraction” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Highlights\nFirst quarter average net sales volumes of 68,874 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) including 36,052 barrels per day (Bbl/d) of crude oil;\nFor the first quarter, Extraction reported a net loss of $52.0 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share 1 , compared to net income of $8.7 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share 1 , for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged 2 was $166.7 million for the first quarter, up 224% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDAX was $141.0 million for the first quarter, up 232% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially;\nDrilling and completion (D&C) capital expenditures for the first quarter 2018 were $226 million;\nReaffirms previously disclosed 2018 guidance.\nCommenting on first-quarter 2018 results, Extraction's Chairman and CEO Mark Erickson said: “We continued our rapid pace of production growth with both our total equivalent production and our crude oil volumes hitting new quarterly records despite facing an extremely difficult midstream operating environment impacted significantly by both high line pressures and freeze-offs on a third-party system.”\nFinancial Results\nFor the first quarter, Extraction reported oil, natural gas and NGL sales revenue of $230.2 million, as compared to $89.6 million during the same period in 2017, representing an increase of 157%. Revenue increased 8% sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in crude oil production.\n1 For further information on the earnings per share, refer to the Consolidated Statement of Operations\n2 Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged and a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, read “-Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged.” Extraction reported a net loss of $52.0 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter, compared to net income of $8.7 million for the same period in 2017. This net loss was driven predominately by a $50.3 million unrealized loss on commodity derivatives. Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged was $166.7 million for the first quarter, up 224% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDAX was $141.0 million for the first quarter, up 232% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.\nThe following table provides a summary of our sales volumes, average sales prices and certain operating expenses on a per BOE basis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales (MBoe) (1) : 6,199 3,005 Oil sales (MBbl) 3,245 1,211 Natural gas sales (MMcf) 10,404 6,359 NGL sales (MBbl) 1,220 734 Sales (BOE/d) (1) : 68,874 33,383 Oil sales (Bbl/d) 36,052 13,454 Natural gas sales (Mcf/d) 115,602 70,651 NGL sales (Bbl/d) 13,554 8,154 Average sales prices (2) : Oil sales (per Bbl) $ 55.56 $ 43.05 Oil sales with derivative settlements (per Bbl) 45.53 36.42 Differential ($/Bbl) to Average NYMEX WTI (7.33 ) (8.73 ) Natural gas sales (per Mcf) 2.31 3.13 Natural gas sales with derivative settlements (per Mcf) 2.97 2.97 Differential ($/Mcf) to Average NYMEX Henry Hub (3) (0.83 ) (0.24 ) NGL sales (per Bbl) (3) 21.21 24.00 Average price per BOE 37.14 29.84 Average price per BOE with derivative settlements 32.98 26.82 Expense per BOE: Lease operating expenses $ 3.34 $ 4.01 Transportation and gathering 1.22 3.42 General and administrative expenses 5.00 8.55 Cash general and administrative expenses 2.46 3.31 Stock-based compensation 2.54 5.24 Production taxes as a % of Revenue 8.8 % 7.2 % One BOE is equal to six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas or one barrel (“Bbl”) of oil or NGL based on an approximate energy equivalency.

Crude oil accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s total revenues and over 52% of the Company’s total equivalent volumes recorded during the first quarter. First quarter average net sales volumes were 68,874 BOE/d, an increase of 106% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Extraction estimates high line pressures and freeze-offs negatively impacted its first quarter net production by approximately 13 MBoe/d including 8,000 Bbl/d of crude oil. As the first new plant comes on, the Company expects to see a significant increase in its base production as the constraints are lifted.\nFor the first-quarter 2018, the Company’s aggregate drilling, completion, leasehold capital expenditures, totaled approximately $248 million, $226 million of which was for drilling and completion and $22 million on leasehold. In addition, the Company incurred $5 million of midstream capital expenditures.\nDuring the first quarter, Extraction reached total depth on 41 gross (27 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 7,300 feet, completed 49 gross (39 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 8,700 feet and turned to sales 31 gross (18 net) wells with an average lateral length of approximately 9,000 feet.\nUpdated Investor Presentation\nExtraction has posted an updated investor presentation to its website.

for derivatives that settled during the period (2,506 ) — Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged $ 166,730 $ 51,488 Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are not measures of net income (loss) as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) adjusted for certain cash and non-cash items, including depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairment of long lived assets, exploration expenses, loss on sale of property and equipment, acquisition transaction expenses, commodity derivative (gain) loss, settlements on commodity derivatives, premiums paid for derivatives that settled during the period, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt issuance costs, make-whole premiums, interest expense, income taxes, and non-recurring charges. We define Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged as Adjusted EBITDAX adjusted for settlements on commodity derivative instruments and premiums paid for derivative that settled during the period.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital, hedging strategy and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are widely followed measures of operating performance. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged and net income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is provided in the table above. Additionally, our management team believes Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted EBITDAX, Unhedged are useful to an investor in evaluating our financial performance because these measures (i) are widely used by investors in the oil and natural gas industry to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term, among other factors; (ii) help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure from our operating structure; and (iii) are used by our management team for various purposes, including as a measure of operating performance, in presentations to our board of directors, as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nInvestor Contact: Louis Baltimore, ir@extractionog.com , 720-974-7773\nMedia Contact: Brian Cain, info@extractionog.com , 720-974-7782\nSource:Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9ab382d9-6610-43c9-aa76-f6500483eff1", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HFy1MYyqQb12W1Is6V1kIbSMXoju_UnmtB3KVCI-ola2I1M0RByA_vMlW6GO-aQCprCji1oVNX6qbGct6dyhRGfv7wfGDt4bdQbcEzWh9ac=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=azBX2k536rxoIKTzYSDBvFuvbKT5vBxTJMZeeqzugM-9m0w96m3D5IDqGqanq6wAiJVALKcbFK0H_jvr2ytc9DwPwPGVjSJF9CHxrqrZnGA="], "published": "2018-05-09T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T01:16:24.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
