Shariq Yosufzai and Sushil (\"Sam\") Kapoor Are Appointed to Aqua Metals Board\nSteve Cotton Rejoins Aqua Metals as President\nALAMEDA, Calif., May 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQMS) , which is commercializing a non-polluting electrochemical lead recycling technology called AquaRefining™, today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Kanen Wealth Management, LLC (“KWM”).\nUnder the agreement, Aqua Metals has expanded the Board from five (5) to six (6) directors and has appointed KWM nominees - - Mr. S. Shariq Yosufzai and Mr. Sushil (\"Sam\") Kapoor - - to the Board, effective immediately. Aqua’s Nominating Committee has determined that Messrs. Yosufzai and Kapoor are “independent directors” under applicable Nasdaq Stock Market rules, and Mr. Yosufzai will serve as Aqua’s new Non-Executive Chairman and lead independent director. With the addition of Messrs. Yosufzai and Kapoor, Aqua’s Board now consists of six directors, all of whom are independent directors. Upon completion of Aqua’s CEO search, the new permanent CEO will join the Board as the seventh director. Each of Messrs. Vincent L. DiVito, Mark Slade, Eric Prouty, Mark Stevenson, Shariq Yosufzai and Sushil (“Sam”) Kapoor has been nominated to stand for election at Aqua’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders scheduled to be held on June 5, 2018.\nMessrs. Yosufzai and Kapoor have been appointed, with Messrs. DiVito and Stevenson, to serve on the Board’s newly constituted CEO Search Committee, which is charged with overseeing and executing Aqua’s previously announced permanent CEO search process, in consultation with an external executive search firm and with authority to make hiring recommendations to the full Board. Mr. Yosufzai has also been appointed to the Board’s Nominating Committee and Mr. Kapoor has been appointed to the Board’s Compensation Committee.\nSteve Cotton, the Company's former Chief Commercial Officer (from January 2015 to June 2017) rejoins Aqua as its new President and will be invited by the CEO Search Committee to interview for the position of CEO together with all other candidates for such position during the pendency of the Company’s permanent CEO search process. Mr. Selwyn Mould, who served briefly as Aqua’s interim CEO, has agreed to step down from such capacity immediately following the Company’s filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and has resigned as a director of the Company, effective immediately. Mr. Mould will remain Aqua’s Chief Operating Officer. Although there can be no assurance, the Board expects to complete its search process and to hire a permanent CEO before Q4 2018.\nAqua and KWM are committed to establishing certain corporate governance “best practices” going forward and, in that regard, have agreed to institute a “majority voting” policy for the election of directors which will be effective commencing with the 2019 Annual Meeting of stockholders. The Company will also continue to focus on further refreshing the Board to improve its overall diversity.\nIn addition, KWM has agreed to certain customary standstill and voting provisions, including voting for the election of the Board’s slate of six (6) directors at the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n“We are very pleased to welcome Shariq and Sam as our two newest independent directors,” said independent director Vincent L. DiVito. “Over the past week, we’ve had very open and positive discussions with Shariq and Sam, and it’s clear that their stellar credentials and strong executive management experience will be most valuable as Aqua enters the next critical phase of commercializing our AquaRefining™ technology.\n“We also welcome back Steve Cotton, and greatly appreciate his willingness to join Aqua as our new President to help lead our executive team during this important time of transition and work side-by-side with our Chief Operating Officer and the entire AquaRefining operations team. Steve has considerable institutional knowledge about Aqua from his prior leadership role as Chief Commercial Officer and has built valuable relationships with the Company’s vendors and customers. “\nDavid Kanen, managing member of KWM, stated, “We are pleased to have reached an amicable resolution that enhances Aqua’s board and management team. We believe a solid foundation exists and can be built upon to monetize our revolutionary Aqua refining technology. We are looking forward to executing a strategy that we are hopeful will lead to value creation for all shareholders.”\nSteve Cotton noted, “I am looking forward to hitting the ground running by reigniting my existing relationships and developing new ones with Aqua Metals employees, partners, industry and other stakeholders to build momentum and maximize shareholder value.”\nAs previously announced, Frank Knuettel II will formally assume the CFO role immediately following the filing of the Company’s second quarter.
