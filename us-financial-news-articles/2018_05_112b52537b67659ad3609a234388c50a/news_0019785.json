Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nContracts for Brent, the global crude benchmark, and for the U.S. benchmark jumped almost 3 percent to highs last seen in November 2014 after Trump on Tuesday abandoned the deal and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against Iran.\nTrump’s move raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East and casts uncertainty over oil supplies in an already tight market.\nU.S. crude rose $1.95 to $71.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.09, up $2.24.\nThe energy sector in equity markets rallied, helping lift European stocks, a gauge of world equity performance and the broad U.S. market on Wall Street.\n“It’s the clear leader today. It’s overwhelming almost all the other sectors in terms of its impact on today’s market action,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.\nExxon Mobil rose 1.65 percent, Chevron gained 1.36 percent, Royal Dutch Shell [RDSb.L] rose 3.38 percent and BP [BP.L] rose 3.92 percent.\nWhile crude oil prices have rallied over the past 12 months, energy stocks have basically gone nowhere, which is helping their gains on Wednesday, Arone said.\n“Now we’re starting to see that gap close, so this could be a bit of a short-term rally for the energy sector,” he said.\nMSCI’s gauge of equity performance in 47 countries gained 0.25 percent, with Exxon and BP the second- and third-largest contributors.\nEnergy added the most points to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of regional stocks, rising 0.65 percent with Royal Dutch Shell and BP leading shares higher.\nOn Wall Street, stocks traded higher to mixed, but the S&P energy sector gained 2.1 percent, led by Exxon Mobil.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.19 points, or 0.04 percent, to 24,370.4. the S&P 500 gained 6.71 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,678.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.72 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,273.62.\nEquities have traded in a range recently on concerns about U.S.-China trade negotiations, a disparate view by the Federal Reserve and investors over inflation and the economy, and the notion that earnings and growth have peaked, Arone said.\n“Those things certainly have the market in a bit of a sideways pattern,” he said.\nThe dollar fell from its strongest levels in 2018 against a basket of currencies due to mild profit-taking, but the greenback was expected to resume its rise due to solid U.S. economic growth and further monetary tightening by the Fed.\nThe weaker dollar stemmed from a bounce in the euro, which hit a fresh low for the year in early trading before paring gains.\n“There’s a little exhaustion with the long-dollar trade, but I don’t think we’ve reached the end of it yet,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, FX and global macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.\nThe dollar index fell 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.03 percent to $1.1859. The Japanese yen weakened 0.53 percent versus the greenback at 109.72 per dollar.\nU.S. government bond yields fell across maturities as demand for safe-haven assets increased after Trump’s Iran announcement.\nBenchmark 10-year notes fell 8/32 in price, pushing their yield up to 2.9986 percent.\nIn Europe, the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs hit its widest in nearly six weeks on the possibility that a coalition of Italian anti-establishment parties would come to power.\nThe Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread widened five basis points immediately after news that 5-Star and the League had said they were holding last-minute talks to try to clinch a coalition deal.\nThe spread widened to 132.7 basis points, its widest since March 29.
