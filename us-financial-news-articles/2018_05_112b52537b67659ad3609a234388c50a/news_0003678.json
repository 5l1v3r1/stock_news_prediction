The company reported adjusted income, which excludes both the results of discontinued operations and certain other items that affect comparability of results between periods, of $40 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. The adjusted income excludes the following items: after-tax gain of $120 million associated with 2017 U.S. tax reform and a $12 million after-tax gain on foreign exchange, partially offset by a mark-to-market after-tax loss on crude oil derivative contracts of $11 million. Net cash provided from continuing operations was $279 million. This includes a one-time cash payment of $35 million for a Canadian tax withholding associated with repatriating cash from Canada to the U.S. The tax expense associated with the repatriation of cash was recorded in 2017. Details for first quarter results can be found in the attached schedules.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totaled $373 million, or $24.78 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) sold. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) totaled $402 million, or $26.70 per BOE sold. Details for first quarter EBITDA and EBITDAX reconciliation can be found in the attached schedules.\nProduction in the first quarter 2018 averaged 168,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD). Offshore production exceeded guidance primarily driven by Gulf of Mexico wells at Kodiak and Habanero coming back online with production levels above expectations, as well as higher uptime across all offshore assets (3,000 BOEPD). Onshore production in the Tupper Montney also exceeded production guidance primarily due to wells performing above expectation (900 BOEPD). This was partially offset by lower U.S. onshore production in the Eagle Ford Shale (1,500 BOEPD) due to the continued recovery of shut-in wells from offset operators’ frac operations as well as underperformance of wells in the Midland Basin (800 BOEPD).\n“Over the course of the first quarter, we had strong production results from our offshore assets in Malaysia and the Gulf of Mexico and our onshore Canadian assets in the Tupper Montney and Kaybob Duvernay. We were also able to achieve competitive margins across our oil-weighted assets for the U.S. and Malaysia operating areas. We continue to maintain our key balance sheet metrics while delivering on our 2018 plans. Our diverse, high margin portfolio coupled with the recent improvement in oil prices allows Murphy to generate free cash flow above our dividend this year,” stated Roger W. Jenkins, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had $2.8 billion of outstanding long-term, fixed-rate notes and $939 million in cash and cash equivalents. The fixed-rate notes have a weighted average maturity of 8.5 years and a weighted average coupon of 5.5 percent. The next senior note maturity for the company is in 2022. There were no borrowings on the $1.1 billion unsecured senior credit facility at quarter end.\nREGIONAL OPERATIONS SUMMARY\nNorth American Onshore\nThe North American onshore business produced 92 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOEPD) in the first quarter, with 47 percent liquids.\nEagle Ford Shale – Production in the quarter averaged 43 MBOEPD, with 88 percent liquids. During the quarter, the company brought six operated wells online, all of which were in the Tilden area in the Lower Eagle Ford Shale with average initial production rates over 30 days (IP30 rate) exceeding 700 BOEPD. By employing Gen 5.0 completions in the Tilden area, IP30 rates have improved 115 percent over the past six years.\n“In the first quarter, we had planned limited well delivery, as a result of focusing our drilling activity on a ten well pad in the Karnes area. These ten wells are part of the 22 operated wells we expect to bring online in the second quarter. The ten well pad at Karnes is important to learnings in the area as we were able to test a staggered lateral completion style that we believe could be beneficial for future pads. With the wells recently being placed on production, early indications are positive and we look forward to giving more conclusive results in the coming quarters,” stated Jenkins. “Our first quarter production was temporarily affected by a large number of our best Catarina wells being shut in for offset fracs from peers in the area. All of these wells have recently been brought back online,” Jenkins added.\nTupper Montney – Natural gas production in the quarter averaged 240 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD). The company drilled the remaining three wells on a five well pad, with all five wells expected to be brought online in the second quarter.\nFull cycle break-even costs, with a ten percent rate of return, continue to decrease and are currently C$1.90 AECO per thousand cubic feet (MCF). As a result of long-term forward sales contracts and other marketing agreements, Murphy achieved strong first quarter netbacks in the Tupper Montney of C$2.20 per MCF, consisting of a blended sales price of C$2.47 per MCF less C$0.27 per MCF of transportation costs. Furthermore, the company continues to significantly reduce its future multi-year exposure to AECO prices through a combination of forward sales contracts and market diversification to the Malin, Chicago, Emerson and Dawn markets.\nKaybob Duvernay – Production increased 92 percent from first quarter 2017, averaging near 5,500 BOEPD with 70 percent liquids. During the first quarter, the company continued appraising the play by drilling 12 wells and bringing online eight wells, including Murphy’s first wells in the Simonette area. The IP30 rates at the 15-16 two well pad averaged 985 BOEPD with 70 percent liquids, and one well at 01-12 averaged 900 BOEPD IP30 with 80 percent liquids. The 12-29 two well pad in the Kaybob East area flowed at an average of 1,040 BOEPD with 80% liquids. The 16-3 three well pad in the Saxon area was placed online just prior to quarter end, with the wells flowing above expectations.\n“Our appraisal of the Kaybob Duvernay is paying off. Since entering the play in 2016, we have meaningfully reduced drilling and completion costs, with recent pacesetter wells averaging below the $8.0 million mark. We are well on our way to achieving planned drilling and completions costs of $6.5 million per well that have average lateral lengths of approximately 9,000 feet. Currently, production rates are exceeding our expectations,” commented Jenkins.\nGlobal Offshore\nThe offshore business produced over 75 MBOEPD for the first quarter, with 72 percent liquids.\nMalaysia & Brunei – Production in the quarter averaged over 51 MBOEPD, with 63 percent liquids. Block K and Sarawak averaged over 31 thousand barrels of liquids per day, while Sarawak natural gas production averaged 107 MMCFD. The company continues to progress the Kikeh DTU gas lift project with expected startup in the third quarter 2018, as well as preparing for the production startup of Block H FLNG in 2020.\nNorth America – Production in the quarter for the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast Canada averaged 24 MBOEPD, with 91 percent liquids. The non-operated Kodiak well resumed production during the quarter with rates exceeding expectations. The well achieved gross rates over 25 MBOEPD, with net rates more than 6,100 BOEPD. The non-operated Habanero well was also brought back online during the quarter and is producing above expectations.\nEXPLORATION\nGulf of Mexico Exploration – During the first quarter, Murphy farmed into the Highgarden prospect (GC 895). At the March 2018 Gulf of Mexico lease sale, Murphy and it’s co-venturer were also the high bidder for two blocks with Miocene prospects, one at GC 939 and the other at MC 599.\nBrazil Exploration – During the first quarter, Murphy and its co-venturers, ExxonMobil and QGEP, were the successful bidders on blocks 430 and 573 in the Sergipe-Alagoas basin, with no well commitments. These two blocks are strategically located next to the company’s existing four block position.\n“We continue to execute on our focused exploration strategy by increasing our acreage in plays where we envision adding low-cost resources with meaningful upside. In the Gulf of Mexico, we are excited to get back to work as we recently spud our operated Samurai (GC 432) appraisal well with our new partner BHP. This well is consistent with our strategy of pursuing oil-weighted, lower risk opportunities with competitive returns and low finding and development costs,” commented Jenkins.\nPRODUCTION AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE GUIDANCE\nProduction for the second quarter 2018 is estimated to be in the range of 166 to 169 MBOEPD, with updated full year 2018 production guidance in the range of 167 to 170 MBOEPD. The low end of the full year production guidance is being increased by 1,000 BOEPD from the previous guidance.\nFull year capital expenditure guidance is being increased by five percent from $1.06 billion to $1.11 billion. Approximately three-quarters of the additional capital is attributable to the increased working interest to drill the Samurai appraisal well, increased working interest in Vietnam and workovers at the Medusa field in the Gulf of Mexico.\n“We are pleased with our first quarter production where our offshore fields delivered high-margin results for our company. We are increasing the midpoint of our annual guidance after our strong first quarter results. In the second quarter, we look forward to delivering 22 operated wells in the Eagle Ford Shale as well as re-igniting our exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico. Also, following spring break-up, we will be resuming our drilling and completions activities in the Duvernay,” stated Jenkins.\nDetails for production can be found in the attached schedules.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST SCHEDULED FOR MAY 3, 2018\nMurphy will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 financial and operating results on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET.
