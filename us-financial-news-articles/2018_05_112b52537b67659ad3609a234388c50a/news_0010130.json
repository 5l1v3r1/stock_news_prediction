(NASDAQ:EIGI), a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small and medium-sized businesses succeed online, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with our financial and operating progress in the first quarter,” commented Jeffrey H. Fox, president and chief executive officer of Endurance International Group. \"With a majority of the year still ahead of us, we remain focused on executing our integrated operating plan. In 2018 we are investing to deliver increased customer value in our market-leading assets and simplify our operations to execute more effectively at scale.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $291.4 million, a decrease of 1 percent compared to $295.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.1 million compared to net loss of $31.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss attributable to Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.1 million, or $(0.05) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $35.4 million, or $(0.26) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $86.2 million, an increase of 8 percent compared to $80.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of a total of $8.5 million of accrued expense reserved in connection with our ongoing efforts to resolve two shareholder lawsuits, each brought as a class action against either Endurance or Constant Contact. Any final settlement agreement reached with the plaintiffs in each case would be subject to court approval. Thus, we can make no assurance that any final agreement will be reached, or that any final settlement agreement will be approved by the court. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $52.4 million, an increase of 55 percent compared to $33.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and capital lease obligations, for the first quarter of 2018 was $44.9 million, an increase of 100 percent compared to $22.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter Operating Highlights\nTotal subscribers on platform at March 31, 2018 were approximately 5.011 million, compared to approximately 5.304 million subscribers at March 31, 2017 and approximately 5.051 million subscribers at December 31, 2017. See “Total Subscribers” below. Average revenue per subscriber, or ARPS, for the first quarter of 2018 was $19.30, compared to $18.43 for the first quarter of 2017 and $19.28 for the fourth quarter of 2017. See “Average Revenue Per Subscriber” below.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nThe company’s prior guidance, announced on February 13, 2018, remains unchanged. As of the date of this release, May 1, 2018, for the full year ending December 31, 2018, the company expects:\n2017 Actual\nas Reported Guidance\n(as of May 1, 2018) GAAP revenue $1.177 billion $1.140 to $1.160 billion Adjusted EBITDA $351 million $310 to $330 million Free cash flow $151 million ~$120 million Free cash flow guidance does not include the impact of potential settlements of pending legal proceedings. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is provided in the financial statement tables included at the end of this press release.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nEndurance International Group’s first quarter 2018 financial results teleconference and webcast is scheduled to begin at 8:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 1, 2018. To participate on the live call, analysts and investors should dial (888) 734-0328 at least ten minutes prior to the call. Endurance International Group will also offer a live and archived webcast of the conference call, accessible from the Investor Relations section of the company’s website at http://ir.endurance.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP or includes amounts that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. For example, adjusted EBITDA excludes interest expense, which has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the additional information about adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow shown below, including the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net (loss) income, excluding the impact of interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization of other intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring expenses, transaction expenses and charges, (gain) loss of unconsolidated entities, impairment of other long-lived assets, SEC investigations reserve (with respect to fiscal year and third quarter 2017), and shareholder litigation reserve. We view adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and believe it helps investors evaluate and compare our core operating performance from period to period.\nFree Cash Flow, or FCF, is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and capital lease obligations. We believe that FCF provides investors with an indicator of our ability to generate positive cash flows after meeting our obligations with regard to capital expenditures (including capital lease obligations).\nKey Operating Metrics\nTotal Subscribers - We define total subscribers as the approximate number of subscribers that, as of the end of a period, are identified as subscribing directly to our products on a paid basis, excluding accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us. Subscribers of more than one brand, and subscribers with more than one distinct billing relationship or subscription with us, are counted as separate subscribers. Total subscribers for a period reflects adjustments to add or subtract subscribers as we integrate acquisitions and/or are otherwise able to identify subscribers that meet, or do not meet, this definition of total subscribers. There were no adjustments for the first quarter of 2018.\nAverage Revenue Per Subscriber (ARPS) - We calculate ARPS as the amount of revenue we recognize in a period, including marketing development funds and other revenue not received from subscribers, divided by the average of the number of total subscribers at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period, which we refer to as average subscribers for the period, divided by the number of months in the period. See definition of “Total Subscribers” above. ARPS does not represent an exact measure of the average amount a subscriber spends with us each month, since our calculation of ARPS is impacted by revenues generated by non-subscribers.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements concerning our financial guidance for fiscal year 2018, our expectations regarding our investments to deliver increased customer value, simplify our operations, and operate more effectively at scale, and our expected financial and operational performance in general.
