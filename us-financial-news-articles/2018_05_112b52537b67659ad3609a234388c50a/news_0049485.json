This was due to a number of factors, including one-offs,” Latsanych told Reuters during an economic forum in St Petersburg. “We would like to let (the market) know that the growth pace of the first quarter should not be expected in the coming quarters because there are no particular economic preconditions for it.”\nOfficials expect Russia’s economy to grow by up to 2 percent this year but it only expanded by 1.3 percent from a year earlier in January-March.\n“In the first quarter, the economy did not expand as we did - this means that we could find new sources of growth... But we may fail to find them in the second or third quarters,” he said.\nLatsanych previously worked as vice president for strategy and marketing at MTS , Russia’s top mobile phone operator.\nDATA LAW INVESTMENTS A new law will come into effect on Oct. 1 requiring telecoms operators in Russia to store user communications data for up to six months, part of broader counter-terrorism legislation aimed at bolstering state security.\nFor telecom groups, that means extra spending on hardware, which Veon had preliminarily estimated at 45 billion roubles ($725 million) for the next five years, of which 6 billion in 2018.\nLatsanych said the lion’s share of the company’s investments related to the legislation would fall in 2019.\n“The law is a “black swan”. Its implementation will force us to invest more than we planned and more than last year,” Latsanych said.\n“It will pressure our cashflow but not the efficiency, efficiency should stay at a high level,” he said, adding the bulk of investments would be reflected in capital expenditure while operating costs would be largely unaffected.
