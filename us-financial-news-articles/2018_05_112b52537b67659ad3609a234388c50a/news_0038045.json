(\"RYB\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: RYB), a leading early childhood education service provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational and Financial Summary\nNumber of students enrolled at RYB directly operated kindergartens was 22,087 as of March 31, 2018, an 11.3% increase from 19,850 as of March 31, 2017. Number of franchise play-and-learn centers and kindergartens in operation were 966 and 212 as of March 31, 2018, respectively. Net revenues increased by 8.4% to $28.8 million, compared with $26.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit was $0.6 million, compared with $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.7 million, compared with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders [1] of RYB for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.0 million, compared with adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Cash generated from operating activities was $5.3 million during the first quarter of 2018.\n\"The Company delivered 8.4% net revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018, as the number of directly operated kindergartens increased to 86 as of March 31, 2018 from 81 a year ago, and student enrollment at directly operated kindergartens increased by 11.3% year-over-year to 22,087 from the first quarter of 2017,\" said Ms. Yanlai Shi, Co-founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer of RYB Education Inc. \"In addition, we continue to make positive strides, implementing more stringent teacher recruitment requirements and training standards, raising teaching quality together with teachers' compensation levels, enhancing security and safety standards at our facilities and refining our security monitoring and management systems. We have also invited parents into our facilities to experience our open classes along with other efforts aimed at making our facilities more secure and transparent. We firmly believe that by following this path we can better the lives of our children and their families while enabling us to achieve our growth objectives and provide healthy long-term value,\" Ms. Shi concluded.\nMs. Ping Wei, Chief Financial Officer of RYB Education Inc., added, \"Despite the first quarter being a seasonally soft quarter for the industry due to the Chinese New Year and school breaks, and this year in particular due to the late timing of Chinese New Year and the extreme weather right before the Chinese New Year, we achieved an 8.4% increase in net revenues and smaller adjusted net loss than we initially expected in the first quarter of 2017. As we continue our work to implement higher security and safety standards at our facilities and continue our investments to further enhance teaching and service quality, we expect our spending to be at a heightened level this year. In addition, our decision at the end of last year to temporarily suspend the addition of new franchisees while providing financial relief, as well as more operational and training support to our existing franchisees, will result in a temporary slow-down in franchise revenues and a lower franchise business-related margin in 2018. However, we expect this impact to be short-term, without materially impacting our long-term growth trajectory beyond this year.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 8.4% to $28.8 million, from $26.5 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nService revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 8.3% to $26.0 million, from $24.0 million for the same quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of students enrolled at our directly operated kindergartens and increases in training and other service revenues.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ACS 606) applying the modified retrospective method to all contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for the prior periods. More specifically, under ASC 606, the initial franchise fee collected is amortized over the initial set-up service period; while under ASC 605, it was recognized as revenue upon our franchisees open their facilities for business operation. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard of $0.9 million is recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity upon adoption.\nProduct revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 8.8% to $2.8 million, from $2.5 million for the same quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of merchandise sold through the Company's franchise network.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the first quarter of 2018 was $28.1 million, a 23.2% increase from $22.8 million for the same quarter of 2017. Cost of services revenues for the first quarter of 2018 was $26.7 million, compared with $21.4 million for the same quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in staff compensation at the Company's directly operated kindergartens and play-and-learn centers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in compensation to our franchise service and supervision team. Cost of products revenues for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.4 million, compared with $1.5 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 83.1% to $0.6 million, compared with $3.7 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 2.2%, compared with 13.9% for the same quarter last year primarily due to the increase in staff compensation at directly operated facilities and lower margin from franchise fee revenues and training revenues as the Company provided one-off preferential training rates and annual franchise fee relief to its franchisees.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.8 million, a 106.8% increase from $2.8 million for the same quarter of 2017. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, operating expenses were $4.1 million.\nSelling expenses of $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 remained flat compared with $0.3 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.5 million, a 123.4% increase from $2.5 million for the same quarter of 2017. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, G&A expenses were $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, a 54.1% increase from $2.5 million for the same quarter of 2017. The increase in G&A expense excluding share-based compensation expenses was primarily due to higher cash compensation cost and additional expenses incurred in professional service fees. The share-based-compensation included in G&A expense was $1.7 million for the quarter.\nOperating Income/Loss\nOperating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.1 million, compared with operating income of $0.9 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating loss [2] was $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with adjusted operating income of $0.9 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nNet Income/Loss\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.7 million, compared with net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $1.0 million for the same quarter of 2017. Adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB, which excludes the impact of $1.8 million of share-based compensation expense for the first quarter of 2018, was $1.0 million, compared with adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of $1.0 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nBasic and diluted net loss per American depositary share (\"ADS\") attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.09 and $0.09, respectively, compared with basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB of $0.05 and $0.04, respectively for the same quarter of 2017. Each ADS represents one Class A ordinary share.\nAdjusted basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders [3] of RYB for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.03 and $0.03, respectively, compared with adjusted basic and diluted net income per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB of $0.05 and $0.04, respectively for the same quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA [4] for the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of $2.8 million, compared with an income of $2.4 million for the same period of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA [5] for the first quarter of 2018 was a loss of $1.0 million, compared with an income of $2.4 million for the same quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total cash, cash equivalents and term deposits of $162.8 million, compared with $158.7 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOperating Cash Flow\nCash generated from operating activities was $5.3 million during the first quarter of 2018. The cash inflow in the quarter was primarily driven by the advance tuition payments from our directly-operated facilities partially offset by the refund of security deposits and franchise fees to potential and contracted franchisees.\nRecent Developments\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 80% equity interest with a franchisee for four of the Company's franchise kindergartens in Shandong province. The total consideration for this acquisition is around RMB39.0 million (US$6.2 million) in cash. In addition, the Company has entered into agreements with third parties to acquire two kindergarten facilities that are ready to be used.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company currently expects:\nNet revenues to be between $41.6 million and $43.5 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% to 15%.\nFor the full year of 2018, the Company currently expects:\nNet revenues to be between $154.9 million and $166.1 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 10% to 18%.\nThe above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company's current and preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions and customer demand, which are all subject to change.\nConference Call\nThe Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on May 16, 2018 (8:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong time on May 16, 2018).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nUnited States (toll free):\n1-888-317-6003\nInternational:\n1-412-317-6061\nChina (toll free):\n400-120-6115\nHong Kong (toll free):\n800-963-976\nParticipants Elite Entry Number:\n0989873\nParticipants should dial-in at least 5 minutes before the scheduled start time and ask to be connected to the call for \"RYB Education.\"\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company's investor relations website at http://ir.rybbaby.com .\nA replay of the conference call will be accessible until May 23, 2018, by dialing the following telephone numbers:\nUnited States (toll free):\n1-877-344-7529\nInternational:\n1-412-317-0088\nReplay Access Code:\n10120299\nAbout RYB Education, Inc.\nFounded on the core values of \"Care\" and \"Responsibility\", \"Inspire\" and \"Innovate\", RYB Education, Inc. is a leading early childhood education service provider in China.
