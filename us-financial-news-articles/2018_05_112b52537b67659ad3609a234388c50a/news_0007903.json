Tony Makuch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kirkland Lake Gold, commented: “We had a strong quarter in Q1 2018 and continued to be a top performer in our industry in terms of profitability and free cash flow. Our Q1 2018 results surpassed target levels for the quarter in most key areas and, as a result, we entered the second quarter tracking very well against our consolidated 2018 guidance. Looking ahead, we expect higher levels of production as the year progresses, which will contribute to further improvements in unit costs. Our capital expenditures will increase from Q1 2018 levels over the balance of the year as we ramp up the Macassa shaft project and key growth projects at Fosterville. At Macassa, work on the shaft project in Q1 2018 was focused on permitting and engineering, with surface construction commencing in the second quarter. At Fosterville, a number of permits were received in April, which will lead to an acceleration of work going forward.\n“Turning to exploration, we continue to make significant progress with very encouraging results recently being announced that support our commitment to aggressive organic growth. At Fosterville, we intersected visible-gold bearing mineralization at Robbin’s Hill, located approximately 3.8 km from the Fosterville mine. The mineralization has similarities to the high-grade, visible-gold hosted quartz veins encountered in the Eagle and Swan zones of the Lower Phoenix system at Fosterville. In the Northern Territory, we identified a second potential source of production with gold mineralization being intersected below historic open pits on the property of our processing plant at Union Reefs. In Canada, underground drilling at Macassa continues to return high-grade intersections both within and outside current Mineral Resource blocks, highlighting the significant potential for further growth in both reserves and resources. At Taylor, recent drilling has provided additional confirmation that our existing gold deposits are part of a large mineralized system. Last week, we announced a 150-metre extension of the new gold zone we discovered late last year below the West Porphyry Deposit. We also announced continued success intersecting high-grade mineralization along the Porcupine Destor Fault, with our furthest intersection now being 2.9 km east of the mine. We regard both Taylor and the Northern Territory as dark horses within our portfolio, as they do not attract a lot of attention, but have both consistently generated encouraging drill results and demonstrated potential for growth.”\nReview of Financial and Operating Performance\nThe following discussion provides key summarized consolidated financial and operating information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 include production and costs related to the Northern Territory operations in Australia, which were placed on care and maintenance effective June 30, 2017. Also, results for Q1 2017 have been restated to exclude discontinued operations, related to the sale of the Stawell Mine.\nTable 1.

Production, Sales and Revenue\nThe Company produced 147,644 ounces in Q1 2018, an increase of 13% from 130,425 ounces in Q1 2017. Excluding production from mines currently on care and maintenance, including Northern Territory and the Holloway mine, total consolidated production for Q1 2018 grew by 22% to 147,611 ounces from 121,066 ounces in Q1 2017. Both Fosterville and Macassa achieved solid production growth compared to the same period in 2017 due to higher average grades. Fosterville produced 63,843 ounces in Q1 2018, a 39% increase from 46,083 ounces in Q1 2017. The average grade at Fosterville in Q1 2018 was 16.8 g/t versus 11.1 g/t in Q1 2017, consistent with the trend at Fosterville towards improving grades at depth. Macassa achieved record quarterly production in Q1 2018 of 54,038 ounces, an 11% increase from 48,723 ounces in Q1 2017. The increase from Q1 2017 was primarily related to an improvement in the average grade, to 19.9 g/t from 17.1 g/t in Q1 2017, reflecting the mining of higher-grade stopes as well as the impact of favourable grade performance late in Q1 2018. Higher levels of mill throughput resulted in increases of 9% and 19%, respectively, in production at Holt and Taylor, to 16,675 ounces and 13,055 ounces, respectively, in Q1 2018 versus 15,318 ounces and 10,942 ounces, respectively in Q1 2017.\nQ1 2018 production compared to record quarterly production of 166,579 ounces in Q4 2017. The main contributor to the change in production from Q4 2017 was the impact of a greater proportion of high-grade stopes mined at Fosterville during Q4 2017, consistent with the mine plan. Production at Fosterville in Q4 2017 totaled 79,157 ounces, with grades averaging 21.5 g/t for the quarter. Production at Macassa in Q1 2018 was 5% higher than 51,608 ounces in Q4 2017, as a 43% increase in the average grade (19.9 g/t in Q1 2018 versus 13.9 g/t in Q4 2017) more than offset a reduction in tonnes processed. Both Holt and Taylor achieved record levels of production in Q4 2017 (19,263 ounces at Holt and 16,541 ounces at Taylor), with the change in Q1 2018 mainly resulting from lower average grades at both mines in Q1 2018 consistent with their respective mine plans.\nGold sales Q1 2018 totaled 147,763 ounces, a 7% increase from 137,841 ounces in Q1 2017. The realized gold price in Q1 2018 averaged $1,333 per ounce, an increase of 10% from $1,225 per ounce in Q1 2017. Through a combination of increased sales and a higher average gold price, revenue in Q1 2018 totaled $198.2 million, 18% higher than revenue of $168.5 million in Q1 2017. Excluding the impact of mines currently on care and maintenance, primarily the $12.6 million of revenue from the Northern Territory in Q1 2017, revenue grew 27% year over year. Revenue in Q1 2018 compared to total revenue of $212.4 million in Q4 2017, with record quarterly gold sales of 165,715 ounces during the prior quarter more than offsetting a 5% increase in the average gold price in Q1 2018 in accounting for the change in revenue quarter over quarter.\nEarnings from Mine Operations\nEarnings from mine operations in Q1 2018 totaled $98.2 million, more than double the Q1 2017 total $47.8 million. The increase from the same period in 2017 reflected strong revenue growth, as well as lower production costs, largely due to the inclusion of production costs for the Northern Territory operations in Q1 2017 prior to the mine being placed on care and maintenance effective June 30, 2017. Also contributing to the year-over-year improvement in earnings from mine operations was a $7.5 million or 21% reduction in depletion and depreciation costs, as the impact of higher gold production was more than offset by a significant increase in the level of depletable Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at the Company’s operations following the release of the Company’s December 31, 2017 Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates on February 20, 2018. Royalty expense in Q1 2018 totaled $6.0 million versus $4.7 million in Q1 2017, with the increase mainly reflecting higher sales volumes.\nEarnings from mine operations in Q1 2018 increased 6% from $92.3 million in Q4 2017. The quarter over quarter increase was due to a $17.7 million or 39% reduction in depletion and depreciation costs, reflecting higher levels of depletable Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources in Q1 2018, as well as lower levels of production costs and royalty expense. These factors more than offset the impact of higher revenue in Q4 2017 based on record quarterly gold sales during the prior quarter.\nUnit Cost Performance (See Non-IFRS measures)\nFor Q1 2018, operating cash costs per ounce sold averaged $447, a 21% improvement from $564 in Q1 2017. The improvement from Q1 2017 mainly reflected significantly higher sales volume from higher average grades at Fosterville and Macassa in Q1 2018 compared to the same period the previous year. AISC per ounce sold averaged $833, 5% better than $873 in Q1 2017. The reduction in operating cash costs per ounce sold more than offset higher levels of sustaining capital expenditures per ounce sold in accounting for the improvement year over year. Sustaining capital expenditures averaged $285 per ounce sold in Q1 2018 versus $231 per ounce sold in Q1 2017. Operating cash cost per ounce sold increased from $412 the previous quarter, mainly reflecting the impact of higher volume of sales from higher average grades in Q4 2017. AISC per ounce sold in Q1 2018 compared to $816 Q4 2017, as the impact of higher operating cash costs per ounce sold compared to a quarter ago was largely offset by a reduction in sustaining capital expenditures per ounce sold ($285 in Q1 2018 versus $312 per ounce sold in Q4 2017). Sustaining capital expenditures in 2017 were weighted to the final quarter of the year.\nAdditional Expenses\nExploration and evaluation expenditures in Q1 2018 were substantially higher than in Q1 2017 and the previous quarter, increasing 91% and 57%, respectively, to $16.7 million. The increase from both prior periods reflected the Company’s significant commitment to aggressive organic growth through continued exploration success. Exploration and evaluation expenditures in 2018 are heavily weighted to Australia, with Fosterville accounting for $5.8 million of exploration expenditures in Q1 2018 and the Northern Territory accounting for and additional $8.1 million, with the remainder being incurred at Taylor and Macassa.\nGeneral and administrative expense (excluding share-based payments expense and transaction costs) totaled $6.9 million in Q1 2018, which compared to $4.4 million in Q1 2017 and $6.1 million the previous quarter. The level of general and administrative expense in Q1 2018 largely reflected the weighting of legal and audit fees and incentive compensation expense to the first quarter of the year.\nShare-based payment expense in Q1 2018 totaled $1.8 million, compared to $1.2 million in Q1 2017 and $0.7 million in Q4 2017. The increase from both prior periods reflects a higher volume of restricted-share units (“RSUs”) and performance-share units (“PSUs”) granted during the quarter.\nOther income in Q1 2018 totaled $5.4 million compared to other income of $0.1 million in Q1 2017 and other loss of $19.2 million in Q4 2017. The main factors contributing to the increase in other income (loss) from Q1 2017 were realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains as a result of the US dollar strengthening by 4% in the quarter and a $2.3 million pre-tax mark-to-market gain on fair valuing the Company's 14.0 million common share purchase warrants in Novo Resources Corp. (“Novo”), which the Company did not own in Q1 2017. The change in other income from Q4 2017 mainly related to the fair valuing of the Novo warrants, with a pre-tax mark-to-market loss of $17.6 million being recorded in Q4 2017 compared to the pre-tax gain of $2.3 million in Q1 2018.\nCare and maintenance expense in Q1 2018 totaled $0.8 million, which compared to care and maintenance expense of $2.4 million in Q1 2017 and a recovery on care and maintenance expense of $2.2 million in Q4 2017. Care and maintenance expense in Q1 2018 related to the Company’s Northern Territory operation in Australia (placed on care and maintenance effective June 30, 2017) and the Holloway mine in Northern Ontario (placed on care and maintenance effective December 31, 2016). Care and maintenance expense in Q1 2017 related solely to the Holloway mine. The recovery on care and maintenance expense recorded in Q4 2017 of $2.2 million reflected the reclassification to discontinued operations of year-to-date 2017 and 2016 expenses, including care and maintenance expenses for Stawell, which was placed on care and maintenance effective December 13, 2016 and was sold on December 21, 2017.\nFinance costs in Q1 2018 totaled $0.7 million versus $3.3 million in Q1 2017 and $3.5 million in Q4 2017. The change in finance costs from Q1 2017 mainly related to the maturity of two series of convertible debentures in 2017 following the end of last year’s first quarter. The Company’s C$56.8 million 6% unsecured convertible debentures (\"6% convertible debentures\") matured and were repaid on June 30, 2017, while the C$62.1 million 7.5% unsecured convertible debentures (\"7.5% convertible debentures\") matured on December 31, 2017, with over 99% being converted into Kirkland Lake Gold common shares. The level of finance costs in Q1 2017 largely related to interest payments on both series of debentures. Finance costs in Q4 2017 reflected interest costs on the 7.5% convertible debentures, as well as finance fees and bank charges. Finance income in Q1 2018 totaled $0.7 million, which compared to $0.6 million in Q1 2017 and $0.5 million the previous quarter.\nThe Company's total income tax expense is higher than Q1 2017 and previous quarters due to higher taxable income. Current income tax expense totaled $5.1 million in Q1 2018, along with deferred tax expense of $18.3 million. The deferred tax expense in Q1 2018 resulted from the utilization of $12.4 million of deferred tax assets to reduce current income tax expense. In Q1 2017, current income tax expense totaled $6.6 million, while deferred income tax expense totaled $6.2 million. The Company reported a net deferred tax recovery of $10.0 million in Q4 2017 comprised of a one-time net deferred tax recovery of $52.6 million offset by a one-time current and deferred tax expense of $42.6 million related to the tax impacts of Australian reorganizations and Canadian flow through shares.\nNet Earnings in Q1 2018 total $53.8 million or $0.25 per basic share\nNet earnings in Q1 2018 totaled $53.8 million ($0.25 per basic share), an increase of $40.7 million from net earnings of $13.1 million ($0.06 per basic share) in Q1 2017. The Company’s net earnings in Q1 2018 were entirely related to continuing operations. Net earnings in Q1 2017 included net earnings from continuing operations of $15.4 million ($0.08 per basic share) and a loss from discontinued operations of $2.2 million ($0.02 per basic share), with the loss from discontinued operations related to care and maintenance expenses and the sale of the Stawell mine effective December 21, 2017. The significant growth in net earnings in Q1 2018 compared to earnings from continuing operations in Q1 2017 mainly related to the impact of increased production and revenue, lower production costs and reduced depletion and depreciation expenses. The reduction in depletion and depreciation costs was due to a significant increase in the level of depletable Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at the Company's operations following the release of its December 31, 2017 Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates on February 20, 2018. The Company also benefitted from higher other income and lower finance costs in Q1 2018 compared to the previous year's first quarter. The increase in other income was mainly due to realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains as a result of the US dollar strengthening by 4% during the quarter, as well as the impact of a $2.3 million pre-tax mark-to-market gain on the fair valuing of the Company's 14.0 million Novo warrants. These favourable factors more than offset the impact of a 91% increase in exploration expenditures, reflecting the Company’s commitment to aggressive organic growth through continued exploration success, as well as higher levels of deferred tax expense and general and administrative expenses.\nQ1 2018 net earnings compared to net earnings of $41.0 million ($0.20 per basic share) the previous quarter, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $24.9 million ($0.12 per basic share) related to care and maintenance expenses and the sale of Stawell. Net earnings in Q1 2018 compared to earnings from continuing operations in Q4 2017 of $65.9 million ($0.32 per basic share) with the quarter over quarter change mainly due to higher sales volumes in Q4 2017, a significant increase in exploration expenditures in Q1 2018, as well as the impact of $18.3 million of deferred tax expense in Q1 2018 compared to a $10.0 million net deferred tax recovery in Q4 2017. Partially offsetting these factors were a significant reduction in depletion and depreciation expenditures in Q1 2018, as well as the impact of the $2.3 million pre-tax mark-to-market gain in Q1 2018 on the fair valuing the Company's Novo warrants, which compared to a pre-tax mark-to-market loss of $17.6 million in Q4 2017.\nAdjusted net Earnings (Non-IFRS) in Q1 2018 total $52.6 million or $0.25 per basic share\nThe Company's adjusted net earnings from continuing operations totaled $52.6 million ($0.25 per basic share) in Q1 2018 representing growth of $35.1 million or 201% from adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $17.5 million ($0.09 per basic share) in Q1 2017. The growth of $35.1 million is a result of increased production and revenue, lower production costs and reduced depletion and depreciation costs. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations in Q4 2017 totaled $71.2 million ($0.34 per basic share), which excluded the $24.9 million after-tax loss on discontinued operations ($0.12 per share), the $17.6 million pre-tax mark-to-market loss on the fair valuing the Company’s 14.0 million Novo warrants ($0.08 per share) and the net deferred tax recovery of $10.0 million ($0.05 per share).\nQ1 2018 cash flow from operating activities of $89.6 million, free cash flow (Non-IFRS) totals $50.2 million\nCash totaled $275.3 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $231.6 million at December 31, 2017. The $43.7 million or 19% increase in cash in Q1 2018 was largely related to strong cash flow from operating activities, as well as the $12.4 million reduction in cash taxes paid as a result of the utilization of tax losses in Q1 2018 and the timing for capital and exploration expenditures, which are expected to be weighted to the second half of 2018.\nCash flow from operating activities of continuing operations in Q1 2018 totaled $89.6 million, which compared to $67.9 million in Q1 2017 and record cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations of $103.4 million in Q4 2017. Free cash flow in Q1 2018 totaled $50.2 million, a 30.1% increase from $38.5 million in Q1 2017 and compared to record quarterly free cash flow of $64.5 million in Q4 2017.\nPerformance Against 2018 Guidance\nIn 2017, Kirkland Lake Gold achieved all of the Company’s consolidated production and unit cost guidance. On January 17, 2018, the Company announced its guidance for full-year 2018, which includes increased production levels compared to 2017, improved unit costs and higher levels of capital and exploration expenditures. Following completion of Q1 2018, the Company's full-year 2018 guidance remained unchanged. The increase in capital and exploration expenditures is being undertaken in support of achieving the Company’s longer-term objective of growing annual gold production over the next five to seven years to approximately a million ounces.\nTable 3. 2018 Guidance (1) (as at February 21, 2018)\nMacassa Taylor Holt Fosterville Consolidated Gold production (,000 ozs) 215 – 225 60 – 70 65 – 75 260 – 300 +620 Op. cash costs ($/oz) 2 475 - 500 625 – 650 625 – 650 270 – 290 $425 - $450 AISC/ounce sold ($/oz) 2 $750 - $800 Operating cash costs ($M) 2 $260 - $270 Royalty costs ($M) $22 - $27 Sustaining capital ($M) 2 $150 – $170 Growth capital ($M) 2 $85 – $95 Exploration ($M) $75 – $90 Corporate G&A ($M) 3 $20 – $22\n(1) Represents the Company’s guidance for which the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was measured against.

The Macassa mine achieved record quarterly production of 54,038 ounces in Q1 2018. The Company remains on track to achieve its full-year 2018 consolidated production guidance of over 620,000 ounces, with production volumes to increase in the second half of the year, including at Fosterville with the commencement of stope production from the Swan Zone. Production guidance for each of the Company’s mines remains unchanged following the completion of the first quarter of 2018.\nProduction costs for Q1 2018 totalled $66.1 million. Operating cash costs for the quarter of $66.0 million were in line with the Company’s 2018 guidance range of $260 - $270 million, and compared to $80.6 million in Q1 2017 and $68.3 million in Q4 2017.\nOperating cash costs per ounce sold for Q1 2018 averaged $447, in line with the Company's guidance for full-year 2018 of $425 - $450. Operating cash costs per ounce sold at Fosterville were in line with the mine's full-year 2018 guidance. Operating cash costs per ounce sold at Macassa and Holt were at the top end of the target ranges for the full-year, with improvements expected over the balance of 2018. Operating cash costs at the Taylor of $681 per ounce sold were above the full-year 2018 target range. Operating cash costs per ounce sold at Taylor are expected to improve as average grades increase over the balance of the year and the rate of operating development is reduced. Following the end of Q1 2018, the Company remained well positioned to achieve full-year 2018 guidance for operating cash costs per ounce sold on a consolidated basis, as well as at each of its mines.\nAISC per ounce sold of $833 for Q1 2018 exceeded the Company’s full-year 2018 guidance of $750 - $800. AISC per ounce sold is expected to improve in the second half of the year as sales volumes increase and the level of sustaining capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses on a per ounce sold basis are reduced from Q1 2018.\nRoyalty costs totaled $6.0 million for Q1 2018, in line with full-year 2018 guidance of $22 - $27 million.\nSustaining capital expenditures for Q1 2018 totaled $42.1 million. The Company remains on track to achieve full-year 2018 guidance of $150 - $170 million.\nGrowth capital expenditures of $6.5 million were lower than anticipated in Q1 2018, largely due to the timing for permitting and procurement. Construction and development work at both Macassa and Fosterville is expected to ramp up over the balance of the year, with full-year 2018 guidance remaining unchanged.\nExploration expenditures of $16.7 million in Q1 2018 are expected to increase over the remainder of the year as work advances on exploration development drifts at both Fosterville and in the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory, work commenced around the end of Q1 2018 on two development drifts from the existing Cosmo ramp towards the Lantern Deposit in support of future underground drilling. At Fosterville, permits were received early in Q2 2018 for an exploration drift that will support drilling to test downplunge mineralization in the Harrier South system, where there has been a trend towards higher grades at depth with increased occurrence of visible gold. The Company continues to target total exploration expenditures of $75 – $90 million for full-year 2018.\nCorporate G&A expense totaled $6.9 million in Q1 2018, reflecting a weighting of these expenditures to the early part of the year. Corporate G&A expense remains on track to achieve full-year guidance of $20 - $22 million.\nQ1 2018 Financial Results and Conference Call Details\nA conference call to discuss the Q1 2018 results will be held by senior management on Thursday, May 3, 2018, at 10:00 am ET.

The production profile of the company is anchored from two high-grade, low-cost operations, including the Macassa Mine located in Northeastern Ontario and the Fosterville Mine located in the state of Victoria, Australia. Kirkland Lake Gold's solid base of quality assets is complemented by district scale exploration potential, supported by a strong financial position with extensive management and operational expertise.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS measures in this document, as discussed below. The Company believes that these measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers. For a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures described below, please see the Non-IFRS Measures section of the MD&A for three months ended March 31, 2018 beginning on page 27. Non-IFRS reconciliations for Q4 2017 are provided in the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn the gold mining industry, free cash flow is a common performance measure with no standardized meaning. Free cash flow is calculated by deducting capital cash spending (capital expenditures for the period, net of expenditures paid through finance leases) from cash flows from operations.\nThe Company discloses free cash flow as it believes the measures provide valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company’s ability to generate cash flow. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is cash flows generated from operations.\nOperating Cash Costs and Operating Cash Costs per Ounce Sold\nOperating cash costs and operating cash cost per ounce sold are non-IFRS measures. In the gold mining industry, these metrics are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Operating cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing and administration, but exclude royalty expenses, depreciation and depletion and share based payment expenses and reclamation costs. Operating cash costs per ounce sold is based on ounces sold and is calculated by dividing operating cash costs by volume of ounces sold.\nThe Company discloses operating cash costs and operating cash cost per ounce sold as it believes the measures provide valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company’s operational performance and ability to generate cash flow. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is total production expenses. Operating cash costs and operating cash cost per ounce of gold sold should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nSustaining and Growth Capital\nSustaining capital and growth capital are Non-IFRS measures. Sustaining capital is defined as capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels. Growth capital is defined as capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\nAISC and AISC per Ounce Sold\nAISC and AISC per ounce sold are Non-IFRS measures. These measures are intended to assist readers in evaluating the total costs of producing gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning across the industry for this measure, the Company’s definition conforms to the definition of AISC as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance note dated June 27, 2013.\nThe Company defines AISC as the sum of operating costs (as defined and calculated above), royalty expenses, sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels), corporate expenses, underground exploration expenses and reclamation cost accretion related to current operations. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses, net of transaction related costs, severance expenses for management changes and interest income. AISC excludes growth capital, reclamation cost accretion not related to current operations, interest expense, debt repayment and taxes.\nAverage Realized Price per Ounce Sold\nIn the gold mining industry, average realized price per ounce sold is a common performance measure that does not have any standardized meaning. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is revenue from gold sales. Average realized price per ounces sold should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the total revenues realized in a period from current operations.\nAdjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per Share\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations are used by management and investors to measure the underlying operating performance of the Company.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations is defined as net earnings adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of specific items that are significant, but not reflective of the underlying operations of the Company, including transaction costs and executive severance payments, purchase price adjustments reflected in inventory, and other non-recurring items. Adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”)\nEBITDA from continuing operations represents net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is an indicator of the Company’s ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations, and fund capital expenditures.\nWorking Capital\nWorking capital is a Non-IFRS measure. In the gold mining industry, working capital is a common measure of liquidity but does not have any standardized meaning.\nThe most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is current assets and current liabilities. Working capital is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets. Working capital should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute from measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the Company’s liquidity.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe exploration, development and mining of mineral deposits involves significant risks, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate.
