Beginning in 2020, it requires on almost all new homes, condos and apartment buildings be equipped with solar power. While many municipalities across the country have enacted similar renewable energy mandates, California was the first to implement such a solar mandate statewide.\nIn California, currently only 15 to 20 percent of new single-family homes are built with solar power, according to the California Building Industry Association. So, the impact of the new mandate could boost this market by five or six times.\nThe Dow Chemical Company sold earlier generations of the POWERHOUSE™ product to state and national homebuilders, as well as local roofing companies. RGS’ plans to commercialize the next generation product, POWERHOUSE™ 3.0, with direct sales to homebuilders and local roofing companies, each of whom will be trained by RGS to sell and install the product before becoming a POWERHOUSE™ Dealer.\nPOWERHOUSE™ 3.0 has significant advantages over traditional retrofit solar systems. In addition to being visually stunning, when building a new home the overall cost to install a built-in-photovoltaic (“BIPV”) system is comparatively less. RGS believes this is another “moat,” allowing it to have a competitive advantage in the solar marketplace.\nTo best serve POWERHOUSE™ Dealers, the company has appointed former Dow Solar field technical specialist, John Hardwick, as vice president of construction services.\n“Joining the RGS POWERHOUSE™ team allows me to continue the mission of transforming the world of solar with revolutionary products,” said Hardwick. “My years of field experience with this product will support RGS Energy’s successful launch and rapid market acceptance of the product. For meeting this new mandate, I believe it will be the most economical and visually pleasing solution available in California.”\nDennis Lacey, RGS Energy’s CEO, commented: “Having been essential to homebuilder and local roofer relations at Dow Solar, John brings deep knowledge and experience in solar engineering and training programs. He will be instrumental in helping us meet the expected demand and make it easier for homebuilders and local roofers to become RGS POWERHOUSE™ dealers.”\nJohn Hardwick Bio\nAt Dow Solar, based in Southern California, Hardwick was responsible for POWERHOUSE™ sales in California and Texas. He also oversaw training and operational support for Dow Solar’s roofer and homebuilder partners in California, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey and Hawaii. He was also responsible for the safety of all Dow Solar field technicians.\nPrior to Dow Solar, Hardwick worked as a senior project engineer and training manager for the Solar Energy Solutions Group of SHARP Electronics Corporation. At SHARP, he developed and implemented an industry-leading training program that created a network of 2,500 certified installers for Sharp photovoltaic systems. The program received recognition and acceptance from several testing and accreditation boards, including The North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners.\nHardwick holds a dual Bachelor of Science in Energy and Manufacturing Engineering from James Madison University.\nFollow the company’s progress towards the planned launch this summer of POWERHOUSE™ 3.0 by visiting the PowerLines news section at www.RGSPOWERHOUSE.com .\nAbout RGS Energy\nRGS Energy (Nasdaq:RGSE) is America’s Original Solar Company providing solar, storage and energy services whose mission is clean energy savings.
