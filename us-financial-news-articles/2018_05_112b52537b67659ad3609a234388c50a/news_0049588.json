From watching the horse’s reaction, the client learns how to identify and control emotions, he says.\n“People in the first session, when they are in a difficult state of mind, see a horse that doesn’t stop, that moves, that even gallops. The horse is showing you a mind that doesn’t stop, that is tormented,” he says.\nLoreto Garcia has spent two years in sessions with Noailles to help her cope with stress.\n“Fernando sees the reaction of the horse - he can tell if I’m centered in the moment, how I feel. He uses the horse as a guide to let him know how the session is going,” she says.
