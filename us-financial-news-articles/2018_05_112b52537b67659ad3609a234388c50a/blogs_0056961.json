He urged Trump and Kim to talk directly.\nJapanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said Tokyo understands Trump's decision to cancel the Singapore summit, Kyodo News reported.\n\"It's meaningless to have talks that don't achieve results,\" Kono told reporters on a visit to Mexico City, the news agency said.\nJapanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera also played down the significance of the cancelled meeting.\n\"The important thing is not the U.S.-North Korea meeting itself, but that the meeting becomes an opportunity to move forward in the issues of denuclearization and abductions,\" he told reporters in Tokyo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T01:59:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
