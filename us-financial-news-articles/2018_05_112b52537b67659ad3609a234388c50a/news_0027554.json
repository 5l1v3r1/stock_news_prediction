The data is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nThe core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, is forecast to have risen 0.2 percent in April, pushing up the year-over-year increase to 2.2 percent.\nData on Wednesday showed U.S. producer prices rose less than expected, held back by a moderation in the cost of services such as hotel accommodation and healthcare.\nWhile a June interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve is fully priced in, odds of a fourth rate hike in December stands at 41.4 percent, according to the CME Group’s Fedwatch tool.\nFed officials have said rising inflation and wage pressures are not enough yet to prompt a change in the central bank’s rate outlook.\nAt 7:12 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 8 points, or 0.03 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.06 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 8.5 points, or 0.12 percent.\nAmong stocks, Qualcomm edged 2.2 percent higher after the chipmaker approved a new $10 billion share buyback program that replaces the previous $15 billion program.\nMacy’s dropped 3.3 percent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the retailer’s stock to “underweight”.\nRoku jumped more than 7 percent after the TV streaming device maker reported a smaller-than-feared quarterly loss, while its revenue beat estimates. Its shares were the most traded premarket.
