With millennials spending an average of $1,943 on vacation a year, that leaves plenty of dough to have some amazing adventures.\nThe trips can be anything from a weekend surfing in San Diego to a week-long spiritual quest in Sedona to a day bungee jumping in the Grand Canyon, so if picked, you don't even have to quit your day job. It's all about \"embracing new experiences, discovering new passions and traveling to explore new places,\" according to the White Claw website.\nWinners will have to document and share their experiences through social media platforms, like Instagram.\nSince the contest started May 2, there have been more than 550 entries , including a contestant on a yellow raft at Yellowstone National Park as the mountains tower above her, and a couple at the summit of Loveland Pass in Colorado .\nWinners will be determined by how they express themselves in the photo, creativity/originality and quality of the photo, according to the website.\nAll entries (you must be 25 or older to enter) should be submitted by June 3 before 11:59 PM EST. Winners will be announced in August.\nDon't miss: 5 ways you can travel the world for (nearly) free\nLike this story?
