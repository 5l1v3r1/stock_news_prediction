In the meantime, there are at least four key milestones Alternate Heath plans to meet before acting, including:\nLaboratory referrals back above 10,000 samples per month and growing. Our payment engine for non-cannabis transactions has at least 2 contracts with testing and implementation underway. Cannabis payment engine fully integrated to the CanaPass/StatePass system and revenue has started. Recreational cannabis sales have started with a good business plan and prospects for future growth.\nShould the above criteria be met, and final decision made, the Board expects to seek shareholder approval and that all shareholders would receive their pro rata share of ownership in both companies, on a 1:1 ratio. Tax implications must also be considered prior to a final decision being taken.\nAlternate Health's focus continues to be on maintaining shareholder value, therefore:\nOnly equity dilution to be based on any capital raise associated with the Newco offering. Part of any newly raised capital would be used to hire management to oversee and expand each new primary division in the company.\nNo decision has been made on the final division of company assets between the NewCo and Alternate Health. In particular, Alternate Health is exploring different options for the Company's laboratory business. The Lab could move to the non-cannabis NewCo or stay in Alternate Health. Another option could see the Lab move to the NewCo and pay a long-term royalty to Alternate Health.\n\"We believe the proposed spinoff of the Company's non-cannabis assets is the best plan to maximize the value and revenue potential of the Company's assets,\" says Dr. Murphy. \"The Board will be busy performing our due diligence and will update shareholders in time.\"\nIndependent Director Resigns\nThe Company also announces a change to Alternate Health's Board of Directors. Kristin Taylor has tendered her resignation as an independent director to focus on her full-time career obligations. On behalf of the Board of Directors, Alternate Health's Chairman and CEO, Dr. Michael Murphy, would like to thank Kristin Taylor for her support and service to the Company. The Company is actively looking for an independent director to fill Ms. Taylor's seat on the Board, and will do so in the near future.\nAbout Alternate Health\nAlternate Health Corp.
