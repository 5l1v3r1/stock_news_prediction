This is an 11% sequential quarterly increase from $7.2 million reported for Q4 2017. The Company’s natural product retail channel now includes 1,771 locations nationwide.

Our operating performance is driven by a combination of core revenue growth, strong demand for our products, and a market that is still in its infancy stages,” said Joseph Dowling, CFO of CV Sciences. “In every aspect, we set new performance records and laid the groundwork for continued profitable growth. On the drug development side, we made steady progress in advancing CVSI-007 - our proprietary lead drug candidate - which addresses the multibillion dollar smokeless tobacco use and addiction market. This quarter validates our ability to grow profitably and generate cash flow and positions us well to deliver a successful 2018 for our shareholders. ”\nFinancial highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below:\nFor the three months ended March 31, YOY Change Financial Highlights 2018 2017 $ % GAAP Measures: Product sales, net $ 8,071,000 $ 3,764,000 $ 4,307,000 114% Gross profit 5,562,000 2,433,000 3,129,000 129% Net income 619,000 (3,785,000 ) 4,404,000 n/m Cash generated from operating activities 1,654,000 26,000 1,628,000 6262% Non-GAAP Measure (unaudited): EBITDA $ 787,000 $ (3,597,000 ) $ 4,384,000 n/m Adjusted EBITDA 1,822,000 (190,000 ) 2,012,000 n/m n/m - calculation not meaningful\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had unrestricted cash of $3,106,000 and total cash of $3,888,000. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company increased its total cash position by $1,096,000. Stockholders’ equity increased to approximately $18.0 million as of March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCV Sciences focuses on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and financial position. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income [loss], minus interest income, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization), further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. CV Sciences management presents Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important measure of performance and it is a meaningful financial metric in assessing operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that management believes are not representative of the Company’s core business, such as certain non-cash items and other adjustments. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The term “Adjusted EBITDA” is not defined under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss), operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. CV Sciences management compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental information.\nA reconciliation from the Company’s GAAP results to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is detailed below:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss $ 619,334 $ (3,784,777 ) Interest expense 48,272 130,954 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 8,850 8,850 Depreciation of property & equipment 110,196 47,525 EBITDA 786,652 (3,597,448 ) EBITDA Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense (1) 1,035,153 1,186,291 Gain on derivative liability (2) - (210,600 ) Royalty buy-out (3) - 2,432,000 Total EBITDA Adjustments 1,035,153 3,407,691 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,821,805 $ (189,757 )\n(1) Represents stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and stock grants awarded to employees, consultants and non-executive directors based on the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model.\n(2) Represents the gain on changes in derivative liabilities.\n(3) Represents the share-based royalty buy-out associated the CanX acquisition.\nFor further discussion of the Company’s financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, please refer to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which can be found at www.cvsciences.com or EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 14, 2018.\nManagement to Host Financial Results Conference Call\nThe Company is scheduled to host a conference call to discuss its Q1 2018 results on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 1:15 p.m.PDT/4:15 p.m. EDT.\nCV Sciences’ CFO Joseph Dowling will lead the call to provide an operational and financial summary of the first quarter and three months ended May 15, 2018.
