Disney is trying to create a more immersive VR experience with Force Jacket. The prototype is made from a converted life jacket that's been retrofitted with 26 airbags. Using an air compressor, vacuum pump and a number of sensors, each airbag can be manipulated to replicate a sensation such as being hit in the chest by a snowball. So far, researchers have been able to recreate the sensation of getting tapped on the shoulder, being punched in the side and having a snake coiling its body around the user. People wearing the vest can even feel what it's like to have their muscles grow to the size of a superhero's.
