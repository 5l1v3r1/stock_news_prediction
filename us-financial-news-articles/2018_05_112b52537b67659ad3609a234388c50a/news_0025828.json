Seventeen U.S. states have mounted a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s decision to revise emission and fuel-efficiency rules.\nMarchionne was “fully supportive” of Trump’s efforts “to try to get this reexamined in view of the changing circumstances,” he said in one of two brief interviews.\nHe said he still hoped the administration could reach a deal with California to maintain nationwide emissions standards.\nTrump is “probably the most consummate deal maker I’ve seen in a long, long time,” said Marchionne, while characterizing the Obama administration’s effort to “short-circuit” a review of whether standards through 2025 were appropriate as “improper.”\nHe said the industry would continue to improve vehicle efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how the rules change.\n“We shouldn’t become, sort of, poster children of a cause here,” Marchionne said.
