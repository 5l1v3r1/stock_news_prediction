(NASDAQ:VLRX), a medical technology company which offers patients with diabetes V-Go® Wearable Insulin Delivery device , a simple, affordable, all-in-one insulin delivery option that is worn like a patch and can eliminate the need for taking multiple daily shots, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights:\nRevenues in the first quarter grew 32% year-over-year to a record $6.1 million; Total and new prescriptions for the first quarter in the Company’s targeted accounts grew 20% and 17% year-over-year, respectively; Gross margin increased to a record 47.6% in the first quarter; Signed exclusive agreements in the first four months of 2018 for the distribution of V-Go in Puerto Rico, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand; Entered into an agreement with Glooko on April 20, 2018, to provide future V-Go SIM™ (Simple Insulin Management) users with Glooko’s cloud-based mobile and web diabetes data management solution; Presented positive data demonstrating the effectiveness of V-Go at lowering A1C levels in patients with type 2 diabetes; and Completed an underwritten public offering of common stock for estimated net proceeds of approximately $24.1 million.\nCommenting on the results, John Timberlake, President and Chief Executive Officer of Valeritas, stated, “Q1 2018 was our third consecutive quarter of record revenue and our second consecutive quarter with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 20%. We attribute this growth largely to the success of the high-touch and higher-service sales and marketing strategy we have implemented over the past year. I believe we are well positioned to continue to drive and deliver sustained growth and expansion.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue for was a record $6.1 million, a 32% increase from $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in the Company’s revenue growth was primarily due to the strong prescription growth in the Company’s targeted territories. The first quarter year-over-year growth in the Company’s targeted accounts of total and new prescriptions grew 20% and 17%, respectively. Consistent with the past several quarters, the year-over-year decline in total prescriptions in accounts that were not targeted by the Company’s sales representatives continued to stabilize.\nGross profit in was a record $2.9 million, an increase of 67% as compared to $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin increased by 1,000 basis points to a record 47.6% from 37.6% in the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to an increase in unit sales of V-Go, as well as a slight increase in V-Go’s net selling price.\nOperating expenses in were $13.5 million, a 12.4% increase from $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Increased operating expenses were driven primarily by increased investment in the Company’s commercial initiatives and an increase in R&D related to the Company’s V-Go ® SIM TM program and ongoing clinical studies.\nOperating loss in was $10.6 million, an increase of 3.2% as compared to an operating loss of $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet loss in was $12.1 million as compared to a net loss of $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 2.3%.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $14.5 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $26.0 million as of December 31, 2017. Assuming net proceeds of approximately $24.1 million from the Company’s recent public offering, total cash and cash equivalents were $36.4 million as of May 7, 2018.\nGuidance:\nThe Company expects total 2018 revenue to be between $26 and $28 million. The Company also expects quarterly gross margin to increase on an annual and sequential basis in 2018, ending the year with a gross margin above 50% for the fourth quarter of 2018. This improvement in margin is primarily due to the expected increase in unit sales of V-Go in 2018 vs. 2017, as well as a slight increase in the Company’s net selling price of V-Go for the full year. These expectations are based on, among other things, the assumption that there will be continued growth in the Company’s targeted accounts and no further decline in the Company’s non-targeted accounts.\nConference Call Information\nValeritas will hold a conference call to discuss the results today, Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at 4:30 PM ET.
