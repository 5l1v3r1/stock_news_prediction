So far this year, the company introduced a microwavable breakfast scramble called Just Crack An Egg, Heinz mayonnaise and several new products through a partnership with the Food Network.\n“We believe in the big brands,” Mr. Hees said. “When you support them, when you give them the right relevancy...they do really well.”\nIn the latest quarter, Kraft Heinz’s sales in the U.S., its largest market, fell 3.3% to $4.37 billion.\nThe maker of Kool-Aid drink mixes, Velveeta cheese products and Maxwell House coffee has been adjusting its product lines to spur sales amid increasing competition. But like its rivals, Kraft Heinz has lost sales to new brands of snacks and meals that are marketed as healthful and fresh.\nHershey Co. , Mondelez International Inc. and General Mills Inc. have said in recent weeks that U.S. sales trends are improving . But they also are paying more for some ingredients and for transportation because of a trucking shortage, forcing them to raise prices or sacrifice profits.\nKraft Heinz’s adjusted profit margin—before interest, taxes and depreciation—fell to 28.5% in the quarter from 29.2% a year ago, as it faced higher costs.\nStock analysts said Kraft Heinz’s U.S. sales didn’t deteriorate to the extent that some expected and that higher prices protected Kraft Heinz’s profit margin. Its shares rose 4% after hours, though they were down 30% this year through Wednesday’s market close.\nWells Fargo analyst John Baumgartner said the results were “far better than feared...and commendable international margins suggest that cost-savings benefits persist.”\nKraft Heinz was formed in 2015 through a $46 billion deal and is run by executives from 3G Capital Partners LP, a Brazilian firm known for cutting costs and streamlining operations to glean profitability.\nLast year, Kraft Heinz made an offer to buy Unilever PLC, the maker of Dove soap, Lipton tea and Breyers ice cream. Kraft Heinz walked away after Unilever executives rejected deal talks.\nNow, investors are awaiting Kraft Heinz’s next move. JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said that as Kraft Heinz’s sales deteriorate and a promised $2 billion in annual savings from the Kraft Heinz merger is mostly realized, an acquisition is the most likely way for the company to improve its business.\nMr. Hees has said he is open to more deal-making and is looking for strong brands with global reach.\nWrite to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T04:18:56.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
