Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi looks on as League party leader Matteo Salvini (not seen) speaks following a talk with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale palace in Rome, Italy, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi\nItalian markets fell sharply as investors feared a new election in the wake of an inconclusive March 4 ballot would further benefit the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement at the expense of mainstream groups.\nThe March vote saw a center-right alliance, which includes Forza Italia and the League, winning the most seats, while 5-Star emerged as the biggest single party.\nBoth groups fell well short of a majority and although 5-Star says it is willing to hook up with the League, it has refused to deal with the scandal-plagued Berlusconi, seeing him as a symbol of political corruption.\nThe League does not want to abandon its old ally, saying it would betray voters who had backed their alliance, but it is putting increasing pressure on him to stand aside voluntarily.\n“We are continuing to ask Berlusconi to make a gesture of responsibility and help us give this country a government,” said senior League politician Giancarlo Giorgetti, indicating he wanted Forza Italia to agree to sit out of a government deal.\nForza Italia swiftly rejected the idea, as it has for weeks.\n“Today, to ask Forza Italia to give external support (to a government) seems a very bad move which we an only say no to,” said Maria Stella Gelmini, Forza Italia leader in the lower house of parliament.\nForza Italia faces a lose-lose situation. If it gives in to the League, it risks becoming an irrelevance in parliament. If it pushes for a re-vote, opinion polls suggest it will cede significant ground to its increasingly buoyant ally.
