Many are migrants from rural areas who moved in search of better economic opportunities.\n“Authorities have tended to allow informal markets to operate because they are popular with residents, but we may see a stricter clamp-down if more people complain,” Sasiwimon said.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
