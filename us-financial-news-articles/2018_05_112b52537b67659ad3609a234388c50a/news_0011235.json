Several of the cargoes were resold to new buyers including Saudi Arabia, Japan and Spain at drastically reduced prices.\nADM, which revealed the expected impact during an earnings-day conference call on Tuesday, is one of the largest sorghum exporters to China. Other global commodities traders may report they were negatively affected by the trade dispute later in the earnings season, analysts said.\nADM reported a stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday on record soybean processing and higher margins.\nReporting by Karl Plume and P.J.
