Last year I was seriously thinking of giving up, but my game is in pretty good shape now.”\nHiggins, four-times world champion, finished runner-up for the second year in a row.\n“It was unbelievable to play in front of this crowd,” he said. “The last frame was just a joke there for him to play that well under that pressure. He is a great champion.”\nWelshman Ray Reardon won his sixth world title in 1978 at the age of 45 to become the oldest winner of the event.
