Frenchman Pagenaud (228.761) and Power (228.607) will join him on the front row for the May 27 race.\nPatrick, who is retiring, will lead off the third row after averaging 228.090 with Brazilian Helio Castroneves, who had the fastest average speed on Saturday, beside her. The three-time Indy 500 winner averaged 227.859.\n“It’s all good and I am glad that part is over with,” Patrick told ABC television. “Now it is time for 500 fun miles.”\nReigning champion Takuma Sato of Japan will start on the sixth row after posting an average speed of 226.557 in a Honda.
