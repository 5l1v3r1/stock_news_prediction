The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was lower intraday Thursday, down about 0.5 percent. The Nasdaq has fallen in seven of the past 10 trading days and is down more than 2 percent over the past three months.\nBetter-than-expected earnings failed to push stocks higher as investors were worried about trade and geopolitical events.\nCalvasina, whose firm is underweight on tech, said she's reined in her enthusiasm a bit on the broader market, adding RBC has lowered its S&P target for the year from 3,000 to 2,890.\n\"We described it as the bull is limping, but he is still moving forward a little bit,\" said Calvasina, a former chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.\nShe said it appears investors don't believe they've overshot their expectations for the year, however.\n\"They're not going to pay up for inflated earnings on tax boosts,\" Calvasina said. \"What they want is confirmation that the real underlying fundamentals are improving. That they're still good. That they're getting better.\"\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
