Lugo, the team’s most reliable reliever, allowed three runs on three hits in 1 1/3 innings in relief. He had a 17-inning scoreless streak end in the eighth and suffered his first career loss against Atlanta.\nNew York catcher Devin Mesoraco put the Mets ahead in the top of the ninth with a solo homer, his sixth. But Lugo couldn’t hold the lead. He walked Johan Camargo to start the inning, retired Dansby Swanson on a fly to right and gave up the homer to Culberson.\nShane Carle (3-1) got the win, despite allowing the go-ahead homer to Mesoraco. He had two strikeouts in his lone inning of relief.\nAtlanta’s Max Fried pitched five innings in his first start of the season and received no decision. He allowed two runs (one earned) on four hits, four walks and one hit batsman. He struck out six.\nNew York starter Jacob deGrom worked seven innings and allowed one run on five hits and three walks. He struck out eight.\nThe Mets scored a run in the first inning when Mesoraco drew a bases-loaded walk.\nNew York made it 2-0 in the fourth inning when Luis Guillorme doubled home Mesoraco, who had singled.\nAtlanta cut the lead to 2-1 when Tyler Flowers hit a long solo shot to center field, his third, to lead off the Braves’ seventh.\nThe Braves tied the game 2-2 in the eighth when Nick Markakis hit a sacrifice fly to right field that scored Ozzie Albies, who opened the inning with a bunt single.\nBefore the game the Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. on the 10-day disabled list with a sprained anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and lower back contusion. The club had feared a worse prognosis when Acuna stumbled while running through first base in the seventh inning of Sunday’s game at Boston.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:22:34.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
