(Nasdaq: SBGI), the \"Company\" or \"Sinclair,\" today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nCEO Comment:\n\"Our first quarter came in well ahead of guidance in all key financial metrics,\" commented Chris Ripley, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As expected and reflected in our first quarter guidance, advertising revenue was soft largely due to the lack of Olympics and Super Bowl on many of our stations and with the auto category coming off its recent highs from last year. Fortunately, our distribution revenues now make up approximately half our media revenues which makes our business model very resilient to ad market volatility. Furthermore, growth and initiative advances in digital, network, programmatic and addressable advertising are showing results and becoming larger contributors. Lastly, our acquisition of Tribune Media is now approaching the final stages with an anticipated closing in late second quarter/early third quarter of 2018, as we await governmental approvals.\"\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Results:\nTotal revenues increased 6.1% to $665.4 million versus $626.9 million in the prior year period. Operating income was $107.3 million, including $5 million of one-time transaction costs, versus operating income of $157.6 million in the prior year period, which included $53 million of gains on asset dispositions. Included in operating income is $21 million of gains on asset dispositions, which includes an $83 million cash gain relating to our previously announced sale of spectrum in Milwaukee, which was sold pursuant to the National Broadband Plan, partially offset by a non-cash impairment charge of a non-media related real estate investment. Net income attributable to the Company was $43.1 million versus net income of $57.2 million in the prior year period. Diluted earnings per common share was $0.42 as compared to $0.61 in the prior year period.\nThree Months Ended March 31 , 2018 Operating Highlights:\nMedia revenues increased 6.0% to $643.7 million versus $607.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Political revenues were $7 million in the first quarter versus $2 million in the first quarter of 2017, a non-election year. Distribution revenues were $314 million versus $276 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues from our digital businesses increased 71%, as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nRecent Corporate Developments:\nTransactions:\nThe company announced definitive agreements to sell 23 television stations to Standard Media Group LLC, the Fox Broadcasting Company (\"Fox\"), Meredith Corporation, Howard Stirk and Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation, upon consummation of Sinclair's acquisition of the stock of Tribune Media Company (NYSE: TRCO) (\"Tribune\"). Excluding those stations where Sinclair will continue to provide services after the dispositions, the stations are being sold for a combined $1.5 billion of gross sales proceeds, with another approximate $100 million of working capital to be retained by the Company, representing a 9.7x multiple of the stations' 2017/2018 average cash flow. The sales are part of Sinclair's larger acquisition of Tribune Media Company, in order to obtain necessary governmental approval of the Tribune transaction and for other business purposes and are expected to close at the same time as the Tribune transaction. The Company expects to close its announced acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of Tribune late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the FCC and antitrust clearance.\nContent and Distribution:\nIn May, Sinclair and the licensees of stations to which Sinclair provides services and Fox Broadcasting Company agreed to multi-year renewals of 34 Fox affiliates, including all eight of Tribune's Fox affiliates which are not being sold to Fox. In April, the Company entered into a multi-year retransmission renewal with Cox for the carriage of Sinclair stations, Tennis Channel and Sinclair's national networks on its platforms. Sinclair's award-winning news rooms, dedicated to impactful journalism with a local focus, have won 160 local news awards thus far in 2018, including 45 Regional RTDNA Edward R. Murrow Awards by 21 news rooms. Three of the stations that were recognized with regional Murrows, WBFF (Baltimore), WJLA (Washington, DC) and WGME (Portland, ME), separately, earned nationally-recognized awards for outstanding journalism as well. WBFF won the Investigative Reporting Award from the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and a National Headliner Award. WJLA won a National Headliner Award, as well as the June L. Biedler Prize presented by The American Association for Cancer Research. WGME won a Gracie Award for News Program from the Alliance of Women in Media.\nCommunity:\nIn May, Sinclair awarded its Broadcast Diversity Scholarship to seven applicants, distributing over $30,000 in tuition assistance to students demonstrating a promising future in the broadcast industry.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights:\nDebt on the balance sheet, net of $1.038 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, was $2.992 billion at March 31, 2018 versus net debt of $3.053 billion at December 31, 2017.

Routine capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2018 were $19 million with another $3 million related to the spectrum repack. Program contract payments were $28 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nNotes:\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial information to conform to the presentation in the current year.\nOutlook:\nThe following transactions closed during 2017 or 2018 and, therefore, the results of these transactions were not included in the corresponding pre-transaction periods: the acquisition of Tennis Media Company (March 1, 2017); the acquisition of DataSphere (June 1, 2017); the sale of Alarm Funding (March 7, 2017); the conversion of ASN to a joint venture with Silver Chalice and 120 Sports (April 13, 2017); and the purchase of Bonten and Esteem Broadcasting by the Company and Cunningham, respectively (September 1, 2017).\nThe Company currently expects to achieve the following results for the three months ending June 30, 2018 and twelve months ending December 31, 2018.
