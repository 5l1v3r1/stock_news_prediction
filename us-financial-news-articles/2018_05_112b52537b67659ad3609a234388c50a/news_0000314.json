This week Donald Trump tried to ensure that Stormy Daniels doesn’t rain down permanent distraction on his Presidency, though at the cost of further damage to his credibility.\nMr. Trump contradicted his previous statements that he had no knowledge of payments that his lawyer had made to Ms. Daniels — the pornographic-movie actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford —to quell stories of an alleged affair.\nSpeaking in his new role as Mr. Trump’s lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani disclosed that Mr. Trump made a series of payments to reimburse lawyer Stephen Cohen, who had paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 as part of a non-disclosure agreement late in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nIn explanatory tweets Thursday, President Trump said that “Mr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.”\nThe apparent reason for these contortions is the possibility that the payments if made by Mr. Cohen would have exceeded federal campaign-finance donation limits. We have long criticized the arcana of campaign-finance rules, but they are the law and carry real criminal penalties. That is why presidential candidates hire squads of lawyers to flyspeck donations during a campaign.\nMessrs. Trump and Giuliani are arguing that Mr. Trump’s payments to Ms. Clifford were made for reasons that fall outside Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. And perhaps these admissions will lessen Mr. Trump’s legal vulnerability.\nWhat remains is the political damage. Attempting to quiet a similar storm in 1998, President Bill Clinton said, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. ” Many of Mr. Clinton’s political supporters were unmoved by the allegations against him. Similarly now, Mr. Trump’s most ardent backers believe these charges aren’t relevant to his public initiatives as President.\nThat may be true regarding whether Mr. Trump had an affair more than a decade ago. Voters in 2016 knew Mr. Trump was no choir boy, and the irony is that news of an affair would probably have made no difference in his race against Hillary Clinton, who was Bill Clinton’s wife and chief defender.\nBut Mr. Trump’s public deceptions are surely relevant to his job as President, and the attempted cover-up has done greater harm than any affair would have. Mr. Trump asked Americans, not least his supporters, to believe his claims about the payments. They were false and conveniently so in putting the onus on Mr. Cohen. Now, as more of the story has emerged, he wants everyone to believe a new story that he could have told the first time.\nMr. Trump is compiling a record that increases the likelihood that few will believe him during a genuine crisis—say, a dispute over speaking with special counsel Robert Mueller or a nuclear showdown with Kim Jong Un. Mr. Trump should worry that Americans will stop believing anything he says.\nAppeared in the May 4, 2018, print edition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T09:56:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
