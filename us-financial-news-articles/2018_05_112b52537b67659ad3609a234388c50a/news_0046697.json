Sinclair, which is already the largest U.S. broadcast station owner, announced plans in May 2017 to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households. The FCC will take comments and responses through July 12. The deal also needs approval from the U.S. Justice Department.
