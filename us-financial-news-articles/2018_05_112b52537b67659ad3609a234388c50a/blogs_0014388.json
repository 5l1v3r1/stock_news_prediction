If there is debt, we can go long those bonds and use cash flows to buy long-dated out-of-the money puts .\"\nThe investor said the strategy, which he calls the \"future of short-selling,\" does well in this market environment versus shorting stocks directly. He said it can make a \"few percentage points\" when the market rallies but can do much better when the market declines.\nA put gives an investor the option to sell when a stock hits a certain price. The bond part of the strategy involves buying corporate debt that generally would benefit when a stock goes higher but would get hit if it falls.\n\"Senior credit recoveries tend to be very good,\" he said.\nThe fund manager said senior credit bonds prices often drop marginally when a company's stock price falls dramatically.\nBlock is chief investment officer of investment firm Muddy Waters Capital. He is known for his short-selling research, which led to several government fraud investigations and financial restatements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T20:12:17.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
