(NASDAQ: IMI), the trusted partner for advanced materials innovation, today reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQ1 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nTotal revenue of $9.7 million, a decrease of 8% over the prior quarter and 3% over the same period last year. Program revenues grew 5% sequentially and 36% over the same period last year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million (10% of revenue), compared with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $(1.9) million in the same period last year. Total cash and investments increased $1.4 million sequentially to $27.2 million. Secured two new contracts during the quarter.\nManagement Commentary\n\"The first quarter of 2018 marked Intermolecular's third consecutive period of positive adjusted EBITDA, a consistency not seen since 2013,\" said company president and CEO, Chris Kramer. \"Our improved financial performance is the result of the actions we have taken over the past year to both increase customer engagements and reduce our cost structure. Specifically, on a year-over-year basis, we increased program services revenue by $2.4 million, or 36% in the quarter, while reducing operating expenses by $4.5 million. This combination has more than offset the planned expiration of royalties from legacy programs and is key for sustainable profitability. Our engagements with both existing and new customers continue to expand and we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow and scale our business profitably.\"\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.7 million, down 8% compared to $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and down 3% compared to $9.9 million in the same period a year ago.

Forward-looking statements are subject to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as \"would,\" \"may,\" \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"projects\" and other terms with similar meaning. Investors are cautioned that the in this document are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this document and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to current expectations. Such statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond Intermolecular's control, that could cause actual results and other future events to those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to current expectations include, without limitation, the following: our ability to productize our workflows with existing and future customers; expectations regarding our future revenue, cash flow and GAAP and non-GAAP net income or loss; financial condition; the ability of our new business model to generate profits and long-term shareholder returns; the extent to which technology developed in collaboration with our customers will continue to remain on the critical path and have significant value for such customers and us as well as the industry as a whole; and anticipated growth in our current markets through expansion of existing customer programs and the entry into other engagements with new customers. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to expectations, including but not limited to: our ability to execute on our strategy, prove our business model and remain technologically competitive in rapidly evolving industry conditions; commercial acceptance of our HPC platform and methodology as effective R&D tools; our ability to achieve and sustain profitability; the ability of our customers to achieve their announced product roadmaps in a timely manner; the extent to which we are able to successfully extend and expand relationships with existing customers; our ability to manage the growth of our business; the rapid technology changes and volatility of the customers and industries we serve; our potential need for future capital to finance our operations; and other risks described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as updated by our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov , particularly in the sections titled \"Risk Factors.\" All based on management's current estimates, projections and assumptions, and we assume no obligation to update them.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the financial data presented on a GAAP basis, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not serve as an alternative to GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other companies. These results should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. We believe that our non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations because the non-GAAP measures exclude charges that management considers to be outside of Intermolecular's core operating results. We believe that the non-GAAP measures of revenue, cost of net revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, net (loss) income, earnings per share and net (loss) income per share, viewed in combination with our financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective and a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to review and assess financial performance, to determine executive officer incentive compensation and to plan and forecast performance in future periods.\nIntermolecular, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts, Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March
