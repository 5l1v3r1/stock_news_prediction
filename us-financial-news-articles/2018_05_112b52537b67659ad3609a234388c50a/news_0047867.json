China's Dalian iron ore futures fell more than 3 percent on Monday due to technical selling and growing concerns that steel mills in the world's top producer may delay orders. The local share price index futures fell 0.21 percent or 13 points to 6,080, a 4.5-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark declined 0.05 percent on Monday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index gained 0.19 percent at 2205 GMT.
