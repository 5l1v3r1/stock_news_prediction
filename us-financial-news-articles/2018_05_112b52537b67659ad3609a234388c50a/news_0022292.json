REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\nAir France KLM shares were up 6.3 percent at 7.52 euros (6.6 pounds) in late-session trading, although the stock remains down by around 45 percent since the start of 2018.\nEarlier on Friday, the airline had said traffic had fallen 2.6 percent in April, blaming a wave of strikes over pay conditions at the French brand that last week forced the chief-executive of the Franco-Dutch group to resign.\nNevertheless, the company added that its load factor - a measure of how full are the planes flown by an airline - had progressed by 0.4 percentage points.\n“The load factor has still managed to increase. It shows that the company is able to re-adjust its offer to the changing demands,” said a Geneva-based fund manager.\nJean-Marc Janaillac said last Friday that he was resigning as Air France KLM CEO following the rejection by staff of a pay deal that he had put to a vote, after talks with the unions reached a deadlock.
