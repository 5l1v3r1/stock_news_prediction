Meanwhile, the court is expected to issue its final ruling as soon as this week.\nThough major brokerage firms have taken steps to comply with parts of the fiduciary rule — for instance, they moved away from commission-based compensation and toward asset-based fees — the court injected more uncertainty on the responsibilities advisors and their firms face.\n\"There is significant confusion on the 5 th Circuit decision about whether professionals servicing retirement accounts are fiduciaries and what duties they owe their clients,\" said Hauptman.\nThe Labor Department sought to give firms some guidance on their duties, announcing that it would not pursue claims against advisors who make a good faith effort to comply with the \" impartial conduct standard ,\" a portion of the fiduciary rule that's currently in effect.\nThat standard requires advisors to charge no more than reasonable compensation and avoid misleading statements.\nThe ultimate fate of the regulation is still unclear.\nPresident Donald Trump had ordered the Labor Department to review the rule and prepare an updated economic and legal analysis. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators continue to hammer away at their own fiduciary regulation.\nStill on your own Amid the confusion of how financial advisors and their firms should respond to the regulation, the fact remains that investors are their own best advocates.\nSee below for tips on how to vet your financial advisor.\nMore from Personal Finance\nLabor Department won't enforce investor protection rule after court decision\nThe rule that protects your retirement savings may be on the ropes\nWhat to expect from your advisor with the investor protection rule in limbo", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T21:09:16.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
