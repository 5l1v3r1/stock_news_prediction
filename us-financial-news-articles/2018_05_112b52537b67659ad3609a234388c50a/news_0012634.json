Arco’s learning systems are sold to 1,300 schools with 415,000 students.\nThe company has not yet decided whether to list on the New York Stock Exchange or on Nasdaq, the source said.\nArco is in talks with investment banks Goldman Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Itaú BBA SA to manage the offering, the source said.\nInvestment firm General Atlantic LLC has a 26 percent stake in the company, which also has among its shareholders SAS founding family Sá Cavalcante. Shareholders have decided to list in the United States rather than in Brazil because part of its learnings systems are delivered electronically and Arco would like to access technology investors, the source said.\nBrazilian newspaper Valor Econômico first reported that Arco was eyeing an IPO in New York. The company and the banks did not immediately comment on the matter.
