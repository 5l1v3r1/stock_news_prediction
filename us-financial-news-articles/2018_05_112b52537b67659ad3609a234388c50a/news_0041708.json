Ron Wyden of Oregon also asked that the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network give his committee documents relevant to the Cohen reports.\nThe absence of two alleged \"suspicious activity reports\" was first reported by The New Yorker. A law enforcement official, concerned about the missing documents, was the source of a third leaked report, the magazine said Wednesday.\nThe three documents described transactions surrounding Cohen's shell company Essential Consultants, The New Yorker said.\nThe documents were produced by First Republic Bank, with which Essential Consultants had an account, according to the magazine. The leaked report revealed hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to Essential Consultants from multinational drug company Novartis and telecom giant AT&T. show chapters 2:13 PM ET Wed, 16 May 2018 | 03:29\nThose payments came to light last week when the lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels tweeted a summary of payments to Cohen's shell company. Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Donald Trump a decade ago, is suing to void a $130,000 nondisclosure deal crafted by Cohen and brokered through Essential Consultants. That agreement was signed weeks before Trump was elected president.\nThe White House denies he had an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.\nAT&T and Novartis admitted to making payments to Cohen shortly after the tweet by Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti. Those payments, as well as an alleged payment from a Russian oligarch to Cohen through the company Columbus Nova, were all included in the leaked bank document, the magazine reported.\nThe official who leaked the report said two other reports about the transactions were missing from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, according to The New Yorker.\nThose two suspicious activity reports allegedly cover more than $3 million in additional transactions related to Cohen's account with First Republic Bank, The New Yorker said.\nThe official told The New Yorker, \"I have never seen something pulled off the system. ... That system is a safeguard for the bank. It's a stockpile of information. When something's not there that should be, I immediately became concerned.\"\nThat concern prompted the official to leak the first document, despite the legal risks of doing so, according to The New Yorker.\nAvenatti has called on the Treasury Department to immediately release the three suspicious activity reports on Cohen's company.\nEssential Consultants was also used for a hush deal involving Elliott Broidy, former Republican National Committee deputy finance chairman, and a former Playboy model he allegedly impregnated. The deal involved Broidy paying the model $1.6 million.\nThe New Yorker's review of other banks' suspicious activity reports about Cohen's transactions found that a report from City National Bank documented Broidy's payments to Cohen and another lawyer. Broidy reportedly sent three payments of $62,500 to Cohen â€” one of which went to Essential Consultants' account, the magazine said. Broidy resigned from the RNC after news outlets reported the alleged deal.\nA representative for Broidy told The New Yorker that its account of his payments was \"not correct.\" \"Mr. Broidy is not going to detail his payments for legal services to Mr. Cohen,\" the representative told the magazine.\nBenjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, said that while the suspicious activity reports may be absent from the Treasury Department's database, the bank itself likely still has copies of the records.", "external_links": ["https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/missing-files-motivated-the-leak-of-michael-cohens-financial-records"], "published": "2018-05-17T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:02:17.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
