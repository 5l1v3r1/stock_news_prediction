We believe that is only a matter of time,” McDermott said at its annual general meeting in response to a shareholder question, reiterating previous comments on the target.\n“While we are not giving a specific timeframe, we are certainly charging ahead with this in mind,” he said.\nThe company’s market capitalization stood at just above 118 billion euros ($139 billion) on Wednesday. Rival U.S. software maker Oracle ( ORCL.N ) is valued at around $190 billion.\nSAP’s share price trebled between 2010 and 2017.
