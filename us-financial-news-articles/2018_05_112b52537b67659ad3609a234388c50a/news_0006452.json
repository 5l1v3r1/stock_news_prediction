These contracts resulted in thermal oil prices being higher by approximately $10.50 per bbl in the quarter versus the benchmark prices. For the rest of 2018, 70 percent of projected WCS sales are price protected at an average price differential of approximately U.S. $16.80 per bbl.\nAchieved an average netback at Lindbergh of Cdn $26.16 per bbl in the quarter, including the impact of Pengrowth’s physical delivery contracts despite the benchmark light-heavy price differential widening significantly to over U.S. $24.00 per bbl.\nOperations\nPengrowth achieved first quarter average daily production of 19,541 boe per day, led by production volumes from Lindbergh, which averaged 15,118 bbl per day in the quarter at an average SOR of 2.9. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, production at Lindbergh continued to ramp up following the development activities in the quarter, with volumes increasing to over 16,500 bbl per day in mid-April. Similarly, the development activities at Groundbirch in the quarter resulted in a ramp up of production at Groundbirch with total production increasing from approximately 9 MMcf per day at the start of the year to over 28 MMcf per day in early April, representing an increase of over 200 percent.\nLindbergh capital spending in the first quarter was focused on the conversion of four well pairs drilled on Pad D04 late in 2017 to SAGD production, equipment installation and initiation of circulating activities on the three remaining well pairs on Pad D04, as well as the commencement of the 2018 optimization program. As part of our 2018 optimization strategy for Lindbergh, the Company plans on drilling eight infill wells in support of production growth at Lindbergh. Drilling of the wells commenced in the second quarter and the Company expects to have the wells drilled, completed and tied-in by the third quarter. Following planned steaming operations, these wells are expected to be brought on stream in the fourth quarter of 2018, targeting Lindbergh production of approximately 18,000 bbl per day by the end of the year.\nAt Groundbirch, activities in the quarter included the completion and tie-in of three of the four wells drilled in 2017. In addition to the development activities, the Company completed the compression project which allows us to shift transportation of natural gas production at Groundbirch away from Station Two and onto the Nova Gas Transmission Limited (NGTL) system. As of April 1, 2018, volumes from Groundbirch commenced flow on the NGTL system. The fourth well completion and tie-in is anticipated during the third quarter of 2018. The gas production from Groundbirch is a physical hedge for our gas requirements needed to generate steam at Lindbergh, where we expect to utilize approximately 87 percent of the natural gas produced from Groundbirch.\nTotal capital expenditures in the first quarter were $26.4 million and primarily focused on development activities at Groundbirch and Lindbergh.\nNet Operating and G&A Expenses\nFirst quarter net operating expenses of $18.3 million ($10.41 per boe) were on track with full year guidance and reflect the lower operating costs associated with our focused asset base. Cash G&A expenses of $8.9 million ($5.06 per boe) in the quarter continue to trend downwards following the significant asset dispositions completed in 2017 and the subsequent realignment of staffing needs to match the smaller asset base. First quarter cash G&A still contained approximately $1.2 million of staffing costs related to the divested properties. These trailing tasks are expected to end in the second quarter of 2018, and the Company remains on track to reduce G&A costs further in the second half of the year. We anticipate full year 2018 cash G&A expenses to be in line with 2018 Guidance.\nFinancial Results\nThe Company reported funds flow from operations of $7.2 million ($0.01 per share), compared to funds flow of $26.9 million ($0.05 per share) for the same period in 2017. The decrease in funds flow year over year was primarily due to the absence of production volumes from divested properties combined with higher diluent expenses at Lindbergh. Diluent is required for processing and blending of Lindbergh bitumen production to meet pipeline specifications. The Company typically uses more diluent in the winter months due to the colder weather. Higher realized prices during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, due to material improvements in crude oil benchmark prices, were partially offset by realized financial risk management losses.\nPengrowth's WCS physical oil delivery contracts in the first quarter insulated the Company from the volatility in the light-heavy price differentials and resulted in the Company’s Lindbergh production generating an operating netback of $26.16 per bbl. The physical hedge contracts in the quarter resulted in a realized gain of $10.51 per bbl for Pengrowth’s thermal oil sales. A summary of corporate and Lindbergh standalone Q1, 2018 operating netbacks is provided in the table below:\nCorporate Lindbergh Sales 39.97 42.33 Royalties (2.79 ) (2.57 ) Net operating expenses (10.41 ) (10.59 ) Transportation expenses (2.73 ) (3.01 ) Operating netback 24.04 26.16\nIn addition to the physical delivery contracts, Pengrowth has in place financial risk management contracts for 2018. During the second half of 2017, in order to ensure compliance with relaxed covenants on its debt, Pengrowth entered into a series of WTI hedges. In the first quarter these hedges represented 62 percent of Pengrowth’s liquids production, and as Lindbergh production continues to increase through 2018, the percentage hedged will decline to approximately 55 percent of liquids production. These contracts generated a realized loss of approximately $7.96 per boe in the quarter, resulting in funds flow being lower by $14.0 million. If commodity prices remain at current levels, the absence of these financial risk management contracts will result in significantly higher realized prices for liquids production and higher funds flow, starting in 2019.\nPengrowth recorded a net loss of $27.2 million ($0.05 per share) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a net loss of $86.3 million ($0.16 per share) in the first quarter of 2017. The smaller net loss is primarily due to the absence of impairment charges and losses on the disposition of properties recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Partly offsetting these were lower funds flow year over year and the absence of unrealized commodity risk management gains recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Resources and Liquidity\nPengrowth’s total debt (excluding letters of credit) at March 31, 2018 amounted to Cdn $662.1 million, which was a slight increase from the end of the year. The higher debt was primarily a result of Pengrowth’s development program, which is front-end weighted with the bulk of the $65 million of the 2018 capital expected to be spent in the first half of the year. In addition, as the majority of Pengrowth's long term debt and interest payments are denominated in U.S. dollars, they are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars. The weaker Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar during the quarter translated into a higher Canadian dollar equivalent debt, contributing to the overall increase in corporate debt. Pengrowth manages this foreign exchange exposure through swap contracts on the majority of its outstanding foreign denominated notes. At March 31, 2017 Pengrowth held U.S. $255 million of swap contracts at a weighted average exchange rate of Cdn $0.75/U.S. $1.00.\nOutlook\nThe Company has started to demonstrate its growth potential and the development focus on our two primary assets leave us on track to generate double-digit organic production growth in 2018. Our 2018 capital expenditure budget of $65 million is unchanged and focused on adding production volumes from Lindbergh and Groundbirch. The 2018 budget is expected to generate average annual production of 22,500 to 23,500 boe per day, with an estimated 2018 exit rate of approximately 24,000 boe per day, representing double-digit production growth for 2018.\nAnalyst call\nPengrowth will host an analyst call and listen-only audio webcast beginning at 7:00 A.M.

These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided, in part, to assist readers in determining Pengrowth’s ability to generate cash from operations. Pengrowth believes these measures are useful in assessing operating performance and liquidity of Pengrowth’s ongoing business on an overall basis. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash provided by operations and other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with IFRS. Further information including reconciliation to the applicable GAAP measure with respect to these additional and non-GAAP measures can be found in the MD&A.\nNote to US Readers\nWe report our production and reserve quantities in accordance with Canadian practices and specifically in accordance with NI 51- 101. These practices are different from the practices used to report production and to estimate reserves in reports and other materials filed with the SEC by companies in the United States.\nCurrent SEC reporting requirements permit, but do not require United States oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose probable and possible reserves, in addition to the required disclosure of proved reserves. The SEC does not permit the inclusion of estimates of contingent resources in reports filed with it by United States companies. Under current SEC requirements, net quantities of reserves are required to be disclosed, which requires disclosure on an after royalties basis and does not include reserves relating to the interests of others. Because we are permitted to prepare our reserves information in accordance with Canadian disclosure requirements, we have included contingent resources, disclosed reserves before the deduction of royalties and interests of others and determined and disclosed our reserves and the estimated future net cash therefrom using forecast prices and costs. See \"Presentation of our Reserve Information\" in our most recent Annual Information Form or Form 40-F for more information.\nWe incorporate additional information with respect to production and reserves which is either not generally included or prohibited under rules of the SEC and practices in the United States. We follow the Canadian practice of reporting gross production and reserve volumes; however, we also follow the United States practice of separately reporting these volumes on a net basis (after the deduction of royalties and similar payments). We also follow the Canadian practice of using forecast prices and costs when we estimate our reserves. The SEC permits, but does not require, the disclosure of reserves based on forecast prices and costs.\nSource:Pengrowth Energy Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HM433eCfWZON8gOLLp8hV7Fndc1D5HllnHWDw3pDEmvAO24B8J-imM6nBVaMUXuRIUPsCWOo3MSLdnozdaPZRthWZAJvvhOpoL19D5sfJNY=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ffc83a30-0acf-453d-abd2-d08ad3f495e1", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VRgvrIUKJRzY8ckYL0KAcWJt4150mh2UdeY5b-WtMPmZiqqgTXWGGb4L93vLWuokiD4V2h4lJh8IIIX1lm3C-Kviry_FQPaLZPhdDb4mNZ150OK0auYSkhEtLGsc07PR", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HQZLgr1uAOxAsfmeJLzTD8Bgn8Y6HwfyaMI98Nls42qj4DYuOQok-hWOnUyRSae6qyAbFa74w_HFJbnDTs0yo1BZn8RJ9jBYHeuVGBEZ8OXOa8Negybga55HA-FN7tC8U5e8pFBl02q0w9KRBn9dyQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=va-aAk4KkK9_sRDDkzDHx5i4jElhw6p4r95ZSFNxx5T--T3FW4Q-AoOoc6iH3FsMQIZ0JmOwATGmOdnOr5FnnA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=HM433eCfWZON8gOLLp8hV5ActrPH8AnwqoOlkIW6DHPNw470_FS1nz5wz2p2Q3XORGGOa4nUxBtar-UhP9oO_JCIOoZ-JMFSxwD7h5LeMtA=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=va-aAk4KkK9_sRDDkzDHx8e4V5fkh-CZ_PcMmVcubfyga3Dh1OJkZDfxcnQkBZs0brCHf85vIR4r3Vrz3OuxOA==", "https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/dh38jheg"], "published": "2018-05-02T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T04:07:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
