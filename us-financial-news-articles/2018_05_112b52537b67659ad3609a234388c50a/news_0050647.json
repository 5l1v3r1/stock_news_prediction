(OTCQB:CLSH) “CLS,” a development stage diversified cannabis company operating as Cannabis Life Sciences, today announced that its proposed acquisition of Oasis Cannabis has progressed and is now expected to close by the end of June 2018.\nThe parties mutually agreed to extend the purchase agreement to June 21, 2018. This extension timeline remains in the initial expectation of closing by the end of the second quarter 2018. The extension is due to additional time needed to complete certain license transfer documentation.\n“All of us at OASIS have gotten to know the CLS team and their commitment to the acquisition has been unwavering. Together we look forward to the completion of our cultivation, conversion and extraction facility along with continued expansion of our operations in the Las Vegas marketplace,” said Ben Sillitoe, CEO and Co-Founder of Oasis Cannabis.\nAbout Oasis Cannabis ( http://oasiscannabis.com )\nOasis Cannabis has operated a cannabis dispensary in the Las Vegas market since dispensaries first opened in Nevada in 2015 and has been recognized as one of the top marijuana retailers in the state.

The company recently commenced wholesale offerings of cannabis in Nevada with the launch of its City Trees brand of cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products in August 2017. An expansion of its cultivation and production facility is currently underway and is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018.\nAbout CLS Holdings USA, Inc.
