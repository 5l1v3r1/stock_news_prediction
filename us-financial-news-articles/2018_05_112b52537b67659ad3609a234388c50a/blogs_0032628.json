In 2015, Trump denigrated the former Navy flier’s military service. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”\nAsked if Trump himself should apologize for Sadler’s comments, Graham said, “I’ll leave that up to him, but if something happened like that in my office - somebody in my office said ... such a thing about somebody, I would apologize on behalf of the office.”\nSen.
