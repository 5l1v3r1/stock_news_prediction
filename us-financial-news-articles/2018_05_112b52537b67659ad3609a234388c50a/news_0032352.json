He said his main selection issues were in defence.\nThe squad is split evenly between domestic and foreign-based players, and Shin will have to submit his final squad by June 4.\nThe Koreans, who will face Mexico, Sweden and defending champions Germany in their group at the finals, are making their ninth straight appearance at the World Cup.\nThe are scheduled to play tune-up matches against Honduras, Bosnia, Bolivia and Senegal before meeting Sweden in their opening Group F encounter in Nizhny Novgorod on June 18.
