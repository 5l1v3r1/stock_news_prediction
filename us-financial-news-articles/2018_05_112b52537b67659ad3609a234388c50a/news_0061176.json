The other 50 percent is held by ArcelorMittal SA.\n“In the early years, most of the steel for the joint venture was sourced from ArcelorMittal South Africa. Today, while it remains an important source of steel products, ArcelorMittal SA supplies less than 20 percent of the total tonnages traded and less than 2 percent of volumes shipped by MIHBV,” Verster said.\n“The investment is no longer considered to be a core asset and we have decided to dispose of our interest,” he said.
