Opposition supporters celebrated further as he confirmed he would hand power to Anwar Ibrahim after the opposition veteran — who Mahathir ordered prosecuted years earlier — is released in June from prison after being convicted of sodomy.\nNajib’s National Front took 79 seats and other candidates secured the remaining 21, the official Election Commission said. He was expected to concede defeat later Thursday.\nMahathir had campaigned on an anticorruption platform, and his victory clears the way for a new investigation into Najib’s alleged misappropriation of money from 1MDB.
