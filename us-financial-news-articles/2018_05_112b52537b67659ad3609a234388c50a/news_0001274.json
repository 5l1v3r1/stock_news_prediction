Passenger yields, which gauge the average fare paid per mile per customer, dropped over five percent.\nHowever, IndiGo expects a 25 percent rise in available seat kilometres, a measure of the airline’s passenger carrying capacity, in the fiscal year that began on April 1.\nThe company announced on Friday that its president, Aditya Ghosh, would step down after 10 years with the company and it would consider naming Gregory Taylor, an airline sector veteran, as his successor in the coming months.
