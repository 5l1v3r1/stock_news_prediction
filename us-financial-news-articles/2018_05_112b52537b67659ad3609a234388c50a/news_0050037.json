In the wake of the 2013 rules, few banks offered these types of loans, leading borrowers in need of short-term lending or with a subpar credit history to seek out alternative options, like payday lenders.\nCritics of such short-term loans argue it can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt as they struggle to pay off the debt, which is often accompanied by extremely high interest rates.\nOtting argued on Wednesday that banks could be in a position to service a portion of those lenders and offer products that are more appealing to borrowers without placing excessive risk on banks.\n“I am an advocate for figuring out a way to get national banks back into that space,” he said.\nCurrently, rules established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) restrict the terms of loans with maturities of fewer than 45 days. Those rules will take effect in August 2019, but the CFPB, under new Republican leadership, has said it plans to revisit those restrictions.\nThe OCC said on Wednesday it wanted to work with the CFPB in that rewrite to ensure banks can offer short-term loans across a variety of maturities.
