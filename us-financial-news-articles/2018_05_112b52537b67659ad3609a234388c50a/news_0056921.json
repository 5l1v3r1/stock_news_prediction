Riverland and the Nowingi project in the state of Victoria need offers to connect to the grid before construction can begin.\nA smaller project, Cape York, in the state of Queensland already has development approval and an offer to connect to the grid.\n“There are many markets beyond Australia where big batteries can provide substantial value in terms of network strength and dispatchable capacity,” Lyon Group Chairman David Green said in a statement.\n($1 = 1.3221 Australian dollars)\nReporting by Sonali Paul; additional reporting by Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T04:29:51.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
