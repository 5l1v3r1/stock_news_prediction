(Nasdaq: SRTS ), a medical device company specializing in the non-invasive treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers and keloids with superficial radiation therapy (SRT), announces financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights from the first quarter of 2018 and recent weeks include:\nAchieved 10 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth, with revenues up 37% year over year to $6.0 million Shipped 21 systems including 12 SRT-100 Vision™ systems, bringing the worldwide installed base to 350 units; more than 70 centers are using SRT systems to treat keloid scars in addition to skin cancer Launched a new line of laser systems for clinical and aesthetic dermatologic solutions; sold four laser systems in the first quarter of 2018 Opened a new subsidiary in Israel for research and development and sales Presented an abstract at the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) Annual Meeting illustrating the low recurrence rate of keloids post-keloidectomy using SRT\nManagement Commentary\n\"Our business momentum continued during the first quarter of 2018, and I am very pleased to report our 10 th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth,\" said Joe Sardano, chairman and chief executive officer of Sensus Healthcare. \"Revenues of $6.0 million were up 37% over last year's first quarter and included strong sales of our feature-rich, premium-priced SRT-100-Vision™ system for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer and keloids. We also had a month's contribution from our new line of three lasers launched on March 1 under the Sensus Laser Systems brand. These lasers provide a wide range of aesthetic and clinical solutions, including tissue ablation, acne treatment, and hair and tattoo removal, among other uses, while providing our dedicated sales force with additional products as they call on dermatologists and Mohs surgeons.\"\nMr. Sardano added, \"The growing contribution of SRT-100 Vision™ systems, which accounted for more than half of the units sold during the quarter, contributed to a year over year increase in gross margin to 66.2%, up from 65.6% in the prior-year's first quarter.\n\"We opened a subsidiary in Tel Aviv during the quarter with a two-pronged goal,\" Mr. Sardano continued. \"With SRT-100 Vision™ systems already installed in Israel, we see opportunity to expand sales there while using this office as a springboard to the rest of the Middle East and Europe. Also, we are mindful of the wealth of aesthetic technology being developed in Israel, and believe there are multiple opportunities for collaboration to expand our product portfolio. We recently announced the further expansion of our reach with new distribution agreements in Mexico, Korea, Germany, Thailand, and Costa Rica.\n\"We continue to invest in research and development in the U.S., and are developing new applications, products and upgrades to our offerings that are expected to support revenue growth for the foreseeable future. We filed a 510(k) application with the U.S. FDA for our new SRT system for Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) for breast and other cancers. Our application is progressing through the Agency, and we are optimistic we will be in a position to launch this system by the end of the year. With this in mind, we are dividing our sales responsibilities for the International and Domestic Oncology Markets. Last week, we announced that Rick Golin, EVP and co-founder of the company, will focus on our expanding International business. Consequently, we are very pleased to announce the hiring of Ms. Rita Gable, a seasoned and well-respected sales professional who has spent the last 15 years of her career in the Oncology market and specifically, the past 8 years in Proton Therapy with the leader in that market, IBA. Rita will lead our sales team as Vice President of Sales – Oncology and will lead the introduction of IORT into the US market when it becomes available to the market.\"\nMr. Sardano continued, \"I am pleased with the progress in China following the recent launch of the SRT-100 for the treatment and prevention of keloids. Along with our distributor in China, Chindex Medical, we are excited about the growth opportunity this new indication represents, as the number of Chinese with keloid scars is very large. We hope to receive clearance from the China Food and Drug Administration for the SRT-100 Vision™ system by the end of the year.\n\"We expect our installed base of SRT systems to increase to more than 400 by the end of 2018, and our confidence is supported by the excellent start to the year. While we are open to gaining mass through a strategic acquisition, we continue to invest in research and development and in sales and marketing to grow Sensus organically.\"\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 37% to $6.0 million, compared with $4.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is attributable to a higher number of units sold, in particular the SRT-100 Vision™, which has a higher average selling price.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.9 million, or 66.2% of revenue, compared with $2.9 million, or 65.6% of revenue, for the first quarter of 2017. The higher gross profit margin was mainly due to a sales mix favoring the SRT-100 Vision™.\nSelling and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.2 million, compared with $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.3 million, compared with $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to stock compensation expense of over $0.5 million during the 2018 quarter. Excluding this non-cash expense, general and administrative expense decreased by over $0.1 million.\nResearch and development expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.5 million, compared with $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is due to the ongoing IORT project, along with additional development of new products.\nThe net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.1 million, or $0.08 per share, compared with a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.12 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $(0.5) million, compared with $(1.4) million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest and stock-compensation expense. Please see below for a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, and the specific reasons these non-GAAP financial measures are provided.\nCash, cash equivalents and investments were $9.5 million as of March 31, 2018, compared with $10.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Sensus Healthcare management uses Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, in its analysis of performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures nor should it be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-compensation expense, provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of Sensus Healthcare. Non-GAAP financial measures are not formally defined by GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by Sensus Healthcare. As a complement to GAAP financial measures, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA assists investors who follow the practice of some investment analysts who adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude items that may obscure underlying performance and distort comparability. A reconciliation of the GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the schedule below.\nSENSUS HEALTHCARE, INC.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n(unaudited)\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet loss, as reported\n$ (1,125,913)\n$ (1,572,133)\nAdd:\nDepreciation and amortization\n100,533\n94,157\nStock compensation expense\n538,037\n104,072\nInterest, net\n11,393\n(16,100)\nAdjusted EBITDA, non GAAP\n$ (475,950)\n$ (1,390,004)\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host an investment community conference call today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, during which management will discuss financial results for the 2018 first quarter, provide a business update and answer questions.
