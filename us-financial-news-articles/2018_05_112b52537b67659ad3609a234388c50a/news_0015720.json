(“Tactile Medical”) (Nasdaq:TCMD), a medical technology company focused on developing medical devices for the treatment of chronic diseases at home, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary:\nFirst quarter revenues increased 35% year-over-year, to $26.8 million, compared to $19.9 million in first quarter 2017. Flexitouch revenues increased 40% year-over-year, to $24.5 million, compared to $17.5 million in first quarter 2017. Operating loss of $1.8 million, compared to operating loss of $2.9 million in first quarter 2017. Net loss of $0.1 million, compared to net loss of $1.5 million in first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA of $0.1 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.7 million in first quarter 2017.\nHighlights Subsequent to Quarter-End:\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company announced that its latest-generation Flexitouch system, the Flexitouch Plus, is commercially available throughout the United States for the treatment of lymphedema. The Company previously announced U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for the Flexitouch Plus in June 2017, and recently completed its limited market release of the system.\n“Our first quarter sales performance, marked by 40% growth in sales of our Flexitouch system, represents an exciting start to 2018 and reflects the increasing awareness of, and demand for, our Flexitouch system in the lymphedema market,” said Gerald R. Mattys, Chief Executive Officer of Tactile Medical. “Our Flexitouch sales growth during the quarter continued to benefit from the expansion of our sales team in recent years, our efforts to target high-volume accounts and our expansion of in-network coverage with commercial insurers. In addition, we saw strong growth in sales to the Veterans Administration hospital system. We also made progress preparing for the commercialization of our latest-generation Flexitouch system, the Flexitouch Plus, which we launched in early April.”\nMr. Mattys continued, “We are increasing our 2018 revenue guidance based on our strong start in the first quarter. We expect to continue leveraging our strong revenue growth into improved profitability in 2018. We remain committed to delivering on our mission to help people with chronic diseases live better and care for themselves at home.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased $7.0 million, or 35%, to $26.8 million, compared to $19.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in revenues was attributable to an increase of $7.0 million, or 40%, in Flexitouch system sales. This increase was largely driven by expansion of the Company’s salesforce, growth in the Veterans Administration channel, increased physician and patient awareness of the treatment options for lymphedema, and expanded contractual coverage with national and regional insurance payers.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased $5.3 million, or 37%, to $19.5 million, compared to $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin was 72.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 71.7% of sales in the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $4.2 million, or 25%, to $21.4 million, compared to $17.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses in the first quarter was primarily driven by an increase of $2.4 million, or 24% year-over-year, in sales and marketing expenses due to continued investment in field sales team expansion and marketing activities to increase awareness. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was also impacted by a $1.5 million, or 26%, increase in reimbursement, general and administrative expenses and a $0.3 million, or 29%, increase in research and development expenses.\nOperating loss for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.1 million, or 38%, to $1.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax benefit for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million, compared to income tax benefit of $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the current period tax benefit was due to increased tax-deductible stock-based compensation activity recognized in the current quarter.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 decreased approximately $1.5 million, or 97%, to $0.1 million, or $0.00 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.09 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Weighted average shares used to compute net loss per share were 18.0 million and 16.9 million for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately $1.8 million year-over-year to $0.1 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash Position\nAt March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $41.2 million, compared to $43.9 million at December 31, 2017. The Company had no debt outstanding at March 31, 2018.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nFor 2018, the Company now expects revenues in the range of $132 million to $134 million, representing growth of 21% to 23% year-over-year, compared to revenues of $109.3 million in 2017. This compares to the Company’s prior guidance range of $131 million to $133 million.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7 to discuss the results of the quarter with a question and answer session.

Adjusted EBITDA in this release represents net loss less interest income, net, plus income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because the Company believes it is a useful indicator of its operating performance. Management uses the measure principally as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget and financial projections. The Company believes this measure is useful to investors as supplemental information because it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric in the Company’s compensation program.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and as an alternative to, or superior to, net income or loss as a measure of or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company’s GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. The Company’s definition of this measure is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table contains a reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\nTactile Systems Technology, Inc.\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss $ (50 ) $ (1,504 ) Interest income, net (108 ) (62 ) Income tax benefit (1,686 ) (1,373 ) Depreciation and amortization 463 298 Stock-based compensation 1,481 957 Adjusted EBITDA $ 100 $ (1,684 )\nTactile Systems Technology, Inc.\nSupplemental Financial Information\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes revenues by product ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Flexitouch System $ 24,530 $ 17,526 $ 7,004 40.0 % Entre / Actitouch Systems 2,318 2,324 (6 ) (0.3 )% Total Revenue $ 26,848 $ 19,850 $ 6,998 35.3 %\nInvestor Inquiries: Mike Piccinino, CFA Managing Director Westwicke Partners 443-213-0500 investorrelations@tactilemedical.com\nSource:Tactile Systems Technology, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5e528ddc-facb-41f2-b232-4bb7a34511ba"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T00:21:10.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
