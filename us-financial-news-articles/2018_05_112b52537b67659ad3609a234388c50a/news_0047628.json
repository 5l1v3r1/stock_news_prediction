Earlier this month however, they also voted him their player of the season.\nZiyech intends to move on from Ajax after the World Cup and the finals present him with a stage to attract top-quality suitors.\n“I have little left to achieve in the Netherlands and I feel I need a new challenge,” he said.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T02:19:17.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
