The central bank projected headline inflation averaging 2-3 percent in 2018, up from 1.8 percent in the first quarter.\nMonetary policy would remain accommodative, the governor said, adding that it premature to judge how the new government’s policies would effect economic growth.\n“Although 5.4 percent is slightly lower than official projection of 5.5-6.0 percent (growth in 2018), GDP growth is expected to remain favorable going forward, driven by continued strength in domestic and global demand,” Muhammad told reporters.\nThe central bank said first quarter growth was propped up by expanding private sector activity and strong support from exports.\nNet exports saw a sharp rebound, expanding 62.4 percent annually in the first quarter compared to a 1.9 percent contraction in the October-December period.\nOther data released on Thursday showed Malaysia’s current account deficit widened to 15.0 billion ringgit ($3.78 billion) in the first quarter from 13.9 billion ringgit in the previous three months.\nReporting by Joseph Sipalan; Writing by A.
