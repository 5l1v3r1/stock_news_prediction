He noted that the terror group, having lost ground to U.S.-led forces in the Middle East, had ordered its followers to attack wherever they could, citing a fatal stabbing by a Muslim extremist in Paris over the weekend.\nIndonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, has long faced a terrorism threat but has had considerable success in quelling Islamist violence since the early 2000s. Sunday’s coordinated attacks, however, were the deadliest in almost a decade, fueling concerns that extremists may be regrouping.\n“The fact that they used children, in three separate bombings, shows an unbelievable degree of callousness, but also ideological indoctrination,” said Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who studies Southeast Asian security.\n“The degree of coordination and sophistication we have seen in these attacks is not something we’ve seen in years,” he said. Islamic State “may be down, but they are not out.”\nThe attacks come as Indonesian authorities have cracked down on top radical leaders. The country’s de facto leader of Islamic State supporters, Aman Abdurrahman, is on trial for inciting followers to commit acts of terror, while his heir apparent, Zainal Anshori, was sentenced in February to seven years in prison for smuggling guns.\n‘ [Islamic State] may be down, but they are not out. ’\n—Zachary Abuza In recent days, police also arrested other suspected militants who were allegedly planning to attack a detention center for terrorist inmates in Jakarta, the capital. Inmates there killed five police officers in a revolt last week.\n“They were angry and wanted to retaliate,” Mr. Karnavian said of the perpetrators of recent attacks. “There’s international and local dynamics” at play, he added.\nMr. Karnavian was speaking after three families in this city on the main island of Java detonated bombs that left most of them dead.\nOn Sunday, a family of six, including children aged 9 to 18, killed at least seven people in suicide bombings at three churches in the city. It was the first use of children in a terrorist attack in Indonesia.\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, and police said the children’s father had been the leader of a pro-Islamic State cell in Surabaya. Mr. Karnavian corrected an earlier statement that the family had traveled to the Middle East in support of Islamic State, saying instead that the father had been inspired by Indonesian radicals returning from the region.\nPolice vehicles flank the Surabaya police headquarters following an attack there on Monday.

The family’s father, mother and two boys died in the attack, while an 8-year-old daughter survived, police said.\nMeanwhile, police shot dead one man overnight at an apartment in a town near Surabaya after a bomb in his possession exploded and killed his wife and daughter. A police spokesman said officers shot the man when they encountered him holding a switch connected to a bomb. Mr. Karnavian said explosives found on the premises were similar to pipe bombs used in the church attacks and might have detonated accidentally due to heat or movement.\nSidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, said the attacks in recent days were the most coordinated in Indonesia since Christmas Eve in 2000, when militants struck churches and pastors in numerous cities.\nWrite to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-10466?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10466?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10466?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10466?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10468?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10468?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10466?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10468?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10468?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10468?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10468?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-10466?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-14T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T16:05:11.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
