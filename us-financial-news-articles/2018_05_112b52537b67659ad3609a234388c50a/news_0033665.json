Instilling uniform cultural values has gotten more difficult as Goldman has grown from the private firm with 5,000 employees Scherr joined in 1993 to the global banking institution with 30,000 employees that it is today, he said.\n“When I look back over 25 years, I don’t think the themes that are being covered in these more organized sessions are frankly very different than those that were pervasive early on,” said Scherr. “What has changed is that at a purely practical level we’re a much bigger organization.”\nGoldman Sachs listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May 1999. The bank has maintained its partnership program, but partners now represent less than 2 percent of total staff.\nGoldman took a hard look at its culture following the financial crisis, when its image was tainted by claims it misled investors over profitable mortgage trades and a former employee who wrote a book accusing bank executives of calling clients “muppets.” ( reut.rs/TKAIjb )\nFollowing that review, an internal committee released a report in 2013 reiterating a set of core business principles established by former CEO John Whitehead that focused on integrity, trust and putting clients first. ( reut.rs/122nCbB )\nThe training sessions build on that effort, especially as Blankfein enters his 13th year as CEO and prepares to eventually hand the reins over to Solomon.\nGoldman executives said they are trying to make the training sessions relevant to real situations managers encounter. Sessions begin with video case studies that lead to interactive group discussions.\nBlankfein makes an appearance at the start of each session by video, telling managers to foster a culture in which employees see it their “individual responsibility to raise issues that they are worried about.” (Reporting by Henry Engler of Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.
