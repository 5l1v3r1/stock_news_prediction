(NASDAQ: FTEK) , a world leader in advanced engineering solutions for the optimization of combustion systems and emissions control in utility and industrial applications, today reported financial results for the first quarter (“Q1 2018”).\n“We are very pleased with our results for Q1 as they are in line with our expectations for the beginning of 2018,” said Vincent J. Arnone, Chairman, President, and CEO of Fuel Tech. “Significantly higher revenues reflected the impact of our successful business development in 2017 and early 2018, while lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses stemmed from our previously announced cost-containment initiatives over the past three years. We expect to realize the full year benefit of this lower cost profile in 2018.\n“We remain optimistic about our performance for 2018, and continue to pursue a solid pipeline of contract opportunities, particularly in the US. We are excited about the long-term potential associated with our previously announced exclusive license agreement with NanO2 LLC (“NanO2”) to market and sell NanO2’s dissolved gas technology. This represents a new business vertical for Fuel Tech - environmental solutions focused on water.”\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company reiterates its forecast for continuing operational improvement in 2018 when compared to 2017. This includes higher total revenues, driven primarily our Air Pollution Control (“APC”) business, profitable operations and positive cash flow generation, due in large part by a lower cost structure.\nQ1 2018 Results Overview\nConsolidated revenues rose 50.6% to $12.8 million from $8.5 million in Q1 2017, reflecting the timing of project execution due to the conversion of previously announced new orders during 2017 and early 2018.\nCost of sales rose to $7.8 million, or 60.7% of revenues, from $4.8 million, or 56.2% of revenues, in Q1 2017, due primarily to the conversion of previously announced new orders, project mix, and certain product demonstration expenses.\nGross margin declined to 39.3% of revenues from 43.8% in Q1 2017, due to the revenue mix between APC and FUEL CHEM, as well as certain product demonstration expenses.\nSG&A expenses declined 4.5% to $4.9 million, or 38.5% of revenues, from $5.2 million, or 60.7% of revenues, in Q1 2017, driven primarily by the previously announced cost containment initiatives.\nNet loss from continuing operations was $191,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in Q1 2017.\nNet loss for the quarter was $216,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.11 per share, in Q1 2017. Net loss in Q1 2017 included a loss from discontinued operations of $730,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, reflecting losses from the Company’s Fuel Conversion segment, the operations of which were discontinued in 2017.\nAPC segment revenues rose by 114.5% to $8.6 million from $4.0 million in Q1 2017, driven by an improved pace of U.S. bookings during 2017 as compared to recent historical levels. APC gross margin was $3.0 million, or 34.8%, as compared to $1.5 million, or 37.5%, in Q1 2017, due to product line and geographical mix versus the prior quarter.\nFUEL CHEM segment revenues decreased to $4.2 million from $4.5 million in Q1 2017, with gross margin of 48.5% as compared to 49.5% for the same period last year. We believe that full year FUEL CHEM revenues in 2018 will trend similarly to 2017.\nResearch and development expenses for Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 were $0.3 million, respectively, which supports our continued development of new products.\nEBITDA for Q1 2018 was $31,000 as compared to an EBITDA loss of $1.9 million for Q1 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $12.2 million, which included restricted cash of $6.5 million. Shareholders’ equity was $34.7 million, or $1.44 per share, and the Company had zero long-term debt. Capital projects backlog was $19.7 million, as compared to $22.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 10:00 am ET / 9:00 am CT to discuss the results and business activities.\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing:\n(877) 423-9820 (Domestic) or (201) 493-6749 (International)\nThe conference call will also be accessible via the Upcoming Events section of the Company’s web site at www.ftek.com .

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock compensation expense, and building impairment. The Company's reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP standards, but are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and ability to generate cash flow, which we believe is a meaningful measure for our investor and analyst communities. In many cases non-GAAP financial measures are utilized by these individuals to evaluate Company performance and ultimately determine a reasonable valuation for our common stock. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest GAAP measure of net income (loss) has been included in the above financial table.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006428/en/\nFuel Tech, Inc.\nJim Pach, (630) 845-4500\nPrincipal Financial Officer\nor\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nDevin Sullivan, (212) 836-9608\nSenior Vice President\nSource: Fuel Tech, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftek.com%2F&esheet=51803984&newsitemid=20180509006428&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ftek.com&index=2&md5=f8c77e54c20a9c686e8853efa85d1bdf", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftek.com&esheet=51803984&newsitemid=20180509006428&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ftek.com&index=3&md5=a55328eb67ab86db9c7a434bf5bc47dd", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509006428/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftek.com&esheet=51803984&newsitemid=20180509006428&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ftek.com&index=1&md5=9ffbdb0e17bf6fbdab2890db2a9f0e48"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:27:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
