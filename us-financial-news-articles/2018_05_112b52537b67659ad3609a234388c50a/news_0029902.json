All Russian track and field athletes bar one and the weightlifting team were banned from the summer games in Rio in 2016.\n“The information is mostly mail conversations, but material and lists from Swedish anti-doping work has also been published,” the Swedish Sports Confederation said in a statement.\nIt said the attack was by the Fancy Bears hacking group, which has been linked by Western governments and security experts to a Russian spy agency blamed for some of the cyber operations that marred the 2016 U.S. election.\nFancy Bears said on its website that the documents showed some Swedish athletes were breaking anti-doping rules. It did not immediately respond to an emailed request for more information.\nThe Confederation said the attack was aimed at discrediting its anti-doping activities.\nFancy Bears has been blamed for an attack on the IAAF, the governing body of global athletics, in early April.\nThe group was also blamed for an Olympics-related hack in 2016, when the World Anti-Doping Agency said it stole and published confidential medical information on athletes.\nWestern governments and security experts have linked Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, to a Russian intelligence agency and have blamed it for operations including an attack on the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections.\nMoscow has repeatedly denied its involvement in these intrusions.
