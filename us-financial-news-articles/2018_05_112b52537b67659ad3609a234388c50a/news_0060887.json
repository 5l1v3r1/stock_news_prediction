The four are now in jail awaiting trial.\nA fifth monk, who is also a member of the council, turned himself into police on Wednesday.\n“We are investigating. We will take him to jail this afternoon,” Maitri Chimcherd, the commander of the Crime Suppression Division, told Reuters.\nBuddhism is followed by more than 90 percent of Thailand’s population of 69 million.\nThailand’s temples, which earn billions of dollars every year from donations, have been embroiled in scandals ranging from murder, sex and drugs to shady financial dealings.\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Panarat Thepgumpanat; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:12:52.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
