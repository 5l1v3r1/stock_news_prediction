Amazon employed about 566,000 full- and part-time employees worldwide at the end of December, and on Monday announced it was hiring 3,000 people in Vancouver.\nBoston is among a list of 20 finalists to land Amazon’s second headquarters, which would create about 50,000 new jobs and cost more than $5 billion.
