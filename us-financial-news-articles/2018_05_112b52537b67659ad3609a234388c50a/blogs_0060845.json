Over four days, the movie brought in $101 million. This was about $40 million light of revenue expectations, according to FBR Capital Markets analyst Barton Crockett.\n\"All else equal, this suggests the Star Wars movie is pacing close to breakeven, a 2% headwind for our Disney estimates,\" Crockett said in a note to clients Tuesday.\nLast week, revenue forecasts had been as high as $150 million for the four-day debut of \"Solo.\"\nThe movie marked the lowest opening for a Disney-produced film in the Star Wars franchise. Until then, \"Rogue One\" had been Disney's lowest-grossing Star Wars film, bringing in $155 million in its 2016 debut. \"The Last Jedi\" brought in $220 million, while \"The Force Awakens\" brought in $248 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\nThe company paid $4 billion in 2012 to buy the franchise from Star Wars creator LucasFilm.\nThe recent box office weakness could be mitigated by an advertising lift from the upcoming seven-game NBA conference finals and strength in Disney's Marvel movies franchise, FBR's Crockett said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:49:54.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
