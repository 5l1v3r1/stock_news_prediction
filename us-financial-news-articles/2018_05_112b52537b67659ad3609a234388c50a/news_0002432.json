Everyone has a vote, it is a very democratic, open process and there are very stringent guidelines, set by FIFA, as to what you can and cannot do and we are following them scrupulously,” U.S Soccer Federation president Carlos Cordeiro told Reuters.\nThose with the vote certainly appreciate being involved.\n“I am really glad we are having these meetings, it is part of the reform process that we moved the decision-making from the few,” Danish FA President Jesper Moller said.\n“We can and did ask a lot of questions and that is very good for a democratic and open process,” he added. PUBLISHED CRITERIA\nYet while the powerpoint presentations and Q&A sessions have been given new importance, along with FIFA’s own technical examination of the bids, which must now meet a series of published criteria, outside influences continue to have power over the process.\nU.S. President Donald Trump waded into the campaign last week with a Tweet that made clear he expected countries that receive American economic and other forms of support to deliver their votes for his nation’s bid.\nMorocco is not only expecting to benefit from the tendency for African countries to vote as a block but also enjoys the support of Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\n“I like to think that people will make decisions based on what is in their best interests and the interests of football and that this not a geo-political discussion at the UN,” Cordeiro said.\nThere is also another reality of football politics that hasn’t changed – the need to deliver FIFA some handsome profits.\nIn a media presentation, Morocco bid CEO Hicham El Amrani, said a study had shown that “Morocco can guarantee a net profit of 5 billion US dollars, considering a revenue of 7.2 billion and an expense of 2.2 billion,” – figures that were strongly questioned by Cordeiro.\nThe first page of the North American bid’s brochure states they expect $2 billion in ticket revenue alone and the bid says they would generate more than $5 billion in short-term economic activity.\n“They are two strong bids,” Moller said diplomatically when asked if either of the proposals had won over the Nordic voters.\nThe vote will be held at the FIFA congress on June 13 in Moscow.
