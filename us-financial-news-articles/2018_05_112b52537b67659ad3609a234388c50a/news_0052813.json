(TSX.V:AEC) (OTCQB:ANLDF) (FRANKFURT:0AD) (“Anfield” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce that Stephen S. Lunsford has agreed to join the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Lunsford has had an extensive career as a geologist in the uranium sector, spanning four decades, with his vast experience generated through his time working with entities such as Cameco Resources, Inc., American Nuclear Corp. and Power Resources, Inc. (PRI). In addition, Mr. Lunsford was involved in a feasibility study completed by PRI for Cotter with regard to Anfield’s recently-acquired Charlie project in Wyoming. Overall, Mr. Lunsford’s regional expertise and uranium asset knowledge will be a significant asset to Anfield.\n“We are excited to have someone of Mr. Lunsford’s calibre joining our board of directors,” commented Anfield’s CEO Corey Dias. “His successful career spanning four decades in the uranium industry with well-known entities in the sector, such as Cameco and PRI, is impressive, and his extensive knowledge of Wyoming uranium will prove to be a great value to the Company as we move our projects forward. Moreover, his direct knowledge with regard to the Charlie project could allow Anfield to further streamline our path to production.”\nMr. Lunsford began his career with American Nuclear Corp. in 1972 where he began as a field geologist supervising field drilling programs for as many as seven drill rigs. He later became a project geologist where he organized and directed all aspects of exploration drilling programs.\nIn 1987 Mr. Lunsford began work as a project geologist with Everest Minerals, which became PRI in 1989. In 1996 PRI was acquired by Cameco Inc., and in 2008 PRI’s name was changed to Cameco Resources. During his time with Everest/PRI/Cameco, Mr. Lunsford planned and implemented delineation and exploration drilling programs and mapped subsurface roll fronts by means of drill hole geophysical logs. As project geologist he generated uranium reserve/resource evaluations, created and maintained drill hole databases and planned and designed in-situ patterns. His responsibilities also included data collection and geology for generating mine permit applications.\nFrom 2000 to 2002 Mr. Lunsford served as the senior project geologist on PRI’s Smith Ranch-Highland Mine where he evaluated the uranium reserve/resource estimation by geologic and geostatistical methods. He designed and evaluated uranium in-situ production patterns, performed prospect evaluations, and created and/or supervised maintenance of the geophysical drill hole database. He also managed production databases, tracked production and created monthly production reports.\nIn 2002 he became chief geologist for the Smith Ranch-Highland Mine where he evaluated uranium prospects and supervised uranium IST mining efforts. As chief geologist he functioned as the qualified person (QP) for purposes of NI 43-101 reports.\nFrom 2006 until his retirement in 2013, Mr. Lunsford served as senior evaluation geologist for PRI/Cameco Resources. In this position he generated uranium prospects internally and evaluated prospects submitted from outside sources. During this period he continued to serve as the QP on NI 43-101 reports for PRI/Cameco.\nFrom 2013 to 2014 Mr. Lunsford was a consulting geologist to Tetra Tech and Anatolia Energy on the Temrezil Uranium project in Turkey. His responsibilities included reserve/resource estimation to enable definition of mineral resource boundaries, and assisting in preparation of a preliminary wellfield layout to support the development of a pre-feasibility study.\nWe also announce the resignation of Jim Rasmussen from the Anfield Board. We would like to thank Mr. Rasmussen for his significant contributions to the Company over the years, and wish him all the best in his future endeavours.\nAbout Anfield\nAnfield is a uranium and vanadium development and near-term production company that is committed to becoming a top-tier energy-related fuels supplier by creating value through sustainable, efficient growth in its assets. Anfield is a publicly-traded corporation listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (AEC-V), the OTCQB Marketplace (ANLDF) and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (0AD). Anfield is focused on two production centres, as summarized below:\nWyoming – Irigaray ISR Processing Plant (Resin Processing Agreement)\nAnfield has signed a Resin Processing Agreement with Uranium One whereby Anfield would process up to 500,000 pounds per annum of its mined material at Uranium One’s Irigaray processing plant in Wyoming. In addition, the Company can both buy and borrow uranium from Uranium One in order to fulfill some or all of its sales contracts.\nAnfield’s 24 ISR mining projects are located in the Black Hills, Powder River Basin, Great Divide Basin, Laramie Basin, Shirley Basin and Wind River Basin areas in Wyoming. Anfield’s two projects in Wyoming for which NI 43-101 resource reports have been completed are Red Rim and Clarkson Hill.\nThe Charlie Project, acquired from Cotter Corporation is located in the Pumpkin Buttes Uranium District in Johnson County, Wyoming. The Charlie Project consists of a 720-acre Wyoming State uranium lease which has been in development since 1969.\nArizona/Utah – Shootaring Canyon Mill\nA key asset in Anfield’s portfolio is the Shootaring Canyon Mill in Garfield County, Utah. The Shootaring Canyon Mill is strategically located within one of the historically most prolific uranium production areas in the United States, and is one of only three licensed uranium mills in the United States.\nAnfield’s conventional uranium assets consist of mining claims and state leases in southeastern Utah and Arizona, targeting areas where past uranium mining or prospecting occurred. Anfield’s conventional uranium assets include the Velvet-Wood Project, the Frank M Uranium Project, as well as the Findlay Tank breccia pipe. An NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment has been completed for the Velvet-Wood Project. All conventional uranium assets are situated within a 125-mile radius of the Shootaring Mill.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors\nANFIELD ENERGY INC.\nCorey Dias, Chief Executive Officer\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nContact:\nAnfield Energy, Inc.\nClive Mostert\nCorporate Communications\n780-920-5044\ncontact@anfieldenergy.com\nwww.anfieldenergy.com\nSafe Harbor Statement\nTHIS NEWS RELEASE CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS”.
