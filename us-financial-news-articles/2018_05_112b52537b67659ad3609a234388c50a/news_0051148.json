The 1-2 and 5-1 wells were both drilled with a 1,900 metre lateral section and were completed with 28 and 30 stages, respectively. Initially only a fraction of the total stages were opened on each well to assess contributions from the new frac system employed. Initial production rates through testers averaged 473 boe/d (82% oil) for the 1-2 well on an 11-day test and 388 boe/d (83% oil) for the 5-1 well for the final 4 days of a 19 day test period. The Company is encouraged by the unconstrained deliverability of the wells and believes the new frac systems were effective in linking net pay intervals within the Muskeg zone. The wells are currently experiencing some surface restrictions due to pipeline pressures. Strategic is actively evaluating alternatives to debottleneck the system at west Marlowe to fully optimize the new wells. Average rates over the first 30 days of production are as follows:\nIP30 Current rate Well Total (boe/d) % oil\nTotal (boe/d) % oil\n1-2 309 86 % 122 83 % 5-1 165 87 % 168 91 % Corporate production volumes decreased 10% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2,183 boe/d for the current period due to natural declines and a Company-operated pipeline being evaluated at north Marlowe which resulted in a loss of 145 boe/d. The decline was partially offset by production volumes from the new Muskeg wells drilled in the first quarter.\nStrategic had estimated a total of $9 million in capital spending for the first half of 2018. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $9.2 million, and the Company expects an additional $1 million in spending in the second quarter to complete the program, with the increase related to minor facilities projects and additional completion costs incurred while monitoring the effectiveness of the new frac design.\nStrategic is encouraged by the production potential of the latest Muskeg wells, and feels that the new drilling and completion techniques were effective in correcting the well placement and connectivity issues experienced with the 2017 drilling program. The Company is working on reducing surface restrictions to enhance productivity of the west Marlowe area. The information gained from the two-well winter program will be incorporated into the next development plan, which is currently in the planning stage.\nAs previously announced, the Company’s new CEO Tony Berthelet started on May 21, 2018. Mr. Berthelet commented: “I am excited to join Strategic at this point in the Company’s history to lead the effort to realize value from the significant light oil resource under our land base.”\nQUARTERLY SUMMARY\nCapital expenditures of $9.2 million were incurred in the quarter, primarily related to the two well Muskeg development drilling program and minor recompletion and pipeline projects. Revenues increased 13% from the first quarter of 2017 to $10.1 million for the period, due to higher oil production and an increase in realized oil prices. The average WTI oil price for the quarter was US $62.87/bbl, and WTI prices are currently over US $70/bbl. Despite higher revenues, funds from operations decreased to $1.6 million for the quarter from $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily related to higher operating costs, higher royalty rates driven by the increase in commodity prices and cash interest expense on the Company’s convertible debentures starting March 1, 2018. Average production decreased 4% from the first quarter of 2017 to 2,183 boe/d for the first three months of 2018, as contributions from the two new Muskeg wells drilled during the quarter were offset by downtime caused by pipeline maintenance work, primarily at north Marlowe. The Company issued $4.1 million of additional convertible debentures as payment in kind of interest payable on February 28, 2018 to preserve cash while pursuing its capital spending program. The additional debentures have the same terms as the original debentures except that they are convertible into common shares of the Company at a price of $1.08 per share.\nSTOCK OPTIONS\nOn May 22, 2018, Strategic issued 1.0 million stock options to the incoming CEO of the Company. Each option entitles the holder to acquire one common share of the Company for a period of five years at a price of $1.08 per share. These options are issued in accordance with the Company's incentive stock option plan.\nAbout Strategic\nStrategic is a junior oil and gas company committed to becoming a premier northern oil and gas operator by exploiting its light oil assets primarily in northern Alberta. The Company maintains control over its resource base through high working interest ownership in wells, construction and operation of its own processing facilities and a significant undeveloped land and opportunity base. Strategic’s primary operating area is at Marlowe, Alberta.

These flow-back or test results are Quote: d on a raw basis before shrinkage on natural gas volumes and may not be indicative of long-term well performance or ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in estimating the aggregate production for the Company. Total corporate production volumes include natural gas shrinkage.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release constitute forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation.

For the purpose of calculating unit information, the Company's production and reserves are reported in barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and boe per day (boed). Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio for natural gas of 6 Mcf: 1 boe has been used, which is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nThe Company utilizes certain measurements that do not have a standardized meaning or definition as prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other entities, including net debt, operating netback and funds from operations. Readers are referred to advisories and further discussion on non-GAAP measurements contained in the Company’s MD&A.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource: Strategic Oil & Gas Ltd", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9b03e67-87f5-4cda-b608-0326e0e0231c", "http://www.sogoil.com/", "http://www.sedar.com/"], "published": "2018-05-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:57:13.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
