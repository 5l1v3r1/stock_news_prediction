This latest deal cuts the exposure by an additional 1.1 billion euros.\nThe consortium includes Everyday Finance, an Irish debt management business acquired by London-based Link Financial Group from Finance Ireland in 2016, which is regulated by the Irish central bank.\nSome of the loans are in deep, long-term arrears with around 90 percent of them more than 2 years past due, and around 70 percent more than 5 years in arrears.\n“The portfolio is underpinned by investment asset properties and excludes private dwelling houses and family farm homes,” the bank said.\nThe portfolio has 800 customers with an average loan balance of 1.4 million euros ($1.65 million) and does not include loans that have been restructured and deemed to be performing by the bank. $1 = 0.8476 euros Reporting by Graham Fahy.
