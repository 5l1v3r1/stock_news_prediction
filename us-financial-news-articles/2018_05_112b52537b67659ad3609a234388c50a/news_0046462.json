He said any legal changes considered would “protect Second Amendment rights.”\nThe Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution enshrines the right to bear arms. Gun rights proponents say that language prohibits regulations on gun ownership and argue that enforcement of existing laws should be sufficient to stop violence like the scenes that played out in Santa Fe.\nGun control groups point to the regular toll of shootings across the United States as evidence that more needs to be done to rein in the proliferation of weapons.\nAbbott on Monday did not name any of the participants in three days of discussions but said they would include supporters of arming teachers and those who oppose it.\nMike Collier, a Democrat running for Texas lieutenant governor, expressed skepticism that the talks would bring significant change.\n“Dozens of Texans have been killed in massacres just six months apart ... and our state leadership feebly announces ‘roundtables,’” Collier said, referring to the November shooting of 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.\nPolice arrested Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, at the Santa Fe school following the rampage that they said he carried out with a shotgun and .38-caliber pistol. He has been charged with murder.\nTwo teachers and eight students, including Pakistani exchange student Sabika Sheikh, 17, were killed in the attack, police said.\nA chaplain carries a cross bearing the name of a victim killed in a shooting at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, U.S., May 21, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman Her father, Aziz Sheikh, said on Monday he hoped his daughter’s death would spur gun control in the United States.\n“Sabika’s case should become an example to change the gun laws,” Sheikh said in a phone interview.\nSHOTGUN GIVEAWAY Abbott’s campaign website on Monday dropped a contest which gave donors a chance to win a shotgun, one of the types of weapons used in Friday’s attack, said John Wittman, a campaign spokesman.\n“This is a contest that started on May 1, well before these events,” Wittman said in a phone interview.\nThe offer had remained up after the shooting, drawing criticism from Texas gun-control advocates including the organizers of the Houston March for Our Lives, the national protests that followed the Florida shooting.\n“Abbott’s decision to continue the raffle was disrespectful to the Santa Fe community,” the group said on Twitter.\nPolice said Pagourtzis confessed to Friday’s killings after he was taken into custody but have offered no motive yet for the massacre.\nPagourtzis’ family said in a statement it was “saddened and dismayed” by the shooting.\nFebruary’s massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, prompted a March law creating a $67 million statewide fund to train teachers to carry weapons in the classroom. Parkland rejected its share of that funding.\nSlideshow (18 Images) In Santa Fe, some students were more interested in that idea, with 18-year-old Kassidy Monroe saying, “In some cases arming teachers may help.”\nAdditional reporting Saad Sayeed in Islamabad and Gina Cherelus in New York; Writing by Rich McKay and Scott Malone; Editing by Bill Trott and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:09:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
