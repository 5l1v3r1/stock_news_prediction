(NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands comprised of Anthropologie, BHLDN, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters brands and the Food and Beverage division, today announced net income of $41 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.38 for the three months ended April 30, 2018.\nTotal Company net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2018, increased 12.4% over the same period last year to a record $856 million. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 10%, driven by strong, double-digit growth in the digital channel and positive retail store sales. By brand, comparable Retail segment net sales increased 15% at Free People, 10% at the Anthropologie Group and 8% at Urban Outfitters. Wholesale segment net sales increased 13%.\n“We are pleased to report record first quarter sales driven by a 10% increase in comparable Retail segment sales and a 13% increase in wholesale sales,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “Even more exciting is our 280% jump in first quarter EPS, a result of strong sales, healthy margin improvement, SG&A leverage and a lower tax rate,” finished Mr. Hayne.\nNet sales by brand and segment for the three-month period were as follows:\nThree Months Ended April 30, 2018 2017 Net sales by brand Urban Outfitters $ 322,678 $ 284,787 Anthropologie Group 347,085 311,056 Free People 181,307 159,507 Food and Beverage 4,618 5,840 Total Company $ 855,688 $ 761,190 Net sales by segment Retail Segment $ 775,564 $ 690,352 Wholesale Segment 80,124 70,838 Total Company $ 855,688 $ 761,190 For the three months ended April 30, 2018, the gross profit rate increased by 130 basis points versus the prior year’s comparable period. The increase in the gross profit rate was primarily driven by lower markdowns at all three brands and leverage in store occupancy cost due to growth in Retail segment comparable net sales. These gains were partially offset by lower initial margins due in part to lower mix of private label merchandise and deleverage in delivery expense due in part to the increased penetration of the digital channel.\nAs of April 30, 2018, total inventory increased by $45.1 million, or 12.6%, on a year-over-year basis. Comparable Retail segment inventory increased 8% at cost. The remainder of the increase was primarily related to increased wholesale inventory.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8.0 million, or 3.7%, during the three months ended April 30, 2018, compared to the prior year’s comparable period. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses leveraged 224 basis points when compared to the prior year’s comparable period. The growth in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased marketing expenses helping to fuel the sales increase. The leverage for the three months ended April 30, 2018, was primarily driven by the net sales growth, continued savings associated with the fiscal 2018 store reorganization project and the current year benefit associated with the nonrecurring store reorganization expenses incurred in the prior year.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2018, was 23.6% compared to 44.1% in the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2018, was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the three months ended April 30, 2018, was favorably impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to equity activity.\nNet income for the three months ended April 30, 2018, was $41 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.38.\nOn August 22, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 20 million common shares under a share repurchase program, of which 17.9 million common shares were remaining as of April 30, 2018. No shares were repurchased during the three months ended April 30, 2018. During the year ended January 31, 2018, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 2.1 million common shares for approximately $46 million under this program.\nDuring the three months ended April 30, 2018, the Company opened a total of four new locations including: two Free People stores and two Urban Outfitters stores; and closed one Urban Outfitters store.\nUrban Outfitters, Inc., offers lifestyle-oriented general merchandise and consumer products and services through a portfolio of global consumer brands comprised of 246 Urban Outfitters stores in the United States, Canada, and Europe and websites; 226 Anthropologie Group stores in the United States, Canada and Europe, catalogs and websites; 134 Free People stores in the United States and Canada, catalogs and websites and 10 Food and Beverage restaurants, as of April 30, 2018. Free People and Anthropologie Group wholesale sell their products through approximately 2,100 department and specialty stores worldwide, digital businesses and the Company’s Retail segment.\nA conference call will be held today to discuss first quarter results and will be webcast at 5:00 pm.
