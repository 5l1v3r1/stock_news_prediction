In April, state media had said the suspect sought payback for bullying he had suffered at school.\nReuters could not reach Zhao, who has been detained by police since the day of the attack, for comment.\nViolent crime is rarer in China than many other countries, especially in major cities where security is tight. Recent years have seen a series of knife and axe attacks, however, including one this year in Beijing, the capital.\nReporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:26:42.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
