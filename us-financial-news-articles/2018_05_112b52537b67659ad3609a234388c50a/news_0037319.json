It had net debt of 2.9 billion reais at the end of March, around two times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\nThe prospectus gave no details on pricing and timing for the sale of shares, or what Bunge’s stake would be after the transaction.\nBunge’s chief executive officer, Soren Schroder, said at an investor event in New York earlier on Wednesday that an IPO would allow the Brazilian sugar milling unit to “stand on its own two feet.”\nThe company has been looking to sell the beleaguered sugar assets since 2013, but because of a downturn in the sector and the high price at which Bunge scooped up the mills, no deal has emerged.\nRaw sugar prices are languishing at multi-year lows as huge global supplies of the sweetener outpace demand.\nBunge’s chief financial officer, Thomas Boehlert, also speaking at the event in New York, noted Tuesday’s filing for a potential IPO and said the company plans to keep a majority stake in the unit in the short term. “So we would maintain a majority ownership and participate in the company, and potentially exit altogether down the road,” he said.
