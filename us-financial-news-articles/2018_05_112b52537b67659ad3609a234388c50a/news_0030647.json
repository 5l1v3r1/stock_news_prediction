Broad based revenue performance was led by double digit growth in the U.S. (U.S. +13.5%, Japan -0.2%, Europe & Canada +6.7%, Emerging Markets +2.0%; Japan growth was +7.0% excluding returned portfolio) Reported revenue grew +2.2%, with underlying growth (+5.5%) and positive currency impact (+2.5pp), partly offset by the impact of divestitures (-5.8pp).\nStellar EPS growth reflects strong revenue growth and progress of Global Opex Initiative\nUnderlying Core Earnings grew +40.2%, with the Core Earnings margin increasing by 420bps due to product mix improvement and strong cost discipline (+280bps gross margin; +160bps from OPEX margin). Reported operating profit was up +55.1%, mainly driven by Core Earnings growth. In FY2017, Takeda booked a large one-time gain of 106.3 billion yen from the sale of Wako; however, higher one-time expenses resulted in total other income/expenses being less favorable than prior year by-27.8 billion yen. Underlying Core EPS was up +44.8%, in-line with underlying Core Earnings growth. Reported EPS was 239 yen, an increase of +62.7% from 147 yen in the prior year, benefitting also from a lower tax rate due to re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the U.S. tax reform.\nSignificant pipeline progress leveraging therapeutic area expertise\n17 New Molecular Entity clinical stage-ups in FY2017, compared with 5 in the same period of the previous year. Important events included European Commission approval of ALOFISEL ® (darvadstrocel) in the area of GI, a label update for TRINTELLIX ® in neuroscience, and the initiation of Phase 3 for pevonedistat in oncology. Further strengthened innovation network with 56 new collaborations with academia and bio-tech/bio-ventures.\nNet leverage improved due to continued strong progress on cash flow\nOperating Free Cash Flow was up +52.9% to 242.9 billion yen, higher than the dividend payment for the third consecutive year. Non-core asset sales generated an additional 164.4 billion yen of cash. Strong cash generation allowed rapid de-leveraging with the net debt/EBITDA ratio improving from 2.7x in March 2017 to 1.8x in March 2018.\nChristophe Weber, President and Chief Executive Officer of Takeda, commented:\n\"Takeda's transformation is delivering superior results as we execute against our key mid-term priorities of growing the portfolio, strengthening the pipeline, and boosting profitability. In FY2017, our Growth Drivers maintained their strong momentum, which together with disciplined cost management under the Global Opex Initiative resulted in industry-leading revenue and earnings growth. We also made significant progress in R&D, with 17 New Molecular Entity clinical trial stage-ups, and 56 new collaborations to strengthen our innovation network.\nThe strength of the underlying business means we expect to maintain revenue and earnings growth momentum in FY2018, and I am confident that through strategic focus and superior execution, Takeda will continue to deliver long-term value to patients and shareholders.\"\nReported Results for FY2017 (April-March)\n(billion yen) FY2016 FY2017 % Growth vs Prior Year Reported Underlying 2 Revenue 1,732.1 1,770.5 +2.2% +5.5% Core Earnings 1 245.1 322.5 +31.6% +40.2% Operating Profit 155.9 241.8 +55.1% - Net Profit 3 114.9 186.9 +62.6% - EPS 147 yen 239 yen +62.7% +44.8% 1\nCore Earnings is calculated by deducting SG&A expenses and R&D expenses from reported Gross Profit.
