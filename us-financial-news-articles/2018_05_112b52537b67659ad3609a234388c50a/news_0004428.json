Former Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, will examine concerns about a liberal bias on Facebook.\nThe moves come as Facebook deals with a privacy scandal related to access of tens of millions of users' data by a consulting firm affiliated with President Donald Trump. CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on the issue last month. Facebook also has faced criticisms over a deluge of fake news and Russian election interference.\nThe audits were reported earlier by Axios. Facebook says the feedback will help Facebook improve and serve users more effectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T11:31:33.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
