For more information, visit www.mhplan.com .\nBasis of Presentation\nIn addition to results determined under GAAP, WellCare provides certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful in assessing the company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings per share have been adjusted for the effect of certain expenses, and as appropriate, the related tax effect, related to previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation and resolution costs (\"investigation costs\"); amortization expense associated with acquisitions (\"acquisition-related amortization expenses\"); and certain one-time transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Universal American and Meridian (\"transaction and integration costs\").\nAlthough the excluded items may recur, WellCare believes that by providing non-GAAP measures exclusive of these items, it facilitates period-over-period comparisons and provides additional clarity about events and trends affecting its core operating performance, as well as providing comparability to competitor results. The investigation costs are related to a discrete incident which management does not expect to reoccur. WellCare has adjusted for acquisition-related amortization expenses as these transactions do not directly relate to the servicing of products for our customers and are not directly related to the core performance of its business operations. The transaction and integrations costs are related to a specific 2017 and 2018 events, which do not reflect the underlying ongoing performance of the business.\nThe company is not able to project at the time of this news release the amount of expenses associated with investigation costs, the timing of transaction and integration costs and, therefore, cannot reconcile projected non-GAAP measures affected by these items to projected GAAP measures.\nCautionary Statement Regarding\nThis news release and related presentation contain \"forward-looking\" statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
