(NYSE American:IOR), a Dallas-based real estate investment company, today reported results of operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOur primary business is investing in real estate and mortgage note receivables.

This represents an increase of $2,000, as compared to the prior period advisory fees of $162,000.
