Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Helgren Speaking at an investor conference, Stephen Bird said offering high rates tends to attract “hot money” depositors rather than loyal customers.\nInstead, the bank will market the accounts nationally to its credit card customers, such as holders of its Double Cash card and cards it issues for American Airlines Group, and Costco Wholesale Corp and Home Depot Inc.\nBird said, for example, that offering additional American Airlines mileage credits will attract stable deposits to the bank.\nCitigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has fewer than 700 branches, located in just six cities. It said in March that it will offer accounts nationally on a new phone app.\nOther banks, such as Rhode Island-based regional bank Citizens Financial Group Inc, have also said they will offer accounts nationally on digital apps, raising investor concern about more competition in rates for deposits.\nReporting by David Henry in New York\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:28:00.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
