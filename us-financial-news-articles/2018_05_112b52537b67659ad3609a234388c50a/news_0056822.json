Barr’s tweet was a reply to a tweet that accused Jarrett of helping to cover up alleged misdeeds by the Obama administration.\nUsers commented that the tweet seemed racist. “Muslims r NOT a race,” Barr replied. Barr did delete the tweet. In a subsequent tweet, Barr said it was a joke.\nThe comedian and TV star pivoted again and did apologize. I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 29, 2018\nAbout five minutes later, Barr posted another tweet announcing she was leaving Twitter. I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter.\n— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 29, 2018\nWhat “leaving Twitter” means is unclear. Barr’s Twitter account was still active as of noon ET on Tuesday.\nThe apology and deleted tweet weren’t enough to stem the damage. A few hours after Barr’s tweet, Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer on the Roseanne show, tweeted she will not be returning. I will not be returning to @RoseanneOnABC .\n— Wanda Sykes (@iamwandasykes) May 29, 2018 SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/therealroseanne/status/1001470384556752898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/RoseanneOnABC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/iamwandasykes/status/1001494592649342979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/therealroseanne/status/1001471669641216005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-05-30T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T20:02:00.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
