Tennis - WTA Premier 5 - Italian Open - Foro Italico, Rome, Italy - May 19, 2018 Romania's Simona Halep celebrates winning her semi final match against Russia's Maria Sharapova REUTERS/Tony Gentile\nDefending champion Svitolina put in a clinical performance earlier in the day to beat unseeded Estonian Anett Kontaveit 6-4 6-3 in the other semi-final.\nHalep and Sharapova both made nervy starts, with neither able to hold serve until the seventh game, when the Russian finally managed to get her nose in front.\nThat proved to be the only hold of the first set, with Sharapova relinquishing her serve once more either side of breaking Halep to clinch the opener.\nThe Romanian came out stronger at the start of the second set, breaking Sharapova in the first game before holding service for the first time in the match to go 2-0 up.\nShe saved break points to extend her lead to 3-1 and then 5-1 before levelling the match.

Slideshow (8 Images) SVITOLINA SEES OFF KONTAVEIT\nEarlier in the day, Ukrainian fourth seed Svitolina struck at key moments against Kontaveit in a display that bodes well for her chances at the French Open later this month.\nTwenty-two-year-old Kontaveit offered stiff resistance, hitting 24 winners to Svitolina’s 18, but her opponent converted four of her five break-point opportunities while making seven fewer unforced errors in a contest of tight margins.\nSvitolina started well, breaking early in the first set to go 2-0 up, but Kontaveit held her nerve to take the next three games and edge in front.\nSvitolina responded well, though, and took the opener.\nWith Svitolina’s speed proving decisive, Kontaveit was forced to mix things up, but the baseliner’s touch deserted her at times in the second set, allowing the speedy Ukrainian to run down a couple of poorly disguised drop shots.\nThe world number four took an early break in the second set for a 2-1 lead, and went on to take the match on her opponent’s serve, converting her second match point with a deep forehand that left Kontaveit flailing.
