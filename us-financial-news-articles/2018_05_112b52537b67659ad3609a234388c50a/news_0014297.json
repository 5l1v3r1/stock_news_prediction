REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko/File Photo He said Boss had been unable to decouple its performance from a sluggish German fashion market and expects it will take one or two quarters to stabilize and start growing there again.\nEarnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) before special items rose 1 percent to 99 million, ahead of average analyst forecasts for 97 million, helped by lower selling and distribution costs.\nAnalysts said the rise in same-store sales was encouraging, but the fall in operating expenses that helped support profitability was due to costs being pushed back in the year and would not necessarily continue throughout the rest of 2018.\n“The stock ran strongly into the print and the 7 percent like-for-like is good enough on the top line, but the cost phasing makes full-year upgrades unlikely,” said UBS analyst Fred Speirs.\nThe core Boss brand saw sales up a currency-adjusted 7 percent, while Hugo, aimed at a younger audience, slipped 6 percent, which Langer said was due to Boss taking over selling space from Hugo, which is also cutting sales in outlet stores.\n($1 = 0.8335 euros)\nReporting by Emma Thomasson; Editing by Tom Sims and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:18:15.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
