REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\nUruguay, winners of the inaugural World Cup in 1930 and again in 1950, won nine and drew four of their 18 games in the South American qualifying competition to finish second among 10 teams, ahead of Argentina and behind five-times world champions Brazil.\nProgress to the finals was in stark contrast to previous qualifying campaigns when Uruguay scraped through to the finals via intercontinental playoffs in 2002, 2010 and 2014 after missing out altogether in 2006.\nUp against hosts Russia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in Group A at this year’s World Cup, Uruguay will consider themselves firm favourites to advance to the round of 16, a feat they have always managed under coach Oscar Tabarez.\nThey could, however, face a potentially difficult test against Spain or Portugal in the first knockout stage.\nOne more reason for Uruguay to feel upbeat heading to Russia was their strong showing in front of goal during qualifying. ‘La Celeste’ scored 32 goals, a tally bettered only by Brazil who netted 41.
