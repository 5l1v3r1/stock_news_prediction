It was last pinned at $1.1950 and threatening the low for the year so far at $1.1915.\nThe dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05, before edging back to 109.82. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index touched the highest since late December at 92.834 and was last at 92.742.\nIn the Treasury market, yields dipped slightly as a quarterly refunding program of $73 billion came in short of expectations, reducing the pressure on prices from the torrent of supply.\nOil prices slipped with the market cautious ahead of the May 12 deadline for the U.S. to ratify the Iran nuclear deal.\nReuters reported President Donald Trump has all but decided to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord but exactly how he will do so remains unclear.\nBrent crude futures fell 34 cents to $73.00 a barrel, while U.S. crude dropped 33 cents to $67.60.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:23:23.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
