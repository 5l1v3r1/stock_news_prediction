(“Silvercorp” or the “Company”) (TSX:SVM) (NYSE AMERICAN:SVM) today announced that its Board of Directors declared a semi-annual dividend of US$0.0125 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record at the close of business on June 8, 2018, with a payment date of the dividend scheduled on or before June 29, 2018.\nIn November 2016, in light of improved operations, financial results, and a growing cash position, the Company re-instated dividends, declaring a semi-annual dividend of CAD$0.01 per share (CAD$0.02 per share on an annual basis).

The Company’s vision is to deliver shareholder value by focusing on the acquisition of under developed projects with resource potential and the ability to grow organically.
