On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard, under which it recognizes revenue as it sells product to wholesale distributors. Previously, it recognized sales on the basis of a model that estimated the sale of Afrezza to patients. As of January 1 2018, it reduced $3.4 million in previously deferred revenue (that reflected inventory in sales channels) to zero and also made a corresponding decrease to accumulated deficit. A comparison of the condensed consolidated financial statements with and without the adoption of ASC 606 can be found in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Total revenue for was $3.4 million compared to $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.4 million or 15%. This increase was primarily due to the increased net revenue from Afrezza, partially offset by the sale of bulk insulin of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCost of goods sold for was $4.0 million compared to $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase $1.5 million or 57%. This increase was primarily the result of higher Afrezza sales compared to the same period in the prior year together with inventory write-offs of $0.6 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2018. There were no inventory write-offs in the same period of the prior year.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for were $2.6 million compared to $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.5 million or 16%. This decrease reflected a $1.1 million reallocation of salary and salary-related expenses from R&D in 2017 to selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in 2018) associated with personnel who were engaged in R&D activities in 2017 and transitioned to providing medical affairs and pharmacovigilance support to Afrezza commercial activities in 2018. The decrease in R&D expenses in the first quart of 2018 was offset by increased outside contract research organization spending on clinical trials of $0.5 million.\nSG&A expenses were $20.6 million for compared to $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The $5.2 million or 34% increase was primarily due to $5.7 million in headcount-related expenses from additional field force and G&A support functions (inclusive of the $1.1 million reallocation from R&D). In addition, there was a charge of $0.8 million in the first quarter 2018 for costs related to transitioning corporate support functions from Danbury, CT to Westlake Village, CA to create a more efficient back-office operation. Partially offsetting these increases were a $0.5 million decrease in spending on outside sales efforts that were transitioned in-house, $0.6 million lower consulting costs, and $0.2 million due to lower facility costs.\nThe net loss for was $30.4 million, or $0.25 per share compared to a $16.3 million net loss in the first quarter of 2017 or $0.17 per share. In addition to the variances described above which impacted the net loss in 2017, there was a favorable change due to a non-cash gain recognized in the first quarter of 2017 for the decrease in the fair value of warrant liability of $6.6 million which did not have a corresponding first quarter 2018 amount as the warrants were exchanged for shares and cancelled in October 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at March 31, 2018 decreased to $27.2 million compared to $48.4 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of $21.7 million in the first quarter 2018 offset by $0.5 million of net proceeds from the at-the-market equity offering facility. Subsequent to the quarter end in early April, the Company raised $26.3 million of net proceeds from a registered direct offering of 14 million shares of common stock and warrants at a purchase price of $2.00 per share and accompanying warrant exercisable at $2.38 per share.\nConference Call\nMannKind will host a conference call and presentation webcast to discuss these results today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
