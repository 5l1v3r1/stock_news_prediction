Both the indexes hit their highest levels since Feb 2 and were poised to end the month higher after two consecutive months of losses.\nIT stocks rose, with the Nifty IT index gaining as much as 2.3 percent aided by the recent weakness in the rupee.\nReliance dragged the Nifty Energy index, which was down as much as 2.1 percent, its biggest intraday percentage loss in over a month.\nBond and currency markets are closed on Monday and Tuesday for a public holiday. Stock markets will remain shut on Tuesday.
