Michael Bever, who was charged as an adult along with his brother but was ineligible for the death penalty because of his age, opted to go to trial.\nThe brothers, who were 18 and 16 at the time of the murders, used knives, a hatchet and other weapons to kill their parents, David and April Bever, two brothers and a sister in July 2015 in their home in Broken Arrow, a suburb of Tulsa.\nA sister who was 13 at the time survived the attack and a 2-year-old child was found unharmed.\nPolice said the brothers told them they wanted to be known as famous criminals and launch a nationwide killing spree.
