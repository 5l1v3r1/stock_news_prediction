Although crude oil prices retreated, the index rose 0.9 percent.\n\"We continue to like the sector particularly given the strength of support for cash distributions but the stocks upsides to our target prices have become much more muted after the sectors outperformance,\" said HSBC in a note.\nStrength in the financial sector also supported European equities with Raiffeisen and Commerzbank rising 4.6 and 3.9 percent respectively following strong earning updates.\nThe earnings season was nearing its close with more than three-quarters of MSCI Europe companies having reported first-quarter results.\n\"Generally it's been slightly underwhelming on sales numbers and in line on earnings numbers,\" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.\n\"European banks have tended to perform quite well and have picked up a lot recently with some good earnings,\" he added.\nCredit Agricole added to the optimism around banking stocks. The French bank's shares had fallen at the open but recovered to trade up 1.2 percent after quarterly profit fell short of expectations.\nTelecoms were the biggest sectoral weigh to the STOXX, falling 2 percent.\nVodafone fell 4.3 percent after the world's second largest mobile operator said its boss was leaving.\nVodafone, which also announced its full-year results, said CEO Vittorio Colao, who spent 10 years reshaping the group into a digital communications powerhouse, would be replaced by its current finance director.\nFrench satellite firm Eutelsat also tumbled 12 percent after warning it could fall short of its full-year revenue target.\nElsewhere, Iliad shares sank 19 percent to the bottom of the STOXX after a management reshuffle and weak first-quarter results.\nDealmaking, which has been rife in European markets this year, continued with Worldline agreeing to buy the payments arm of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX for $2.75 billion.\nShares in the French payments company jumped 2 percent, while Atos, which has a majority stake in Worldline, rose 1.9 percent.\nTemenos jumped 5.6 percent. The banking software firm was boosted by dealmaking in the sector and by its addition to MSCI's Switzerland index, traders said.\nStill in earnings news, steel-to-submarines group Thyssenkrupp posted a surprise loss at its Industrial Solutions business, sending its shares down 6.4 percent, while Danish jewelry maker Pandora fell 15.5 percent on lower than expected profit due to a slowdown in China.
