(NYSE American: BTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on degenerative diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and recent corporate accomplishments.\n“With the European CE Mark submission of Renevia, the initiation of patient recruitment for the fourth cohort of our OpRegen clinical trial, sufficient capital to get us well into 2019 and the excellent OpRegen data we reported at ARVO, 2018 is shaping up to be a transformative year for BioTime,” said Adi Mohanty, Co-Chief Executive Officer of BioTime.\nFirst Quarter Highlights and Financial Results\nClinical Progress Highlights\nRenevia ® (Facial Lipoatrophy)\nSubmitted Renevia ® for CE Marking in Europe. U.S. investigator-initiated study in facial aesthetics is continuing to enroll patients.\nOpRegen ® (dry-AMD)\nThe independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved initiation of the fourth cohort for the OpRegen ® clinical trial in patients in the advanced stage of the dry form of age-related macular degeneration. Positive OpRegen ® clinical trial data from the first nine patients from the first three cohorts were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nCorporate Highlights\nAscendance Biotechnology was sold in March 2018. AgeX received approximately $3.2 million for its interest in Ascendance.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nCash Position and Marketable Securities: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $31.4 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $38.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nValue of Holdings in Public Affiliates: At March 31, 2018, BioTime held common stock in publicly-traded affiliates valued at approximately $62.4 million. This amount was the market value of BioTime’s 21.7 million shares in Asterias Biotherapeutics (NYSE American: AST) and 14.7 million shares in OncoCyte (NYSE American: OCX).\nCash Used in Operating Activities: Cash used for operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was approximately $10.3 million, as reported, of which approximately $8.3 million was used by BioTime and subsidiaries other than AgeX, and approximately $2.0 million was used by AgeX. The cash used for BioTime's and AgeX's operating activities during the first quarter was in line with our expectations. The first quarter is generally our highest cash use quarter within the year, attributable to seasonal cashflows, such as annual bonus payments and seasonal fluctuations in grant receipts timing. We also had certain non-recurring payments related to the planned distribution of AgeX.\nRevenues: BioTime’s revenue is generated primarily from research grants, licensing fees and royalties, and subscription and advertising from the marketing of online database products. Total revenue was $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues increased by $0.3 million primarily due to our grants, particularly from the new SBIR grant from the NIH which was awarded to BioTime last September.\nOperating Expenses: for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.8 million, as reported, which is comprised of $9.1 million for BioTime and $3.7 million for AgeX. BioTime’s consolidated operating expenses, as adjusted, were $9.8 million, which is comprised of $7.3 million for BioTime and $2.5 million for AgeX. The difference in consolidated operating expenses, as reported, and total operating expenses, as adjusted, is approximately $3 million in non-cash and non-recurring expenses.\nR&D Expenses: First quarter research and development expenses were $5.9 million compared to $6.5 million for the comparable period in 2017, a decrease of $0.6 million. The decrease was primarily related to nonrecognition of OncoCyte research and development expenses due to the deconsolidation of OncoCyte on February 17, 2017, and LifeMap Solutions expenses which ceased operations in July 2017. The current quarter also includes an acquired in-process research and development expense of $0.8 million purchased by AgeX from Ascendance, which is a non-recurring expense.\nG&A Expenses: First quarter general and administrative expenses were $6.0 million compared to $5.1 million for the comparable period in 2017, an increase of $0.9 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased legal and compliance costs, including costs incurred for the planned distribution of AgeX, and license and patent fees for patent prosecution and patent fees.\nThe reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses by entity is provided in the financial tables included with this earnings release.\nNet Income or loss attributable to BioTime: First quarter net loss attributable to BioTime was $63.5 million, or ($0.50) per share, compared to net income attributable to BioTime of $49.3 million, or $0.46 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss attributable to BioTime for the first quarter of 2018 includes combined unrealized losses of $54.8 million from a decrease in the value of marketable securities and the $3.2 million gain sale of Ascendance. Net income attributable to BioTime for the first quarter of 2017 includes the noncash gain of $71.7 million for the deconsolidation of OncoCyte and net unrealized losses of $10.0 million from a decrease in the value of marketable securities.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nBioTime will host a conference call and webcast today, May 10, 2018 at 1:30pm PT/4:30pm ET to discuss results and corporate developments.

Renevia ® is part of the HyStem ® hydrogel family of proprietary injectable matrices, being developed as devices for various applications and for cell and drug delivery.\nAbout OpRegen ®\nOpRegen ® , which is being studied for the treatment of the dry form of AMD, consists of a suspension of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that are delivered subretinally during a simple intraocular injection. RPE cells are essential components of the back lining of the retina, and function to help nourish the retina including photoreceptors. A proprietary process that drives the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells is used to generate high purity OpRegen ® RPE cells. OpRegen ® RPE cells are also “xeno-free,” meaning that no animal products are used at any point in the derivation and production process. The avoidance of the use of animal products eliminates some potential safety concerns. Preclinical studies in rats have shown that following a single subretinal injection of OpRegen ® , the cells can rapidly organize into its natural monolayer structure in the subretinal space and survive throughout the lifetime of the animal. OpRegen ® is designed to be an “off-the-shelf” allogeneic (non-patient specific) product. Unlike treatments that require multiple, frequent injections into the eye, it is expected that OpRegen ® will be administered in a single procedure. OpRegen ® was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA, which allows more frequent interactions with the agency, and eligibility for accelerated approval and priority review. OpRegen ® is a registered trademark of Cell Cure Neurosciences Ltd., a majority-owned subsidiary of BioTime, Inc.\nAbout BioTime, Inc.\nBioTime is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on degenerative diseases. Its clinical programs are based on two platform technologies: cell replacement and cell/drug delivery. With its cell replacement platform, BioTime is producing new cells and tissues with its proprietary pluripotent cell technologies. These cells and tissues are developed to replace those that are either rendered dysfunctional or lost due to degenerative diseases or injuries. BioTime’s cell/drug delivery programs are based upon its proprietary HyStem ® cell and drug delivery matrix technology. HyStem ® was designed, in part, to provide for the transfer, retention and/or engraftment of cellular replacement therapies. BioTime’s lead cell delivery clinical program is Renevia ® , which consists of HyStem ® combined with the patient's own adipose (fat) progenitor cells. Renevia ® met its primary endpoint in an EU pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in HIV patients in 2017. BioTime has submitted Renevia ® for CE Mark approval in the EU. There were no device related serious adverse events reported to date. BioTime’s lead cell replacement product candidate is OpRegen ® , a retinal pigment epithelium transplant therapy, which is in a Phase I/IIa multicenter clinical trial for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in developing countries. There were no related serious adverse events reported in the first nine patients. BioTime also has significant equity holdings in two publicly traded companies, Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE American: AST) and OncoCyte Corporation (NYSE American: OCX), and a private company, AgeX Therapeutics, Inc.\nBioTime common stock is traded on the NYSE American and TASE under the symbol BTX.
