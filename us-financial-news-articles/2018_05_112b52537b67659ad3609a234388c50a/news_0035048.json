EU producers say biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia gets unfair state support enabling it to be sold at low prices in Europe.\nU.S. agribusiness group Archer Daniels Midland Co said in March it would suspend production at a major biodiesel plant in Germany because of increasing cheap imports.\nIn April, German renewable fuel producer Natural Energy West said it was reducing biodiesel output by 50 percent because of surging imports from Argentina and Indonesia.
