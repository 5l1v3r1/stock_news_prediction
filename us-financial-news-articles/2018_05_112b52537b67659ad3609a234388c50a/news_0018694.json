A trader speaks on his mobile phone as he waits for customers at a sugarcane wholesale market in Kolkata, India May 2, 2018. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri\nThe Global Sugar Alliance launched an investigation this year into whether the EU, India and Pakistan are in violation of WTO rules, with plans to conclude by July, the group’s secretary, Warren Males, told Reuters along the sidelines of New York “Sugar Week.” The group represents top exporting nations, including Brazil, Australia and Thailand.\nMembers of the Global Sugar Alliance met during the annual industry conference in New York, with plans to reconvene after finishing the review, Males said. The group will discuss next steps, with plans to ask their governments to either step up talks with counterparts in the EU, India and Pakistan or to take action with the WTO, he said.\n“We had been weighing this for some time, (but) the issue became more pressing,” said Males, who is also the head of economics at Australia’s Canegrowers trade group.\nRaw sugar prices traded in New York are languishing near 2015 lows as global supplies swell, outstripping production at record levels. That has the world’s millers and refiners churning out sugar for prices below production costs.
