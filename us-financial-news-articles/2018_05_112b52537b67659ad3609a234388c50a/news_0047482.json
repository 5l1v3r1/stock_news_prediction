You can’t say Liverpool have more hunger than us; it simply isn’t true.\n“Nobody can take our hunger away from us. We’re Real Madrid ... We always want more and will always give our all to get more.”\nThe Frenchman also said that his side’s experience of playing in and winning three finals in the past four years will have no bearing on the outcome. By comparison, no player in the Liverpool squad has reached this stage of the competition before.
