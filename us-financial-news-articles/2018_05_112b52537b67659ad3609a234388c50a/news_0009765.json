KCNA/via REUTERS ‘POSITIVE ROLE’\nIn an earlier statement, he said China hoped dialogue between North Korea and the United States would be successful and that substantial progress would be made, referring to an upcoming meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.\n“China is willing to strengthen communication with North Korea and continue to play a positive role in seeking a political solution to the Korean peninsula issue,” Wang said.\nSouth Korea’s presidential official said high-level inter-Korean talks would be held in mid-May to work on implementing the agreement reached by Kim and Moon.\nNorth Korea’s Kim said at last week’s summit that he would discuss details of denuclearisation at the North Korea-U.S. summit, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said, citing South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon.\nChina had largely sat on the sidelines while the two Koreas improved ties, until Kim made a secretive trip to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in late March.\nBeijing has been keen to show that it has an indispensable role to play in seeking a lasting solution, concerned that its interests may be ignored, especially as Pyongyang and Washington edge closer together.\nThe widely read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial any suggestion China was being marginalised “is a shallow attempt to manipulate public opinion”.\nChina preferred quieter diplomacy, it said, pointing to the secrecy surrounding Kim’s meeting with Xi.

U.S. President Donald Trump has started claiming credit for the Kim-Trump summit before it even starts,” it said.\n(This refiled version of the story corrects title of Chinese diplomat in paragraph four to “Chinese government’s”, not “China’s”).
