Average PM2.5 concentrations in 338 cities across China stood at 39 micrograms in the first four months of 2018, unchanged from a year earlier.\nJanuary-April PM2.5 readings in the key smog control area of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei fell 18.8 percent on the year to 69 micrograms, nearly double the national standard.\nSix of China’s 10 most polluted cities for the period are in Hebei province, China’s biggest steel producing region.\nThe capital Beijing said on Monday its pollution levels fell 22.4 percent from a year ago to 59 micrograms over January to April, though it saw readings rise 20.8 percent year-on-year in April alone.\nA senior MEE official said last month that China had reached a “stalemate” when it comes to improving air quality, with smog abatement measures often counterbalanced by unfavorable weather conditions.\nChina President Xi Jinping promised in a speech on Saturday that the might of the Chinese Communist Party would be used to tackle the nation’s environmental problems, with the aim of achieving fundamental improvements by 2035.
