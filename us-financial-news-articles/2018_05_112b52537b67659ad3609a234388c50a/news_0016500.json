(NYSE American: ORM) (the \"Company\") today acknowledged receipt of a notice of director nominations from Eric Hovde, Financial Institution Partners III, LP, and certain of their affiliates (collectively, the \"Hovde Group\") that they plan to nominate Steven Hovde and James Hua to stand for election to the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nThe Board and management of the Company have for quite some time maintained a constructive dialogue with the Hovde Group, as we would with any other stockholder. Indeed, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (the \"Nominating Committee\"), consisting entirely of independent directors, recently completed its interviews of Messrs. Hovde and Hua as part of its normal process to evaluate potential director candidates. At the end of this process, the Nominating Committee and the full Board concluded that adding the Hovde Group candidates to the Board would not be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nIn an effort to constructively address its recommendations and to avoid a costly and distracting proxy fight, we made the Hovde Group a very reasonable settlement proposal. Our settlement offer contemplated that the Hovde Group would have direct involvement in the designation of a female director that would replace an existing management director. Our proposal not only would have given the Hovde Group Board representation, it also would have increased the proportion of independent directors on our Board from 60% to 80%. In addition, we proposed that this new, female director would be designated to certain Board committees and would oversee a thorough review by the Board of the Hovde Group's views concerning additional stock repurchase programs by the Company.\nEric Hovde unfortunately rejected our settlement proposal, including completely dismissing the value of designating a female director as we continue to promote gender diversity on our Board. We are disappointed that the Hovde Group has chosen to launch baseless attacks at your Board and management team. Nonetheless, we remain committed to constructively engaging with the Hovde Group and plan to address their attacks in due course.\nYour Board and management team continue to maintain an intense focus on acting in the best interests of the Company and all its stockholders. We continue to make progress in responsibly disposing of our real estate assets and reinvesting the proceeds into commercial real estate loan investments, which we are confident is the best means of maximizing returns for our stockholders and closing the gap between the Company's stock price and book value.\nReturning capital to our stockholders through a mix of dividends and share repurchases remains a strategic priority for the Company, as evidenced by the recently announced increased second quarter 2018 dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, which represents a 25% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend, and the adoption of a new $10 million stock repurchase plan. As of March 13, 2018, the Company has repurchased approximately $31.5 million of its stock, not including commissions and fees, representing approximately 1,961,000 shares, or 17.5% of the shares outstanding on May 20, 2013, and paid out approximately $17.1 million in cash dividends.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company, through its Compensation Committee consisting completely of independent directors, and Owens Financial Group, the Company's manager, reached an agreement to amend the manager's compensation structure, including making permanent the recent interim management fee adjustment along with an additional adjustment that will decrease the fee when stockholders' equity exceeds $300 million, payment to the Company of 30% of all fees and commissions paid to the manager in connection with its mortgage lending activities, and the elimination of service fees and certain reimbursable expenses.\nAlso, as previously disclosed, your Board continues to facilitate a series of corporate governance enhancements. These include, among others, an ongoing search process to identify a female director candidate, which includes input from our stockholders. Your Board also recently approved of formal policies with respect to Board diversity, majority voting with respect to uncontested director elections, director and officer stock ownership/retention guidelines, and anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies. Finally, today, also as part of our planned governance enhancements, the Company will be announcing that Bill Owens has stepped down as chair of our Board and has assumed the role of executive Chairman Emeritus. Our lead independent director, Dennis Schmal, will now serve as independent Chairman of our Board.\nTogether, it is the Board's strong belief that these actions provide the best opportunity to reduce expenses, deliver a consistent, competitive risk-adjusted yield and further align our management compensation structure and corporate governance with the long-term interests of the Company and all of its stockholders.\nThe Company will provide stockholders with proxy materials, including a WHITE proxy card, in connection with the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in due course. Stockholders are not required to take action at this time.\nPremierCounsel LLP and Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. are representing Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc.\nAbout Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc.\nOwens Realty Mortgage, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a specialty finance mortgage company organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that focuses on the origination, investment, and management of commercial real estate mortgage loans.
