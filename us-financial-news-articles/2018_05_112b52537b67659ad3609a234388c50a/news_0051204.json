After weeks of fruitless talks between the various parties, 5-Star and the League finally agreed to a government pact last Friday, promising to hike taxes and jack up spending.\nRoth’s comments were echoed by Germany’s BDI industry association which urged the new Italian government to abide by European treaties and the euro zone’s common budget rules.\n“German industry is concerned about the government program,” BDI Managing Director Joachim Lang said. “Incoming Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte must bring the coalition parties back to earth. The expensive election promises are not financeable. They endanger the economic recovery in Italy,” he added.\nLang pointed out that Italy’s industrial production and foreign trade in particular had developed well over the past three years.\nItaly’s industry is the second largest in Europe after Germany which is by far the most important trading partner of Italian companies with an annual bilateral trade of 120 billion euros ($140.71 billion), Lang added.
