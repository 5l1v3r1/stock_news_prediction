(“InvenTrust” or “the Company”) today announced the acquisition of PGA Plaza, a 120,000 square foot Trader Joe’s grocery-anchored neighborhood center located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, for $88 million from Delray Beach, FL based Menin Development Inc.\n“This transaction represents a compelling growth opportunity for InvenTrust and expands the Company’s presence in the vibrant and burgeoning South Florida market,” said Michael E. Podboy, EVP – Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer of InvenTrust. “Following a $14 million renovation in 2015, PGA Plaza is a best-in-class property, attracting high traffic-driving anchors such as Trader Joe’s, Marshalls and Ulta. We are confident this accretive acquisition will drive long-term value creation.”\nChristopher Covey, Senior Vice President of Transactions, said, “PGA Plaza, located in one of IVT’s targeted Sun Belt markets, is an excellent fit for our portfolio. The center is 95% leased and has a stable internet resistant tenant base. It is located on highly travelled PGA Boulevard and will enhance the demographics of InvenTrust’s portfolio. This transaction will further advance our strategy of concentrating our portfolio into grocery-anchored assets in markets with above-average wage and population growth.”\nPGA Plaza is well located, with access to Florida’s major arterials of I-95 and the Florida Turnpike. Including the tenants above, the property also features national tenants such as Verizon, Orangetheory and Chase.\nAbout InvenTrust Properties Corp.\nInvenTrust Properties Corp. is a pure-play retail company with a focus on acquiring grocery-anchored open-air centers in key growth markets with favorable demographics.
