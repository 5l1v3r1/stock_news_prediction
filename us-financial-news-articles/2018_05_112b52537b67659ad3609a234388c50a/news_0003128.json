Many debate whether efforts drive up rents for others, by making development more expensive, or whether the moves are too little, too late. The Mission Economic Development Agency, a nonprofit, buys buildings through San Francisco’s small sites program, which allows private buildings to be converted to affordable housing units.\nCayce Clifford for The Wall Street Journal\n“Sometimes the rhetoric is about stopping gentrification,” said Vicki Been, a New York University law professor. “In a market system you’re limited in your ability to do that.”\nMs. Been was head of the New York City Housing Preservation and Development Department when the city rezoned East New York, a historically poor, predominantly African-American and Hispanic neighborhood just a subway stop or two from areas with quickly rising rents. The goal was to spur new affordable housing construction, but residents protested the new units would be too costly.\nIn Philadelphia, the city council passed a policy allowing people below a certain income who have lived in their homes for a decade to limit their property-tax increase if their home values triple in the span of a year. The measure was passed after the city did its first property-tax reassessment in three decades and thousands of homeowners who lived in gentrifying neighborhoods were at risk of their taxes skyrocketing.\nIn Portland, a policy aimed at bringing back residents displaced by city redevelopment efforts includes subsidized apartments and down-payment assistance for newly purchased homes.\nSan Francisco’s Mission District, historically a center of Latino activism and culture transformed in recent years by an influx of affluent residents , has been a contentious gentrification battleground. The area lost 26% of its Latino population from 2000 to 2016, as that same population over that period increased citywide, according to Veritas Urbis Economics, a consulting firm.\nMost people rent in the Mission. And there has been a 49% citywide increase in rents over the past eight years, according to property tracker RealPage Inc.\nMany buildings where lower-income people live are privately owned and have been kept affordable for decades by weak demand and lack of investment. Public officials have little leverage to get landlords to keep rents low when units suddenly become desirable.\nThe Mission Economic Development Agency, a local nonprofit, began buying buildings in 2016 through San Francisco’s small sites program, which allows private buildings to be converted to affordable housing units if enough income-eligible tenants agree to the change. The group’s efforts are supported by city funds as well as donations from charitable organizations, including the Citi Foundation, which recently provided MEDA with a $500,000 grant.\nKaroleen Feng, director of community real estate for MEDA, said she often targets buildings with deferred maintenance, those requiring expensive retrofits to meet San Francisco’s rigorous earthquake standards, and homes where landlords and tenants both want to work out a deal that won’t result in displacement.\nThrough its purchase of small buildings, the organization also has been able to acquire commercial spaces such as the one used by The Jelly Donut restaurant, owned by a family of Cambodian immigrants, and keep those businesses from being priced out.\nMr. Martinez, 51 years old, came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1994, and his wife, Ana Lopez, 54, arrived from Peru the following year. The couple met in the Mission and had a son and twin daughters. In 2003, the family moved into the two-and-a-half bedroom apartment after considering the place for years.\nThe family says the spacious flat has provided them with stability that has allowed them to succeed. Their son Sergio is attending Princeton University this year, they said.\nIn the case of the Martinez building, three higher-income tenants living in one of the building’s three flats agreed to a rent increase, allowing the numbers to work.\nThe family members were relieved when MEDA closed on the building last year, as they had few other options to stay in the city.\n“We really didn’t have time to think about anything else,” Ms. Lopez said. “We thought in God, and little else.” Popular Homes Based on your last search Editors' Picks ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T21:14:54.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
