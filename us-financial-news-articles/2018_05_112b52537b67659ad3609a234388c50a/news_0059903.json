He was re-elected by a landslide for a third consecutive term in 2016 with his wife as vice president.\nThe Organization of American States last week called for early elections, but Ortega has not acceded.\nWriting by Mexico City Newsroom; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T04:18:17.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
