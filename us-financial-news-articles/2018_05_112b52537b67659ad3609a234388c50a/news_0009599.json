The first IHOP outlet in India had “exceeded” the company’s expectations and was already running a profit eight months after opening, said a source close to the company, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.\nIn India, breakfast is a meal traditionally prepared and consumed at home, but trends are changing as the country, with more than half its population below 30 years, preferring to dine out as disposable incomes rise.\nThis shift has helped breakfast emerge as one of the fastest-growing meal categories in the Indian dining industry.\nFourteen percent of Indians have had breakfast outside home at least three to four times a week in 2016, compared with 9.6 percent in 2015, according to a survey by market research firm Euromonitor international’s global consumer trends unit.\nThe growing market has seen companies including McDonald’s ( MCD.N ) introduce items such as the masala dosa brioche – an all-day offering that combines a staple south Indian breakfast dish called masala dosa in a burger-style serving.\nAnalysts covering Dine Brands said tapping India could be a growth vehicle for the company at a time when IHOP’s North American sales have plateaued with comparable sales ranging from down low-single digits to up low-single digits over the past few years.\nBut configuring its dishes to an Indian palate that usually prefers savoury dishes over sweet would be IHOP’s biggest challenge.\n“India is a huge potential market but getting the menu mix right could prove to be tricky,” said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins.\nAdditional reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T03:47:54.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
