REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo “China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!” Trump tweeted.\nHe did not elaborate on the significance of the North Korea-China border issue in any deal that might be reached on denuclearization. Trump has said his meeting with Kim will take place on June 12 in Singapore.\nPyongyang last week threatened to scrap any meeting if Washington continued to press for unilateral denuclearization.\nIn response, Trump said that as far as he knew, the meeting was still on track and sought to placate Kim by saying the North Korean leader would be protected as part of any deal.\nLast week, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Kim was possibly being influenced by Beijing, North Korea’s main ally, after two recent visits he made to China.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:08:09.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
