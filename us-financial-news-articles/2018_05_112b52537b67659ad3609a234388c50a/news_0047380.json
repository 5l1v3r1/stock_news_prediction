But pent-up demand from this month and expectation of tight rail transportation capacity in summer could lead to supply crunches,” a coal trader based in Hefei, southern Anhui province said.\nReporting by Meng Meng and Aizhu Chen; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:06:34.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
