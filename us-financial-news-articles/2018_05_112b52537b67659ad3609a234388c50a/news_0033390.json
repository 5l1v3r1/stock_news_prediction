As the name suggests, this division includes Facebook’s core apps: Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Although Instagram is also part of the new team, it will continue to be managed by Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom. Chris Daniels, vice president of Facebook’s Internet.org, will take over WhatsApp (after the former CEO and cofounder Jan Koum departed ), Stan Chudnovsky, previously the head of product for Messenger, will take over Messenger, and Will Cathcart, a longtime Facebooker who works on product, will head the Facebook team (which includes the not-yet-launched dating app, according to Recode).\nWhile tech news site TechCrunch points out that this could mean less autonomy for Instagram and WhatsApp, this restructuring is reportedly aimed at improving communication between the executives managing core apps. New platforms and infrastructure\nLeader: Chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer\nWhat’s new? This division focus on new products and technology including blockchain , artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and Workplace (a social network for work that competes with Slack), and privacy-focused product.\nFor users, privacy may be the most interesting aspect of the reshuffling. Another Recode report from Tuesday says that David Baser, a product director who was working on GDPR privacy policies, will head up a privacy product division of around 300 engineers and other product developers. Their first product may well be the “clear history” function, which would allow users to control and clear their Facebook browsing history, that Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced last week at F8, Facebook’s developers conference.\nAdditionally, Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, will work closely with Baser to make sure these products work. Her team is expected to grow to 120 people from 40. Central product services\nLeader: Javier Olivan, who formerly ran Facebook’s growth team.\nWhat’s new? This team will oversee other essential products including ads, security, and data/growth, according to Recode.\nFortune contacted Facebook for more information on the reorganization about the changes. We’ll update as necessary.
