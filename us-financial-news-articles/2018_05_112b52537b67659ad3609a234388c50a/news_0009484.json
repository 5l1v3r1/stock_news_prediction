General Assembly has adopted a resolution on strengthening UN-Habitat as the organization’s focal point on sustainable urbanization and human settlements and that is her aim.\nSharif said one of her most immediate challenges is to reform UN-Habitat so that it can be a global driving force in implementing the New Urban Agenda (NUA), a 20-year-road map adopted by global leaders in 2016.\nThis sets non-binding goals such as developing cities that do not harm the environment, redeveloping informal settlements with residents involved and reining in urban sprawl.\nPart of this includes working on a new six-year strategic plan to address urban challenges such as income inequality, affordable housing, climate change and resilience.\nSharif said making cities more liveable for women is one of her priorities because the benefits will be far-reaching.\n“If we plan the city for a woman, we plan it for all,” Sharif said.\n“If pavements are more accessible for women with children, it’s also good for men and it’s also good for people with mobility issues.”\nSharif said participatory budgeting, in which ordinary people have a say in how city funds are spent, is an effective way to make sure women are included in key planning decisions.\nSharif added that urban planning was not just a “check-box” of building the school, the park, the road but you need to create “inclusive communities” involving the public, public sector and private companies.\n“When you ask people what they want, you can make good decisions,” she said.\nReporting by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
