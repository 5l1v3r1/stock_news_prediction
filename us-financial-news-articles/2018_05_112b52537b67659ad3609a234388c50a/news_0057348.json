Its shares rose more than 3 percent to 9.086 euros.\n“Canada intends to carry out this project through a non-competitive process with the original equipment manufacturer, Leonardo,” the Canadian government said.\nThe contract under discussion could be worth more than $1 billion and account for almost 7 percent of the group 2018 order intake with an operating margin topping 10 percent, Italian broker Banca Akros said in a report.\nCanada has been operating a fleet of 14 AgustaWestland helicopters, now called Leonardo Elicotteri, since 2000.
