Premier John Horgan, saying she would instead focus on Trans Mountain as the May 31 deadline looms.\nCanadian oil trades at a steep discount to the North American benchmark, with the gap widening in recent months due to tight capacity on rail and pipelines.\nThat has Alberta desperate to get new pipelines built, particularly a line to the coast to access overseas markets. The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Alberta to a Metro Vancouver port.\nThe project is fiercely opposed by environmental groups, some aboriginal groups and the B.C. government.\nB.C. said on Tuesday that it had filed a challenge to a new Alberta law that would allow the oil-rich province to cut fuel shipments west.
