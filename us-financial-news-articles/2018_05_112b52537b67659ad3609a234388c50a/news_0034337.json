This compared with just a tad below a 50 percent chance late on Monday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program.\nFed funds contracts suggested traders have priced in a 100 percent likelihood that the Fed would hike rates at its June 12-13 policy meeting FFM8 FFN8.\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-15T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:18:08.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
