I can’t manage that.\n“We’ve hit some good form recently and we want to continue that. This is a tough game for us against Spurs. I’m focusing on preparing us for the game.\n“Any team you face in the Premier League pose threats. Collectively as a group we have to come together to work hard to get a result. It’s the last home game of the season and we want to give a good account of ourselves.”\nGoalkeeper Ben Foster was among a host of players and pundits to praise Moore in recent weeks and the 44-year-old, who is in charge of West Brom until the end of the season, welcomed the support.\n“Support from anywhere is excellent really,” Moore added. “It’s excellent to have it from players and staff within.\n“It shows that we are supporting each other and continuing to support each other... To have support, from any department of the club, has to be a positive.”\nMidfielders James Morrison (Achilles tendon) and Gareth Barry (knee) are the only doubts for West Brom as the club look to get their first home league win since January.\nWest Brom travel to Crystal Palace for their final Premier League match of the season on May 13.
