Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nWilbur Ross, U.S. secretary of commerce, speaks at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on May 14. Getty Images Good morning. The latest twist in the U.S. pursuit for an alternative penalty on ZTE Corp. could include a plan to install American compliance officers at the Chinese telecom giant.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross floated the idea Thursday during an interview on CNBC, saying the penalty “would involve…implanting people of our own choosing into the company to constitute a compliance unit” that would report back to his department. “The whole key is enforcement,” he said.\nInstalling a monitor often is a routine act in a U.S. corporate criminal resolution, but sanctions experts said it wouldn’t resolve lingering U.S. national security concerns in this case. “There are going to be concerns about how effective it will be,” said Brian O’Toole, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a U.S.-based think tank.\nThe U.S. last month banned ZTE for seven years from receiving U.S. components after the Commerce Department found it failed to comply with a settlement resolving allegations of evading sanctions on Iran and North Korea. President Donald Trump recently raised the specter of lifting or lessening the penalty as part of a trade deal with China, an act some in Congress have sought to block .\nZTE should take an offer of a compliance monitor in exchange for a lifted export ban “in a heartbeat” if presented with it, said Richard Matheny, a partner at the law firm Goodwin. He acknowledged it might be difficult to find someone willing to take the role.\n“Many in the export enforcement community are dismayed that ZTE may be let off the hook, and this will do very little to satisfy those concerns,” said Mr. Matheny.\nSanctions experts say a U.S. move could undermine the intent of penalizing ZTE, in addition to harming the broader use of sanctions as a foreign-policy and national-security tool. “By not addressing the national-security risk, there’s going to be criticism regardless of whether this is an effective law enforcement or sanctions compliance tool,” said Mr. O’Toole.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nCompanies are using “nudges,” or choice architecture, as a way to promote ethical behavior.

Neither could be reached for a response.\nThe charges follow the unsealing of an indictment in November of Petros Contoguris, a Greek citizen living in Turkey who was charged with money laundering and seven counts of violating U.S. foreign-bribery law.\nThe charges filed Thursday allege Mr. Contoguris, working with Messrs. Martirossian and Leshkov and others, devised and executed a scheme to pay bribes. The payments were disguised as commissions to Mr. Contoguris’s company in exchange for help getting Rolls-Royce contracts, prosecutors said.\nRolls-Royce agreed to pay more than $800 million in penalties last year in a global settlement. — Samuel Rubenfeld\nCOMPLIANCE\nThe U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on nine individuals and firms accused of procuring airplane parts for Iranian airlines blacklisted for their support of U.S.-designated terror groups.

Learn how boards are enhancing their risk oversight practices by clarifying and formally approving the organization’s risk appetite — the aggregate level of risk that management is willing to take in pursuit of its strategy.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
