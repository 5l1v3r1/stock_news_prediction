A liter of petrol costs 77.17 rupees ($1.13) while diesel is sold at 68.34 rupees/ liter.\n“The government is keen that instead of having an ad hoc measure it may be desirable to have a long-term view which addresses not only the volatility but also takes care of the unnecessary ambiguity arising out of frequent ups and downs,” Ravi Shankar Prasad told a news conference.\nOpposition leaders have criticised the government for failing to rein in rising fuel prices, a politically-sensitive issue in one of the world’s biggest economies.\n$1 = 68.3650 Indian rupees Reporting by Nidhi Verma; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:38:30.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
