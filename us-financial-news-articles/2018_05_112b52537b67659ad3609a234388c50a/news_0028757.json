REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci Rubio, a Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee, unveiled the “Fair Trade with China Enforcement Act,” which among other things would bar the sale of national security sensitive technology and intellectual property, and increase taxes on multinational corporations’ income from China.\nIt would also prepare duties on, and cap Chinese investor shareholding in U.S. companies producing goods targeted by China’s “Made in China 2025” initiative to catch up with rivals like the United States and Germany in industries such as robotics, aerospace and clean-energy cars.\n“How America responds to the growing threats posed by China is the single most important geopolitical issue of our time, and will define the 21st century,” Rubio said in a statement introducing the bill.\nThe legislation would bar the U.S. government or contractors from purchasing telecommunications equipment or services Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp ( 000063.SZ ), Chinese companies that are among the world’s major telecommunications equipment manufacturers.\nMembers of the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration have pressured U.S. companies to not sell Huawei or ZTE products, saying they could be used to spy on Americans.\nThe two companies have denied such allegations.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:53:41.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
