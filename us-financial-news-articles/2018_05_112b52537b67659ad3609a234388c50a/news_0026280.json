The most-active contract reached a session high of $10.33-3/4 a bushel before eventually settling up 5-1/2 cents at $10.21-1/4 a bushel.\n“They are really strong on soybean exports and I am very skeptical of that,” Seifried said about the USDA.\nThe USDA report did not break out expected destinations for exports. The agency did raise its forecast for China’s soybean imports by 6.2 percent, or 6 million tonnes, to 103 million tonnes in 2018/19, nearly matching government expectations for the increase in U.S. soybean exports.\n“U.S. soybean exports projected to increase a large 225 million bushels might be flat out just wrong,” Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst at Futures International,” said in a note to clients. “USDA either remains very optimistic on China trade relations and/or bullish Asian demand for soybean consumption.”\nChina, which needs soybeans to boost pork production amid surging domestic demand, was expected to account for about 65 percent of global soybean imports in 2018/19.\nBeijing has recently stepped up checks on imports of other U.S. commodities including fruit, logs and pork.\nAdditional reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago.
