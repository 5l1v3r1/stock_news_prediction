These appointments advance A&M’s strategic expansion plans to meet local market demand in France, enhance its cross-border M&A offering and help clients address increasingly complex regional, European and global regulatory requirements.\nThe addition of Messrs. Gibbons, Martinez, Steiner and Chenu, all formerly with one of the Big Four in France, completes the latest phase of A&M’s European strategic growth plan following the launch of the firm’s Stockholm office and Nordics expansion in 2017 that added to existing transaction advisory activities in the U.K., Germany, and Netherlands. They will bolster A&M’s suite of integrated global transaction advisory services that provide clients with a differentiated offering for due diligence and transaction advisory requirements.\nA&M’s market share continues to expand with the firm’s European practices experiencing strong growth over the past two years leading to work on a range of flagship European private equity deals. With A&M’s operational focus and market leading capabilities in Private Equity and Corporate Performance Improvement, A&M is uniquely placed to provide a differentiated approach to due diligence and take on the challenges of current market conditions faced by clients.\nAntonio \"Tony\" Alvarez III , Managing Director and A&M’s European Practice lead, said, “These appointments support our global expansion strategy along with our capability building plans in France and Europe. New audit regulation and rotation rules are impacting the provision of non-audit services and generating greater conflicts in providing those services to clients. As growing numbers of Big Four professionals across Europe look beyond the traditional firms, A&M’s platform is acknowledged to be less restrictive enabling greater access for practice growth.”\nPaul Aversano , Managing Director and Global Practice Leader of A&M’s Global Transaction Advisory Group, said, “The growth of our transaction advisory presence in France supports the firm’s commitment to meet local market needs and global market M&A demands with our unique and differentiated approach. These appointments are the latest of several growth areas in France and Europe for A&M to enable us to continue our European expansion.”\nManaging Director and European Practice Lead with A&M’s Transaction Advisory Group, David Evans , added, “Jonathan’s, Guillaume’s, Frederic’s, and Donatien’s in-depth knowledge advances our ability to help private equity firms and corporate clients maximize value on a pan-European basis. We expect the French team to grow rapidly as client needs continue to escalate.”\nTarek Hosni , the France country leader and Managing Director with A&M Paris, stated, “The addition of these senior transaction professionals will enable us to increase our scale and service for French private equity firms as well as France based multinationals. A leading protagonist of positive transformation in France, we now also intend to deliver in France our internationally recognized expertise in transaction advisory services. This marks the start of our future growth plans for A&M France.”\nA&M’s new Transaction Advisory Managing Directors have extensive cross-border and global transaction experience working with private equity and multi-national corporations throughout Europe and the world. The team’s collective experience spans numerous sectors including TMT, manufacturing, retail and consumer goods and financial services. For more information on Messrs.
