Malloy, a Democrat, is not seeking reelection this year, and this was his final address to the joint session.\n“I leave the (office) with a hope and a belief that Connecticut can focus on fiscal discipline and restraint in the years ahead,” he said, calling the job of governor “the honor of my lifetime.”\nThe revised budget appropriates $20.86 billion for fiscal 2019. It restores a Medicare savings program for low-income disabled and elderly patients and puts money towards magnet and vocational schools.\nThe budget also gives a 1 percent cost of living increase to private nonprofit service providers.\nLawmakers added $1 billion for new infrastructure in the state’s highway system, but they dropped a proposal to increase tolls on trains and buses.\nConnecticut legislators, like those in New York and New Jersey, also allowed state and local property taxes to be filed as charitable contributions to offset federal tax law changes.\nHelping to grease the wheels of the budget process was an unanticipated windfall of $1 billion in state income tax revenues.\nEven so, the state did not have consensus revenue forecasts until April 30, giving the legislature less than two weeks to craft budget adjustments before the end of their session.
