A logo hangs on the wall outside the WPP offices in London, Britain April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\nISS extended its support to Quarta on Wednesday. He oversaw the recent departure of industry veteran Martin Sorrell, who stepped down as chief executive on April 14 after a probe into an allegation of personal misconduct.\nEarlier this month, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co, recommended voting against Quarta at WPP’s annual meeting.\nISS said it had raised concerns over the lack of transparency around Sorrell’s departure, but added that “the absence of disclosure” does not imply a failure in governance on WPP’s part.\nWPP’s response to allegations about Sorrell, the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion at the company, was adequate and showed that appropriate due process was observed, ISS said in an emailed statement, adding that continuity in the board’s leadership best serves the interests of the shareholders.\nQuarta became executive chairman after Sorrell’s departure and will hold the position until a new chief executive is found.\nWPP has not disclosed any details of Sorrell’s alleged misconduct and he has denied any wrongdoing.\nSorrell has announced plans for a comeback after leaving WPP. On Wednesday, he said he would invest 40 million pounds of his own money in a little-known financial holding company Derriston Capital ( DERR.L ) and use it to build a “next generation marketing services group”.
