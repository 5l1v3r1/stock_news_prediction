It expects to get final regulatory clearances for the acquisition by the middle of the year.\nUniper shareholder Cornwall Luxembourg S.a.r.l., which Schaefer says is backed by activist investor Elliott Management, will propose appointing a special auditor at Uniper’s annual general meeting on June 6 to identify possible breaches of duty and violations of the law by members of the management board.\nFortum said it had nothing to do with that motion.\nUniper has advertised in Finnish newspapers, arguing against the transaction. It is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Rothschild on the deal, sources have told Reuters.\n($1 = 0.8415 euros)\nReporting by Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt and Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:40:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
