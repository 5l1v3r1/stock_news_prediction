Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester United v Arsenal - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - April 29, 2018 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho after the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nBritish media has reported that the 42-year-old Faria is on Arsenal’s shortlist to replace Arsene Wenger, who will leave the north London club after almost 22 years in charge.\nPortuguese Faria has worked with Mourinho since 2001 and they have won 25 trophies together across six clubs.\nWhen asked if his assistant would be a contender for the Arsenal job, Mourinho said: “I think so, yes. I don’t know (if he wants to be a manager). You ask me if I think it would be a good fit and I say ‘yes’.\n“And I say it because more than my assistant, he is my friend. If my friend has the possibility one day of a big job I would help him to pack and to carry the bags and to wish him luck.\n“I met him when he was a kid at university and we worked together for 18 years. He is a big friend more than an assistant.”\nFormer Arsenal midfielders Mikel Arteta and Patrick Vieira, former Barcelona boss Luis Enrique and Liverpool’s assistant manager Zeljko Buvac have also been linked with the Arsenal job in the British media.
