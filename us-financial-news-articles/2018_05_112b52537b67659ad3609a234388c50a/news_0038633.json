The Czech economy grew 4.5 percent, a touch slower than expected.\nRomania’s economy expanded 4.0 percent on the year but was well short of expectations. Bulgaria grew by 3.5 percent year-on-year and car stalwart Slovakia posted a 3.6 percent rise.\nThe region is an important manufacturing and supply chain cog for western European firms, especially the car industry. The region’s economies rely on exports.\nThere are signs that some weakness could set in. German data out on Tuesday showed growth below expectations at 1.6 percent year-on-year in the quarter.\nNevertheless, the central European region outpaced the EU’s average growth of 2.4 percent last year and should lead the bloc again this year even with a slight slowdown looming.\n“Economic cycles across CEE now look mature, and we expect that rising inflation and interest rates will increasingly weigh on domestic demand,” said Liam Carson, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics.\nSlovakia, a euro zone member, may stand out as its economy will be boosted by the launch of a Jaguar Land Rover factory this year, said Erste’s Arokszallasi.\nThe Czechs were the first in Europe to begin reversing years of ultra-loose monetary policy, starting with interest rate increases last year. The country’s central bank has lifted its main rate three times since last August to 0.75 percent.\nWith growth seen close to 4 percent in 2018, the Czech central bank is likely to raise rates again, as early as the third quarter according to a Reuters analyst poll.\nRomania has also raised interest rates three times this year and is expecting to continue to tighten conditions.\nPoland and Hungary, though, are seen keeping rock-bottom rates in place into 2019, fuelling a lending boom.\n** To monitor in real-time economic data releases in the Eikon app and view historical data click: here\nReporting by Jason Hovet Additional reporting by Jan Lopatka in Prague, Marcin Goettig in Warsaw, Sandor Peto in Budapest, Luiza Ilie in Bucharest and Tatiana Jancarikova in Bratislava Editing by Edmund blair\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
