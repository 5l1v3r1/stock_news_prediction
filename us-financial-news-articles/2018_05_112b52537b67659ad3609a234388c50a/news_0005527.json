No injuries had been reported, but images posted online by the NWS showed farm buildings flattened and a mobile home with its roof ripped off in north-central Kansas.\nTornado concerns were not as high on Thursday, forecasters said.\n“You can’t rule one out today, but it’s not expecting to be a big time destructive tornado,” said NWS meteorologist Brandon Drake in Topeka, Kansas.\nFurther east, portions of southern New York state, northern Pennsylvania and western New England, could see wind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour (100 km per hour), powerful enough to down trees, Chenard said.\nHail and wind threatened northeast Texas, southeast Oklahoma and central Arkansas, Chenard said. In addition, Chenard said there was some threat of rain and flash flooding in parts of Iowa and Wisconsin on Thursday.
