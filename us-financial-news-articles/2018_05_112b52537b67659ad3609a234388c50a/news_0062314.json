Selected financial and operational information included below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements , with the notes thereto and related management’s discussion and analysis (“ MD&A ”), which can be found at www.Greenfields-Petroleum.com and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Except as otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts referenced herein are expressed in United States dollars.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nGross production volumes with respect to the offshore block known as the Bahar Project (the “ Bahar Project ”) averaged 838 bbl/d for crude oil and 17,299 mcf/d for natural gas, or a total of 3,720 boe/d. In comparison to the first quarter 2017, gross production volumes decreased 3% for crude oil (862 bbl/d), decreased 20% for natural gas (21,587 mcf/d) and decreased 17% (4,460 boe/d) for boe/d. In fourth quarter 2017, gross production volumes were 638 bbl/d for crude oil, 18,965 mcf/d for natural gas, or a total of 3,799 boe/d. The Company's entitlement share of sales volumes (the “ Sales Volumes ”) resulted in revenue of $7.0 million, a decrease of 24% in comparison to revenue of $9.2 million realized in the first quarter 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company realized revenue from Sales Volumes of $6.9 million. Realized oil price averaged $63.11/bbl, an increase of 34% in comparison to $47.24/bbl realized in the first quarter 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company realized average prices of $56.04/bbl. The price of natural gas has been fixed at $2.69/mcf since April 1, 2017 and previously it was constant at $3.96/mcf. Operating costs were $5.0 million, 20% lower when compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter 2017. In the fourth quarter 2017 the Company had operating costs of $4.8 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 million, 30% lower when compared to expenditures of $2.0 million in first quarter 2017. The Company had capital expenditures of $2.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017. After interest and depreciation expenses, the Company realized a net loss of $2.6 million or a loss per share (basic and diluted) of $0.01, as compared to the first quarter 2017, where the Company realized a net loss of $1.4 million with a loss per share (basic and diluted) of $0.01. In the fourth quarter 2017, the Company realized a net loss of $2.2 million or a loss per share (basic and diluted) of $0.01.\n“The Company has made good progress during the first quarter 2018 by increasing oil production in relation to fourth quarter 2017 through recompletions,\" said John Harkins, CEO. \"Performance improvements in relation to service workovers contributed to restore and stabilize production. Our operating netback continues to improve due to increased oil production, coupled with higher market prices, and operating costs well under forecast.”\nOperational Review\nThe increase in crude oil production in first quarter 2018 resulted from the successful workover of the GD-456 well. In the Bahar Gas Field, two capital workovers were completed and one remained underway. The decrease in natural gas production in the quarter is due to the loss of production from the B-171 well (approximately 1,800 mcf/d) due to a tubing problem. The workover on Bahar-171 restored natural gas production to 2,600 mcf/d at the end of the first quarter 2018 (a 44% increase as compared to year end 2017). The Bahar-177 well was suspended pending further evaluation of options for casing repair. Construction efforts focused on platform refurbishment to enable access for workovers and production operations, as well as infrastructural improvement projects related to the causeway, facilities and pipelines. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company continued the south Gum Deniz re-development project with the refurbishment of GD Platform-412. It was determined that the deeper wells in the south Gum Deniz will require pulling units larger than previously available. New larger pulling units are expected to be in service in June 2018 for Platform-409 and August 2018 for Plaform-412. Lower operating costs in first quarter 2018 resulted from costs reimbursements by SOCAR Oil Affiliate (\" SOA \"), the Company's 20% partner in the Bahar Project, as well as lower personnel costs, insurance and rentals. Administrative expenses for the first quarter 2018 were $1.2 million, 88% higher in comparison to $0.6 million in first quarter 2017 and 45% higher when compared to $0.8 million in fourth quarter 2017. The increases in Administrative expenses are due to higher professional and technical fees in connection with ongoing reservoir simulation studies and corporate initiatives. Lower capital expenditures in first quarter 2018 resulted from costs reimbursements by SOA and the slow start of the capital program due to procurement delays and inclement weather. In relation to the extended waterflood injectivity test in the Gum Deniz initiated in December 2017, two wells have been placed on injection and a third well is expected to follow in second quarter 2018. Injection of water will continue as new wellbores are added. Offset producing wells and observation wells will be closely monitored for response. The Company continues to work closely with SOCAR Drilling Trust (“ SDT ”) in connection with partnering opportunities to drill deep gas wells in the Bahar Gas Field, as previously announced to the market on December 4, 2017. The refurbishment of the Bahar Platform 196, key for future development drilling, is ongoing. In addition, both the work to design the Bahar 301 well and its respective drilling contract are underway.\nSelected Financial Information\n(US$000’s, except as noted) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 * Restated* (1) Financial Revenues Crude oil and natural gas 7,046 9,238 Net loss (2,591 ) (1,368 ) Loss per share, basic and diluted ($0.01 ) ($0.01 ) Operating Average Entitlement Sales Volumes (2) Crude Oil (bbl/d) 597 709 Decrease with respect to same period in 2017 (16 %) Natural gas (mcf/d) 14,855 17,296 Decrease with respect to same period in 2017 (14 %) Barrel oil equivalent (boe/d) 3,072 3,591 Decrease with respect to same period in 2017 (14 %) Entitlement to gross sales volumes (3) 88 % 84 % Prices Average oil price ($/bbl) 64.25 48.20 Net realization price ($/bbl) 63.11 47.24 Increase with respect to same period in 2017 34 % Brent oil price ($/bbl) 66.86 53.59 Natural gas price ($/mcf) (4) 2.69 3.96 Net realization price ($/boe) (5) 25.48 28.58 Operating cost ($/boe) (5) (18.26 ) (19.61 ) Operating Netback ($/boe) (5) 7.22 8.97 Capital Items Cash and cash equivalents 210 1,891 Total Assets 199,689 198,781 Working capital (6) (6,666 ) (48,189 ) Long term debt and shareholders’ equity 180,087 138,147\n(1) The term * Restated* was added to the 2017 comparative information due to the reclassification of impairment expense, previously reported on a separate expense line, into operating expense, both within the same group of expenses as reported in the Company’s financial statements.

Specifically, “net realization price”, “operating netback” and “operating cost” do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS and are regarded as non-IFRS measures. These non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similar amounts for other entities and readers are cautioned that use of such measures to compare issuers may not be valid. Non-IFRS measures are used to benchmark operations against prior periods and are widely used by investors, lenders, analysts and other parties. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The definition and reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure or additional subtotal is presented herein.\n“Net realization price”, “operating netbacks”, “operating costs” are common non-IFRS measurements applied in the oil and gas industry and are used by management to assess the operational performance and performance of the Company. “Net realization price” indicates the selling price of a good less the selling costs. “Operating netback” is a measure of oil and gas sales revenue net of royalties, production and transportation expenses. “Operating cost” provides an indication of the controllable cash costs incurred per boe during a period. Management believes that these non-IFRS measures assist management and investors in assessing Greenfields’ profitability and operating results on a per unit basis to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis.\nThe Operating Summary on page 10 of the Company’s first quarter 2018 MD&A includes a reconciliation of “net realization price”, “operating netback” and “operating cost” to the most closely related IFRS measure.\nNotes regarding Oil and Gas Disclosures\nBarrels of oil equivalent or “boe” may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. The volumes disclosed in this press release use a 6 mcf: 1 boe, as such is typically used in oil and gas reporting and is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. The Company uses a 6 mcf: 1 boe ratio to calculate its share of entitlement sales from the Bahar project for its financial reporting and reserves disclosure.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nFor more information, please contact:\nGreenfields Petroleum Corporation\ninfo@greenfieldspetroleum.com John W Harkins (CEO) +1 (832) 234 0836 Jose Perez-Bello (CFO) +1 (832) 234 0831 Yellow Jersey (Media Relations)\ngreenfields@yellowjerseypr.com Charles Goodwin +44 7747 788 221 Harriet Jackson +44 7544 275 882\nSource: Greenfields Petroleum Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b85c57ea-8665-4be9-8097-0aa1d174a183", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=roPt-Y6rObq_xl7tv1fBl_RCIRVEN3zkSEKwqc5-kAH9JsjPzv_VmBRAPQcaUdGGf3zN3U0zX3mKnXsnkIFJhGagdpZHpD6n4mFGtXPlEkf1AiVcPj_f5w2uZ2nCXqQE"], "published": "2018-05-30T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:18:24.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
