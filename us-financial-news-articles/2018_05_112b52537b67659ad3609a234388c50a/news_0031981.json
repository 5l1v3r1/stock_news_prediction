She even cracked what some see as the toughest U.S. glass ceiling, when the company made a President Barbie doll in 2016.\nHer longtime boyfriend Ken, whose buff chest and chiseled face also are encased in silver in Lange’s rings, brooches and necklaces, underwent a makeover of his own to bolster sagging sales. Mattel in 2017 offered Ken in a range of body types and skin tones for every ethnicity, with man buns and cornrows.\nLange is always on the lookout for the classic old-time Barbie, with red lips, at garage sales, thrift store and flea markets.\nAfter Mattel contacted her for a Barbie collector’s catalog, she made rings displaying Barbie shoes heels and then expanded her creations in the “Plastic Body Series,” which she has been crafting for 20 years.\n“I fell in love with Barbie as a child,” said Lange, a graduate of Maryland Institute College of Art. “I was obsessed with Barbie dolls and playing in and creating her miniature world.” (Writing by Barbara Goldberg in New York Editing by Scott Malone and Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:07:32.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
