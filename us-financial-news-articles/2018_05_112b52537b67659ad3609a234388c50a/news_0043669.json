Where is the rule of law?” Indian Nobel laureate and child rights activist Kailash Satyarthi said on Twitter.\nThe case has put the spotlight on the abuse of domestic servants in India where millions of people, including children trafficked from remote and impoverished states, toil for long hours in homes with little freedom or protection.\nSatyarthi urged the government to pass India’s new anti-trafficking bill, that was cleared by cabinet in February but has not been tabled in parliament yet, and called for the enactment of another bill to regulate employment agencies.\nWith stringent punishment for traffickers and quick relief for victims, campaigners believe the anti-trafficking law will result in more arrests and convictions.\nAbout 60 percent of the more than 23,000 trafficking victims rescued in India in 2016 were children, government data shows.\nCampaigners have blamed the dilution of the country’s child labor act for more children being trafficked for domestic work.\nIndia’s parliament approved a controversial law in 2016 allowing children to work for family businesses, despite widespread concern that it would push more of them into labor.\nAnti-trafficking charity Shakti Vahini demanded a rollback of amendments in the law and quick enactment of legislation to monitor unregulated employment agencies to stop them withholding salaries from workers or using violence against them.\n“It is getting worse after the law was amended,” Ravi Kant, founder of Shakti Vahini, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“There is no fear of law under the current child labor act.”\nReporting by Annie Banerji @anniebanerji, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian issues, conflicts, land and property rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, gender equality, climate change and resilience.
