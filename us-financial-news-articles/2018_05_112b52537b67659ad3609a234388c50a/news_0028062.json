Trump is “probably the most consummate deal maker I’ve seen in a long long time. I think we should give him a chance to get it done.” (Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T17:47:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
