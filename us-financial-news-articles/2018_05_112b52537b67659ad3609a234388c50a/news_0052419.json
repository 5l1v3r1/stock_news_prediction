For the week, the index has fallen 2.2 percent so far and is poised to post the first weekly decline in nine weeks.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.1 percent.\nDefence equipment maker Ishikawa Seisakusho surged 6.3 percent, Howa Machinery jumped 6.4 percent, while health protection device maker Shigematsu Works soared 2.8 percent.\n“Investors see exporter shares are difficult to invest in now due to a strong yen, so they are shifting their money to defence-related stocks for now,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n“Investors’ risk stance came back earlier this week as trade war worries seemed to ease, but the relief was short-lived and investors seem risk averse again.”\nTrump, in a letter to North Korea released by the White House, called off the June 12 summit, citing “tremendous anger and open hostility” in a recent statement by Pyongyang. The cancellation came even after North Korea followed through on a pledge to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site.\nAutomakers continued to slide on worries about new U.S. tariffs.\nToyota Motor Corp dropped 1.0 percent and Subaru Corp declined 0.7 percent.\nDefensive shares such as railway and food stocks, which are less affected to global risks, found support. East Japan Railway rose 1.0 percent, while Ajinomoto Co advanced 0.7 percent.
