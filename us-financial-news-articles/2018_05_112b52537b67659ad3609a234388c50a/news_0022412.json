Our strategy of international expansion of our existing portfolio is showing good results. Domestic Animal Health sales growth was muted on the continued weak dairy industry and on low disease incidence that reduced vaccine demand. Our Mineral Nutrition segment’s profitability continued to improve on volume growth and operational execution around new initiatives. We saw 12% growth in adjusted EBITDA, outpacing sales growth. Improved gross profit from favorable product mix allowed us to continue to invest in product and organizational development, while still growing profitability.”\n“Looking forward, we are in discussions with third parties to fund development and then commercialize and acquire promising new technologies and products. As part of our first entry into the companion animal space, we have recently signed an agreement to develop a new product using a novel delivery method for a canine Lyme disease vaccine. This and other opportunities targeting the nutritional and vaccine sectors for both production and companion animals will require expense investment for the next 18 to 24 months before we see the commercial fruits of our investments. These investments reinforce our belief in the bright future for our business.”\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\nNet sales\nNet sales of $208.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $19.0 million, or 10%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Animal Health, Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products grew $11.3 million, $5.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nAnimal Health\nNet sales of $132.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, grew $11.3 million, or 9%. Net sales of MFAs and other grew $6.6 million or 9%. International net sales of MFAs and other increased $5.6 million due to growth across most regions, notably due to additional penetration in the cattle sector, plus favorable seasonal demand for certain products and the incremental benefit of a recent acquisition. Domestic net sales of MFAs and other increased $1.0 million due to volume growth of certain products. Domestic sales of medically important antimicrobials were approximately level with the prior year. Net sales of nutritional specialty products grew $3.8 million, or 14%, primarily due to volume growth of our products for the dairy and poultry industries in various international countries and in the United States. Net sales of vaccines grew $1.0 million, or 6%, primarily due to volume growth in international markets; domestic growth was moderate due to reduced disease pressure.\nMineral Nutrition\nNet sales of $62.9 million increased $5.8 million, or 10%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increased revenue primarily was driven by higher average selling prices, consistent with the underlying raw material commodity price increases.\nPerformance Products\nNet sales of $13.7 million increased $1.9 million, or 17%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, due to increased volumes and higher average selling prices of copper-based products.\nGross profit\nGross profit of $69.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $8.4 million, or 14%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Gross profit increased to 33.1% of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 31.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Animal Health gross profit increased $7.5 million due to volume growth and favorable seasonal demand for certain MFAs and other products, volume growth of nutritional specialty products and vaccines and overall lower unit costs from improved manufacturing efficiencies for certain of our products. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $1.1 million, driven by volume growth and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Performance Products gross profit was in-line with the prior year as volume growth and increased pricing of copper-based products were offset by increased commodity costs of copper-based products.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) of $42.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $11.9 million, or 39%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million gain in SG&A resulting from a payment to us in settlement of our claims against an insurance carrier under our liability insurance policies. Without the effects of the gain on the insurance settlement, SG&A increased $4.4 million or 12%.\nAnimal Health SG&A increased $2.8 million as compared to the prior year, driven by investments in product and organization development. A recent acquisition also contributed to the Animal Health increase. Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products SG&A were approximately level with the prior year. Excluding the prior-year insurance settlement, Corporate expense increased $1.6 million primarily due to increased employee-related costs and higher professional fees.\nInterest expense, net\nInterest expense, net of $3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased $0.9 million, or 22%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense decreased $1.0 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower interest rates in the new Credit Facilities completed in June 2017. Interest income decreased $0.1 million due to less interest income on deposits in foreign jurisdictions.\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net\nForeign currency (gains) losses, net for the three months ended March 31, 2018, amounted to net gains of $1.0 million, as compared to net gains of $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The strengthening of the Mexican currency relative to the U.S. dollar was the primary reason for the foreign currency gains during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Foreign currency gains and losses primarily arise from intercompany balances.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes, effective income tax rate and certain income tax items for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, are reflected in the table below:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 (in thousands, except percentages) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 4,548 $ 2,805 Effective income tax rate 18.6 % 10.6 % Certain income tax items Benefit from exercised employee stock options $ (1,038 ) $ (1,442 ) Release of unrecognized tax benefits (758 ) - Release of foreign valuation allowance - (3,780 ) Total $ (1,796 ) $ (5,222 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes, excluding certain items $ 6,344 $ 8,027 Effective income tax rate, excluding certain items 26.0 % 30.4 % During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we concluded it was more likely than not that the value of deferred tax assets related to a foreign subsidiary would be realized, resulting in the release of a foreign valuation allowance.\nNet income\nNet income of $19.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, decreased $3.8 million, as compared to net income of $23.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease primarily was driven by a $3.5 million decline in operating income, partially offset by lower interest expense of $0.9 million and increased foreign currency gains of $0.6 million, and a $1.7 million increase in the income tax provision. The decline in operating income primarily was influenced by the prior-year $7.5 million insurance settlement gain. Excluding this gain, operating income would have increased $4.0 million or 18%, driven by sales growth and gross profit expansion.\nDiluted EPS\nDiluted EPS was $0.49 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.10, compared to $0.59 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as a result of the decrease in net income.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of $33.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased $3.7 million, or 12%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Animal Health Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.5 million, or 14%, due to sales growth and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A. Mineral Nutrition Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.0 million, or 24%, due to volume growth and higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Performance Products Adjusted EBITDA was similar to the prior year as higher volumes and selling prices were offset by higher raw material costs. Corporate expenses increased $1.8 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased employee-related costs and higher professional fees.\nAdjusted provision for income taxes\nThe adjusted effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 26.8%, and included the benefit of a reduced statutory federal income tax rate.\nAdjusted diluted EPS\nAdjusted diluted EPS was $0.46 for the quarter, an increase of $0.09 compared to $0.37 last year. Higher gross profit, lower interest expense, net, and a lower effective income tax rate, were the primary contributors to the improvement.\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS\n2.5x leverage ratio at March 31, 2018 $311 million total debt $125 million LTM Adjusted EBITDA $76 million cash and short-term investments on hand at March 31, 2018 $18 million source of cash before financing for the March 2018 quarter, excluding cash used to purchase short-term investments Dividend $4.0 million quarterly dividend paid during the March 2018 quarter $4.0 million quarterly dividend to be paid June 2018\nFINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nWe are not modifying our financial guidance for the fiscal year 2018 as presented in our February 5, 2018 press release.\nWEBCAST & CONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nPhibro Animal Health Corporation will host a webcast and conference call during which the company will review its financial results and respond to questions.\nDate: Tuesday, May 8, 2018 Time: 9:00 AM Eastern Location: http://investors.pahc.com/events-presentations U.S. Toll-Free: +1 (877) 853-5634 International Toll: +1 (315) 625-6893 Conference ID: 69676216\nNOTE: In order to join this conference call, all participants will be required to provide the Conference ID number.\nA replay of the webcast will be archived and made available on Phibro’s website.\nDISCLOSURE NOTICES\nForward-Looking Statements: This communication contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
