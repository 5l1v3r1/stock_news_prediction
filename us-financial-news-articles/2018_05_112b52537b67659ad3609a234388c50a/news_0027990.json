That came a day after it topped its 50-day average, a key indicator of short-term momentum.\nAt 12:40 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 234.65 points, or 0.96 percent, at 24,777.19, the S&P 500 was up 26.24 points, or 0.97 percent, at 2,724.03 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 65.76 points, or 0.90 percent, at 7,405.67.\nCenturyLink gained 8 percent, the most on the S&P, after its first-quarter results. That helped the telecoms sector rise 1.56 percent, the most among the 11 sectors.\nAXA Equitable Holdings, the U.S. division of French insurer AXA, slipped 0.5 percent in its market debut. Although its offering raised less than targeted, it was still the biggest U.S. IPO this year. The top losers on the S&P 500 included Victoria’s Secret owner L Brands, which fell 8.6 percent, and Booking Holdings, formerly called Priceline, which dropped 5.3 percent. Both companies gave disappointing outlooks.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 3.13-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.19-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 135 new highs and 20 new lows.
