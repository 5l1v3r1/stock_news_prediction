REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo The option to have a date of birth in the future was spotted by London blogger ianvisits who wrote on his site: “Professor Hawking once threw a party for time travelers, to see if any would turn up if he posted the invite after the party.\n“None did, but it seems perfect that the memorial website allows people born in the future to attend the service. Look out for time travelers at the Abbey.”\nSarah Bridle, a professor of Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, told BBC Radio that Hawking, who was confined to a wheelchair for most of his life, had remained curious about the potential for time travel, even after his party in 2009.\n“He was curious and he had a great sense of humor,” she said. “He said he combined his two favorite things, experiments and champagne to put on this party.”\nReporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T13:10:49.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
