He gave up four hits and three walks while striking out three.\nThe Giants had allowed no more than five runs in any of their previous eight games.\nMaking just his second start of the season after beginning the year in the minors, Eflin shut out the Giants on four hits over 6 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out nine.\nThe right-hander had pitched well, but without a decision, in his season debut last Tuesday, allowing just one run and three hits in six innings against the Miami Marlins.\nZac Curtis, Seranthony Dominguez and Yacksel Rios worked the final 2 1/3 innings for the Phillies, allowing two hits and one walk while completing the club’s fourth shutout of the season.\nDominguez, 23, pitched a perfect eighth inning in his major league debut.\nSantana made it a four-RBI game with an infield out that scored Pedro Florimon, who had doubled, to complete the scoring in the eighth.\nHerrera scored three times and had five RBIs for the Phillies, who have alternated wins and losses in their past six games.\nHernandez and Hoskins scored twice apiece, while Nick Williams had two hits for Philadelphia, which was opening a seven-game homestand.\nBuster Posey had two hits for the Giants, who had opened their 10-game trip with a three-game sweep at Atlanta.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:57:09.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
