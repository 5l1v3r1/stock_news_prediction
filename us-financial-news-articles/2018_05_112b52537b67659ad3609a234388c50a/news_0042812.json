Any discounts or rebates will depend on negotiations with health plans, said Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis.\nAimovig is the first in a new class of treatments designed to prevent migraine by interfering with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain.\nCompanies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Eli Lilly & Co are developing similar treatments.\nIn studies of patients with chronic and episodic migraines, Aimovig was shown to significantly reduce headache days and use of other acute migraine medications.
