Until now, market participants have debated what that language meant.\nSpecifically, the minutes said \"a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee's symmetric inflation objective.\"\nThough the general tone was that inflation would continue to rise, there was disagreement over how confident the Fed should be after undershooting its target for so long, with some members amenable to letting the prices climb higher.\n\"It's not like the Minutes were all that earth-shattering, but if you looked closely, you may have seen a bit of the hawkish tone get adjusted,\" wrote Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James.\n\"Regardless of what they say publicly, they don't want to see the yield curve invert, and they don't want to be the cause of a recession,\" he added. \"What all of this means to the bond market is that the Fed may have blinkedâ€¦a bit.\"\nAll signs continued to point at a tight labor market, with Thursday's data on new applications for U.S. unemployment rising just slightly to 234,000 for the week ended May 19.\nThe Treasury Department auctioned $30 billion in seven-year notes at a high yield of 2.93 percent.
