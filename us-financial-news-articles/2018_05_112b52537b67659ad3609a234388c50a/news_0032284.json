It’s a reason to keep working, keep staying motivated and hopefully I can keep going.”\nShapovalov will meet Dutchman Robin Haase in the second round.\nArgentine Diego Schwartzman, the 14th seed, advanced to the second round after a regulation 6-4 6-1 victory over Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry, while Spaniard Fernando Verdasco was beaten 6-3 6-1 by Bosnia’s Damir Dzumhur.\nRain delayed play at the start of the day before disrupting things at the end, with fourth seed Marin Cilic’s second round match against American Ryan Harrison suspended with the players level at 3-3 in a first set tiebreak.
