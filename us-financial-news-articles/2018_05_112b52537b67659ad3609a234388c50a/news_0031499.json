Matt Dunham/Pool via REUTERS\nRights campaigners have accused May of turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in pursuit of trade deals after Brexit. In Turkey’s case they point to the jailing tens of thousands of people after the attempted coup. Erdogan’s government has said its actions are necessary to combat the threat it faces.\nMay said Britain’s relationship with Turkey was indispensable, praising the impact of security cooperation and the prospect of close post-Brexit trade ties.\nBut she added a diplomatic warning on the need for restraint.

Matt Dunham/Pool via REUTERS\nShe said she had underlined the need for Turkey to uphold democratic values and its human rights obligations.\nErdogan’s visit is part of May’s charm offensive to shore up relations with countries outside the European Union as Britain prepares to leave the bloc and secure at least the promise of future trade deals to bolster her all but stalled Brexit plans.\nErdogan, the most popular - and divisive - politician in recent Turkish history, has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of sharp economic growth and a widespread crackdown against his opponents. Last month he declared snap elections for June 24, bringing the polls forward by more than a year.\nErdogan deflected a question from a British journalist about his country’s ability to hold a free and fair election. He said those arrested in Turkey were being processed by the judiciary.

Another said “tamam”, or enough.\nAbout 20 metres away, separated by barriers and a police cordon, a similar number waved Turkish flags in the direction of the anti-Erdogan protesters, chanted and played loud music.\nThe two sides briefly scuffled.\nLast year, May secured a commitment for Britain and Turkey to work on post-Brexit trade.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Erdogan welcomed a transition deal agreed between London and the EU to ease Britain’s departure from the bloc. He said the two leaders had agreed trade could be increased to $20 billion annually, up from the 2017 level of around £16 billion.\nTies between the EU and Turkey are increasingly strained, with Brussels saying that Erdogan is leading his country away from the path to membership, while some Turkish officials say they feel betrayed by some of the bloc’s leaders.
