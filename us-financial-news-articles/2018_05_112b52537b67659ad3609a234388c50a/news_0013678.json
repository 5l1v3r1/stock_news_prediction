Pittsburgh has dropped four in a row, and the Pirates’ problems in this series came mainly because they scored just 10 runs.\nWashington used power for its offense in this game. Turner hit a two-run homer to left in the sixth, and Zimmerman added his solo shot two batters later.\nWashington starter Jeremy Hellickson threw well but came away with a no-decision. The right-hander went 5 2/3 innings and gave up three hits with four strikeouts. Sammy Solis (1-1) got the victory after he got the final out of the top of the sixth — throwing only one pitch.\nTrevor Williams (4-2) pitched effectively for the seventh straight time this season but was hurt by the lack of run support. The Pittsburgh starter allowed just one hit and one walk through the first five innings until the Nationals broke through in that three-run sixth.\nWilmer Difo led off the inning with a single and then scored when Turner lined his two-run homer two batters later. That gave Washington a 2-0 lead, and Zimmerman added to that later in the inning with his solo blast.\nPittsburgh loaded the bases with one out in the eighth against Ryan Madson, but closer Sean Doolittle then came on. Gregory Polanco brought in one run by grounding into a forceout before Starling Marte flied out, and the Nationals escaped with a 3-1 lead.\nDoolittle then set down the Pirates in the ninth and locked up his sixth save, this one being 1 2/3 innings.\nMLB.com reported that Nationals reliever Shawn Kelley (ulnar nerve irritation) could return this weekend. He is eligible to come off the disabled list Friday.\nAlso for Washington, third baseman Anthony Rendon is scheduled to be the DH for Class-A Advanced Potomac on Thursday night in his first rehab game. He’s been out since April 13 with a bruised left big toe.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:17:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
