Sales rose 0.8 percent when adjusted for currency effects.\nEarnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 18 million euros, after a loss of 19 million in the same period last year, helped by the end of the VAT refunds, cost cuts and higher demand for services.\nCeconomy kept its forecast for at least medium single-digit percentage growth in annual operating profit and a slight increase on sales of 22.16 billion euros last year.\n($1 = 0.8458 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:53:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
