Annual inflation rose 4.55 percent during the period, the national statistics agency said, below expectations in a Reuters poll and the slowest pace since December 2016. Inflation is easing from a 16-1/2 year high in 2017 and Mexico's central bank is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady next week for the second meeting in a row after raising borrowing costs to a nine-year high of 7.50 percent Month-on-month, consumer prices fell 0.34 percent in April, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures, as summer electricity subsidies kicked in. The core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.15 percent during the month .
