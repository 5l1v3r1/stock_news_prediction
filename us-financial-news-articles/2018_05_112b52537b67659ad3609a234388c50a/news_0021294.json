Those markets surged 21 percent.\n“The positive market conditions seen throughout 2017 have continued in the first months of 2018 in all divisions... providing a good base for the start into the high season,” Chief Executive Julian Diaz said.\nDufry said initial contributions from its cost-savings plan also helped earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) jump 18.4 percent to 183.1 million Swiss francs ($182.5 million).\nRevenue rose 6.6 percent to 1.82 billion francs.\n“Overall, we expect the market to take today’s results relatively well. The surprise came at the EBITDA level, which was 6 percent above market expectations,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.\nShares in the company are expected to rise more than 2 percent, according to premarket indications from traders.\n$1 = 1.0033 Swiss francs Reporting by Bartosz Dabrowski and Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:15:53.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
