CONSTITUTION DAY ATTACK\nThe warning about the malware - which includes a module that targets industrial networks like ones that operate the electric grid - will be amplified by alerts from members of the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), a nonprofit group that promotes the fast exchange of data on new threats between rivals in the cyber security industry.

It infects and monitors network traffic, looking for login credentials that a hacker can use to seize control of industrial processes, Williams said.
