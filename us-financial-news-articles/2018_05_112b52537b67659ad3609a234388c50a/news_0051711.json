Based in the Irving, TX office, he will lead a CAT Command Center which will house dedicated CAT adjusters.\n“As our team reflected on the 2017 CAT season, we felt that we should dedicate more resources to CAT handling and to separate it completely from our daily claims operations.

More recently, Randy served as the Director of Property Claims at AmTrust Financial.\nRandy shared, “I chose the property line of business as my career over 25 years ago and, for the last 15 years, CAT has been my passion. My goal is to enhance the deployment and CAT management strategies already in place at NARS, while keeping the customer experience at the forefront.”\nRandy has additional experience in Training, Quality Assurance, and Branch Management. He received a Bachelor’s Degree in Business Administration from the University of North Texas.\nAbout NARS\nNorth American Risk Services, Inc.
