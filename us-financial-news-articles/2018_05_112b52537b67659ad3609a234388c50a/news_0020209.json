The index is up another 1.5 percent so far in May.\nTaiwan stocks, a favorite of foreign buyers in the last six years, witnessed outflows of 2.8 billion in April to take the year’s tally to over $5 billion.\nSouth Korea and Indian stocks saw outflows of $1.7 billion and $850 million, respectively.\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that a mounting trade dispute between the United States and China was one of the most pressing worries for Southeast Asian nations.\nThe Trump administration is threatening to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports and Beijing has vowed to retaliate. []\nCreeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are also fuelling fears that portfolio managers may move money into safer fixed-income securities at the expense of riskier assets like stocks and emerging markets.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield breached the psychological level of 3 percent in late April and with the Federal Reserve being the only major central bank set to raise interest rates in this quarter most analysts expect further upside in U.S. bond yields.\nAnother worry for regional markets was the United States pulling out of an international nuclear deal with Iran on Wednesday and the move is seen as disruptive for many Asian companies that have deals with Iran.\nIran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a major supplier, especially to refiners in Asia.\nIG’s Pan said the risk factors for Asian equities “look to be here to stay as we tread into May, which could continue to keep the outflows ongoing.”\nReporting by Patturaja Murugaboopathy in Bengaluru; Editing by Kim Coghill\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
