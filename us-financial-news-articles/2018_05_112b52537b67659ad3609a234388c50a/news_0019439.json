This increase was primarily driven by an increase in direct sales from both new customers and repeat orders from existing customers, an increase in distributor sales, and strength of the Euro.\nGrant income was approximately $491,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to approximately $517,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of approximately $26,000. This decrease was a result of timing of certain grant revenue.\nTotal revenues were approximately $4,925,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to total revenues of approximately $3,114,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $1,811,000 or 58%.\nCost of Revenue:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, cost of revenue was approximately $1,568,000 and $1,254,000, respectively, an increase of approximately $314,000. Product cost of revenues increased approximately $305,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to increased sales. Product gross margins were approximately 74% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to approximately 68% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in gross margin of 6% was due to a reduction in the cost of devices manufactured as a result of production efficiencies achieved, as well as a favorable mix of sales between direct customers and distributors and the impact of the increase in the exchange rate of the Euro.\nResearch and Development Expenses:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, research and development expenses were approximately $1,780,000 as compared to research and development expenses of approximately $469,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase of approximately $1,311,000 was due to increase in costs related to our clinical studies and trials of approximately $867,000, an increase in our clinical related salaries of approximately $211,000, an increase in non-clinical research and development salaries of approximately $96,000, an increase in new product development costs of approximately $70,000, an increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $49,000 and increases in other non-clinical research and development costs of approximately $18,000.\nLegal, Financial and Other Consulting Expenses:\nLegal, financial and other consulting expenses were approximately $416,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to approximately $280,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase of approximately $136,000 was due to an increase in employment agency fees of approximately $79,000 related to the recruitment of senior level personnel and an increase in legal fees of approximately $44,000 related to certain corporate initiatives and an increase in auditing and accounting fees of approximately $21,000. These increases were offset by a decrease consulting fees of approximately $8,000.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $4,262,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to approximately $2,667,000 for the three months ending March 31, 2017. The increase of $1,595,000 was due to increase in salaries, commissions, and related costs of approximately $696,000, an increase in royalty expenses of approximately $146,000 due to the increase in product sales, additional sales and marketing costs, which include advertising and conferences of approximately $81,000, an increase in travel and entertainment and other costs of approximately $84,000, an increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $520,000, an increase in public relations costs of approximately $43,000, an increase in rent expense of approximately $11,000 related to the new expansion of manufacturing and office facilities and an increase in other general and administrative cost increases of approximately $14,000.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, interest expense was approximately $239,000, as compared to interest expense of approximately $120,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in interest expense of approximately $119,000 is directly related to the additional interest expense related to the Company's draw down of the Term B Loan (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement dated as of June 30, 2016 with Bridge Bank) on June 30, 2017 in the amount of $5,000,000.\nGain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately $358,000 as compared to approximately $153,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The 2018 first quarter gain is directly related to the increase in the exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar at March 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.23 per Euro at March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.20 per Euro at December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, our operations have been primarily financed through the issuance of debt and equity securities. At March 31, 2018, we had current assets of approximately $24,515,000 including cash on hand of approximately $21,090,000 and current liabilities of approximately $3,986,000.\nOn June 30, 2016, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, CytoSorbents Medical, Inc. (together, the \"Borrower\"), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Bridge Bank, a division of Western Alliance Bank, (the \"Bank\"), pursuant to which the Company borrowed $10 million in two equal tranches of $5 million (the \"Original Term Loans\"). On March 29, 2018 (the \"Closing Date\"), the Original Term Loans were refinanced with the Bank pursuant to an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement by and between the Bank and the Borrower (the \"Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\"), under which the Bank agreed to loan the Borrower up to an aggregate of $15 million to be disbursed in two tranches (1) one tranche of $10 million (the \"Term A Loan\") which was funded on the Closing Date and used to refinance the Original Term Loans, and (2) a second tranche of $5 million which may be disbursed at the Borrower's sole request prior to March 31, 2019 provided certain conditions are met (the \"Term B Loan\" and together with the Term A Loan, the \"Term Loans\"). The proceeds of the Term Loans will be used for general business requirements in accordance with the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement.\nIn addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company sold 782,328 shares of its common stock under the terms of its Controlled Equity Offering SM Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald and Co. (the \"Sales Agreement\") at an average cost of $7.97 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $6,047,000, and during the period from April 1, 2018 through May 2, 2018, the Company sold an additional 27,088 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $8.29, per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $218,000.\nAs a result of the equity financing under the terms of the Sales Agreement and the availability of additional debt financing under the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Bridge Bank, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations into the second half of 2019.\n2018 Second Quarter Revenue Guidance\nCytoSorbents has not historically given financial guidance on quarterly results until the quarter has been completed. However, we expect our second quarter 2018 product sales to exceed product sales reported in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor additional information, please see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed on March 8, 2018 on http://www.sec.gov .\nAbout CytoSorbents Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO )\nCytoSorbents Corporation is a leader in critical care immunotherapy, specializing in blood purification. Its flagship product, CytoSorb® ® is approved in the European Union with distribution in 45 countries around the world, as an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber designed to reduce the \"cytokine storm\" or \"cytokine release syndrome\" that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical illnesses.
