Dual-fuel cars, which are run partly on natural gas or other cleaner fuels, will be tax free, the ministry added.\nThe National Society of Industries, a manufacturing association, warned the tax hikes in Peru would lead to more contraband and pirated goods.\nThe government of President Martin Vizcarra, who took office in March, promised to be vigilant of attempts to evade the new taxes. It said demand for alcoholic and sugary drinks has been rising while public resources for health care have fallen.\nAddressing the impacts of non-communicable diseases - associated with smoking, drinking, obesity and pollution - costs Peru $24 billion, or about 11 percent of GDP, every year, the finance ministry said, citing a study from Harvard University.\nGovernment spending on health care in Peru is only about 3.7 percent of gross domestic product, the ministry added.\nVizcarraâ€™s government has also said it would eliminate some tax exemptions following three straight years of declines in tax revenues as economic growth has slowed.\nThe government aims to widen the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP this year before leaving it at 1 percent by 2021, when it expects the economy to grow by 5 percent.\nReporting By Mitra Taj; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:43:55.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
