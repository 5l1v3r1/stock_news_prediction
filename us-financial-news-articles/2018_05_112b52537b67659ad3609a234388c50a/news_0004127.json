REUTERS/Stringer/Files Iron ore is the second commodity China is opening to outside investors after launching crude oil futures in late March. Unlike crude oil, though, the iron ore contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE) - launched in 2013 - has a deep pool of liquidity and major Western traders have already had access through local Chinese entities.\nWith trading volumes last year that reached 20 times global iron ore trade, and 25 times volumes done in rival contracts on the Singapore Exchange, iron ore futures in China regularly sway benchmark spot pricing. Giving foreign investors direct access can only boost that influence.\n“DCE will always be a leading indicator. It has been and will always be (because of) the sheer volume of it,” said Kelly Teoh, an iron ore derivatives broker at Clarkson Asia Pte Ltd.\nGlobal commodity traders including Glencore, Trafigura and Cargill already trade Dalian futures via China-registered units, sources with knowledge of their participation say.\nCargill said it has been trading DCE’s iron ore futures since the contract launch, using it as a price reference to manage its own inventory risk.\n“The internationalization of the DCE iron ore contracts will give greater access to the global commodity community to trade in the world’s biggest onshore ferrous market,” Lee Kirk, managing director at Cargill Metals, said in an email.\nMore global players on the DCE should lead to “more efficient pricing and increased liquidity,” he said.\nOfficials for Trafigura and Glencore declined to comment.\nTwenty-one foreign trading agencies have so far registered at the DCE, according to the China Securities Journal, the official publication of China’s top securities regulator, although the DCE has declined to name the agencies.\nThe move should also boost arbitrage opportunities between Dalian and Singapore, said William Chin, head of commodities at the Singapore Exchange.\nIt “will make it easier for foreign participants to take advantage of price movements across both exchanges,” he said.\nMASSIVE VOLUMES Unlike oil, gold and copper, for which prices are set in London and New York, iron ore is one of the few commodities whose global pricing takes its cue from China.\nWith massive volumes of iron ore futures traded on the Dalian exchange, prices there virtually dictate the path for the physical market. In 2017, Dalian iron ore volumes reached nearly 33 billion tonnes versus global annual trade of about 1.5 billion tonnes.\nThe huge volumes make the DCE a magnet for speculative retail investors, who have triggered wild price swings and prompted regulators to impose trading curbs over the past two years.\nNev Power, former boss of world No. 4 iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group, had criticised the speculative trade on Dalian, saying producers and users should be the main participants.\nFortescue’s new CEO, Elizabeth Gaines, who took over in February, said “it remains to be seen what impact (the internationalisation) will have on speculative trading and volatility in the market.”\n“We ... support pricing mechanisms which accurately reflect supply and demand for iron ore and provide certainty for the industry,” Gaines said in an email.\nMiners such as Vale, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue typically don’t hedge or fix prices for future sales because that means their earnings can be lower if prices increase.\n“We will have to wait and see how this develops as there has been limited use so far by the miners to hedge on SGX,” said Jamie Pearce, head of commodity derivatives at SSY Futures.\nBut even if miners don’t join the fray, DCE’s internationalisation is expected to boost its image as a venue for price discovery, participants say.\n“I expect China’s iron ore futures market will be more mature and rational when more foreign investors enter the Chinese market,” said Jacky Wang, chairman of Shanghai LC Assets Management Co Ltd.\nReporting by Manolo Serapio Jr. in MANILA and Muyu Xu in BEIJING; Writing by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T09:04:09.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
