Beef is also a key export demand of Mercosur.\nThe EU mandates, which are very similar, say that for such sensitive products longer transition periods or “other arrangements”, which could include limited quotas, should be considered.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:54:12.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
