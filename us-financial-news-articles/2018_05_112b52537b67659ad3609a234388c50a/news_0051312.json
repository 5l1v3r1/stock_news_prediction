It later granted him a one-year work visa.\nIn its interim injunction, the court reasoned that the revocation was based on “old information” that predated the granting of the permit. It noted the visa had been extended until the end of last month even after a review process.\n“Under these circumstances, it seems the status quo must be preserved, by an interim injunction,” said a court document, staying the order for Shakir to leave Israel. The court scheduled a hearing for July 2 to continue deliberations in the case.\nOn Tuesday, the European Union called on Israeli authorities to reinstate Shakir’s permit, saying that “otherwise Israel would join a very short list of countries which have barred entry to, or expelled, Human Rights Watch staff”.\nIsrael is basing its decision to deport Shakir on a law that allows immigration authorities to deny entry to supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a group Israeli authorities say advocates the country’s demise.\nReporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Ori Lewis/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:33:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
