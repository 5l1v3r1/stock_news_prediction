Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure equal to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back income tax, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, and write-off of long-lived assets, as noted in the tables below. We define adjusted gross profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Net loss $ (2,084 ) $ (2,893 ) Depreciation and amortization 451 216 Share-based compensation expense 165 458 Litigation costs - 504 Write-off of long-lived assets 55 - Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,413 ) $ (1,715 ) Three Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2018 2017 Revenue $ 3,325 $ 1,572 Cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 2,017 1,401 Adjusted gross profit $ 1,308 $ 171 Adjusted gross margin 39 % 11 % We present adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin as supplemental measures of our operating performance because we believe they provide useful information to our investors as they eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use them as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our business, evaluate the performance of our senior management and measure the operating strength of our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are measures frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and are indicators of the operational strength of our business. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and write-off of long-lived assets, and the impact of other items. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are calculated by using cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either loss before income taxes or net loss as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514006174/en/\nRed Violet, Inc.\nInvestors Relations:\nCamilo Ramirez, 561-757-4500\nir@redviolet.com\nSource: Red Violet", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redviolet.com&esheet=51805919&newsitemid=20180514006174&lan=en-US&anchor=www.redviolet.com&index=1&md5=341ae5952a4845d8e112bd5de448256d", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180514006174/en/"], "published": "2018-05-15T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T01:04:15.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
