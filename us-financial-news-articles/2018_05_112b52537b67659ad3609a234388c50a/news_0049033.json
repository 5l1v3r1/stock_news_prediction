Bank of England Governor Mark Carney arrives at the Bank of England Markets Forum 2018, at Bloomberg, in central London, Britain, May 24, 2018. Victoria Jones/Pool via REUTERS\nWhile the BoE expected a smooth transition, investors should look at its response to the shock referendum decision in 2016 - which included an interest rate cut and more bond-buying - for a sense of how it might react to a “disorderly” Brexit, he said.\nBritain is due to leave the EU in March next year but the terms of its new relationship with its most important trading partner remain unclear. Prime Minister Theresa May’s ministers are divided on what kind of Brexit they should pursue.\n“A more disorderly transition, or a materially different end state from our assumption, would have implications for monetary policy,” Carney said in a speech to the Society of Professional Economists in London.\nBusinesses, households and investors should look at how the BoE moved to support the economy, and allowed inflation to run above its 2 percent target, after the referendum “since exactly the same framework would apply,” he said.\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs to 0.25 percent after the 2016 Brexit vote and increased the size of its bond-buying programme by 60 billion pounds to 435 billion pounds. It also launched a plan to buy 10 billion pounds of corporate debt and a scheme to encourage banks to lend at low rates.

We have the tools we need. We will be prudent not passive.” Writing by William Schomberg, Editing by Angus MacSwan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:36:53.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
