I just like being at home and I like being around my family and friends more than I like chasing it around here.\n“I’ve got everything in place for both sides of it, so I’m not going to be bothered if I make it (back onto the Tour full-time).\n“If I don’t make it, I’m not playing golf anymore.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T08:31:23.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
