They came out of buses and waved Serbian flags.\n“We wanted to have a peaceful rally, and the regime had banned it without any reason,” Seselj told reporters.\nBut as he was leaving supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) arrived and held a banner reading “Seselj is a war criminal,” sparking skirmishes.\nSeselj founded the Serbian Radical Party and was deputy prime minister under Slobodan Milosevic during the wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s in which more than 100,000 people were killed.\nBoth the LDP and the Serbian Radical Party are opposition groups in Serbia.\nReporting by Marko Djurica; Writing by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T14:14:22.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
