The 10-year yield retreated below 3 percent on buying from investors attracted to those yield levels.\nAt 10:35 a.m. (1435 GMT), the 10-year Treasury yield was 2.976 percent, up 4 basis points from late on Monday. The share of investors who said on Monday they were “short,” or holding fewer Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, decreased to 28 percent from 36 percent a week earlier.\nThe share of investors who said they were “long” longer-dated Treasuries slipped to 19 percent from 21 percent the prior week.\nThe net shorts fell to 9 percent from 15 percent last week, marking the smallest difference between the shares of short and long investors since Sept. 18, JPMorgan said.\nThe share of investors who said they were neutral on longer-dated government debt grew to 53 percent from 43 percent, JPMorgan said.\nJPMorgan surveyed clients, including bond fund managers, central banks and sovereign wealth funds, as well as market makers and hedge funds.
