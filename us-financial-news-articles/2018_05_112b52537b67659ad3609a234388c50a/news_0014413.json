Gates has shared his love for \"Enlightenment Now\" before. In a post on his blog , he called the Harvard psychology professor's work his new favorite book of all time. \"The world is getting better, even if it doesn't always feel that way. I'm glad we have brilliant thinkers like Steven Pinker to help us see the big picture,\" Gates writes.\nOn \"Squawk Box,\" Gates also recommends another of his current favorites , \" Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World — and Why Things Are Better Than You Think ,\" by Hans Rosling, a professor of global health .\n\"Factfulness\" explores why humans are consistently wrong about common problems facing the world. Instead of making decisions based off of facts and data, humans are largely influenced by unconscious biases. The silver lining is that the world is doing better than it may seem.\nThe book is \"very readable,\" Gates says. \"It talks about how the world has changed, and Hans shares how he had some misperceptions, that he didn't see all the progress. It taught you how to think about news and where we're going.\"\nGates and his wife Melinda first became fans of Rosling's in 2006, when he gave a viral TED Talk on the same topic. When the author passed away in 2017, the couple promised to carry on his final wish.\n\"He simply hoped that we would promise to keep spreading the message he was so passionate about: that the world is making progress, and that policy decisions should be grounded in data,\" Gates shares in a blog post dedicated to Rosling .\nDon't miss: Warren Buffett doesn't think college is necessary—here's how he learns\nLike this story?
