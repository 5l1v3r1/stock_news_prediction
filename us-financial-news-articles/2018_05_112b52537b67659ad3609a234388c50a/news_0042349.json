We are now looking to take this great track record on customer 'health' to the next level by industrialising our best practices in developing, implementing and managing a consistent and standardised Customer Success Management framework right across the group.\"\nSteven spent the first 27 years of his career with the Barclays group, of which the first half was spent in the U.K. learning retail banking and the second half as a COO in a number of emerging market countries. During this time, he first became a client of ActiveOps as COO in Botswana and then again in their Egypt business.\nFrom there he has undertaken further COO roles for 2 banking groups in the Middle East, before becoming a client of ActiveOps again at Allied Irish Banks where he was Customer Services Director and led their award-winning Operations Transformation Programme, in which ActiveOps played a key role.
