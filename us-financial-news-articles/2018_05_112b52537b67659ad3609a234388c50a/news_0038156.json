We are convinced that Tom brings the exact skill set and experience we need to lead our operations, and are proud to name him our Chief Operating Officer,\" said Daryl Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Tom's strong leadership in FVS over the past year, combined with his prior experience at Smeal and Oshkosh, makes him the ideal person to head up operational leadership across our organization, bringing increased agility to our senior leadership team.
