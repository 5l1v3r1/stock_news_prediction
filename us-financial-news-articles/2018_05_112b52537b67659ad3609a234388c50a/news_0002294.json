Official figures show the overall value of food imports fell by just 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier, while the value of cereal and milk imports rose.\n\"Algeria has all the tools needed to promote production,\" said an economics professor at Algiers university, asking not to be identified. \"But, as usual, the implementation will take time because of bureaucracy.\"\nNevertheless, farmers are responding to the government push.\nMohamed Amine Abid, who breeds dairy cattle, has increased his herd to 70 cows from 40 since starting up in 2013, helped by state aid that included an extra piece of land.\n\"Our objective is to develop the Algerian cow. We want it to be born in and raised in Algeria to get used to our climate,\" he said.\nThe state budget is still stretched, even as oil prices have been recovering, so some government initiatives have been scrapped. But Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said agriculture spending, worth about $2 billion this year, would not be cut in 2019.\nHowever, analysts say providing aid is not sufficient to achieve the government's goal of increasing agriculture's share of economic output from 12 percent now, as long as youths are losing interest in the land and looking elsewhere for jobs.\n\"We need to win the food security battle,\" said 50-year-old farmer Ahmed Moussaoui.
