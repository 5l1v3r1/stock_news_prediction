GLOBAL RISKS\nThe central bank was monitoring the risks of higher international interest rates and risk premiums, which could increase funding costs for banks and ramp up borrowing costs, putting pressure both on banks and their customers.\nOrr referred to Tuesday’s jump in Italian bond yields as an example of sudden changes in market conditions.\n“You’ve seen as recently as last week no one could ask us a question about the Italian bonds market, that’s how quickly these things can arise,” he told reporters.\n“We are in a solid place. Does that mean that these events won’t happen? No.”\nHe said New Zealand banks had increased the share of domestic deposits and longer-term borrowing in their funding, thereby reducing their reliance on short-term offshore borrowing.\nThe New Zealand dollar was largely steady in local trade on Wednesday, stuck in a narrow range near $0.69 after having fallen more than 0.5 percent overnight on depressed global risk sentiment. MORTGAGE RULES REMAIN\nAt the previous review in November, the RBNZ said it would partially unwind loan-to-value ratios (LVR) restrictions to offset the impact of planned government curbs on the housing market.\nThe central bank noted that lending and house price growth had slowed in the past year, but said it needed further evidence of a cooling before loosening rules further.\nOrr told reporters any changes are unlikely until “at least” the next review in six months time.\nSome economists had thought that the central bank might ease the restrictions further.\n“They could have easily tweaked them again but ... they’re taking a very cautious approach there, they’re still worried about the potential for the market to take off again,” said Philip Borkin, senior economist at ANZ Bank.\nPrices have recently cooled, slowed by an uncertain election period in 2017, the LVR restrictions and wider taxes on investment properties announced by the government.
