He has held down a regular place in the face of intense competition at City, whose manager Pep Guardiola has played a major part in his development.\nAlways extravagantly gifted with the ball, Sterling has added more strength and thought to his play to become one of the English game’s most versatile performers.\nThe problem for England manager Gareth Southgate is where to play him because he has proved just as effective as a support striker as he has out wide.\nThe only thing missing from Sterling’s game is goals at international level — just two in 37 appearances. He has not scored for England since a Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia in 2015 and though his finishing has improved at City, he is still often wayward.\nBut he has a good understanding with England’s main striker Harry Kane, with whom he played at under-21 level, and the World Cup could provide him with the perfect stage.\nReporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:23:20.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
