Ormat’s Viridity Energy Solutions, Inc., remains on track to start construction of two 20MW/20MWh utility scale, in-front-of-the-meter battery energy storage systems (BESS) located in Plumsted Township and Alpha, New Jersey; Ormat closed the acquisition of U.S. Geothermal, Inc. (USG) which became an indirect subsidiary of Ormat and Ormat indirectly acquired the interests held by USG and its subsidiaries in, among other assets, three power plants at Neal Hot Springs, Oregon, San Emidio, Nevada and Raft River, Idaho with a total net generating capacity of approximately 38 MW, which will be fully integrated into Ormat electricity segment; Signed a finance agreement with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), United States government’s development finance institution, to provide an approximately $125.0 million loan (on a non-recourse basis) for the 35 MW Platanares geothermal power plant in Honduras; On May 3, 2018, the Kilauea volcano located in close proximity to our Puna geothermal power plant in Hawaii erupted. Necessary steps to secure the Puna facilities, including, among others, taking electricity generation offline, were taken. The impact of the volcanic eruption is still under assessment and may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n3 The Product segment backlog includes revenues for the period between April 1, 2018 and May 7, 2018. The increase in the backlog is compared with the Backlog of $243 million as of February 26, 2018.\n“This was a milestone quarter for Ormat, as we closed the acquisition of U.S. Geothermal, which broadens and diversifies our operations in the United States, expanding our presence into Idaho and Oregon and gives us additional opportunities to strengthen our development pipeline,” commented Isaac Angel, Chief Executive Officer. “The implementation of our growth plan combined with the efforts to improve efficiency and resource performance at our plants continues to drive enhanced financial performance. We had record results in the Electricity segment with 14.4% increase in revenues and 3.7% improvement in the segment’s gross margin, reaching 44.5% margin. This performance helped to largely offset the expected decline in revenue related to our products segment, ultimately driving a 7.2% increase in our Adjusted EBITDA to a quarterly record of $98.4 million. With the contribution of USG's 38 MW operating portfolio and the completion of the 4 MW enhancement at our Brady project, we increased our generation portfolio to approximately 837 MW and we are on track to achieve our growth target of between 186 MW and 196 MW by the end of 2020.”\nMr. Angel added, “I am encouraged with the increase in our product segment backlog. This $281.0 million backlog secures revenues for our product segment in 2019. We are also seeing progress in our energy storage initiatives. We remain on track to start construction of two 20MW/20MWh utility scale, in-front-of-the-meter battery energy storage systems (BESS) located in New Jersey. We continue to view energy storage, and our differentiated Battery Storage as a Service (BSAAS) offering as a long-term growth opportunity for Ormat, helping to further solidify our position as a leader in the broader renewable energy sector.”\nGUIDANCE\nMr. Angel added, “We update our full-year 2018 guidance to include the financial contribution of U.S. Geothermal’s assets and now expect total revenues between $711.0 million and $735.0 million with electricity segment revenues between $523.0 million and $533.0 million and product segment revenues between $180.0 million and $190.0 million. Revenues from energy storage and demand response activity are expected to be between $8.0 million and $12.0 million. We expect 2018 Adjusted EBITDA between $368.0 million and $378.0 million for the full year. We expect annual Adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest to be approximately $28.0 million.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total revenues were $184.0 million, down 3.1% compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Electricity segment revenues increased 14.4% to $132.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up from $115.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Product segment revenues decreased 34.3% to $48.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $74.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Other revenue, representing the contribution of Ormat’s energy storage initiatives, were $3.0 million in the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $13.8 million, or 7.5% of total revenues, compared to $9.9 million, or 5.2% of total revenues, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to general and administrative expenses from Viridity which was acquired on March 15, 2017; and an increase of approximately $2.0 million in costs associated with our tax material weakness that was identified in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the additional work and controls to compensate for that material weakness.\nThe Income tax benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $2.1 million compared to income tax provision of $10.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Due to the continuous evolution of the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" signed into law on December 22, 2017, certain estimates, as defined by Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (\"SAB 118\"), were refined and will continue to be refined pursuant to potential legislative amendments and interpretations of the new law as they become available. As a result of amendments and interpretations during 2018, the Company recorded a tax benefits of $20.3 million for the reduction of the valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits.\nThe company reported net income attributable to the company’s shareholders of $44.7 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to the company’s shareholders of $35.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, for the year ago period.\nAdjusted net income attributable to the company's shareholders of $24.4 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $35.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017; Adjusted Net income attributable to the Company’s stockholders and diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2018 excludes the $20.3 million tax benefits mentioned above.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $98.4 million, compared to $91.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 7.2%. The reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below in this release.\nDIVIDEND\nOn May 7, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and authorized payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share pursuant to the company’s dividend policy. The dividend will be paid on May 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 21, 2018. In addition, the company expects to pay quarterly dividends of $0.10 per share in the next two quarters.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nOrmat will host a conference call to discuss its financial results and other matters discussed in this press release on Tuesday, May 8, at 9 a.m. ET.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nFor the Three-Month Periods Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n(Unaudited)\nWe calculate EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) termination fees, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets, (iii) write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities, (iv) any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, (v) merger and acquisition transaction costs, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) gain from extinguishment of liability, and (viii) gain on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net earnings as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a Company’s ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31 2018 2017 (in thousands) Net income $ 49,435 $ 39,735 Adjusted for: Interest expense, net (including amortization of deferred financing costs) 14,231 14,679 Income tax provision (2,121 ) 10,886 Adjustment to investment in uncosolidated company: Our proportionate share in interest, tax and depreciation and amortization 3,530 — Depreciation and amortization 29,437 25,542 EBITDA $ 94,512 $ 90,842 Mark-to-market on derivatives instruments 962 (1,523 ) Stock-based compensation 1,707 1,713 Merger and acquisition transaction cost 1,095 800 Write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities 123 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 98,399 $ 91,832\nOrmat Technologies Contact:\nSmadar Lavi\nVP Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations\n775-356-9029 (ext. 65726)\nslavi@ormat.com Investor Relations Agency Contact:\nRob Fink\nHayden - IR\n646-415-8972\nrob@haydenir.com\nSource:Ormat Technologies, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f969930c-fa44-44e7-a435-fa0434127fd8", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bb1NPsA4K__wnTe_S6shYoECsfCo2znHAv1EKQsSS8C7F_EIHf2PjiTvEe3dpA2saHKA7Q4fHJY94saApzvAtB7Qx9CcR4NnQjrJ7V7JCKtwMz1vZsshmGfceMJxqZ8n"], "published": "2018-05-08T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:45:09.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
