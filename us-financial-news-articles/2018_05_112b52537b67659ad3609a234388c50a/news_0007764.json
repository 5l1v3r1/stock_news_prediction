(“BBSI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:BBSI), a leading provider of business management solutions, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter\nNet revenues up 7% to $224.0 million.\nGross billings up 10% to $1.3 billion.\nNet loss of $9.1 million, or $(1.25) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11.2 million, or $(1.55) per diluted share.\n“We continue to evolve our value proposition in support of the small business owner, and we are seeing validation of those efforts both through client referrals and expanded referral channels,” said Michael Elich, president and CEO of BBSI. “As evidence of this, we added 152 net new clients in the quarter.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenues in the first quarter of 2018 increased 7% to $224.0 million compared to $210.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal gross billings in the first quarter increased 10% to $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the same year-ago quarter (see “Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below). The increase was primarily due to the continued build in the Company’s PEO client count and same-customer sales growth, which was partially offset by a decrease in staffing revenue.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.1 million, or $(1.25) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11.2 million, or $(1.55) per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. The Company historically incurs losses in the first quarter due to the higher effective payroll taxes at the beginning of each year.\nOutlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company continues to expect diluted earnings per share to be approximately $4.45. This continues to assume approximately $0.06 per diluted share in estimated legal costs associated with accounting and securities law issues, as well as an effective tax rate of approximately 20%.\nBBSI continues to expect gross billings growth for the next rolling 12-month period to be approximately 14%.\nConference Call\nBBSI will conduct a conference call tomorrow, May 2, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Pacific time) to discuss its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.

However, management believes that gross billing amounts and wages are useful in understanding the volume of our business activity and serve as an important performance metric in managing our operations, including the preparation of internal operating forecasts and establishing executive compensation performance goals. We therefore present for purposes of analysis gross billing and wage information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Gross Billings $ 1,319,844 $ 1,199,549 PEO and staffing wages $ 1,114,707 $ 1,011,690 Because safety incentives represent consideration payable to PEO customers, safety incentive costs are netted against PEO revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Management considers safety incentives to be an integral part of our workers’ compensation program because they encourage client companies to maintain safe-work practices and minimize workplace injuries. We therefore present below for purposes of analysis non-GAAP gross workers’ compensation expense, which represents workers’ compensation costs including safety incentive costs. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful in evaluating the total costs of our workers’ compensation program.\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Workers' compensation $ 57,121 $ 55,437 Safety incentive costs 7,565 6,572 Non-GAAP gross workers' compensation $ 64,686 $ 62,009 In monitoring and evaluating the performance of our operations, management also reviews the following ratios, which represent selected amounts as a percentage of gross billings. Management believes these ratios are useful in understanding the efficiency and profitability of our service offerings.\n(Unaudited) Percentage of Gross Billings Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 PEO and staffing wages 84.5% 84.3% Payroll taxes and benefits 9.4% 9.6% Non-GAAP gross workers' compensation 4.9% 5.2% About BBSI\nBBSI (NASDAQ:BBSI) is a leading provider of business management solutions, combining human resource outsourcing and professional management consulting to create a unique operational platform that differentiates it from competitors.
