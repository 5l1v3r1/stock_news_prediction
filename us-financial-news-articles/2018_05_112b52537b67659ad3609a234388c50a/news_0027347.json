REUTERS/Samrang Pring The decision comes amid growing concern about a crackdown on his critics by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for 33 years, ahead of a general election set for July 29.\n“The Appeal Court decides to uphold the Phnom Penh Municipal Court’s decision...and continues to detain the 11 individuals,” Judge Plang Samnang said, without giving a reason.\nMembers of the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) travel in a police vehicle on their way to attend a verdict announcement at the appeal court in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, May 10, 2018.
