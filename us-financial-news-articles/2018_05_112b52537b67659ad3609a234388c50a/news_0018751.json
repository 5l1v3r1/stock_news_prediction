(\"B&W\") (NYSE: BW) announced today first quarter 2018 revenues of $311.4 million, a decrease of $79.7 million, or 20%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. GAAP earnings per share in first quarter 2018 were a loss of $2.73 compared to a loss per share of $0.14 in first quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings per share were a loss of $2.19 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to an adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 in the prior-year period. GAAP net loss in first quarter 2018 was $120.3 million compared to $6.8 million in first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $61.6 million compared to positive $8.4 million in the prior year period. A reconciliation of historical non-GAAP results is provided in the exhibits to this release.\n“Performance in our Power and Industrial segments was generally in line with our expectations in first quarter. However, the performance in these segments was overshadowed by the previously announced cost increases on our B&W Vølund new-build contracts,\" said Leslie C. Kass, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are making progress toward completion at each of our Renewable new-build project sites and are seeking potential recoveries to mitigate losses. In Power, we had strong bookings, and Industrial profitability is beginning to improve.\n“With the support of our shareholders, we raised $248.5 million through the recently completed rights offering, allowing us to repay our second-lien term loan, which combined with the potential sales of MEGTEC and Universal, puts us on a path to having a much-improved balance sheet. All of the members of the management team, including the recently appointed Chief Implementation Officer, are driving efficiencies and cost reductions throughout the organization in an effort to produce improved financial results while maintaining our ability to continue serving our customers with high-quality and reliable engineered equipment, parts, and services.”\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated revenues in first quarter 2018 were $311.4 million, a decrease of $79.7 million compared to $391.1 million in first quarter 2017, as modestly higher revenue in the Industrial segment was offset by lower revenue in the Renewable and Power segments. The GAAP operating loss in first quarter 2018 was $102.7 million compared to an operating loss of $13.0 million in first quarter 2017. The adjusted operating loss in first quarter 2018 was $77.0 million, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.0 million in first quarter 2017, due mainly to a higher level of charges on contracts within the Renewable segment compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $61.6 million compared to positive $8.4 million in the prior year period.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues for the Power segment decreased 18.9% to $159.1 million compared to $196.3 million in the prior year period. Revenues decreased mainly as the result of reduced levels of work on new-build and environmental contracts, partially mitigated by a modest increase in retrofit services contracts. Gross profit in the Power segment in first quarter 2018 was $30.9 million, compared to $37.7 million in the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 19.4%, compared to 19.2% last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the Power segment in first quarter 2018 was $11.2 million, compared to $17.4 million in last year's quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.1% compared to 8.9% last year, as the impact of lower volume was mitigated by solid execution and benefits from cost savings initiatives implemented over the past year.\nIn first quarter 2018, the Company sold all of its joint venture interest in Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Company, Ltd. (BWBC), its Chinese joint venture company, for approximately $21 million, in addition to the $41 million dividend (net of taxes) received from BWBC in fourth quarter 2017. The Company will continue a relationship with BWBC through an expanded technology license. Also, the Company recognized an $18.4 million other-than-temporary-impairment based on a preliminary agreement to sell its investment in Thermax Babcock & Wilcox Energy Solutions Private Limited (TBWES), its Indian joint venture. The actions to sell interests in both of its Asian joint ventures is consistent with the Company's strategy to shift its focus more toward aftermarket parts and service and retrofit opportunities in the coal-fired power market and away from large international new-build projects and to monetize non-core assets.\nIndustrial segment revenues increased 2.9% to $94.9 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $92.2 million in first quarter 2017, as growth at MEGTEC was partially offset by a small decline at Universal and lower volumes at SPIG, where the Company implemented a new business model in second half 2017. Gross profit in the Industrial segment was $11.3 million in first quarter 2018, compared to $15.3 million in the prior-year period. Gross profit margin was 11.9%, compared to 16.6% last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $(3.4) million compared to $0.5 million last year mainly due to a lower contribution from SPIG as the result of lower profitability on certain cooling systems projects.\nRevenues in the Renewable segment were $60.0 million for first quarter 2018, compared to $105.5 million in first quarter 2017. The Renewable segment gross loss was $50.4 million in first quarter 2018, compared to gross profit of $10.6 million reported in first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was negative $61.7 million compared to positive $0.9 million last year, mainly due to increased estimated costs to complete Renewable new-build projects and a higher level of SG&A to support the completion of the projects.\nManagement has identified $52.6 million of additional estimated costs to complete its Renewable energy projects in Europe. The largest portion of these costs ($18.2 million) is related to the project with the previously announced steel beam failure due to additional costs following a joint venture partner entering administration in the United Kingdom and delays in receiving regulatory releases (received in April 2018) to conduct repairs on the failed beam. The remainder of the increased costs was related to schedule delays, claim settlements and other costs associated with the other loss projects.\nStatus summary of Renewable loss projects\nThe first project, a waste-to-energy plant in Denmark, was approximately 97% complete as of March 31, 2018. Construction is complete and turnover is expected to be complete in mid-2018. The second project, a biomass plant in the United Kingdom, was approximately 87% complete as of March 31, 2018. Commissioning activities began on the project in first quarter 2018 and turnover is expected to occur in mid-2018. The third project, a biomass plant in Denmark, was approximately 98% complete as of March 31. 2018. Construction activities are complete and partial takeover by the customer was achieved in March 2018, with the remainder of work expected to be complete during the plant's planned outage later in 2018. The fourth project, a biomass plant in the United Kingdom, was approximately 87% complete as of March 31, 2018. Commissioning began in first quarter 2018, and turnover is expected to occur in mid-2018. The fifth project, a biomass plant in the United Kingdom, was approximately 61% complete as of March 31, 2018. Construction activities are ongoing and are expected to be complete in late 2018 with turnover to customer in early 2019. The sixth project, a waste-to-energy plant in the United Kingdom, was approximately 83% complete as of March 31, 2018. Construction activities are ongoing and turnover is expected to occur in second half 2018.\nIn connection with the above-mentioned projects, B&W intends to not only seek insurance recoveries, but also additional relief from its customers and pursue other claims. However, there can be no assurance as to the amounts, if any, that B&W may recover. The $52.6 million of additional renewable project costs recognized in first quarter 2018 do not take into account any potential recoveries to mitigate these losses.\nBalance Sheet\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance, net of restricted cash, was $37.4 million at March 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company has $19.8 million from the sale of BWBC in its restricted cash balance, which was released in early May 2018. At March 31, 2018, outstanding balances under revolving credit facilities totaled $181.4 million; at May 8, 2018 the U.S. revolving credit facility balance was $142.0 million.\nOn April 30, 2018, the Company completed its previously announced rights offering raising gross proceeds of $248.5 million. The Company used $214.9 million of the net proceeds to repay all of the indebtedness and other obligations under its former second-lien term loan and will use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital purposes.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company is reaffirming its prior consolidated 2018 guidance as follows:\nRevenue in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $20 million to $40 million (1)\n(1) As more fully described in Exhibit 2, management is unable to reconcile without unreasonable effort the Company's forecasted range of adjusted EBITDA for the full year to a comparable GAAP range. The Company is also reconfirming its prior 2018 revenue and gross margin guidance by segment (2) :\nPower: revenue down 5% to flat compared to 2017; gross margin approximately 20% Renewable: no guidance Industrial: revenue up 14% to 19% compared to 2017; gross margin approaching 20%\n(2) Segment gross margin guidance is presented reflecting the adoption of FASB ASU 2017-07. The new guidance classifies service cost as the only component of net periodic benefit cost presented in cost of operations, whereas the other components will be presented in other income. Upon adoption, this affected not only how we present net periodic benefit cost, but also Power segment gross profit. We adopted the new accounting standard retrospectively as of January 1, 2018. The changes in the classification of the historical components of net periodic benefit costs from operating expense to other expense for the first quarter 2017 amounted to $4.2 million and are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For a reconciliation of changes in the classification of the historical components of net periodic benefit cost please see the appendix in the May 2018 Company Overview Presentation which can be located on the investors page of our website at www.babcock.com , and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC.\nConference Call to Discuss First Quarter 2018 Results\nDate:\nTuesday, May 8, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EST Live Webcast:\nInvestor Relations section of website at www.babcock.com\nForward-Looking Statements\nB&W cautions that this release contains , including, without limitation, statements relating to our strategic objectives; our business execution model; management’s expectations regarding the industries in which we operate; our guidance and forecasts; our projected operating margin improvements, savings and restructuring costs; covenant compliance; and project execution.

(2) EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The amounts included in Adjusted EBITDA however, are derived from amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net earnings (loss), operating profit (loss) or operating cash flows. B&W has presented EBITDA as it is regularly used by many of our investors and is presented as a convenience to them. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in this calculation however, differs from the EBITDA calculation used to compute our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined by our Amended Credit Agreement. (3) Power adjusted EBITDA includes pension benefit, excluding MTM adjustments of $6.8 million, $5.2 million, $5.0 million, $5.0 million and $5.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. 2018 Outlook\nManagement has provided full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $20 million to $40 million. It is not possible for B&W to identify the amount or significance of future adjustments associated with potential mark to market adjustments to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities or other non-routine costs that we adjust in our presentation of adjusted EBITDA. These items are dependent on future events and/or market inputs that are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile without unreasonable effort its forecasted range of adjusted EBITDA for the full year included in the 2018 Guidance section of this overview to a comparable GAAP range. However, items excluded from adjusted EBITDA guidance include the historical adjustments previously disclosed such as interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and spin costs, acquisition and integration costs, financial advisory services, gains or losses on asset sales, including any related expenses, goodwill and other asset impairments, litigation settlements and mark-to-market adjustments of pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities. B&W’s full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance also excludes the following estimable adjusting items: $49.2 million loss on extinguishment of second lien debt, spin and restructuring costs of approximately $8.8 million, financial advisory services costs of approximately $9.4 million, the gain on the sale of BWBC (a former Chinese joint venture) of $6.5 million, other than temporary impairment of equity method investment in TBWES impairment of $18.4 million and additional acquisition integration costs of less than $1 million.\nExhibit 3\nBabcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (1)\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nThree Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018 2017 Revenues $ 311.4 $ 391.1 Costs and expenses: Cost of operations 322.0 332.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 71.9 66.9 Restructuring activities and spin-off transaction costs 6.9 3.0 Research and development costs 1.5 2.3 Total costs and expenses 402.3 404.7 Equity in income and impairment of investees (11.8 ) 0.6 Operating loss (102.7 ) (13.0 ) Other income (expense): Interest income 0.2 0.1 Interest expense (13.5 ) (1.8 ) Benefit plans, net 7.0 4.2 Other – net 2.8 (0.4 ) Total other income (expense) (3.5 ) 2.1 Loss before income tax expense (106.3 ) (10.9 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 14.1 (4.0 ) Net loss (120.4 ) (6.9 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Net loss attributable to shareholders $ (120.5 ) $ (7.1 ) Basic loss per share $ (2.73 ) $ (0.14 ) Diluted loss per share $ (2.73 ) $ (0.14 ) Shares used in the computation of earnings per share: Basic 44.2 48.7 Diluted 44.2 48.7 (1) Figures may not be clerically accurate due to rounding.
