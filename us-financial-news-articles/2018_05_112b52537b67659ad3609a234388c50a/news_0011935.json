Organic Net Sales decreased 1.5 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 1.0 percentage points, driven by price increases in the United States and Rest of World markets. Volume/mix decreased 2.5 percentage points, primarily driven by lower shipments in the United States and Rest of World markets that more than offset solid retail growth in Canada and EMEA (3) as well as foodservice gains in the United States and EMEA.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders increased to $1.0 billion and diluted EPS increased to $0.81, primarily reflecting benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2.6 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.8 billion, including a favorable 0.9 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, the decline in Adjusted EBITDA reflected higher input costs, lower volume/mix and investments in strategic initiatives. Adjusted EPS increased 6.0 percent to $0.89, mainly reflecting lower taxes versus the prior year period.\nQ1 2018 Business Segment Highlights\nUnited States\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change March 31, April 1, Impact of 2018 2017 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 4,368 $ 4,518 (3.3 )% 0.0 pp (3.3 )% Segment Adjusted EBITDA 1,382 1,464 (5.6 )% 0.0 pp United States net sales were $4.4 billion, down 3.3 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing increased 0.8 percentage points as higher pricing was partially offset by the timing of trade spending versus the prior year period. Volume/mix decreased 4.1 percentage points as solid gains in foodservice and a favorable shift in Easter-related sales was more than offset by lower shipments of nuts, cold cuts, frozen potatoes and parts of the cheese business.\nUnited States Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5.6 percent versus the year-ago period to $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting lower volume/mix, non-key commodity (2) inflation and investments to enhance capabilities that were partially offset by gains from productivity and pricing.\nCanada\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change March 31, April 1, Impact of 2018 2017 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 484 $ 440 9.8 % 4.8 pp 5.0 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 134 125 7.1 % 4.4 pp Canada net sales were $484 million, up 9.8 percent versus the year-ago period, including a favorable 4.8 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 5.0 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing was neutral with the prior year period as higher pricing in several categories was offset by lower pricing in cheese. Volume/mix increased 5.0 percentage points reflecting earlier implementation of go-to-market agreements with key retailers that primarily benefited cheese and coffee sales.\nCanada Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.1 percent versus the year-ago period to $134 million, including a favorable 4.4 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.7 percent, primarily driven by volume/mix growth that was partially offset by higher input costs.\nEMEA (3)\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change March 31, April 1, Impact of 2018 2017 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 685 $ 597 14.7 % 12.4 pp 2.3 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 182 140 30.4 % 14.7 pp EMEA net sales were $685 million, up 14.7 percent versus the year-ago period, including a 12.4 percentage point benefit from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 2.3 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing declined 0.5 percentage points, driven by increased promotional activity in infant nutrition, primarily in Italy. Volume/mix increased 2.8 percentage points, reflecting a strong soup season in the UK and growth in condiments and sauces, as well as gains in foodservice.\nEMEA Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 30.4 percent versus the year-ago period to $182 million, including a positive 14.7 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding currency impacts, the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflected gains from productivity, pension and postretirement cost favorability versus the prior year period, as well as volume/mix growth that was partially offset by lower pricing.\nRest of World (3)(4)\nFor the Quarter Ended Year-over-year Change March 31, April 1, Impact of 2018 2017 Actual Currency Organic (in millions) Net sales $ 767 $ 769 (0.2 )% (3.2) pp 3.0 % Segment Adjusted EBITDA 143 144 (0.7 )% (5.6) pp Rest of World net sales were $767 million, 0.2 percent lower than the year-ago period, including a negative 3.2 percentage point impact from currency. Organic Net Sales increased 3.0 percent versus the year-ago period. Pricing was up 4.3 percentage points, primarily driven by actions to offset higher input costs in local currency, particularly in Latin America. Volume/mix decreased 1.3 percentage points, driven by a combination of unfavorable impacts from distributor network realignment in select markets and lower shipments in Indonesia and Brazil that was partially offset by growth in Australia.\nRest of World Segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.7 percent versus the year-ago period to $143 million, including an unfavorable 5.6 percentage point impact from currency. Excluding the impact of currency, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.9 percentage points as Organic Net Sales gains were partially offset by higher input costs in local currency.\nEnd Notes\n(1) Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non- .

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company's plans, expectations, investments, innovations, opportunities, capabilities, execution and growth. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks difficult to predict and beyond the Company's control.\nImportant factors that may affect the Company's business and operations and that may cause actual results to those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, operating in a highly competitive industry; changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers; the Company’s ability to maintain, extend and expand its reputation and brand image; the impacts of the Company’s international operations; the Company’s ability to leverage its brand value; the Company’s ability to predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand; the Company’s ability to drive revenue growth in its key product categories, increase its market share, or add products; an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets; volatility in commodity, energy and other input costs; changes in the Company’s management team or other key personnel; the Company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its cost savings initiatives; changes in relationships with significant customers and suppliers; the execution of the Company’s international expansion strategy; tax law changes or interpretations; legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions; product recalls or product liability claims; unanticipated business disruptions; the Company’s ability to complete or realize the benefits from potential and completed acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures; economic and political conditions in the United States and in various other nations in which we operate; the volatility of capital markets; increased pension, labor and people-related expenses; volatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use; exchange rate fluctuations; risks associated with information technology and systems, including service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security; the Company’s ability to protect intellectual property rights; impacts of natural events in the locations in which we or the Company’s customers, suppliers or regulators operate; the Company’s indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness; the Company’s ownership structure; the impact of future sales of its common stock in the public markets; the Company’s ability to continue to pay a regular dividend; changes in laws and regulations; restatements of the Company’s consolidated financial statements; and other factors.

The Company disclaims and does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this press release, except as required by applicable law or regulation.\nTo supplement the financial information, the Company has presented Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, which are considered non- . The non- provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) that are presented in this press release. The non- presented may differ from similarly titled non- presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non- in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable , such as net sales, net income/(loss), diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non- .\nManagement uses these non- to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting the Company's non- is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non- , when considered together with the corresponding and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of acquisitions, currency, divestitures and a 53rd week of shipments. The Company calculates the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following the Company's June 28, 2015 currency devaluation, for which the Company calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, other expense/(income), net, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization (excluding integration and restructuring expenses); in addition to these adjustments, the Company excludes, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and equity award compensation expense (excluding integration and restructuring expenses). The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis. The Company calculates the impact of currency on Adjusted EBITDA by holding exchange rates constant at the previous year's exchange rate, with the exception of Venezuela following the Company's June 28, 2015 devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and remeasurement of assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary, for which it calculates the previous year's results using the current year's exchange rate. Adjusted EBITDA and Constant Currency Adjusted EBITDA are tools that can assist management and investors in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.\nAdjusted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share excluding, when they occur, the impacts of integration and restructuring expenses, merger costs, unrealized losses/(gains) on commodity hedges, impairment losses, losses/(gains) on the sale of a business, nonmonetary currency devaluation (e.g., remeasurement gains and losses), and U.S. Tax Reform, and including when they occur, adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividend payments on an accrual basis. The Company believes Adjusted EPS provides important comparability of underlying operating results, allowing investors and management to assess operating performance on a consistent basis.\nSee the attached schedules for supplemental financial data, which includes the financial information, the non- and corresponding reconciliations to the comparable for the relevant periods.\nSchedule 1\nThe Kraft Heinz Company Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) For the Quarter Ended March 31, April 1, 2018 2017 Net sales $ 6,304 $ 6,324 Cost of products sold (a) 4,059 4,125 Gross profit 2,245 2,199 Selling, general and administrative expenses (b) 764 766 Operating income 1,481 1,433 Interest expense 317 313 Other expense/(income), net (c) (90 ) (130 ) Income/(loss) before income taxes 1,254 1,250 Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes 261 359 Net income/(loss) 993 891 Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest — (2 ) Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders $ 993 $ 893 Basic shares outstanding 1,219 1,217 Diluted shares outstanding 1,228 1,229 Per share data applicable to common shareholders: Basic earnings/(loss) per share $ 0.81 $ 0.73 Diluted earnings/(loss) per share 0.81 0.73 (a) Integration and restructuring expenses recorded in cost of products sold were $76 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 ($61 million after-tax) and $96 million for the quarter ended April 1, 2017 ($66 million after-tax).
