His net worth is around $74 billion (according to Forbes ), which means he's amassed an average of $5.97 million per day. That's second only to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose approximate $132 billion fortune averages out to about $6.8 million each day of his life.\nOther tech entrepreneurs, like M co-founder Bill Gates , also started their careers young — Gates was the youngest billionaire ever in 1987, when he earned his first billion at age 31 . But as he has aged, Gates has turned his attention to philanthropy — now, at age 62, Gates's lifetime average comes out to just about $4 million per day. Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett , who has pledged much of his fortune to Gates' foundation , nets about $2.7 million a day at the age of 87.\nZuckerberg, too, has turned much of his Facebook fortune to other causes in recent years. He has sold about $3.38 billion of Facebook stock over the past six months, according to FactSet, mostly to put toward the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which invests in a broad range of causes including education, health care, affordable housing, immigration reform and criminal justice reform .\nZuckerberg said in September he would sell as many as 75 million Facebook shares ( then worth $12.8 billion ) for CZI over the following 18 months.\nDespite scrutiny on Facebook's business practices, shares have risen 6 percent so far this year, more than Google.\n— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Mark Zuckerberg's 2004 CNBC interview shows how far he and Facebook have come show chapters Mark Zuckerberg's 2004 CNBC interview shows how far he and Facebook have come 9:09 AM ET Tue, 17 April 2018 | 03:33", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:15:58.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
