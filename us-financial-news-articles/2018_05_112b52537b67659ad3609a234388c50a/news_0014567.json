(NASDAQ:BCRX) announced today financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are off to a strong start in 2018 as we continue to make progress advancing all our HAE development programs and remain on track to read out top line data from APeX-2 in the first half of next year,” said Jon P. Stonehouse, BioCryst’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We remain excited about our proposed merger with Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which we believe will create greater and more sustainable value for the benefit of our stockholders and our patients. We look forward to positive data readouts from Idera in early June, which would reinforce the value creation potential in combining our synergistic discovery engines and creating a more robust and diversified late-stage pipeline.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, total revenues were $4.0 million, compared to $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenue was primarily associated with infrequent revenue events that occurred in 2017 that did not recur in 2018. Those 2017 events were the recognition of $4.1 million of royalty revenue from Japanese government stockpiling of RAPIACTA ® and a $2.0 million payment for the Canadian regulatory approval of RAPIVAB ® .\nResearch and Development (“R&D”) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $18.4 million from $16.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to additions in R&D personnel and increased spending on our hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) and preclinical programs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the Company’s peramivir and galidesivir development spending in 2018.\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $7.6 million, compared to $3.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to approximately $4.7 million of merger-related costs associated with the Company’s pending merger with Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Idera”).\nInterest expense was $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Also, a $1.8 million mark-to-market loss on the Company’s foreign currency hedge was recognized in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a $1.5 million mark-to-market loss in the first quarter of 2017. These changes result from periodic changes in the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to a net loss of $14.2 million, or $0.19 per share, for the first quarter 2017.\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $137.5 million at March 31, 2018, and reflect a decrease from $159.0 million at December 31, 2017. Net operating cash use for the first quarter 2018 was $22.9 million.\nClinical Development Update & Outlook\nOn February 28, 2018, BioCryst announced the dosing of the first patient in APeX-S, a long-term safety trial evaluating two dosage strengths of BCX7353 administered orally once-daily as a preventive treatment in patients with HAE. APeX-S is an open label two-arm trial to evaluate the safety of two dose levels of BCX7353 (110 mg once daily and 150 mg once daily) over 48 weeks in patients with Type I and II HAE. The trial will enroll approximately 160 patients.\nOn March 15, 2018, BioCryst announced the dosing of the first patient into APeX-2, a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating two dosage strengths of BCX7353 administered orally once-daily as a preventive treatment to reduce the frequency of attacks in patients with HAE. APeX-2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm trial testing two doses of BCX7353 (110 mg and 150 mg) for prevention of angioedema attacks. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 100 patients with Type I and II HAE in the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary efficacy endpoint of APeX-2 is the rate of angioedema attacks over 24 weeks of study drug administration.\nEnrollment in both the 750 mg and 500 mg cohorts of the ZENITH-1 proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial liquid formulation of BCX7353 for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in HAE have been completed, and the 250 mg cohort is enrolling. We expect to report top-line results from the first cohort in the second half of 2018.\nOn May 1, 2018, BioCryst announced that the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has approved peramivir with the brand name of ALPIVAB TM , a single intravenous infusion for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza in adults and children from the age of 2 years. The EMA approval of ALPIVAB under the centralized licensing procedure provides marketing authorization for all 28-member states of the European Union, Norway and Iceland.\nBioCryst has a license agreement with Seqirus regarding peramivir. As previously disclosed, BioCryst and Seqirus are engaged in a formal dispute resolution process involving many items under the contract including, but not limited to, the EMA approval milestone of $5 million, which BioCryst maintains is due.\nIn April 2018, the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved RAPIVAB (peramivir injection), an intravenous treatment for acute influenza, for commercial sale in Australia.\nFinancial Outlook for 2018\nBased upon development plans and awarded government contracts, on a stand-alone basis, BioCryst continues to expect its 2018 net operating cash use to be in the range of $67 to $90 million, and its 2018 operating expenses to be in the range of $85 to $110 million. With merger-related costs and the aggressive advancement of programs thus far, it is expected the Company will trend to the upper-end of both ranges. The Company’s operating expense range excludes equity-based compensation expense due to the difficulty in reliably projecting this expense, as it is impacted by the volatility and price of the Company’s stock, as well as by the vesting of the Company’s outstanding performance-based stock options.\nConference Call and Webcast\nBioCryst's leadership team will host a conference call and webcast Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these financial results and recent corporate developments.

BCX7353 has been generally safe and well tolerated in the Phase 2 APeX-1 clinical trial. BioCryst is currently conducting the Phase 3 APeX-2 clinical trial and the long-term safety APeX-S clinical trial, both evaluating two dosage strengths of BCX7353 administered orally once-daily as a preventive treatment to reduce the frequency of attacks in patients with HAE. BioCryst is also conducting the ZENITH-1 clinical trial. ZENITH-1 is a proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trial testing an oral liquid formulation of BCX7353 for the treatment of acute angioedema attacks.\nAbout BioCryst Pharmaceuticals\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals designs, optimizes and develops novel small-molecule medicines that address both common and rare conditions. BioCryst has several ongoing development programs including BCX7353, an oral treatment for hereditary angioedema, galidesivir, a potential treatment for filoviruses, and a preclinical program to develop oral Alk-2 inhibitors for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (“FOP”). RAPIVAB ® (peramivir injection), a viral neuraminidase inhibitor for the treatment of influenza, is BioCryst's first approved product and has received regulatory approval in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and the European Union. Post-marketing commitments for RAPIVAB are ongoing.
