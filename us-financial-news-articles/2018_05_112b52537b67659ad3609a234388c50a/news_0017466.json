These include halting Iran's ability to export its carpets and foods into the U.S., as well as ending certain licensing-related transactions.\nAt the end of the 180-day interval on Nov. 4, another set of sanctions will once again be clamped down on Iran: Sanctions on Iran's ports, as well as the country's shipping and shipping sectors Sanctions on buying petroleum and petrochemical products with a number of Iranian oil companies Sanctions on foreign financial institutions transacting with the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian financial institutions Sanctions on the provision of certain financial messaging services to Iran's central bank and other Iranian financial institutions Sanctions on the provision of underwriting services, insurance, or reinsurance Sanctions on Iran's energy sector\nThe following day, on Nov. 5, the Trump administration will disallow U.S.-owned foreign entities from being allowed to engage in certain transactions with Iran.
