Moreover, G100 is emerging as an exciting, active immunotherapeutic molecule with great potential,” said Carlos Paya, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Immune Design. “The continued progress in our programs increases our confidence in Immune Design’s strategies, differentiation and potential in an underserved immuno-oncology space.”\nRecent Highlights\nCMB305: novel prime-boost targeting NY-ESO-1 + cancers\n-- The higher dose of CMB305 (4x the vector component compared to earlier clinical studies) was found to be safe by a data monitoring committee and cleared to move forward into the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial in frontline maintenance in synovial sarcoma patients.\nG100: novel, synthetic TLR4 agonist for intratumoral therapy\n-- Updated data in follicular lymphoma patients show that a higher dose of G100 (20ug, 2x the dose studied in the ongoing randomized study with pembrolizumab) has increased activity, as defined by a two-fold increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) pre- vs. post-G100 treatment.\n-- Immune Design is planning to interact with the FDA regarding next steps for development of G100.\nFinancial Results\nFirst Quarter\nImmune Design ended the first quarter of 2018 with $131.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and other receivables compared to $144.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Net cash used in operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $16.4 million.\nNet loss and net loss per share for the first quarter of 2018 were $13.3 million and $0.28, respectively, compared to 12.6 million and $0.50, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.5 million and was primarily attributable to the Sanofi G103 HSV2 vaccine collaboration. Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $5.5 million and was primarily attributable to $5.2 million in collaboration revenue associated with the Sanofi G103 collaboration and $0.3 million in product sales to other third parties.\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $10.3 $14.0 million for the same period in 2017. The $3.7 million decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in contract manufacturing costs related both internal and collaboration programs. Offsetting this decrease was an increase of $1.1 million in personnel-related and other research and development expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $4.0 million, relatively consistent with general and administrative expenses of $4.1 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash Guidance\nBased on current expectations, Immune Design expects to have cash to fund operations into the second half of 2020.\nConference Call Information\nImmune Design will host a conference call and live audio webcast this afternoon at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss first quarter 2018 financial results and provide a corporate update.\nThe live call may be accessed by dialing 844-266-9538 for domestic callers and 216-562-0391 for international callers.
