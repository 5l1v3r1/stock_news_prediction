Its corporate and investment bank was a weak spot with revenue down 13.4 percent and net income falling 56.9 percent, impacted by a “strong negative forex effect”.\nIts equity trading also declined despite a broad improvement in this area across other international banks.\nSocGen said this “this lower performance in relation to the industry can be attributed to our business mix, which is more geared towards structured products, and our geographical mix, which is more focused on Europe”.\nFollowing the reshuffle, Severin Cabannes, previously in charge of control functions, will overview SocGen’s investment bank.\nUnder its new three-year plan, SocGen aims to improve the return on net equity at its investment banking arm to 14 percent from 10.8 percent it had in 2017, when revenues fell on the back of low market volatility.\nSocGen’s French retail banking revenues were on path to stabilisation, down 0.7 percent over the period. $1 = 0.8340 euros Reporting by Maya Nikolaeva and Matthieu Protard; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T08:23:30.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
