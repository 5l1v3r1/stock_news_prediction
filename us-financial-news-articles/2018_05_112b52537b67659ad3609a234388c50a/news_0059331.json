Until then, the court barred SGX from launching the proposed products.\n“SGX will contest the interim injunction and reserves all rights in respect of damages caused by IISL’s action,” the SGX said.\nIn the meanwhile, SGX said it will continue listing SGX Nifty contracts until August. NSE could not be immediately reached for comment.\nOver the past two decades, SGX has become the most popular market for foreign investors to bet on Indian equity indexes, with Nifty 50 futures tracking the NSE’s main index .\nBut NSE, BSE Ltd and Metropolitan Stock Exchange took steps to end licensing deals with foreign bourses to prevent the loss of trades to overseas rivals, after SGX moved to introduce trading in single-stock futures contracts.\nAccording to sources, the decision was endorsed by the Indian government, which is keen to draw investor interest to an international financial centre being developed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat.
