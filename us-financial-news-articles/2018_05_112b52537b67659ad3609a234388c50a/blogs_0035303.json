The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.\nUber has said it is cooperating with the NTSB in its investigation and has initiated a “top-to-bottom safety review” of its self-driving vehicles program. An Uber spokeswoman told Fortune earlier this month that the company has hired former NTSB Chair Christopher Hart to review and advise on its overall safety culture.\nThe permit follows the opening of Didi Labs , the company’s new research and development center in Mountain View, Calif. Didi has acquired, partnered, and invested in a number of companies outside of China. But the R&D center is its first physical office outside of China. The company doesn’t plan to open its ride-hailing service in the United States.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "published": "2018-05-14T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T21:02:32.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
