Under South Carolina law, a jury has to make a unanimous decision.\nChristopher Swett, a lawyer for the family of Boyd-Bostic, said in a statement that the plaintiffs would retry the case at the earliest opportunity.\n\"We continue to believe that the daily use of baby powder on Bertila from birth led to her death,\" Swett said.\nThe case also named as a defendant the U.S. unit of talc supplier Imerys SA, as well as a local unit of Rite Aid, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, which allegedly sold the baby powder used by the woman.\nGwen Myers, a spokeswoman for Imerys Talc America, said: \"We remain confident that talc does not cause cancer. Imerys follows all FDA and other regulatory guidelines and utilizes rigorous testing to ensure that our talc meets the highest quality standards. We continue to stand by the safety of our product.\"\nRite Aid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJ&J is battling some 9,000 cases claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer, but litigants have recently focused on claims based on alleged asbestos contamination.\nA California jury on Thursday awarded $25.7 million in damages to a woman and her husband over allegations that the company's baby powder had caused her mesothelioma.\nA New Jersey court jury in April ordered J&J and Imerys Talc America to pay $117 million to a man who alleged he developed mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure from talc-based products.\nThe company won the only other asbestos-related trial in November, when a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled in its favor.\n(Reporting by Tina Bellon, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Diane Craft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T03:54:09.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
