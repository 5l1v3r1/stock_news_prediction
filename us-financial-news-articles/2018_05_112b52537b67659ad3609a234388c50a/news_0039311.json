(TSX-V:ITM) (the “ Company” ) announces that the filing of its audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, including the related management discussion and analysis, and CEO and CFO certifications (collectively, the “ Annual Financial Filings” ) will be available on Monday, May 21 at the very latest.\nAs detailed in the press release dated April 5, 2018, the Company was unable to start the audit process in a timely manner due to the temporary absence of its Chief Financial Officer for reasons of force majeure. These difficulties delayed the start of the process of auditing the 2017 financial statements by several weeks.\nThe Company hereby announces that its auditors are currently in the process of finishing the preparation of the annual audited financial statements. The Company’s management is in regular contact with its auditors and it expects the statements to be available on Monday, May 21 at the very latest.\nThere have been no other changes otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to items (a) to (d) of Section 10 of National Policy 12-203.\nAbout Intema Solutions Inc.:\nIntema’s mission is to integrate technologies to marketing. The company develops technologies for marketing and services related to predictive marketing, relationship marketing, database marketing and Blockchain applications.

Such statements include those with respect to the date on which the audit of the Company’s 2017 financial statements will begin, the time that audit will take to complete, and the date that the Annual Filings will be filed. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurances that its expectations will be achieved. Such assumptions, which may prove incorrect, include the following: (i) the Company will succeed in retaining new auditors within a reasonable timeframe, (ii) the Company’s new auditors will begin their work forthwith, (iii) the audit of the Company’s 2017 financial statements will not take longer than has been customary, (iv) the auditors will be in a position to issue an auditor’s report without reservations upon the completion of their audit, and (v) the Company will be in a position to file the Annual Filings shortly after the audit is complete. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include (i) the inability of the Company to successfully retain new auditors for whatever reason, (ii) the inability of those auditors to begin or complete their audit in a reasonable timeframe, (iii) the inability of the auditors to issue an unqualified auditor’s report upon the completion of their audit and (iv) the Company’s inability to file the Annual Filings for whatever reason after the audit has been completed. These factors and others are more fully discussed in the Company’s filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities available at www.sedar.com . Actual results may vary from the forward-looking information.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180516006395/en/\nINTEMA:\nRoger Plourde, +1-514-861-1881\nPresident, Director and Chief Executive Officer\nrplourde@intema.com\nSource: Intema Solutions Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Feflyermaker.com%2F&esheet=51807921&newsitemid=20180516006395&lan=en-US&anchor=eflyermaker.com&index=2&md5=a99c564689b5bf0f23da036680f2dc4c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmatcheranalytics.com%2F&esheet=51807921&newsitemid=20180516006395&lan=en-US&anchor=matcheranalytics.com&index=3&md5=ba67c4b9dd8938861f7f78d418f9f5a8", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180516006395/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedar.com&esheet=51807921&newsitemid=20180516006395&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sedar.com&index=4&md5=4f9541f8184ea78590b84c0d6049b69d", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fintema.com%2F&esheet=51807921&newsitemid=20180516006395&lan=en-US&anchor=intema.com&index=1&md5=1669e58c0bf232f15db839f704069eb9"], "published": "2018-05-17T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:54:12.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
