I was looking for different things to keep my motivation going,” the 47-year-old told Reuters in a telephone interview on Tuesday.\n“I have so many wonderful memories. It was so amazing overall.\n“I had a putt on my last hole to shoot par. That would have been nice but I didn’t need to play the weekend.”\nTo this day she says she is remembered by people as much for that appearance as for the 59 she recorded at an LPGA event in Arizona in 2001.\nThese days, however, the conversation has changed from women competing against men, to women competing alongside men, as evidenced by the recent Victorian Open in Australia.\nMen and women played that event on the same course on the same days for the same prize money, in alternating groups, albeit from different tees.\nSorenstam sees this as the future, rather than a lone female wolf playing with a pack of 100-plus men.\n“I grew up playing with boys at my club,” said the native of Sweden, who now lives in Florida with her husband and two children.\n“Men and women should play together, but not necessarily compete against each other.”\nLPGA commissioner Mike Whan recently said it was just a matter of time before the women’s tour and the PGA Tour staged a joint event, though nothing has been announced.\nSorenstam, meanwhile, walked away from competitive golf in 2008 at the relatively young age of 38 and focuses her attention these days on her myriad of business and philanthropic interests.\nHer Annika Foundation seeks to develop women’s golf worldwide, and stages six junior tournaments. She hopes soon to add one or two more.\nSorenstam also finds time in her busy schedule for triathlon training.\nShe recently competed in a race in St Petersburg, Florida, completing the 750-metre swim, 20km bike and 5 km run in a respectable one hour, 26 minutes, 32 seconds.\nWhile she has little time left for golf, she remains proud of her achievements in the sport.\n“I’m very happy, and when I look back on my career I’m proud,” she said.
