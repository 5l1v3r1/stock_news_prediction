The Fed is expected to raise U.S. interest rates.\nJoseph Incalcaterra, an economist at HSBC, said Monday’s advances on Indonesian markets meant BI’s pre-emptive stance is being rewarded. “It thus appears that the hike is widely priced-in by domestic and foreign market participants,” he said.\nReporting by Gayatri Suroyo, Nilufar Rizki and Tabita Diela; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:24:12.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
