They had asked Republican leaders not to hold the vote until the Goodlatte-McCaul immigration bill could be considered.\nScalise said the Goodlatte-McCaul bill, which would give temporary protections to young illegal immigrants but not offer citizenship, was currently short of the votes needed to the pass the House, according to Roll Call.\nHe said there was an effort underway to find another immigration measure that could pass the chamber, Roll Call said.
