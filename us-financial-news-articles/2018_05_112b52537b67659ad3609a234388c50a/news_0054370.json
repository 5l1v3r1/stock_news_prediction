China’s yuan also eased 0.3 percent to its lowest level since mid-January.\nThe rand had firmed on Monday in the wake of S&P Global’s decision to leave the country’s credit rating unchanged with a stable outlook.\nMeanwhile Turkey’s lira held up better in choppy trading, treading water following Monday’s 2.7 percent gain as investors in London were gearing up to meet senior policy makers from Ankara.\nThe currency has been supported by the central bank’s decision on Monday to return to using the one-week repo as its benchmark rate with investors welcoming the move to simplify monetary policy after years of relying on multiple rates.\nChow said the move, which will be implemented from June 1, was surprisingly positive.\n“The late liquidity window is now at 19.5 percent, which means if we were to get another period of capital outflows and weakness that’s where money market rates could go to. That’s not only simplification, that’s carrying a bigger stick as well.”\nTurkish sovereign dollar bonds also rallied across the curve, with the biggest gains at the longer end. The February 2045 issue rose over 2 cents to 93.5 cents in the dollar, a 2-1/2 week high.\nThe average yield spread of Turkish sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified index also narrowed by 14 basis points (bps) to 384 bps, a two-week low.\nHungary’s forint continued to underperform its regional peers, down 0.35 percent. Hungary’s central bank is considered one of the most dovish in emerging markets.\nInvestors were also eyeing developments in Latin America where Brazilian stocks plunged to their lowest level this year in Monday’s session as an ongoing truckers’ strike hit all sectors and state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA had to adopt a number of policies unpopular with traders.\nMeanwhile Colombia is heading for a divisive presidential race after right-wing Ivan Duque won Sunday's first round, triggering a run off with leftist Gustavo Petro that could upset a historic peace deal or see a reversal in business-friendly policies.
