POLICY CONTINUITY\nMeantime the shock of Najib’s defeat reverberated through markets.\n“This upset ranks up there with Brexit and Trump election,” said Aninda Mitra, a senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “I believe the ringgit will come under pressure as policy continuity will come under a cloud.”\nIf Mahathir’s coalition takes over the government, investors have to grapple with the impact of the PH’s pledges to abolish a goods and services tax, restore a petrol subsidy, increase minimum wages and review infrastructure projects.\n“The impact on the ringgit is likely via the sentiment channel with perceived risk associating with the transition of government,” said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy at Westpac. “The impact on the fiscal balance is the first thing to watch.”\nForeigners hold nearly half of all outstanding Malaysian government bonds. The equity market is Asia’s top performer after Vietnam, with more than 7 percent gains this year in dollar terms.\nWhile most banks are disallowed by regulators from actively participating in the non-deliverable forward markets for ringgit, the NDFs showed a 4 percent fall in the 3-month tenor, to 4.12 per dollar.\nThe currency was last traded at 3.9480 onshore on Tuesday and has been a relative outperformer in the region as a combination of rising U.S. yields, recovering oil prices and global trade tensions have sapped most high-yielding emerging market currencies.\nThe U.S.-traded iShares MSCI Malaysia exchange traded fund (ETF) fell 6 percent overnight. The cost of insuring against default on Malaysian debt rose to 84 basis points from 78 before the election.\n“At a time of growing pressure on emerging market currencies and bonds, the situation in Malaysia bears careful watching for potential knock-on effects, particularly as rising rates and geopolitical uncertainties remain live in the backdrop,” said Bank of Singapore’s Lee.\nStill, analysts expect the ringgit will find support once the jitters over the election ebb. As a net oil exporter and one of Asia’s higher growth economies, the country is also seen retaining its appeal for foreign investors.\n“The ringgit has scope to outperform the region once the dust has settled with steady domestic growth path amid lower inflation,” wrote Sue Trinh, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n“There is upside risk to our 3.93 end-2018 forecast but we are for now reserving judgement until we see Mahathir’s policies fleshed out in greater detail.” Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:46:19.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
