The United States is offering $5 million for information leading to his capture.\nThe Jalisco gang has challenged Guzman’s Sinaloa cartel and other gangs in territories across Mexico over drug trafficking routes to the United States, fueling part of a surge in murder rates to the highest on records going back 20 years.\nThe surge in murders, kidnappings and extortion has hobbled backing for President Enrique Pena Nieto’s ruling party ahead of a July 1 presidential vote and helped fuel support for the leftist frontrunner, who is promising to curb violence by fighting corruption and poverty.\nNavarrete said nearly 1,800 criminals had been caught since late January with the launch of operation Titian Shield, a federal plan to reduce violence in hot spots around the country.\nHe pointed to a drop in kidnapping rates in April and sharp decline in murder rates at the tourist resort of Los Cabos on the southern tip of the Baja peninsula and Colima state on the Pacific coast.\nYet, overall, murder investigations continued to climb in the first four months of 2018 to 8,900, up 17 percent from the same period last year, according to latest nationwide government data and Reuters calculations.
