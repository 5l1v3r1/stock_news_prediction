Analysts were expecting $1.82 per share.\nNet income fell 30 percent to $287.5 million, hurt by a lower revenue from PharMEDium and high operating expenses.\nRevenue rose 10.5 percent to $41.03 billion, beating estimates of $40.64 billion, helped by sales from stores bought as part of its acquisition of H.D.
