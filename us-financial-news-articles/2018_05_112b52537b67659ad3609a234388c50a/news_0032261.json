Sales at its landline business slid 1.6 percent.\nIn a call with analysts, Reynaud pledged to reinvigorate growth in the next 12 months with more aggressive offers in mobile and broadband and the launch in September of a new set-top box bundling voice, internet and TV services.\nHe also vowed to address France’s business-to-business market in 2020.\n“It is crucial that we reaffirm our identity as a maverick and keep our uniqueness,” Reynaud added.\nIliad is also planning to launch in Italy, and the company said on Tuesday its debut there was pencilled in for June 21. That is later than the initial planned launch around the start of this year.\n“A certain number of things may have dragged on,” Niel said, citing both Italy and the new set-top box.\nCapital expenditure (capex) for France will reach 1.55 billion euros for 2018, Iliad said, including costs related to the set-top box launch. The group had previously flagged capex of 1.4-1.5 billion euros.\nIliad confirmed its 2020 targets, including a consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation an amortisation (EBITDA) margin of more than 40 percent in France. But the quarterly results left some analysts sceptical.\n“Free cash flow generation looks increasingly challenging, given the competitive pressure in fixed, the lack of enough mobile ARPU (average revenue per user) uplift, and the high capex intensity, making it hard to achieve guidance...,” Kepler Cheuvreux said in a note to clients.\n$1 = 0.8381 euros Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
