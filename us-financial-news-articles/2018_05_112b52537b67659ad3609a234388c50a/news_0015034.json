The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 bounced off their 200-day moving averages, a technical level that indicates long-term momentum.\nAt 12:45 p.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 285.76 points, or 1.19 percent, at 24,215.91, the S&P 500 was up 28.60 points, or 1.09 percent, at 2,658.33 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 106.67 points, or 1.50 percent, at 7,194.83.\nAll the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, and 29 of the 30 Dow members were in the black.\nAfter a two-day meeting, China and the United States reached a consensus on some aspects of their trade row, though some “relatively big” disagreements on other issues remained, China said.\nAmong companies that reported results, Pandora Media jumped 22.4 percent after the music streaming service provider reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.\nCBS Corp rose 5.9 percent after the media company topped revenue and profit estimates for the first quarter.\nFluor Corp sank 21.7 percent, the most on the S&P, after the engineering and construction company posted a surprise quarterly loss due to issues with a gas-fired power project.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 3.25-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.70-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 12 new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 39 new lows.
