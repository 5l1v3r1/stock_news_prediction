LTC is insurance coverage which pays out for end-of-life medical care, such as when a person needs assistance bathing or feeding themselves.\nThe U.S. arm of AXA, dubbed AXA Equitable Holdings Inc , offers such protection to clients through a rider on life insurance products. It is one of America's oldest life insurers, with roots going back to 1859 in New York. AXA acquired the business in 1992.\nAXA Equitable Holdings offered 137.25 million shares in its IPO. The listing values the U.S. entity at $11.22 billion.\nIt is the second U.S. insurance IPO this year to price below its target range, after Goosehead Insurance Inc last month.\nMorgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Barclays and Citigroup are the main investment banks involved in the IPO.
