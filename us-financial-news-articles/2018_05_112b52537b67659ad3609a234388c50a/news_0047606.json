REUTERS/Mike Blake\nTen more people were wounded in the attack, which occurred when a 17-year-old armed with a shotgun and a revolver opened fire at the high school, which is roughly 30 miles from downtown Houston.\nAccording to police officials, the suspect, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, is in custody and has been charged with capital murder.\n“Absolutely horrific,” Watt tweeted shortly after the tragedy occurred.\nThe Texans also released a statement:\n“On behalf of the Texans organization, we are saddened by the tragic events at Sante Fe High School this morning and extend our thoughts and heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families and all those affected. We are grateful for the brave first responders, law enforcement officials and medical personnel. The Texans family will continue to pray for our neighbors.”\nWatt has been lauded for his charitable efforts in the last year. The 29-year-old raised over $37 million to help relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston and more of the southwest. He originally hoped to raise $200,000. For his work, Watt was selected as the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year in February and named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in April.\nThe Houston Rockets and Houston Astros also addressed the tragedy on Friday, with Rockets point guard Chris Paul telling reporters the playoffs are “minor compared to what those people are dealing with.”\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-19T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T11:28:37.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
