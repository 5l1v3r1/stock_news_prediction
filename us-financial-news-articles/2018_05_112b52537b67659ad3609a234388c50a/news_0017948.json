USGS/Handout via REUTERS\nKilauea, Hawaii’s most active volcano, erupted on Thursday and lava flows from fissures have destroyed at least 36 structures and caused the evacuation of about 2,000 residents.\nExplosive eruptions could occur if the lava lake in Kilauea’s crater continues to fall to the level of groundwater, causing an influx of water to create steam-driven explosions, the USGS said in a statement.
