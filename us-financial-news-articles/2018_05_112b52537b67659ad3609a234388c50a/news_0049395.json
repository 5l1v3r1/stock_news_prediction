None of these trends are likely to reverse, or even slow, in coming years.\nWood Mackenzie research director for iron ore, Paul Gray, told a media briefing in Singapore on Tuesday that the margin on steel rebar for mills in China is currently as high as 1,000 yuan ($157) a tonne.\nThis isn’t a level Wood Mackenzie, or indeed most analysts, expect is sustainable over the longer term, with Gray expecting it to drop to around 200 yuan a tonne in coming years.\nAssuming this forecast is on the money, the interesting question then becomes what happens to the premium for high-grade ore and the discount for lower quality?\nThe switch to high-grade ore was driven by Chinese steel mills enjoying extraordinary profits and seeking ways to maximise output. They can produce more steel by using high-grade iron ore than lower quality ore.\nBut as profit margins contract for steel mills, the economics are likely to switch, with higher-grade ores losing out to medium and lower grade material as input costs trump the need to maximise output.\nWood Mackenzie expects the discount for lower grade ore to narrow as the steel profit margin shrinks, but not to the levels seen previously. Rather it will be some 10 percentage points wider.\nEven this expectation is premised on Chinese steel mills placing economics above all other considerations when working out how to deal with lower steel margins, something that they may not be able to do.\nMuch will depend on how the authorities in Beijing and steel-producing provinces develop policies to reduce emissions, and the signs are that these will get stricter over time.\nThis may well force steel mills to continue to use higher grade ore, even if it would be cheaper to switch to lower quality.\nThis in turn has implications for iron ore miners, especially producers of lower quality grades, such as Australia’s Fortescue Metals Group.\nFortescue, the third-biggest producer in the world’s top iron ore exporter, enjoys low production costs and can still be profitable at low prices for its ore. It may have to consider longer-term plans to diversify away from China, or improve the quality of its product.\nThe miner is already selling more iron ore to India, but these flows are small compared to its overall production.\nOther producers of lower-grade ore may find themselves uncompetitive, including some smaller Australian miners, those in Iran and Chinese domestic producers.\nConversely, Brazil, the top producer of higher grade ores, stands to benefit, as does South Africa, another producer of higher grade ore and the third-biggest exporter to China.\nOverall, the picture of steady seaborne volumes and prices stuck in a range may continue for the rest of 2018, but within the market significant changes are afoot.
