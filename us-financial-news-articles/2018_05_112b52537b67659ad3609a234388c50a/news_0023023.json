(“IS&S” or the “Company”) ( ISSC ) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reported net sales of $3.7 million, compared to second quarter fiscal 2017 sales of $4.7 million. The Company reported a net loss of $1.3 million, or ($0.08) per share, for the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $5.9 million, or $0.35 per share, in the second quarter a year ago. Second quarter 2017 profitability benefitted from a $3.6 million reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses as well as $4.1 million in other income, both arising from the settlement of a lawsuit.\nGeoffrey Hedrick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IS&S, said, “We continue to invest in new product research and development which we believe will enable the Company to sustain growth over the long term. These efforts yielded our second STC in just the last few quarters; a standalone Autothrottle for the PC-12 that can be installed and operated without upgrading the cockpit display system, thereby proving a highly cost-effective upgrade solution. Work has begun on the development of a standalone Autothrottle for the King Air, which we believe can greatly expand our total market opportunity for Autothrottle. We expect that it should be a straightforward task to complete the development and obtain an STC on the King Air, which would then make IS&S the sole source for a standalone Autothrottle for this aircraft. In the near term we continue to focus on our strategy to increase both revenues and backlog.”\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018, the company intends to use $2.4 million of cash to acquire a King Air airplane to be used in research and development activities.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $23.4 million of cash on hand.\nNew orders in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $4.2 million and backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $3.8 million. Backlog excludes potential future sole-source production orders from products in development under the Company’s engineering development contracts, including the Pilatus PC-24, and the KC-46A, all of which the Company expects to remain in production for a decade following completion of their respective development phases. The Company expects that these contracts will add to production sales already in backlog.\nShahram Askarpour, President of IS&S, added, \"The increase in both revenues and backlog in the second quarter is consistent with our expectation for steady improvement compared to the first quarter. The number of aircraft benefitting from our many products is increasing. Consequently, we continue to see an increase in repeat, intra-quarter book-and-ship business from customers, as well as solid demand for customer service arising as our installed base of products expands. Over the last several quarters we have maintained our commitment to research and development, which has enabled us to introduce a number of new products, including the first Autothrottle for turboprops integrated with our display system, and now a standalone Autothrottle. We are confident that our strategy to develop innovative technologies that improve safety, situational awareness and reduce the cost of operation is building long-term shareholder value.”\nSix Months Results\nTotal sales for the six months ended March 31, 2018 were $6.8 million, compared to $ 8.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2017. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the net loss was $2.2 million compared to net income of $4.7 million for the first half of fiscal 2017. Six months results for fiscal 2017 reflect the unusual items recognized in the second quarter as described above.\nConference Call\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results and its business outlook.
