Lajovic went on to bag the set and Zverev had his back to the wall.\nBut the German, who leads the ATP Race, was fully focused as he raced through the fourth set by sticking closer to the baseline and he ended the match with an unreturnable serve.\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T19:40:37.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
