But there are as many as 50 other destinations in North America and parts of South America that it could serve, he said.\n\"Not all next year,\" Kelly said. \"It may take us 25 years.\"\nWhile such an expansion could be many years a way, a move to northern South America could include destinations in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, where tourism has grown in recent years.

The airline is in the process of revamping its fleet with new Boeing 737 MAX, a more fuel-efficient model of Boeing's best-selling plane.\nSouthwest last month announced it would not only fly to Hawaii from California but that it would fly between the islands, sending shares of Hawaiian Airlines tumbling .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:41:05.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
