Here are some of his favorite and least favorite digital currencies. Bitcoin\nNeu-Ner is an early investor of the large-cap coin. But he still said to sell. Chesnot | Getty Images\n\"I like bitcoin,\" he said, but pointed out that it's, \"priced too low.\" The coin, valued as high as $19,500 late last year, was trading around $8,100 on Thursday evening.\n\"It's going to continue to go up, slowly and in a stable way,\" he said. \"But there are more exciting cryptocurrencies out there.\" Bitcoin cash\nOne of them might be bitcoin cash.\nThe coin, priced around $1,200 Thursday evening, was down by about $100 from Tuesday. But that's still almost double its April 17 level of $763 .\nWith a solid team behind the coin, Neu-Ner said he sees a lot of potential.

Some picks: Oasis, Zilliqa and Thunder Token.\n\"Ethereum has scalability issues,\" Neu-Ner said. \"They're doing 15 transactions per second. That means, that's not real-world stuff. But some of the other blockchains are resolving this. They're promising 10,000 transactions per second.\" Ripple\nDefinitely a sell, the crypto trader said of Ripple.\n\"I'm throwing it in the garbage,\" Neu-Ner said. Ripple\nWhile he pointed out that Ripple the company is \"one of the best companies I know,\" he said its token, the XRP, is not.\n\"I can't find a use case for the token,\" he said. XRP is also a centralized token, which Neu-Ner said defeats the point of blockchain technology.\n\"I'm out,\" he said.
