Fuzesi said growth could even stall in the first three months of 2018.\nOn the year, retail sales climbed by 1.3 percent, beating a Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.0 percent increase.\nThe retail sales data came after a GfK survey published last week showed the mood among German consumers fell heading into May amid fears that a possible confrontation between the West and Russia in Syria and protectionist U.S. trade policies could hurt the economy.
