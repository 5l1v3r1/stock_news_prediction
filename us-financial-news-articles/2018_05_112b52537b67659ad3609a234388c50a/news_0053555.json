I haven’t counted how many times, but yes, many times,” Falcao, 32, laughingly said in a recent interview.

Comfortingly for Colombia, they thrashed Japan 4-1 at the 2014 World Cup.\n“It’s a level group, we have to compete very well to get through the first round,” Rodriguez, whose first name is pronounced “Hamez” in his adoring home country, said recently on Twitter.\n“Difficult, but nothing is impossible.”\nColombia are in their fifth World Cup, with their quarter-final appearance at Brazil 2014 — where they lost to the hosts — their best performance.
