(NASDAQ: ICCH) (the Company), parent company of Illinois Casualty Company, a regional, multi-line property and casualty insurance company focusing exclusively on the food and beverage industry, today reported preliminary, unaudited results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 – FINANCIAL RESULTS\nNet earnings totaled $676,000 or $0.21 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net earnings of $849,000 or $0.27 per share for the first quarter of 2017.\nDirect premium written grew by $1,799,000, or 14.3%, to $14,388,000 for the first quarter of 2018 from $12,589,000 for the same period in 2017. Net premiums earned grew by 4.2% to $11,297,000 for the first quarter of 2018 from $10,838,000 for the same period in 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company ceded to reinsurers $2,248,000 of earned premiums, compared to $2,004,000 of earned premiums for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet realized investment gains were $1,102,000 compared to net realized investment gains of $445,000 for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. These increases were a result of the Company liquidating common stock securities as a result of changing equity managers during the first quarter of 2018. The Company's previous equity manager had an ETF focus which required the Company to sell its holdings during the first quarter of 2018 to allow the new equity manager to implement their investing strategy.\nNet investment income increased by $231,000, or 48.9%, during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. The growth in net investment income is primarily from the increase in the available for sale securities.\nLosses and settlement expenses increased by $1,397,000, or 21.2%, to $7,996,000 for the first quarter of 2018, from $6,599,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase in losses and settlement expenses for the first quarter of 2017 is primarily due to an increase in the severity of workers compensation claims.\nPolicy acquisition costs are costs incurred to issue policies, which include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting reports, and underwriter compensation costs. The Company offsets the direct commissions it pays with ceded commissions it receives from reinsurers. Other operating expenses consist primarily of information technology costs, accounting and internal control salaries, as well as audit and legal expenses. Policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses increased by $402,000, or 10.8%, to $4,137,000 for the first quarter of 2018 from $3,735,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase in policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2018 are primarily driven by increases in expenses related to operating as a public company for the entire three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with only 18 days of public company operating expenses recognized during the same period of 2017, as well as an increase in insurance expense.\nTotal assets decreased by 2.1 % from $152,334,000 at December 31, 2017 to $149,064,000 at March 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a reduction in cash and cash equivalents used to pay off corporate debt during the first quarter of 2018. Our investment portfolio, which consists of fixed maturity securities, common stocks, preferred stocks, and property held for investment, increased by 0.7% from $105,133,000 at December 31, 2017 to $105,852,000 at March 31, 2018.\nFIRST QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 – FINANCIAL RATIOS\nThe Company's loss and settlement expense ratio (defined as loss and settlement expenses divided by net premiums earned) was 70.8% in the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with 60.9% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe expense ratio (defined as the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and underwriting and administrative expenses divided by net premiums earned) was 36.6% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company's GAAP combined ratio (defined as the sum of the losses and settlement expense ratio and the expense ratio) was 107.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 95.4% in the first quarter of 2017.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n\"The Company began the year with historically strong growth in written premium. This was primarily driven by new business in both core states and recently added markets including Colorado. The Company issued its first policies in Michigan in April and believes this state provides excellent growth potential. It is expected that this top line growth trend will continue throughout 2018. In a targeted move, the Company reduced its property retention level by 43%. While this lowered the amount of net premium earned in the first quarter, we believe that this move will be key in returning the Company to historical levels of profitability. Unfortunately, loss results were negatively impacted by underperformance in the workers' compensation line in the first quarter. This was primarily due to unfavorable development on prior accident year losses. The Company is committed to profitable growth, and believes that the measures it has taken to reduce property volatility combined with successful geographic expansion will translate into these desired results,\" stated Arron Sutherland, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nABOUT ICC HOLDINGS, INC.\nICC Holdings, Inc. is a vertically integrated company created to facilitate the growth, expansion and diversification of its subsidiaries in order to maximize value to its stakeholders.
