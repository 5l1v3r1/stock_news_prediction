Net income in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter was $0.8 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with $1.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior-year fourth quarter.\nNet sales for the full year of fiscal 2018 were $77.5 million, compared with $91.8 million in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 net loss was $9.8 million, or a loss of $1.01 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017. Excluding restructuring charges, non-cash charges for goodwill and intangible asset impairments as well as other related charges and the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform legislation passed in December 2017, net income for fiscal 2018 was $1.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $5.5 million, or $0.56 per diluted share in fiscal 2017 on a comparable basis.\nJames R. Lines, Graham’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 orders were $43.5 million, reflecting the highest level since our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. This contributed to full year orders of $112 million. The composition of our resulting year-end backlog of $118 million gives us confidence in our expectations for fiscal 2019.”\nHe continued, “Fiscal 2018 was another challenging year due to weak order levels in fiscal 2017 that totaled $66 million. We believe that fiscal 2018 was the trough of the downturn. Throughout the prolonged cyclical downturn which began in late 2014, we continued to make investments in our business processes, focusing on lead time reduction and first pass yield quality, as well as other continuous improvement and performance management initiatives. We expect that these investments will serve us well and help drive profitability as we enter a growth cycle.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Sales Summary\nSee accompanying financial tables for a breakdown of sales by industry and region)\nThe $3.4 million, or 13%, decline in sales during the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter compared with the prior-year quarter included significant variation by industry. It included a $3.9 million increase in sales to the refining market, offset by a $3.2 million reduction in sales to the chemical/petrochemical market, a $1.6 million decline to the power market, and a $2.5 million reduction to the other commercial, industrial and defense markets.\nFrom a geographic perspective, sales to the Company’s U.S. market decreased $5.3 million compared with the prior-year fourth quarter, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in sales to international markets. U.S. sales represented 66% of consolidated sales in the fiscal 2018 quarter, compared with 78% in the prior-year fourth quarter.\nFluctuations in Graham’s sales among geographic locations and industries can vary measurably from quarter-to-quarter based on the timing and magnitude of projects. Graham does not believe that such quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are indicative of business trends, which it believes are more apparent on a trailing twelve month basis.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Operating Performance Review\n($ in millions except per share data) Q4 FY18 Q4 FY17 Change Net sales $ 22.2 $ 25.6 $ (3.4 ) Gross profit $ 5.0 $ 6.7 $ (1.7 ) Gross margin 22.8 % 26.3 % Operating profit $ 0.9 $ 2.5 $ (1.6 ) Operating margin 3.8 % 9.8 % Net income $ 0.8 $ 1.8 $ (1.0 ) Diluted EPS $ 0.09 $ 0.18 $ (0.09 ) Non-GAAP financial measure: Adjusted net income $ 0.6 $ 1.8 $ (1.2 ) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 0.07 $ 0.18 $ (0.11 ) Fourth quarter fiscal 2018 gross profit was negatively impacted by lower sales. Gross margin was negatively impacted by a weaker mix of projects including a non-repeating atypical project during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as well as under-absorption of overhead costs due to lower sales.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $4.1 million were relatively flat compared with the prior-year period. SG&A as a percent of sales was 19% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with 16% in the same prior-year period.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Graham had an effective tax rate of 16%, benefiting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and favorable year-end tax adjustments. Adjusted net income for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter noted in the table above removes the favorable impact of adopting the new tax legislation. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 31%.\nTo summarize, the decrease in net income and diluted EPS during the fourth quarter compared with the prior-year quarter was primarily due to lower sales and weaker project mix.\nEBITDA ($ in millions) Q4 FY18 Q4 FY17 Change EBITDA $ 1.4 $ 3.1 $ (1.7 ) EBITDA margin 6.3 % 12.1 % EBITDA (defined as consolidated net income before interest expense and income, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization) during the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter was unfavorably impacted by the factors discussed above.\nGraham believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, EBITDA and EBITDA margin (EBITDA as a percentage of sales), which are non-GAAP measures, help in the understanding of its operating performance. Graham’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Graham’s use of EBITDA and EBITDA margin as well as a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Review\n($ in millions except per share data) FY18 FY17 Change Net sales $ 77.5 $ 91.8 $ (14.3 ) Gross profit $ 17.3 $ 22.2 $ (4.9 ) Gross margin 22.4 % 24.1 % Operating (loss) profit $ (13.4 ) $ 6.7 $ (20.1 ) Operating margin -17.3 % 7.3 % Net (loss) income $ (9.8 ) $ 5.0 $ (14.8 ) Diluted EPS $ (1.01 ) $ 0.52 $ (1.53 ) Non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted operating profit $ 2.0 $ 7.3 $ (5.3 ) Adjusted operating margin 2.5 % 8.0 % Adjusted net income $ 1.8 $ 5.5 $ (3.7 ) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 0.18 $ 0.56 $ (0.38 ) Full year sales decreased 16% compared with fiscal 2017. International sales increased to $25.6 million in fiscal 2018 and represented 33% of total sales, compared with $22.6 million, or 25% of sales in fiscal 2017. Sales to the U.S. were $51.9 million, or 67% of net sales in fiscal 2018, compared with $69.2 million, or 75% of fiscal 2017 net sales.\nThe decrease in gross profit and gross margin was due to lower volume resulting from the 16% reduction in sales when compared with the prior year as well as a large non-repeating atypical order which converted in the second half of fiscal 2017.\nSG&A in fiscal 2018 was $15.6 million, up $0.8 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A was 20% for fiscal 2018 compared with 16% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was principally related to the benefit of insurance proceeds received in the prior year.\nThe fiscal 2018 operating results were impacted by a $14.8 million pre-tax ($12.0 million after tax) non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as a related $0.3 million charge, all recognized in the third quarter. The full year operating results also included $0.3 million and $0.6 million of pre-tax restructuring charges for severance costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding those atypical items, adjusted operating profit was $2.0 million and $7.3 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFiscal 2018 results were also impacted by a $0.8 million favorable adjustment to income taxes upon implementation of the tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. That adjustment included $0.8 million of expense for adjusting the rates on the deferred tax liability associated with the Energy Steel acquisition offset by a benefit of $1.6 million for other tax items.\nFiscal 2018 adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS excluded $12.0 million of net-of-tax impairment charges, $0.2 million of net-of-tax bad debt charges associated with the revaluation of the Company’s commercial nuclear power business, $0.2 million for a net-of-tax nonrecurring restructuring charge and a $0.8 million tax benefit for adoption of the new federal tax rates as a result of the tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. Fiscal 2017 adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS excluded $0.4 million net-of-tax for a nonrecurring restructuring charge.\nTo summarize, the decrease in adjusted net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS during the year compared with the prior year was primarily due to lower sales and weaker project mix.\nAdjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) FY18 FY17 Change Adjusted EBITDA $ 4.2 $ 9.6 $ (5.4 ) Adjusted EBITDA margin 5.4 % 10.5 % Adjusted EBITDA (defined as consolidated net income before interest expense and income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, nonrecurring restructuring charges, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and a charge associated with the revaluation of the nuclear business) was impacted by the factors discussed above.\nGraham believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales), which are non-GAAP measures, help in the understanding of its operating performance. Graham’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. See the attached tables for additional important disclosures regarding Graham’s use of Adjusted operating profit, Adjusted operating margin, Adjusted net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as well as reconciliations from GAAP measures.\nSolid Balance Sheet Provides Financial Flexibility to Pursue Business Strategy\nCash, cash equivalents and investments at March 31, 2018 were $76.5 million, up $3.0 million from March 31, 2017. The increase resulted primarily from positive operating cash flow.\nCash provided by operations in fiscal 2018 was $8.5 million, compared with $12.4 million in fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of timing of working capital utilization and lower net income.\nCapital expenditures were $2.1 million in fiscal 2018 compared with $0.3 million in fiscal 2017. The Company expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 to be between $2 million and $2.5 million, the majority of which are expected to be used for productivity enhancements.\nDividend payments were $3.5 million in both fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nGraham had neither borrowings under its credit facility, nor any long-term debt outstanding, at March 31, 2018.\nOrders and Backlog Demonstrate Early Signs of Cyclical Recovery\nDriven by the U.S. Navy as well as the refining industry in North America, total orders grew to $43.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $9.0 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. The fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was unfavorably impacted by $6.5 million of order cancellations. Orders from U.S. customers in the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter were $35.1 million, or 81% of total orders, and orders from international markets were $8.4 million, or 19%. The fiscal 2018 fourth quarter orders included $24.5 million, or 56% of the total, from other commercial, industrial and defense markets, which includes the U.S. Navy.\nOrders for fiscal 2018 were $112.2 million, up 70% compared with $66.1 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was driven by the refining industry, which was up $29.4 million, as well as the other commercial, industrial and defense markets, which were up $19 million. Orders from U.S. customers in fiscal 2018 were $77.1 million, or 69%, and orders from international markets were $35.1 million, or 31%. In fiscal 2017, 74% of orders were from U.S. customers and 26% were international.\nGraham expects that the balance between domestic and international orders, as well as orders by industry, will continue to be variable between quarters.\nBacklog at the end fiscal 2018 was a record $117.9 million, up from $96.2 million and $82.6 million at the end of the previous quarter and from the end of fiscal 2017, respectively.\nThe Company continues to believe that its backlog mix by industry highlights the success of its diversification strategy to increase sales to the U.S. Navy. Backlog by industry at March 31, 2018 was approximately:\n56% for U.S. Navy projects 30% for refinery projects 5% for power projects, including nuclear 5% for chemical/petrochemical projects 4% for other industrial applications\nThe expected timing for the Company’s backlog to convert to sales is as follows:\nWithin next 12 months: 55% to 60% Within 12 to 24 months: 20% to 25% Beyond 24 months: 15% to 25%\nOutlook and FY 2019 Guidance\nGraham is announcing its fiscal 2019 guidance, as follows:\nRevenue anticipated to be between $90 million and $95 million Gross margin expected to be between 24% and 25% SG&A expense expected to be between $18 and $18.75 million Effective tax rate anticipated to be between 20% and 22%\nMr. Lines concluded, “Strong order levels during the past two quarters provide a solid foundation for anticipated revenue growth in fiscal 2019 of 16% to 22% compared with fiscal 2018. Margin for recent orders is superior to fiscal 2017 orders and, when considered in conjunction with our operational improvements, this gives us confidence in our expected fiscal 2019 gross margin range. We are pleased to once again be on a growth trajectory.”\nWebcast and Conference Call\nGraham’s management will host a conference call and live webcast today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to review its financial condition and operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018, as well as its strategy and outlook.

Adjusted net income is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP. Nevertheless, Graham believes that providing non-GAAP information such as Adjusted net income is important for investors and other readers of Graham's financial statements, as it is used as an analytical indicator by Graham's management to better understand operating performance. Because Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted net income, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nGraham Corporation\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018\nAdjusted Operating Profit Reconciliation—Unaudited\n(Amounts in thousands)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Operating profit (loss) $ 850 $ 2,518 $ (13,448 ) $ 6,673 + Restructuring charge - - 316 630 + Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - - 14,816 - + Bad debt charge on commercial nuclear power business - - 280 - Adjusted operating profit $ 850 $ 2,518 $ 1,964 $ 7,303 Adjusted operating margin % 3.8 % 9.8 % 2.5 % 8.0 % Non-GAAP Financial Measure:\nAdjusted operating profit is defined as consolidated operating profit before a nonrecurring restructuring charge, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and a charge associated with the revaluation of the nuclear business.
