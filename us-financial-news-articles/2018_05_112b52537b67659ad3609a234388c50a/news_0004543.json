The Company also provided an update on its targeted action plan, focused on the restructuring of its Americas segment and business improvement activities in its Europe-Africa segment.\n“Our consolidated results were consistent with our expectations, as we continued to address the previously identified challenges in the business,” said Mark Zeffiro, President and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Global. “We made progress against our targeted action as many initiatives moved forward, but there is still work to be done. The consolidation of our distribution network is a top priority and we are making early progress on addressing ongoing challenges.\n“To date, progress on our action plan includes the recent announcement of a restructuring plan for the Americas segment, which includes a 30 percent reduction of its U.S.-based salaried workforce. Additionally, performance levels continue to improve at our Reynosa, Mexico metals facility.\n“Our Asia-Pacific business continues to outperform, achieving a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, driven primarily by new business in the industrial channel. The integration of the Best Bars business is exceeding expectations and contributed to this segment’s profitability during the quarter.\n“Our Europe-Africa business also made progress against its targeted action plan initiatives , including increased production from its low-cost country sources and continued realization of Westfalia synergies. During the first quarter, an interim goodwill impairment test was triggered, in part, by the decline in our stock price since year-end, which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment of $43.4 million. We continue to believe that our Europe-Africa business remains a key driver of the Company’s future financial success. The completion of the Brink acquisition, which remains subject to regulatory review and approval, along with our focus on driving business improvements in this segment and our continued achievement of synergies in Europe will help reinforce Horizon Global’s position as a leading branded towing and trailering solution provider to our global customers and end users.”\n2018 First Quarter Segment Results\nHorizon Americas. Net sales decreased 1.6 percent, primarily driven by inefficiencies in the ramp up of the Company’s Kansas City distribution center and the wind-down of its Dallas distribution center. Operating profit decreased $10.3 million to a loss of $5.1 million, or 5.3 percent of net sales, due to higher material costs that more than offset price increases.\nHorizon Europe-Africa. Net sales increased by $8.5 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange translation. Revenue growth in the OE channel partially offset ongoing challenges in the aftermarket channel. Operating profit decreased $44.7 million to a loss of $45.1 million, or 51.8 percent of net sales, attributable to the impairment of goodwill. Adjusted operating profit (1) decreased to $0.1 million, or 0.1 percent of net sales, due to the margin mix impact from the lower-margin OE business and material cost increases in excess of realized price increases.\nHorizon Asia-Pacific. Net sales increased 24.6 percent, or 19.1 percent, on a constant currency basis (3) , primarily attributable to the Best Bars acquisition and strength in the OE channel. Operating profit increased $1.3 million to $4.4 million, or 13.1 percent of net sales, driven by higher sales and increased operational productivity.\nTargeted Action Plan\nHorizon Global announced a business improvement plan on March 1, 2018 to drive $3.0 million to $5.0 million in consolidated cost savings in 2018. Once implemented, the action plan is expected to result in $10.0 million to $12.0 million in consolidated cost savings on a full-year run rate basis. Action plan updates include:\nInitiated the consolidation the Americas segment’s three legacy non-manufacturing locations into a single location Announced a 30 percent reduction in the Americas segment’s U.S.-based salaried workforce Increased production levels in its Reynosa, Mexico metals facility with a 19% improvement in cost/earned hour and double-digit improvement in plant output Improved shipment rates at its Kansas City distribution center, with considerable effort required in the second quarter to absorb aftermarket volume Increased the Europe-Africa segment’s low-cost country production, achieving the daily production target of 900 towbars Implemented actions to improve the profitability of the Nordics region in the Europe-Africa business by consolidating Sweden and Finland warehousing and commercial operations into Denmark\nZeffiro concluded, “We continue to advance our action plan and are focused on implementing our initiatives with a sense of urgency as we head into the important second and third quarters. We are reaffirming our guidance for the year, on an adjusted basis, as we continue to make the changes necessary to improve our performance and increase shareholder value.”\nConference Call Details\nHorizon Global will host a conference call regarding first quarter 2018 earnings on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
