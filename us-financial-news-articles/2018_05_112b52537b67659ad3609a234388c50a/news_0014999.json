Baird in Milwaukee. \"The market will struggle until we get clarity on this,\" he said.\nThe Iran deal may remain partially intact, even without the United States. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani suggested on Monday that Iran could remain in the accord with the other signatories that remain committed to it.\n\"Iran is monitoring U.S. and European stance closely and will react to U.S. decision based on its own national interests,\" Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, was quoted as saying by Iranian news agency IRNA.\nTrump's move is a snub to European allies such as France, Britain and Germany, who are also part of the Iran deal and tried hard to convince him to preserve it. The Europeans must now scramble to decide their own course of action with Tehran.\nChina and Russia are also signatories to the Iran pact.\nIran's growing military and political power in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq worries the United States, Israel and U.S. Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia.\nIsrael has traded blows with Iranian forces in Syria since February, stirring concern that major escalation could be looming.\n(Additional reporting by Tim Ahmann, Makini Brice and Arshad Mohammed in Washington, Sybille de La Hamaide, John Irish and Tim Hepher in Paris, Parisa Hafezi in Ankara, Bozorgmehr Sharafedin in London, Andrew Torchia in Dubai Writing by William Maclean and Alistair Bell Editing by Peter Graff and Bill Trott)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T07:11:31.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
