Mali was not immediately available for comment.\nThe Serbian government which ended the 2017 with a small fiscal surplus pledged it will raise public sector wages and pensions this year, on condition economic performance remains good.\nSerbia’s economy expanded 2 percent in 2017 and is forecast to grow 3.5 percent this year. It rose 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 according to a flash estimate.
