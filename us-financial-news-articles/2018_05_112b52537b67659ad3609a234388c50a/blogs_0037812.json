Photo: Associated Press\nCompanies will need to be more transparent about the management of employee data or risk getting caught on the wrong side of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.\nGDPR takes effect May 25 and builds upon existing European data-privacy rules to protect personal identifiable information and to empower the individuals who are the subject of the data. The burden of compliance falls with organizations that hold and process information.\nHuman resources departments that have relied on employee consent for data processing may need to review their approach, said GDPR experts in London. Under GDPR consent must be given freely and explicitly, with the individual clearly informed of the use of his or her personal data.\n“Employee consent will be one of the areas of risk for companies with GDPR implementation,” said Rohan Massey, head of privacy and cybersecurity at Ropes & Gray in London. “Companies that have relied on consent to process employee data may need to consider an alternative basis for legitimate means to legally process the data.”\nThe U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office issued guidance that says “public authorities, employers and other organizations in a position of power over individuals should avoid relying on consent unless they are confident they can demonstrate it is freely given.”\nCompanies are examining their basis for processing employee data and looking at employee contracts, policies and handbooks to decide on what needs to be changed to make sure data processing remains lawful under GDPR, said Mr. Massey.\nThe exercise of reviewing the management of employee data offers an opportunity for companies to streamline their processes and avoid further risks, said John Bowman, senior principal at business management consulting firm Promontory Financial Group, an IBM company.\n“Companies need to understand the purpose of the processing and not exceed those, not do unnecessary processing,” said Mr. Bowman. GDPR stresses “principles of data-minimization and storage limitation, so data shouldn’t be stored for longer than is necessary,” he said. “That actually reduces a company’s risk; in case of a breach there is less data being affected.”\nThe underlying principle of GDPR is any data processing needs to be lawful, fair and transparent, so companies that need to do some level of employee surveillance will need to be explicit about their actions, said Mr. Bowman.\n“This is a rights-based legislation, and in the HR context there may be some sensitive information about an employee’s performance, or even medical information, which will require specific protection,” he said.\nAnother potential risk on holding employee data is a request for data access may emerge from an ex-employee and could form a basis for a complaint against the company, said Mr. Bowman.\nView a WSJ primer on the legislation here .\nWrite to Mara Lemos Stein at mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com.

Deciding how to put it to work, however, could be challenging, depending on a company’s strategy and resources, and various stakeholder interests, says Charles Holley, independent senior advisor to Deloitte. He discusses issues for CFOs and the C-suite to consider when forming a strategy for excess cash, such as the organization’s capacity to handle additional investment, and the importance of communicating the plan to both external and internal stakeholders.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
