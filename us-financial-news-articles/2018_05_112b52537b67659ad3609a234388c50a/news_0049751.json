In February the company announced it was teaming up with Baltimore Bike Share to transform five bike-share stations in the city into Lyft pickup and dropoff spots.\nSeparately, Lyft announced Wednesday a $100 million investment to expand its retail footprint to help reduce its drivers' expenses and strengthen its networks. The changes will include discounts for oil changes and basic vehicle maintenance, charging stations for electric vehicles and rest spots.\nLyft's Chief Operating Officer Jon McNeill said based on the company's projections, it expects its driver community \"to more than double in the next five years,\" adding that the ride-hailing service is \"in the business of supporting our drivers for the long haul.\"\nMore from CNBC Disruptor 50:\nHow we chose the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 innovators\nNo. 1 CNBC Disruptor: SpaceX launching Mars spaceships\nSpotify's IPO disrupted Wall St. What's ahead for unicorns looking to go public\nKapoor told CNBC that the company has found investing in its drivers has produced better travel times and, as a result, more loyal passengers.

I don't think this is a monopoly. I think there is more than one that can succeed.\"\nA look back at the CNBC Disruptor 50: 6 years, 167 companies", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T17:18:51.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
