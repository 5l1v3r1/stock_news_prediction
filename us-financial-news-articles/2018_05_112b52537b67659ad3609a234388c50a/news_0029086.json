Announces Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nMaroussi, Greece, May 14, 2018 - Pyxis Tankers Inc. (NASDAQ Cap Mkts: PXS), (the \"Company\" or \"Pyxis Tankers\") an emerging growth pure play product tanker company, today announced unaudited results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nSummary\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, our time charter equivalent revenues were $4.5 million, which resulted in net income of $0.6 million, or earnings per share (basic and diluted) of $0.03, and our Adjusted EBITDA (see \"Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions\" below) was $0.1 million.\nOn February 28, 2018, we refinanced existing indebtedness of $26.9 million for Secondone, Thirdone and Fourthone with a new 5-year secured term loan of $20.5 million and cash of $2.1 million. The remaining balance of approximately $4.3 million was written-off by the previous lender at closing, which was recorded as gain from debt extinguishment in the first quarter of 2018.\nValentios Valentis, our Chairman and CEO commented:\n\"Overall, our operating results for the first quarter of 2018 were mixed. Early in the period, we expected a challenging spot charter market for medium range tankers (\"MRs\"), and consequently, we took the opportunity to fix all of our MR's under short-term time charters at fair rates which averaged around $14,900 per day. However, our small tankers underperformed, and we continue to explore avenues to maximize value, including longer-term solutions, such as, vessel sale or bare boat charter arrangements. During the quarter, we also incurred unscheduled work for one of our vessels, which negatively affected the total operating days for the period.\n\"As for the balance of 2018, we continue to expect chartering activity to be choppy but with a modest upward trend, especially for the second half of the year. As of May 7, 2018, 66% of the available days in the second quarter were booked for our MRs at an average of $14,900/day, exclusive of options. Our recent employment strategy positions us to take advantage of improving rates later this year. We continue to believe in a longer term, sustainable improvement in charter rates as a result of attractive market fundamentals, such as, significantly lower scheduled deliveries of new build MRs combined with projected solid growth in consumption by end-markets and increasing export-oriented petroleum refinery cargoes. Over the long-term, we intend to maintain our strategy of a mix of time and spot charters.\n\"While the capital markets continue to be challenging for tanker companies, we will continue to pursue cost-effective, growth capital to further improve our liquidity and selectively acquire MR2s. We remain optimistic about the fundamentals of the product tanker market, specifically for MR's, and believe that Pyxis Tankers has the platform and position to take advantage of them.\"\nResults for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, we reported a net income of $0.6 million, or $0.03 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share, for the same period in 2017. The improvement in our net result in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to the gain from debt extinguishment of $4.3 million, partially offset by the non-cash vessel impairment charge of $1.5 million ($0.07 per share) related to the write down of the carrying amount of Northsea Alpha and Northsea Beta to their fair values. Our Adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million, representing a decrease of $0.3 million from $0.4 million for the same period in 2017.\nThree Months ended March 31, 2017 2018 (Thousands of U.S. dollars, except for daily TCE rates) Voyage revenues 7,640 6,590 Voyage related costs and commissions (2,931) (2,057) Time charter equivalent revenues* 4,709 4,533 Total operating days 480 425 Daily time charter equivalent rate* 9,810 10,667 * Subject to rounding; please see \"Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions\" below.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results for the Three Months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 (Amounts are presented in million U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except as otherwise noted)\nVoyage revenues: Voyage revenues of $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, represented a decrease of $1.1 million, or 13.7%, from $7.6 million in the comparable period in 2017. The decrease in gross voyage revenues during the first quarter of 2018 was related to a decrease in total operating days attributed to increased idle days between voyage charter employments.\nVoyage related costs and commissions: Voyage related costs and commissions of $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, represented a decrease of $0.9 million, or 29.8%, from $2.9 million in the comparable period in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower spot charter activity, which incurs voyage costs.\nVessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses of $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, represented an increase of $0.3 million, or 11.3%, from $3.0 million in the comparable period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributed to certain unscheduled repairs performed in one of the vessels in our fleet.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, represented a decrease of $0.1 million, or 13.3%, from $0.8 million in the comparable period in 2017. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributed to improved cost efficiencies.\nManagement fees: For the three months ended March 31, 2018, management fees payable to our ship manager, Pyxis Maritime Corp. (\"Maritime\"), and to International Tanker Management Ltd., our fleet's technical manager, of $0.4 million in the aggregate, remained stable compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nAmortization of special survey costs: Amortization of special survey costs of less than $0.1 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, remained relatively stable compared to the comparable period in 2017.\nDepreciation: Depreciation of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, remained flat compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nVessel impairment charge: Vessel impairment charge of $1.5 million (non-cash) for the three months ended March 31, 2018, relates to the write down of the carrying amount of Northsea Alpha and Northsea Beta to their fair values. There was no such charge recorded in the comparable period in 2017.\nBad debt provisions: Bad debt provisions of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, represented an increase in doubtful trade accounts receivable.\nGain from debt extinguishment: Gain from debt extinguishment of $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, relates to the refinancing of existing indebtedness of Secondone, Thirdone and Fourthone with a new 5-year secured term loan. Approximately $4.3 million was written-off by the previous lender at closing, which was recorded as gain from debt extinguishment in the first quarter of 2018. There was no such gain recorded in the comparable period in 2017.\nGain from financial derivative instrument: The gain from financial derivative instrument for the three months ended March 31, 2018, relates to the net gain from the change in fair value of the interest rate cap for a notional amount of $10.0 million the Company purchased in January 2018. There was no such instrument in the comparable period in 2017.\nInterest and finance costs, net: Interest and finance costs, net, of $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, represented an increase of $0.2 million, or 24.7%, from $0.7 million in the comparable period in 2017. The increase was mainly attributed to the increase of the LIBOR-based interest rates applied to our outstanding bank debt, as well as the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs following the refinancing and extinguishment of the existing indebtedness of Secondone, Thirdone and Fourthone.\nUnaudited Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) / Income\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Voyage revenues 7,640 6,590 Expenses: Voyage related costs and commissions (2,931) (2,057) Vessel operating expenses (2,965) (3,299) General and administrative expenses (769) (667) Management fees, related parties (175) (178) Management fees, other (232) (232) Amortization of special survey costs (18) (26) Depreciation (1,373) (1,373) Vessel impairment charge - (1,543) Bad debt provisions (181) (56) Operating loss (1,004) (2,841) Other (expenses) / income: Gain from debt extinguishment - 4,306 Gain from financial derivative instrument - 11 Interest and finance costs, net (699) (872) Total other (expenses) / income, net (699) 3,445 Net (loss) / income (1,703) 604 (Loss) / earnings per common share, basic and diluted ($ 0.09) $0.03 Weighted average number of common shares, basic and diluted 18,277,893 20,877,893 Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 (unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except for share and per share data)\nDecember 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents 1,693 1,427 Restricted cash, current portion 141 141 Inventories 1,016 641 Trade accounts receivable, net 703 359 Prepayments and other assets 342 465 Total current assets 3,895 3,033 FIXED ASSETS, NET: Vessels, net 115,774 112,858 Total fixed assets, net 115,774 112,858 OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS: Restricted cash, net of current portion 4,859 4,765 Financial derivative instrument - 58 Deferred charges, net 285 527 Total other non-current assets 5,144 5,350 Total assets 124,813 121,241 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES: Current portion of long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs, current 7,304 5,521 Trade accounts payable 2,293 2,832 Due to related parties 2,125 4,167 Hire collected in advance - 929 Accrued and other liabilities 809 857 Total current liabilities 12,531 14,306 NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES: Long-term debt, net of current portion and deferred financing costs, non-current 59,126 53,175 Promissory note 5,000 5,000 Total non-current liabilities 64,126 58,175 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY: Preferred stock ($0.001 par value; 50,000,000 shares authorized; none issued) - - Common stock ($0.001 par value; 450,000,000 shares authorized; 20,877,893 shares issued and outstanding at each of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018) 21 21 Additional paid-in capital 74,766 74,766 Accumulated deficit (26,631) (26,027) Total stockholders' equity 48,156 48,760 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity 124,813 121,241 Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Cash flows from operating activities: Net (loss) / income (1,703) 604 Adjustments to reconcile net (loss) / income to net cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation 1,373 1,373 Amortization of special survey costs 18 26 Amortization and write-off of financing costs 38 94 Vessel impairment charge - 1,543 Gain from debt extinguishment - (4,306) Change in fair value of financial derivative instrument - (58) Bad debt provisions 181 56 Changes in assets and liabilities: Inventories 110 375 Trade accounts receivable, net (1,468) 288 Prepayments and other assets 2 (123) Special survey cost - (268) Trade accounts payable - 574 Due to related parties 3,071 2,042 Hire collected in advance 31 929 Accrued and other liabilities 150 48 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,803 3,197 Cash flow from investing activities: Net cash provided by / (used in) investing activities - - Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from long-term debt - 20,500 Repayment of long-term debt (2,121) (23,550) Common stock offering costs - (35) Payment of financing costs - (472) Net cash used in financing activities (2,121) (3,557) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (318) (360) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of the period 5,783 6,693 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the period 5,465 6,333 Liquidity, Debt and Capital Structure\nPursuant to our loan agreements, as of March 31, 2018, we were required to maintain minimum liquidity of $4.9 million.

The remaining balance of approximately $4.3 million was written-off by the previous lender at closing, which was recorded as gain from debt extinguishment in the first quarter of 2018. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.65% per annum. The new loan is repayable in 20 quarterly installments amounting to $10.3 million in the aggregate, the first falling due in May 2018, and the last installment accompanied by a balloon payment of $10.2 million falling due in February 2023. Standard loan covenants include, among others, a minimum loan to value ratio and liquidity.\nATM Program: On March 30, 2018, we filed a prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an At-the-Market program to potentially publicly sell up to $2.3 million of our shares of common stock. To date, we have chosen not to sell any shares under this program.\nNon-GAAP Measures and Definitions\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") represents the sum of net income / (loss), interest and finance costs, depreciation and amortization and, if any, income taxes during a period. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before vessel impairment charge, gain from debt extinguishment and gain from financial derivative instrument. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under U.S. GAAP.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented in this press release as we believe that they provide investors with means of evaluating and understanding how our management evaluates operating performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures do not have standardized meanings, and are therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nThree Months Ended (In thousands of U.S. dollars) March 31, 2017 March 31, 2018 Reconciliation of Net (loss) / income to Adjusted EBITDA Net (loss) / income $ (1,703) $ 604 Depreciation 1,373 1,373 Amortization of special survey costs 18 26 Interest and finance costs, net 699 872 EBITDA $ 387 $ 2,875 Vessel impairment charge - 1,543 Gain from debt extinguishment - (4,306) Gain from financial derivative instrument - (11) Adjusted EBITDA $ 387 $ 101 Daily time charter equivalent (\"TCE\") is a shipping industry performance measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. TCE is not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We utilize TCE because we believe it is a meaningful measure to compare period-to-period changes in our performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which our vessels may be employed between the periods. Our management also utilizes TCE to assist them in making decisions regarding employment of the vessels. We calculate TCE by dividing voyage revenues after deducting voyage related costs and commissions by operating days for the relevant period. Voyage related costs and commissions primarily consist of brokerage commissions, port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract.\nVessel operating expenses (\"Opex\") per day are our vessel operating expenses for a vessel, which primarily consist of crew wages and related costs, insurance, lube oils, communications, spares and consumables, tonnage taxes as well as repairs and maintenance, divided by the ownership days in the applicable period.\nWe calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during the same period. We use fleet utilization to measure our efficiency in finding suitable employment for our vessels and minimizing the amount of days that our vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings or vessel positioning. Ownership days are the total number of days in a period during which we owned each of the vessels in our fleet. Available days are the number of ownership days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and intermediate dry-dockings and the aggregate number of days that we spent positioning our vessels during the respective period for such repairs, upgrades and surveys. Operating days are the number of available days in a period, less the aggregate number of days that our vessels were off-hire or out of service due to any reason, including technical breakdowns and unforeseen circumstances.\nRecent Daily Fleet Data: (Amounts in U.S.$) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Eco-Efficient MR2: (2 of our vessels) TCE 14,043 14,012 Opex 5,622 6,011 Utilization % 84.4% 91.7% Eco-Modified MR2: (1 of our vessels) TCE 11,050 7,861 Opex 6,347 7,568 Utilization % 97.8% 61.8% Standard MR2: (1 of our vessels) TCE 10,119 14,066 Opex 5,931 6,150 Utilization % 96.7% 100.0% Small Tankers: (2 of our vessels) TCE 4,717 4,885 Opex 4,711 5,459 Utilization % 85.0% 71.1% Fleet: (6 vessels) TCE 9,810 10,667 Opex 5,491 6,110 Utilization % 88.9% 82.0% Conference Call and Webcast\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our results at 10:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on May 14, 2018.\nParticipants should dial into the call 10 minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers:\n1 (866) 819-7111 (from the US), 0(800) 953-0329 (from the UK) or (+44) (0) 1452 542 301 (Standard International Dial In).
