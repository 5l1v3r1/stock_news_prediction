Britain's Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle attend a Service of Thanksgiving and Commemoration on ANZAC Day at Westminster Abbey in London, Britain, April 25, 2018. Eddie Mulholland/Pool via Reuters\nThe Ipsos MORI survey, which was carried out in 28 countries, found the British royals were generally viewed well, with on average 35 percent holding a favourable view compared with 11 percent with an unfavourable one.\nHowever, about half were either neutral or did not know, and the indifference was reflected in the numbers interested in Harry’s wedding at Windsor Castle on Saturday. While about one in four of those questioned were fairly interested in news about the upcoming ceremony, 67 percent were not.\nThe royals were most popular in Romania, Saudi Arabia, India and the United States and viewed most negatively in Spain and Argentina.\nThe poll found Harry, 33, and the 92-year-old queen were the most liked of the Windsors, with the prince the favourite among Britons.

Eddie Mulholland/Pool via Reuters\nThey were followed by the prince’s elder brother William and his wife Kate, who was the most liked in the United States, while Harry’s father, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, had the lowest favourability score.\nThe survey found 29 percent felt favourably about Markle, compared with 10 percent who did not, although more than 60 percent had no opinion or did not know.\n“The royal family’s international reputation is bolstered by the popularity of both the queen and members of the younger generation, which gives it a solid foundation for the future, and reflects the growing profile they have around the world,” said Gideon Skinner from Ipsos MORI.\nThe pollster said it has questioned 20,793 people aged under 65 across 28 countries for the survey.
