Tickets for the flights will be available for purchase via “various booking channels” beginning Thursday, according to the airline.\nSingapore Airlines also promises that passengers will fly in comfort, thanks to “higher ceilings, larger windows, an extra wide body and lighting designed to reduce jet lag,” as well as the aircraft’s carbon composite airframe, which will allow for optimized cabin altitude and humidity levels that will improve air quality for passengers.\nThe airline previously provided a Singapore-Newark route up until 2013, when service was suspended because the aircraft used at the time, the Airbus A340-500s, were returned to Airbus.\nDirect flights on the A350-900ULR between Singapore and Los Angeles are also in the works, according to the airline. Currently, it offers flights between New York and Frankfurt and between Los Angeles and Tokyo, among others.
