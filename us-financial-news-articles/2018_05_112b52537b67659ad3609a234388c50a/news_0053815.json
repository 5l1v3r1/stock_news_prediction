For the settlement to be valid two thirds of the creditors must vote for it.\nAfter the settlement, Agrokor will be effectively left without any recoverable assets and will need to be wound down, the crisis management team said.\nThe biggest single creditor of Agrokor is Russia’s Sberbank with loans worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion). It is set to become the biggest single shareholder in the new company after the settlement, which will also include a certain level of write-offs.\nCroatia’s deputy prime minister Martina Dalic resigned on May 14 under pressure from opposition groups who accused her of failing to prevent conflicts of interest during the restructuring of Agrokor.
