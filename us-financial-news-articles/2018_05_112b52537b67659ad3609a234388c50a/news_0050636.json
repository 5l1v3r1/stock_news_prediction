Based on Pebblebrook’s closing share price on May 18, 2018, this implies an offer price of $35.89 per LaSalle common share, representing a premium of 7.1% over Blackstone’s offer of $33.50 and a premium of 47.1% above LaSalle’s closing price on March 27, 2018, which is the day before Pebblebrook publicly disclosed its initial offer of a business combination with LaSalle.\n“Our offer is substantially superior to the merger agreement that LaSalle has reached with Blackstone,” said Jon Bortz, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. “We continue to believe that our offer maximizes immediate and long-term value for LaSalle’s shareholders. The combination of Pebblebrook and LaSalle would create a hotel industry leader, particularly in the independent and lifestyle segment, and it would allow shareholders of both companies to benefit from Pebblebrook’s management of the combined portfolio and the synergies that would result from bringing these two highly similar companies together. We are disappointed that LaSalle’s board of trustees has chosen not to pursue the unique opportunity that we presented.”\nAbout Pebblebrook Hotel Trust\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) organized to opportunistically acquire and invest primarily in upper upscale, full-service hotels located in urban markets in major gateway cities.
