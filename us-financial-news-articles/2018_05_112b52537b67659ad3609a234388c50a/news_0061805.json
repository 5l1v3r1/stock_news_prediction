According to authorities that has helped to foil around a dozen plots since.\nAt the same time, intelligence officers have found themselves increasingly focused on thwarting Chinese influence as public concern has deepened, while ties between the trading partners have soured.\nThe country’s current spy chief has warned that universities need to be “very conscious” of foreign interference - an apparent reference to China’s perceived involvement on campuses.\nThis month, the rift between the countries, opened in the wake of Australia’s foreign influence crackdown, widened.\nChina’s top diplomat rebuked Australia for applying “colored glasses” to the relationship, as Australia’s largest winemaker, Treasury Wine Estates Ltd suddenly encountered problems clearing its products through Chinese customs.\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:11:28.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
