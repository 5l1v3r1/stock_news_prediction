That ‎exceeded the ‎‎$11.3 billion average estimate of 17 analysts noted Akita Matsui Trading analysts. ‎\nThe owner of WeChat, the ‎China's most popular social-networking ‎platform, has ‎reported solid revenue growth in every quarter in the last two years. The impressive ‎performance was due to strength in its core ‎businesses as well as the cloud ‎computing, online entertainment and ‎payments segments.‎\nThe company also raised its second quarter revenue forecast to growth of ‎‎57 to 63 ‎percent, topping the most optimistic of analyst estimates. ‎\nCommenting on the results, Chief Research‎ Analyst at Akita Matsui Trading , Omori Matsuyo said: \"Tencent has made some high-profile investments in ‎recent months, which ‎made substantial contributions to it top line growth ‎over the first quarter.\"‎\nBy noon, Tencent shares were up 5 percent in ‎the benchmark Hang Seng ‎Index, adding $22 billion to the ‎company's market capitalization. They had ‎increased as much as 10 ‎percent in May, hitting a lifetime ‎closing peak of ‎HK$416 in Hong Kong. ‎\nTencent posted a 61 percent jump in quarterly net profit, which was reported ‎at 23.29 billion yuan ($3.66 billion), ‎beating forecasts of 17.5 billion yuan, ‎though revenues from some ‎product lines grew slower than expected. ‎\nMax Harrington, Head of Corporate Equities at Akita Matsui Trading added: \"Fueled by ‎‎advertising and online games, digital content subscriptions remain a ‎‎booming business and we don't see any signs of slow down or ‎deterioration. ‎Even on the domestic front, Tencent has continued to grow massively ‎‎similar to its rivals, such as Alibaba.\"‎\nTencent's strong metrics were also led by the company's forays into ‎multiple markets. ‎The Shenzhen-based firm has been looking for fresh ‎revenues streams such as its newly launched ‎mini games platform. The positive sentiment has ‎continued this year, with ‎Tencent's stock price ‎surging over 15 percent YTD ‎in 2018.‎\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-beats-forecasts-as-profit-surges-60-in-first-quarter-reports-akita-matsui-trading-300651274.html\nSOURCE Akita Matsui Trading", "external_links": ["https://www.amtrading-corp.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-beats-forecasts-as-profit-surges-60-in-first-quarter-reports-akita-matsui-trading-300651274.html"], "published": "2018-05-19T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T02:29:18.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
