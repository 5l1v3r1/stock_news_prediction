We surveyed patient-level details from over 4200 transplant recipients at 50 medical centers to determine what factors predict post-transplant adenovirus infection. We also looked at different ways to measure viral load in order to assess the potential impact on mortality. The AdVance data demonstrated that, among the 240 pediatric patients who had adenovirus detected in the blood, observed mortality increased by 10-fold as the adenovirus burden increased, especially when measured by adenovirus Average Area Under the Curve – AdV AAUC 0-16 . We now have the opportunity to model potential outcomes for the control arm of our AdAPT trial, and have increased confidence that AdV AAUC 0-16 is an ideal endpoint for the AdAPT study,” said M. Michelle Berrey, MD, MPH, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chimerix.\n“With AdAPT site initiations underway and the AdVance data in-hand, we are now focusing on execution of this 141-patient trial and anticipate data read-out in the second half of 2019. A first potential indication in treatment of adenovirus in pediatric transplant builds on the benefits we believe oral brinci will bring to patient care. In parallel, IV brincidofovir is progressing in adult transplant recipients, and we anticipate interim Phase 2 data in the second half of 2018,” continued Dr. Berrey. “In addition, our norovirus antiviral, CMX521, is completing the fourth cohort in the single ascending dose study. The first oral presentation on CMX521 will be at the International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR) in June.”\n“Finally, we recently announced several key additions to our Board of Directors and elected our longest-serving independent director, Martha Demski, as our Chair. The new board members have combined experience in public health, regulatory affairs and corporate strategy that will be invaluable as the Company advances brincidofovir toward commercialization,” concluded Dr. Berrey.\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nAdVance Shows Ten-Fold Mortality Risk in Patients with Highest AdV Burden\nChimerix presented data from AdVance, the first multi-national, multi-center study of adenovirus (AdV) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients at the 44th Annual Meeting of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) in Lisbon, Portugal. Data were also featured at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Madrid, Spain. Conducted in 2017, the study examined the incidence, practice patterns, hospitalization and clinical outcomes of 4,276 (1,738 pediatric, 2,538 adults) allo-HCT recipients.\nIn this landmark study, measures of AdV burden, and specifically the AdAPT primary endpoint of AdV Average Area Under the Curve from zero to sixteen weeks (AdV AAUC 0-16 ), were strongly correlated with risk of mortality within six months. In fact, over half of the patients in the group with the highest AdV burden died within six months of AdV diagnosis, confirming previously reported mortality estimates in transplant recipients.\nAdVance data showed that:\nApproximately one-third of the pediatric allo-HCT recipients developed an AdV infection in the first six months following allo-HCT; Among pediatric allo-HCT recipients with AdV, nearly three-fourths (395/558) developed detectable AdV viremia (virus in the blood); and Nearly two-thirds (241/395) of these patients developed AdV viremia greater than 1,000 copies/mL, a level previously associated with negative clinical outcomes in single-center studies.\n“The robust findings of the AdVance study are extremely important for transplant clinicians, as we seek to better understand the rates and clinical outcomes of adenovirus infection, and to assess ways to evaluate antiviral therapies,” said Marco Zecca, MD, pediatric hematologist and oncologist at Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo and an investigator in the AdVance study.\nThe 60 pediatric patients with the lowest AdV AAUC 0-16 had an observed mortality rate of 3%, compared with over 50% mortality for the 60 patients with the highest AdV AAUC 0-16 . Using these data to model the impact of AdV AAUC 0-16 on clinical outcomes, patients with the highest AdV viral burden had a greater than 10-fold increase in the hazard for mortality. Based on the findings from AdVance, each increase of 1.0 log 10 in AdV AAUC 0-16 predicts a two-fold increase in mortality, independent of immune reconstitution. These data increase confidence that AdAPT’s primary virologic endpoint (AdV AAUC 0-16 ) is clinically relevant.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nChimerix reported a net loss of $19.8 million, or $0.42 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018.
