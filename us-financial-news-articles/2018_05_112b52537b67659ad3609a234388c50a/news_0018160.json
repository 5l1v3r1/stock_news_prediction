(OTCQB: HGBL, CSE: HGP) (“Heritage Global,” “HGI” or “the Company”), a value-driven, innovative leader in corporate and financial asset liquidation transactions, valuations and advisory services, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 as summarized below.\n($ in thousands, except per share amounts) Quarter Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 Revenue Services revenue (1) $ 5,039 $ 4,462 Asset sales (2) 775 571 Total revenue 5,814 5,033 Gross profit 4,986 3,681 Operating income 1,405 394 Net income 1,289 255 Net income per share – basic and diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.01 (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) (3) EBITDA $ 1,489 $ 360 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,550 $ 541 (1)\nServices revenue represents revenue generated from activities in which Heritage Global acted as an agent by either brokering a transaction or providing some other fee-based service.\n(2)\nAsset sales represent revenue generated from activities in which Heritage Global acted in a principal capacity, reselling assets that it had purchased.\n(3)\nDefinitions and disclosures regarding non-GAAP financial information including reconciliations are included at the end of the press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary of Financial Results:\nTotal revenues were $5.8 million, compared to the year ago first quarter level of $5.0 million, representing an increase of 16%. The year-over-year growth in total revenues reflects the timing and magnitude of certain asset liquidation transactions and a higher volume of deals for the NLEX division. Services revenue increased 13% to $5.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, while asset sales revenue increased 36% to $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $0.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit, or total revenue net of costs of revenues, increased 35% to $5.0 million from the year ago first quarter level of $3.7 million, due principally to higher services revenue and improved gross margin on the asset sales, which together, resulted in a $0.5 million, or 39%, year-over-year reduction in the cost of total revenue. During the first quarter, Heritage Global completed a number of successful global online sales, including projects for Pfizer, Amgen, Lightsail and Pharmakea. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3.5 million, compared to $3.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was largely attributable to variable compensation arrangements. Operating income more than tripled to $1.4 million from the year ago first quarter level of $0.4 million. Heritage Global reported net income of $1.3 million, or net income of $0.05 per share, compared to net income of approximately $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The continued financial improvement in Heritage Global’s operations is the result of its strong performance of its asset liquidation business line, coupled with continued operational discipline. As a result, 2018 first quarter net income rose 405%, compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, a commonly used non-GAAP financial measure, was $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a supplemental tool to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis and should be considered together with Heritage Global’s GAAP financial measures.\nHeritage Global Chief Executive Officer, Ross Dove, stated, “Heritage Global began fiscal 2018 on a strong note with solid first quarter performance. The successful execution of our strategies to grow the top-line, coupled with our continued cost management initiatives, resulted in significant gross margin improvement and first quarter operating income and net income growth of 257% and 405%, respectively.\n“Our divisions are maturing together into a very synergistic and seamless platform. Clients globally are reaping the benefits of our integrated valuation and disposition platforms working across asset classes from enterprise sales to capital assets to real estate to financial assets as well as patents and trademarks. We are excited to have Heritage on a clear path to execute its strategy of full service value creation.\n“In closing, we are extremely pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter and expect the positive momentum to continue throughout 2018. We believe that our platform of innovative global asset solutions, combined with our industry-wide reputation for delivering exceptional service to a growing base of global clients, will allow us to generate sustainable operating profits as we undertake the next phase of growth for the Company. We remain confident that Heritage Global’s ongoing initiatives to improve top and bottom-line performance, combined with the prudent management of our capital structure, are a formula for sustained long term financial growth and the enhancement of shareholder value.”\nDefinitions and Disclosures Regarding non-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EBITDA reflects the standard definition of EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, interest and other expense, and provision for income taxes), plus or minus fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and plus stock-based compensation. Management believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to make operating and strategic decisions and to evaluate the Company’s performance. The Company has disclosed this non-GAAP financial measure so that investors have the same financial data that management uses, with the intention of assisting investors to make comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and analyze its underlying performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental tool to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis. The use of Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, any GAAP financial measure. You should carefully evaluate the financial information cited in the tables at the end of this news announcement which reconciles GAAP reported net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented herein.\nAbout Heritage Global Inc.
