Analysts on average were forecasting $2.74 billion.\nNet profit fell to $26 million, or 23 cents per share, from a profit of $38.6 million, or 33 cents a share, a year ago, because of an accounting adjustment related to the Euroimmun acquisition.\nRevenue for the quarter jumped 25 percent to $644 million, helped by favorable foreign exchange rates and the contribution from diagnostics company Euroimmun. That figure also topped Wall Street expectations of $619.6 million.\nConcerns that trade and tariff issues between China and the United States could hurt medical devices and tools are not likely to negatively impact PerkinElmer in its important Chinese market, Friel said.\nMost PerkinElmer products intended for use in China are either manufactured in China or Europe, he explained.\n“We didn’t see any slowdowns,” Friel said, adding that the company sees 2018 sales from China approaching $600 million.\nDiscovery & Analytical Solutions sales grew 10 percent to $396.5 million, while the Diagnostics unit, which now includes Euroimmun, saw sale jump 62 percent to $247.5 million.
