May 16, 2018; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones (10) hits a home run in the first inning against the Philadelphia Phillies at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sports\nOrioles center fielder Adam Jones recently won an auction to purchase the former home of Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr., according to The Athletic.\nHowever, the Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal reported Thursday that the real-estate transaction won’t impact Jones’ future baseball plans. Jones will be a marquee free agent at the end of the current season.\nThe 8,545-square-foot Reisterstown, Md., home on 25 acres was valued at $12.5 million in 2016, but the price dropped below $10 million last year.\nThe amount of Jones’ winning bid was not announced, but The Athletic reported it was “a fraction” of the original listing price. Daniel DeCaro of DeCaro Auctions told mansionglobal.com that the price was the highest paid in Baltimore County this year. That would put it over $2,825,000. Apr 3, 2017; Baltimore, MD, USA; Baltimore Orioles infielder Ryan Flaherty (L) talks to former shortstop Cal Ripken, Jr. (C) prior to the game against the Toronto Blue Jays at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Mandatory Credit: Evan Habeeb-USA TODAY Sports\nThe sale is due to be finalized June 11.\nJones, 32, reportedly has invested in properties in multiple cities, and he has the bank balance to allow for the side interest. He is completing the last year of a six-year, $85.5 million contract, and he has made nearly $100 million in salary as a major-leaguer.\nA five-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner, Jones is in his 11th season with the Orioles. He played for the Seattle Mariners in 2006 and 2007 before he and four other players were swapped to Baltimore in February 2008 in exchange for left-handed pitcher Erik Bedard.\nRipken played his entire 21-year career in Baltimore. He is best known for his streak of playing 2,632 consecutive game, breaking Lou Gehrig’s record. Ripken, a two-time American League MVP and 19-time All-Star, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2007.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:16:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
