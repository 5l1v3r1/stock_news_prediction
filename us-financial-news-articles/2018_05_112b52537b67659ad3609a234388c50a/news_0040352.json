Ananthasubramanian and the two PNB executives did not reply to multiple calls and messages seeking comment.\nThe charges filed on Monday are the first formal ones to be filed in the sprawling case that has stunned investors, shaken the Indian banking sector and prompted a major regulatory crackdown.\nPNB, India’s second-largest state-run bank, said in February that the two jewellery groups led by Modi and his uncle Choksi had defrauded it by raising credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks using illegal guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff over several years.\nPNB has been conducting a separate internal probe into the fraud and has already suspended over 20 officials.\nThe fraud this week dragged PNB into a $1.98 billion fourth-quarter net loss, the worst loss ever recorded by an Indian bank.
