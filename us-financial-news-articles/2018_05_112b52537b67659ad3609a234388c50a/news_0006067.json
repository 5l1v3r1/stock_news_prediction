The drilling campaign produced exceptional drill results and the $10 million we invested in the research and development of our properties has already began to bear fruit with an extremely positive PEA on our Zgounder property previously announced in March. We were also able to increase our silver production in 2017 by 0.87% despite the fact that the Zgounder Mine’s water supply pipelines were washed out following unusually heavy rainfall for approximately two months. The exercise of 28,016,217 warrants in 2017 infused over $6.2 million of positive capital into the Corporation. Looking ahead, 2018 is an exciting year for Maya with the upcoming PEA on our Boumaâdine property and the increase in production at our Zgounder Mine to 500 t/day in Q3 2018, a slight delay due to unusual weather including snow and extreme cold.
