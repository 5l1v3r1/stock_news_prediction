Penal Forum said there were now 355 “political prisoners” in total in Venezuela.\nThe Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Maduro government, which rejects use of the term “political prisoner,” has said all politicians and members of the security forces in detention face legitimate criminal charges, including coup-plotting.\nInternal military documents show arrests have been rising sharply within the armed forces, where there is discontent within the ranks, especially at food shortages and dwindling salaries due to Venezuela’s crushing economic crisis.\nDocuments recently reviewed by Reuters showed the number of new detentions of soldiers for treason, rebellion and desertion rose to 172 in the first four months of 2018, up 3-1/2 times over the same period last year.\nPenal Forum says at least 48 military officials, including the group of 15, have been arrested this year.\nMaduro, a 55-year-old former bus driver who succeeded Hugo Chavez in 2013, says he is the victim of a U.S.-led conspiracy to topple him and take over Venezuela’s oil reserves.\nReporting by Vivian Sequera; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T01:44:48.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
