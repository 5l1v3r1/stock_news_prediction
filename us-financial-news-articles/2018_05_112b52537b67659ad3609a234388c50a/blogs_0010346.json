This includes content integrations with tools like Box, Microsoft Corp.’s OneDrive and Dropbox, according to the post.\nThe Workplace update enables business users to connect to other cloud apps they use on the job.

The company last week reported a net income gain during the latest quarter of 63%, to nearly $5 billion, compared with $3.06 billion a year ago, while revenue rose nearly 50% to $11.97 billion.\nMr. Codorniou said the Facebook has built security controls into Workplace integrations.\nSoftware integrations on the enterprise version are extensively reviewed, both internally and through a third-party security audit, he said. Systems administrators also retain full control over any integrations enabled on the tool, and can review data access permissions and manage all integrations, he added.\nThe goal, he added, is to position the tool to become a “closed and highly curated directory” of a company’s core business software that acts as the main hub for worker collaboration, he said.\nShare this: CORPORATE SOCIAL NETWORKS FACEBOOK Previous The Morning Download: Cloud Giants Experience Even Faster Growth Rates", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T21:18:44.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
