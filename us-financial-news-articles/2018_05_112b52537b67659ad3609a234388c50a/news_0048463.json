Chilli is also sold in local markets and supplied to supermarkets.\nMany of the new farmers also have turned to eating the vitamin-rich peppers at home – often fried with onions and meat – in a dietary change for families in the region.\nNow, “when children are asked to fetch vegetables from the farm, they also fetch chilli as to them it is part and parcel of their diet,” Ole Kapurua said.\nPaul Rangenga a chilli farming expert who has been advising farmers on taking up the crop and who runs a produce company, said he believes chilli can provide a workable alternative for herders dealing with worsening drought stress.\n“Chilli farming is a long-term form of investment and the risks involved are minimal as the crops are drought resistant and well adapted to arid regions,” he said.\nReporting by Caroline Wambui ; editing by Laurie Goering : Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.
