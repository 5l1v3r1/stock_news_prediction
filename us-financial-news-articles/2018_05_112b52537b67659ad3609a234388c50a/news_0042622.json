It expects to ask shareholders for approval of the transaction this summer.\nThe company has declined to comment on reports that Comcast Corp is preparing a rival all-cash offer for the same Fox assets.\nThe new Fox will house assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and sports cable networks, the company said.
