While the time constraints of the heating season prevented us from finalizing our testing, our partner remains interested in our patented Duplex technology and we are very optimistic our technology will prevail, as it has in all other commercial installations.\"\nAs previously announced, ClearSign is working with a large state-owned enterprise (SOE) to install and demonstrate ClearSign's innovative Duplex™ technology in one of its boilers. The project is a joint collaboration with ClearSign handling the design and oversight of the fabrication by the local partner.\nDuring this initial phase of testing, the Company's experts determined substantial burner modifications are necessary to simplify the delivery of gas and air to provide an ideal operating environment for ClearSign's Duplex technology to achieve ultra-low NOx emissions. The level of modification is consistent with previous initial installations for customers in other verticals. Making the modifications to their existing equipment remains a key motivation for the customer because of the potential cost-savings of retrofitting versus replacing the existing burners.\nThe Company believes that once the first installation is successful, the time required for subsequent installations will be dramatically reduced, consistent with its experience in other verticals. This is relevant to note, as the the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with this customer specifies after successful completion of the pilot test, the parties will move to negotiate a subsequent definitive agreement to retro-fit multiple boilers within the district's operational footprint of more than 1,000 units.\nChina's heating season traditionally restarts in the fourth quarter. ClearSign intends to use the time before the restart to work with the customer on multiple options to demonstrate the Duplex technology and satisfy the testing requirements as soon as practical.\n\"While this initial project has taken longer than originally planned, the Chinese market remains a vast and important opportunity for ClearSign,\" said Steve Pirnat. \"Unlike our domestic market, there is clear and urgent government mandate driving adoption of Low NOx technologies like Duplex.\"\nAs previously disclosed during the Q4 2017 conference call, the Company is actively engaged in advanced discussions with additional customers in China in the refinery and petrochemical industries. \"We look forward to providing shareholders with updates on our progress in China in the coming months,\" said Pirnat.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call Announcement\nClearSign will be filling their 10-Q and putting out a release regarding the Company's First Quarter results ended March 31, 2018 prior to the call.\nClearSign invites you to a conference call discussing the Company's First Quarter on Wednesday, May 23, 2018 at 4:30 PM Eastern Time .
