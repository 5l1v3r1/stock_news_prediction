(NASDAQ:AAOI), a leading provider of fiber-optic access network products for the internet datacenter, cable broadband, telecom and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) markets, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We achieved revenue in the first quarter of $65.2 million, which was slightly below our guidance as we were unable to complete some orders in the quarter due to higher than expected employee turnover in our China factory as a result of the Lunar New Year holiday. These orders have been shipped in Q2. In the first quarter, we made good progress in diversifying our customer base with nine design wins, including five for our 100G products,” said Dr. Thompson Lin, Applied Optoelectronics Inc. founder and CEO. “Overall, market trends in the quarter were inline with our expectations and we expect improving demand as we progress throughout the year, with 100G demand expected to more than double in the second half of 2018 compared to the first.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\nTotal revenue was $65.2 million, compared with $96.2 million in the first quarter 2017 and $79.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP gross margin was 39.6%, compared with 43.1% in the first quarter 2017 and 40.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.0%, compared with 43.2% in the first quarter 2017 and 41.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net income was $2.1 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with net income of $19.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share in the first quarter 2017, and net income of $5.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income was $5.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $21.8 million, or $1.10 per diluted share in the first quarter 2017, and non-GAAP net income of $17.9 million, or $0.89 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nA reconciliation between all GAAP and non-GAAP information referenced above is contained in the tables below.

Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and current expectations, which could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: reduction in the size or quantity of customer orders; change in demand for the company's products due to industry conditions; changes in manufacturing operations; volatility in manufacturing costs; delays in shipments of products; disruptions in the supply chain; change in the rate of design wins or the rate of customer acceptance of new products; the company's reliance on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues; potential pricing pressure; a decline in demand for our customers' products or their rate of deployment of their products; general conditions in the internet datacenter, cable television (CATV) broadband, telecom, or fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) markets; changes in the world economy (particularly in the United States and China); changes in the regulation and taxation of international trade, including the imposition of tariffs; changes in currency exchange rates; the negative effects of seasonality; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in the company's documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about these and other risks that may impact the company's business are set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the company's quarterly and annual reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"target,\" \"seek,\" \"aim,\" \"believe,\" \"predicts,\" \"think,\" \"objectives,\" \"optimistic,\" \"new,\" \"goal,\" \"strategy,\" \"potential,\" \"is likely,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"plan\" \"project,\" \"permit\" or by other similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to us as of the date hereof, and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this press release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe provide non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP earnings per share to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our overall operating performance. To arrive at our non-GAAP gross margin, we exclude stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses, if any, from our GAAP gross margin. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income (loss), we exclude all amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses, if any, from our GAAP net income (loss). Included in our non-recurring expenses in Q1 2018 are depreciation on certain equipment undergoing reconfiguration, certain consulting fees, employee severance expenses, certain non-recurring charges related to cancelled programs, and tax benefits associated with income tax rate changes in Taiwan. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated by dividing our non-GAAP net income by the fully diluted share count. We believe that our non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\nWe believe that elimination of items such as stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses is appropriate because treatment of these items may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance; We believe that non-GAAP measures provide better comparability with our past financial performance, period-to-period results and with our peer companies, many of which also use similar non-GAAP financial measures; and We anticipate that investors and securities analysts will utilize non-GAAP measures to evaluate our overall operating performance.\nA reconciliation of our GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP earnings per share for Q1 2018 to our non-GAAP net income (loss) and earnings per share is provided below, together with corresponding reconciliations for the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), earnings per share, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such other non-GAAP measures in the same manner. We have not reconciled the non-GAAP measures included in our guidance to the appropriate GAAP financial measures because the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. GAAP measures that impact our non-GAAP financial measures may include stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses, amortization of intangible assets, unrealized exchange loss (gain), asset impairment charges, and loss (gain) from disposal of idle assets. These GAAP measures cannot be reasonably predicted and may directly impact our non-GAAP gross margin, our non-GAAP net income and our non-GAAP fully-diluted earnings per share, although changes with respect to certain of these measures may offset other changes. In addition, certain of these measures are out of our control. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.\nAbout Applied Optoelectronics\nApplied Optoelectronics Inc.
