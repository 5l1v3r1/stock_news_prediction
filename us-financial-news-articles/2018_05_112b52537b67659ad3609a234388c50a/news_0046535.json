That could pose a hazard to jet engines if it blows into aircraft routes around 30,000 feet (9,144 meters).\nThere have been no reported injuries or deaths since the latest eruption began on May 3.\nLava crossed a road on Friday near the Leilani Gardens housing development in lower Puna district, cutting off around 40 homes and forcing the helicopter evacuation of four residents by Hawaii National Guard, authorities said.\nAround 2,000 residents of Leilani Estates and Laipuna Gardens housing areas have faced mandatory evacuations due to at least 22 volcanic cracks that have opened since May 3.\nMany thousands more residents of the area have voluntarily left their homes due to life-threatening levels of toxic sulfur dioxide gas spewing from vents in the volcanic fissures.\nA further 2,000 residents of coastal communities may face compulsory evacuation if lava from the fissures blocks the oceanside Highway 137.
