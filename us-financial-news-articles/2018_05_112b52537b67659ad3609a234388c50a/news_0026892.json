Bryant advanced to second when Barraclough bounced a pitch into the dirt and moved to third on a groundout by Anthony Rizzo.\nWith the infield in, Victor Caratini hit a grounder at Marlins second baseman Starlin Castro, who took too long to get the ball out of his glove, allowing Bryant to narrowly beat the throw home.\nIt was the first run allowed by Barraclough since April 23, a span of six relief outings.\nBoth starters took no-decisions.\nMiami’s Jose Urena allowed seven hits and three runs in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out six and left with the score tied 3-3.\nCubs starter Jen-Ho Tseng lasted just two innings, allowing four hits and three runs. Tseng, a 23-year-old rookie from Taiwan, was making just his second major league start. He was used in place of Yu Darvish, who was placed on the disabled list due to the flu.\nMiami opened the scoring with three runs in the first. After the first two batters were retired, the Marlins pieced together four consecutive hits —Castro’s single, Justin Bour’s two-run homer, Brian Anderson’s double and Derek Dietrich’s RBI two-bagger.\nChicago cut the deficit to 3-2 in the second. Caratini hit a leadoff single and advanced to third on Ian Happ’s two-out single. Both runners scored on a double by rookie pinch hitter David Bote, who was recalled from the minors earlier Tuesday when Jason Heyward was placed on the disabled list due to a concussion.\nThe Marlins nearly added to their lead in the fourth. Dietrich was hit by a pitch, advanced on a groundout and tried to score from second on Lewis Brinson’s single. However, Chicago right fielder Ben Zobrist’s throw to catcher Caratini caught Dietrich in plenty of time.\nBoth benches cleared after Dietrich and Caratini had a mild collision at the plate, but there were no punches or ejections.\nChicago tied the score 3-3 in the sixth. Bryant was hit by the first pitch of the inning. He advanced to third on Rizzo’s hit-and-run single and scored on Caratini’s RBI groundout.\nAfter Chicago took the lead in the eighth, closer Brandon Morrow pitched a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season. The win went to Carl Edwards Jr. (1-0), who pitched a scoreless eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:21:36.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
