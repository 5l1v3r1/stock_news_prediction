As a rugby player it doesn’t change me who I am as a person. I’m the same person when I go on the field.”\nFolau, whose RA contract expires at the end of the season, refused to clarify his future but said he will not hold grudges against the governing body.\n“In terms of contract talks, it’s something that my management deal with,” he added.\n“You can’t hold grudges, you can’t take it personally. I’ve been fine with how everything has rolled out the last month and my focus is getting back out there on the field.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:29:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
