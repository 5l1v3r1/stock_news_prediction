Fifty-year yields were around 1 basis point higher on the day, compared with a 3 basis point rise for benchmark 10-year debt.\nThe syndication was led by Barclays, Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs International and NatWest Markets, who acted as joint bookrunners.\nBritain’s DMO aims to raise at least 18.0 billion pounds through four gilt syndications this financial year, including at least 9.5 billion pounds via conventional issuance and 8.5 billion pounds through index-linked bonds.\nTotal gross gilt issuance for 2018/19 is pencilled in at 106 billion pounds. British public sector net borrowing fell last year to its lowest as a share of national income since 2001/02.
