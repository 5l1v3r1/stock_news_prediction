China denies this, and says Taiwan is a part of China with no right to formal diplomatic ties with any other country.\nChina’s hostility to Taiwan has grown since President Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016, as Beijing fears she wishes to push for the island’s formal independence, a red line for China. She says she wants to maintain the status quo.
