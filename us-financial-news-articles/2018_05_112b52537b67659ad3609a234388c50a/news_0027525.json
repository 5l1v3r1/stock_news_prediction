Photo: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg News A decade after the financial crisis , The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight Blythe Masters and Gary Gorton .\nBlythe Masters helped create credit-default swaps, a derivative that many on Wall Street hailed as a groundbreaking innovation before it played a major role in the 2008 financial meltdown.\nNow, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive is focusing on another potentially transformative but unproven idea: blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin.\nBlockchain combines powerful tools from the world of secret codes and code-breaking with a decentralized network to form a secure record of transactions in cyberspace.\nRelated Yale Professor Who Had Controversial Role in the Crisis Now Teaches About It Daniel Tarullo, the Regulator Banks Loved to Hate, Heads Back to Campus British Lord Who Helped Stem the Financial Crisis Now Fishing in Scotland John Paulson, Architect of Greatest Trade Ever, Hit by Losses, Redemptions David Einhorn Finds Victories More Elusive Since Winning Lehman Bet Ben Bernanke Loosens Up During His Post-Crisis Years Ex-Iceland Leader Now Hosting Movie Nights as Ambassador to the U.S . Where Are They Now: The Biggest Figures From the Financial Crisis Enthusiasts say it could modernize everything from Walmart Inc.’s supply chain to the often clunky systems behind oil and metals trading. Skeptics say blockchain is wildly hyped and less efficient than the databases that businesses often already use to maintain records.\nMs. Masters, 49 years old, was an early Wall Street convert to cryptocurrencies. In 2015, she became chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings LLC, a startup looking to bring blockchain to traditional financial firms like banks and exchanges, before most bankers and traders embraced the technology.\nDigital Asset has raised about $115 million from investors and employs more than 140 people, making it one of the biggest blockchain startups. In December, it scored a win when it was chosen by Australia’s main stock exchange to revamp its technology for clearing and settling trades.\nMs. Masters, now CEO of Digital Assets Holdings, speaking at the Singapore Fintech Conference in November 2016.

She helped arrange some of the first credit-default swap or CDS trades in the 1990s, pitching the newfangled products to clients such as American International Group Inc.\nIn a CDS transaction, the buyer makes periodic payments to the seller, in exchange for a payout in case some third company can’t make its debt payments. In the 2000s—after Ms. Masters had moved on to other areas—the swaps became a popular way for banks to offload the risks associated with subprime mortgages, fueling a massive real-estate bubble.\nMs. Masters testifying before a Senate panel in December 2009 on derivatives and systemic risk in the financial sector.

Even though Ms. Masters hadn’t sold the insurance giant any swaps linked to subprime mortgages, her reputation suffered. Vanity Fair magazine listed her among the “100 to Blame” for the financial crisis.\nMs. Masters declined to be interviewed. She has said that problems during the financial crisis stemmed from the misuse of credit-default swaps, not the concept itself.\n“It is important to distinguish between tools and their users,” she said in a 2008 speech.\nWrite to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThe first credit-default swaps were pitched to clients such as American International Group Inc.
