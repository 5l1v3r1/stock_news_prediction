It sentenced her to death earlier this month.\nThe case has drawn condemnation by the United Nations and international rights groups who have said Hussein is a victim of child marriage and acted in self-defense.\n“Let it be known here today that Noura was a victim of child marriage, forced marriage, rape and denial of justice,” said a statement by Hussein’s defense team passed on to Equality Now.\n“Noura and indeed the women and girls of Sudan have too often been treated as chattels to be traded and given away as though they are property and as though they have no rights,” it said.\nAfter her marriage ceremony, Hussein refused to have sex with her husband who raped her as three of his male relatives restrained her.\nA day later, as he attempted to rape her again and she struggled to stop him, she stabbed and killed him.\nHussein had a 15-day period to appeal following her sentencing on May 10.\nCelebrities from model Naomi Campbell to actresses Emma Watson and Mira Sorvino have promoted an online campaign to rescue the teenager, adopting the hashtag #JusticeForNoura in Twitter messages of support.\n“Her life hangs in the balance,” said Sorvino in a tweet on Tuesday.\nShe urged her fans to sign an online petition calling on the government of Sudan not to execute Hussein. The petition on Change.org has garnered more than 1.1 million signatures.\nAgencies UN Women, UN Population Fund and the UN Office of the Special Advisor on Africa have all appealed to President Omar Hassan al-Bashir’s government for clemency for Hussein.\nSudan is ranked 165 out of 188 countries on the U.N.’s Gender Inequality Index, which measures how women fare compared to men in terms of access to health, education, political participation and employment opportunities.\nUN Women says violence against women and girls is prevalent in Sudan. Marital rape and child marriage are not considered crimes in the predominately Muslim African nation.\nReporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
