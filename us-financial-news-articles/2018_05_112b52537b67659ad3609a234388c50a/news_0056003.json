Israel disputes this.\nThe ministry’s report included a call for the EU to “immediately halt funding to organisations which promote anti-Israel boycotts and delegitimisation”.\nThe study cited a Norwegian NGO and two Palestinian recipients of EU funds as having links with groups considered by the EU, the United States and Israel to be terrorist organisations.\nIt said Norwegian People’s Aid received 1.76 million euros from the EU in 2016. The group, which also obtained funding from the USAID development agency, was fined $2 million last month by the United States.\nSettling a lawsuit with the U.S. Justice Ministry, the NGO acknowledged violating terms of its USAID grant by training representatives of Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine as part of a youth leadership project in Gaza.\nWriting by Jeffrey Heller; Additional reporting by Dan Williams; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T11:09:43.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
