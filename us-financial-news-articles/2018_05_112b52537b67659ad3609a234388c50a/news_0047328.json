FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Serie A - Torino vs Inter Milan - Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, Turin, Italy - April 8, 2018 Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi reacts after a missed chance REUTERS/Massimo Pinca\nSampaoli named just four forwards in his squad with Lionel Messi, Paulo Dybala, Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain all selected.\nThat meant there was no place for Icardi, who scored 29 league goals for Inter Milan this season.\nAlthough Argentina boast some of world football’s most prolific strikers, they have struggled for goals in competitive matches, scoring just 19 times in the South American group’s 18 qualifying matches. Only Bolivia scored fewer.\nArgentina, who lost in the World Cup final four years ago but only qualified for this year’s tournament thanks to a win in their final qualifying match, have been drawn in Group D alongside Iceland, Croatia and Nigeria.
