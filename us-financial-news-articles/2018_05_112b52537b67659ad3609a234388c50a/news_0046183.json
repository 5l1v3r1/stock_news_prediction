Mr. Piwowar plans to leave the SEC by July.\nIf nominated and confirmed, Mr. Roisman, 37 years old, would join a long list of former banking committee staffers who have filled top slots at the five-member commission, including Mr. Piwowar and two other sitting commissioners: Kara Stein, a Democrat, and Hester Peirce, a Republican.\nMr. Roisman and a White House spokeswoman didn’t respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the banking panel declined to comment.\nBefore joining the Senate banking staff in 2014, Mr. Roisman served as an aide to former SEC commissioner Daniel Gallagher, with a focus on trading and markets issues. He previously worked at the New York Stock Exchange, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nAs chief counsel, Mr. Roisman has played a key role in the development and drafting of bipartisan legislation aimed at rolling back the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. The Senate approved the legislation in March and the House is expected to sign off on it this week.\nMs. Stein is also expected to leave the SEC in the coming months, though she has yet to announce her departure plans. Her term expired last year but she can remain at the commission until the end of this year.\n—Dave Michaels contributed to this article.\nWrite to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:32:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
