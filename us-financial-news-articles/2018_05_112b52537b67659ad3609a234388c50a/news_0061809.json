Soccer Football - International Friendly - Argentina vs Haiti - La Bombonera, Buenos Aires, Argentina - May 29, 2018 Argentina's Lionel Messi REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci\nBeaten finalists four years ago in Brazil, Argentina struggled in the qualifiers, only securing their ticket with a win in their final match, but they were far too strong for a Haiti side 103 places below them in the FIFA rankings.\nLionel Messi took on his usual role as the star of the show, scoring a hat-trick and setting up the fourth for Sergio Aguero, who came off the bench to combine well with the Barcelona striker and Christian Pavon, another second half substitute.\nMessi opened the scoring from the penalty spot after 17 minutes before doubling Argentina’s lead 12 minutes into the second half with a simple tap-in after the keeper could only parry a header.\nHe scored his third after 65 minutes and set up Aguero two minutes later to slot home a fourth as Argentina ran amok at Boca Juniors’ home stadium in the country’s capital.
