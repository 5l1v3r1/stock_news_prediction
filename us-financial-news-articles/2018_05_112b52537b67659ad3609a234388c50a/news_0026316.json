This is in addition to the existing share repurchase authorization approved in February 2017, under which approximately $61 million remained available for repurchases as of May 9, 2018.\nAny repurchases under the new and existing program will be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. The share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common shares, and it may be suspended or terminated at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. Repurchases under the share repurchase program are permitted to be made under one or more Rule 10b5-1 plans, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under applicable insider trading laws.\n“Our Board of Directors and management believe that Masonite’s shares are an attractive investment opportunity. We believe our strong balance sheet and expected cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in internal and external opportunities, strengthen our business and create shareholder value,” said Fred Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nAbout Masonite\nMasonite International Corporation is a leading global designer and manufacturer of interior and exterior doors for the residential new construction; the residential repair, renovation and remodeling; and the non-residential building construction markets.
