The Associated Press report did not indicate if Canada would also be hit with the tariffs.\nIn addition to discussing the matter on Wednesday with French President Emmanuel Macron , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also spoke by phone with the premiers of Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.\nThe Prime Minister's Office said they \"all agreed to continue to defend the Canadian steel and aluminum industry from unwarranted tariffs and to stand up for the best interests of all Canadian workers and businesses.\"\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who pushed the steel and NAFTA issues during her meeting on Tuesday in Washington with U.S. trade czar Robert Lighthizer, has also made it clear that Canada would retaliate if the duties are imposed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:10:35.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
