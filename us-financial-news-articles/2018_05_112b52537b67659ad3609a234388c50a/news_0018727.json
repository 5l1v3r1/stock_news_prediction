It is the impact of the rates rising facing an expensive capital markets.”\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level on expectations of higher interest rates.\nAt 11:24 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.37 points, or 0.08 percent, at 24,378.58, the S&P 500 was up 7.16 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,679.08 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 9.96 points, or 0.14 percent, at 7,276.87.\nSix of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial sector’s 0.6 percent rise providing the second biggest boost to the benchmark index.\nThe yield-sensitive utilities and telecom services were down about 0.7 percent each.\nWalt Disney dipped 2.1 percent. The media company, which is in the process of buying film and TV assets from Twenty-First Century Fox, reported quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.
