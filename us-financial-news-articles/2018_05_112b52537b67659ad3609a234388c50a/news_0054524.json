The tender offer is expected to commence at the end of the third quarter of 2018, and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Subject to various terms and conditions described in offering materials to be distributed to shareholders: (1) purchases will be made at a price per share equal to 98% of the Fund’s net asset value per share as of the close of trading on the first business day after the expiration of the offer; and (2) if more shares are tendered than the amount the Board has authorized to purchase, the Fund will purchase a number of shares equal to the offer amount on a prorated basis.\nThe shares of common stock of the Fund have recently traded at a discount to their net asset value per share. During the pendency of the tender offer, the current net asset value per share will be available by telephone or on the Fund’s website at delawarefunds.com/closed-end .\nThe Fund also announced today that its Board of Trustees has authorized the implementation of an annual tender offer measurement period to provide a periodic liquidity opportunity to shareholders. Specifically, commencing in 2019, if the Fund is trading at an average discount of more than 10% during a 12-week measurement period established each year by the Board during the second calendar quarter of the year, the Fund will conduct an additional tender offer.\nThe Fund’s primary investment objective is to seek current income, with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund invests globally in dividend-paying or income-generating securities across multiple asset classes, including but not limited to: equity securities of large, well-established companies; securities issued by real estate companies (including real estate investment trusts and real estate industry operating companies); debt securities (such as government bonds; investment grade and high risk, high yield corporate bonds; and convertible bonds); and emerging market securities. The Fund also uses enhanced income strategies by engaging in dividend capture trading; option overwriting; and realization of gains on the sale of securities, dividend growth, and currency forwards. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund will invest: (1) at most 60% of its net assets in securities of U.S. issuers; and (2) at least 40% of its net assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers, unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by the Manager, in which case, the Fund would invest at least 30% of its net assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers; and (3) the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in securities issued by real estate companies (including real estate investment trusts and real estate industry operating companies). In addition, the Fund utilizes leveraging techniques in an attempt to obtain higher return for the Fund.\nThe Fund has implemented a managed distribution policy. Under the policy, the Fund is managed with a goal of generating as much of the distribution as possible from net investment income and short-term capital gains. The balance of the distribution will then come from long-term capital gains to the extent permitted, and if necessary, a return of capital. Even though the Fund may realize current year capital gains, such gains may be offset, in whole or in part, by the Fund’s capital loss carryovers from prior years. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of any distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s policy. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of any distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s policy.\nShareholders are advised to read the offer to purchase when it is available as it contains important information. The offer to purchase and other documents filed by the Fund with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Fund’s annual report for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017, will be available without cost at the Commission’s website ( sec.gov ) or by calling the Fund’s Information Agent.\nAdditional Information\nThe Fund intends to file its proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting with the SEC.
