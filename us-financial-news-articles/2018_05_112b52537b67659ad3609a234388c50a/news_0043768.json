I’ve never had one run that fast here.”\nJockey Mike Smith was equally as elated.

It’s a dream come true, to be honest with you,” Smith said after the race.\n“It’s been 25 years since I was blessed to win my first (Triple Crown race), which was here, and to go into it with Bob and (Baffert’s wife) Jill and the whole crew... I’m just so blessed to be riding for these people right now.\n“I’m on cloud nine.”\nGood Magic set out to challenge from the start, and the two raced neck-and-neck for much of the race with the Kentucky Derby runner-up even taking the lead at times.
