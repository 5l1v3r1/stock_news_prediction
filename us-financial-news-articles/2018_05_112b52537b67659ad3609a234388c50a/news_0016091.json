Weinstein had been one of BAFTA’s New York trustees and regularly threw a party ahead of its annual prize ceremony.\nOct. 12\nAmazon Studios chief Roy Price is put on an immediate leave of absence following allegations that he harassed producer Isa Hackett and ignored an actress’s claim of sexual assault by Weinstein.

Franco calls the allegations “inaccurate”.\nSilvio Berlusconi, who resigned as Italy’s prime minister mired in scandal over his “Bunga Bunga” parties with young women and under investigation into sex with an underage prostitute, says Deneuve’s comments on #MeToo were “blessed words”.\n“It’s natural that women are happy if a man tries to seduce them,” he says in a television interview.\nJan. 12\nSundance Film Festival launches a hotline for people to report inappropriate behaviour at the event that runs Jan. 18-28.\n“The accusations are abhorrent and profoundly disturbing.

Don’t talk to us about it at the parties tonight.

Cosby’s lawyers say he plans to appeal.\nPolanski, 84, admitted having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles in the 1970s. The French-Polish director lives in France after fleeing the United States following pleading guilty, for fear his deal with prosecutors would be overruled and he would get a lengthy prison term. The case in Los Angeles is still open and the United States has made several unsuccessful attempts to extradite Polanski to serve time.\nHe was on the red carpet in Cannes last year presenting his movie “Based on a True Story” in an out-of-competition slot.\nOn the Academy’s decision, Polanski’s attorney Harland Braun says: “This is very disappointing. It’s just shocking that the Academy would expel someone without a fair hearing.”\nA Cosby representative did not respond to a request seeking comment.\nMay 4\nThe Swedish Academy which decides the Nobel Prize for Literature says it will not make the award this year because of a sexual misconduct scandal that has led to a string of board members stepping down.\n“We find it necessary to commit time to recovering public confidence in the Academy before the next laureate can be announced,” Anders Olsson, interim permanent secretary of the body, says. The Academy plans to award two prizes in 2019, including the 2018 one.\nMay 7\n“It’s not the Cannes Festival that changed, the whole world has changed since September last year,” festival director Thierry Fremaux tells a news conference.\nMay 8-19\nThe 71st edition of the Cannes Film Festival takes place on the French Riviera.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to fix typo in “harassment” in first paragraph; restores dropped word “to” in second paragraph) Reporting by Robin Pomeroy; Editing by Toby Chopra", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T22:02:52.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
