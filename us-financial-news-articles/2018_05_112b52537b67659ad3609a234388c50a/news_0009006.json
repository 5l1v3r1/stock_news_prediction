NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of our net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions is provided above. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted are provided on page 2 of this press release.\nVORNADO REALTY TRUST\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - CONTINUED\nBelow is a reconciliation of net income to NOI by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017.\nFor the Three Months Ended (Amounts in thousands) March 31, December 31,\n2017\n2018 2017 Net income $ 282 $ 73,847 $ 53,551 Deduct: Loss (income) from partially owned entities 9,904 (1,358 ) (9,622 ) Loss (income) from real estate fund investments 8,807 (268 ) (4,889 ) Interest and other investment loss (income), net 24,384 (6,695 ) (8,294 ) Net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets — (501 ) — Loss (income) from discontinued operations 363 (15,318 ) (1,273 ) NOI attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries (17,312 ) (16,338 ) (16,533 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization expense 108,686 105,128 114,166 General and administrative expense 43,633 47,237 35,139 Transaction related costs and other 13,156 752 703 NOI from partially owned entities 67,513 66,097 69,175 Interest and debt expense 88,166 82,724 93,073 Income tax expense 1,454 1,851 38,661 NOI at share 349,036 337,158 363,857 Non cash adjustments for straight-line rents, amortization of acquired below-market leases, net and other (17,948 ) (20,481 ) (21,579 ) NOI at share - cash basis $ 331,088 $ 316,677 $ 342,278 NOI represents total revenues less operating expenses. We consider NOI to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI should not be considered a substitute for net income. NOI may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nVORNADO REALTY TRUST\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS - CONTINUED\nBelow are reconciliations of NOI to same store NOI for our New York segment, theMART and 555 California Street for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017.\n(Amounts in thousands) New York theMART 555 California Street NOI at share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 $ 288,596 $ 26,875 $ 13,511 Less NOI at share from: Acquisitions (350 ) (85 ) — Dispositions 40 — — Development properties placed into and out of service (412 ) — — Lease termination income, net of straight-line and FAS 141 adjustments (1,127 ) — — Other non-operating income, net (579 ) — — Same store NOI at share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 $ 286,168 $ 26,790 $ 13,511 NOI at share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 $ 277,155 $ 25,889 $ 12,034 Less NOI at share from: Acquisitions — 31 — Dispositions (228 ) — — Development properties placed into and out of service 16 — — Lease termination income, net of straight-line and FAS 141 adjustments (638 ) (20 ) — Other non-operating income, net (1,084 ) — — Same store NOI at share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 $ 275,221 $ 25,900 $ 12,034 Increase in same store NOI at share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 $ 10,947 $ 890 $ 1,477 % increase in same store NOI at share 4.0 % (1) 3.4 % 12.3 %\nExcluding Hotel Pennsylvania, same store NOI at share increased by 3.7%.\nSame store NOI represents NOI from operations which are owned by us and in service in both the current and prior year reporting periods.
