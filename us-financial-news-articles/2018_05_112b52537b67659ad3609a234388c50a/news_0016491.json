The investors only receive a return if predefined results are achieved.\nGlobally, there are 108 social impact bonds in operation in more than 20 countries, according to Social Finance, the London-based charity which pioneered the nascent market in 2010 to mobilize capital for cash-strapped municipalities.\nThe film follows four-year-old Reginald, whose brother was shot and killed outside his home in Chicago, as he receives a year of pre-school education to ready him for kindergarten.\nHe is one of some 2,600 children from low-income families attending the nursery, one of several receiving $17 million in funding from Goldman Sachs and the Pritzker Family Foundation, set up by the wealthy owners of the Hyatt Hotel chain.\nIf the children test well, the investors will profit. They are set to receive $9,100 per student who does not require special education services, for every year up until the end of high school, project manager Joe Schmidt says in the film. INFLUENCE\nThe film questions the impact of profit incentives on the delivery of social services as it follows pioneering venture capitalist Ronald Cohen on his global travels, pitching SIBs to politicians and investors.\nAward-winning filmmaker Pequeneza said she was encouraged by the model’s focus on investing in prevention and early intervention - she filmed the launch of Canada’s first healthcare bond to reduce heart disease.\n“The one thing I want people to take away is that you can make a difference in people’s lives. You can solve some of these problems,” she said from Toronto.\nCanada will pay investors a 9 percent profit if a community initiative enrolls hypertensive Canadians in an education program and maintains their blood pressure.\nBut Pequeneza expressed concern that some social services without measurable outcomes would be sidelined.\n“Wealthy people, or those more willing to invest the sums of cash necessary to get involved in SIBs, are going to have undue influence over what programs get funded,” she said.\nThe film shows Reginald being tested at the end of his year. He can count from one to 10 but cannot identify certain numbers written down in front of him.\nHead teacher Michelle Stewin said in the film that his performance did not meet her expectations.\n“Some days he doesn’t do as well as others,” she said.\n“He has a difficult time being still and focusing on tasks for a long time. Some are and some aren’t ready for kindergarten - some could use an additional year of support.”\n“The Invisible Heart” will be shown on television in Canada and at special screenings and film festivals globally before becoming available on streaming services.
