It should not be a one-stop race, for example,” said Hamilton, a two-times winner in Monaco, who said he would have been asleep on the sofa if watching on television.\n“From a racing driver’s point of view, we were never pushing.\n“It was insane how little I was pushing. I was 10 seconds behind, but I was conflicted because in my heart I wanted to win this race, but the team just asked me to bring the car home.”\nOne man who was celebrating, and not complaining of boredom either, was Ricciardo.\nAt any other track, with his engine problems, he would have been overtaken and forgotten.\nThe Australian performed a jubilant ‘shoey’ celebration on the podium, quaffing champagne from his sweaty racing boot and making Red Bull’s technical head Adrian Newey share the experience.\nThe magnum of champagne was then handed to Monaco’s Prince Albert and Princess Charlene to drink straight from the oversized bottle.\nRicciardo then jumped in the pool on the team’s harbourside hospitality, having mulled over whether a dive in the sea might be preferable.\n“The pool looked a little bit worse for wear yesterday, so maybe the harbour is cleaner,” he said.
