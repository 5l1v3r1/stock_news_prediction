The cases before the court didn’t dispute employers’ ability to require the arbitration of labor disputes.\nBut employees asserted that their right to “concerted activities” could not be limited by employment contracts that allow only individual arbitration claims by workers, rather than joint arbitration actions.\nUnder the Obama administration, the Justice Department and the National Labor Relations Board backed the worker position. The Justice Department switched sides after President Donald Trump took office, while the labor board, still run by holdover appointees, held to its prior position. Lower courts divided on the issue.\n(More to Come)\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T21:19:07.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
