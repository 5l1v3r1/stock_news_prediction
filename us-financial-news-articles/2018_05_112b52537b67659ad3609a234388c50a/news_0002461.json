Brent, the global benchmark, gained 23 cents, or 0.3%, to $73.36 a barrel.\nOn Wednesday, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged and noted positive economic data and increasing inflation. Oil prices rose following the central bank meeting as the dollar declined, making dollar-denominated commodities such as crude cheaper for foreign buyers.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration also reported Wednesday that the amount of crude in storage rose by 6.2 million barrels in the week ended April 27, exceeding average analyst expectations for a 700,000-barrel build.\nStill, prices found support from a larger-than-expected drop in distillate stockpiles, signaling strong demand, analysts said. Gasoline inventories increased by 1.2 million barrels last week and distillate inventories fell by 3.9 million barrels.\n”Distillate demand remained incredibly strong and supports a thesis for solid global petroleum demand. While the headlines were admittedly bearish, the details are considered much less bearish,” said Kyle Cooper, a consultant at ION Energy Group.\nOil prices have also been lifted recently by questions concerning the 2015 Iran nuclear deal , and whether President Donald Trump will reinstate the sanctions , dealing a blow to Iranian oil exporting and tightening global supply.\n“It will all depend what Trump decides in the next 10 days, that will be the main driving force,” said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodities analyst at UBS Wealth Management.\nEarlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement referring to what he called new evidence that Iran maintained a secret plan to build nuclear weapons .\nAnalysts were skeptical that there were any revelations, however, seeing the comments as aimed at encouraging the U.S. to scrap the deal.\n“The comments from experts were quite clear, there is nothing new in what he communicated,” said Mr. Staunovo.\nThe Al-Sheiba oil refinery in the southern Iraq city of Basra, Iraq.

As oil is priced in dollars it becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies as the dollar rises.\nGasoline futures fell 0.3% to $2.0798 a gallon, and diesel futures rose 1% to $2.1215 a gallon.\nWrite to Stephanie Yang at stephanie.yang@wsj.com and Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-9026?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-9026?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-9026?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-9026?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-9026?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-9026?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-02T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T08:34:58.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
