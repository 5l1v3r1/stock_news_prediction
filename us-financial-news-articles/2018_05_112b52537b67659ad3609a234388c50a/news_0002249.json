(NYSE:ARW) today reported first-quarter 2018 sales of $6.88 billion, an increase of 20 percent from sales of $5.74 billion in the first quarter of 2017. First-quarter net income of $139 million, or $1.56 per share on a diluted basis, compared with net income of $115 million, or $1.27 per share on a diluted basis, in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding certain items 1 , net income would have been $168 million, or $1.88 per share on a diluted basis, in the first quarter of 2018, compared with net income of $132 million, or $1.46 per share on a diluted basis, in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding certain items 1 , net income increased 27 percent year over year, and earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 29 percent year over year.\n“We continue to expand our line card, our services, and the solutions we bring to the marketplace to capitalize on the exciting growth opportunities from IoT, industrial automation, and smart cities, homes, and vehicles,” said Michael J. Long, chairman, president, and chief executive officer. “We are delivering differentiated performance as evidenced by our fifth straight quarter of record results.”\nGlobal components first-quarter sales of $4.93 billion increased 21 percent year over year. First-quarter sales, as adjusted, increased 16 percent year over year. Americas components sales increased 15 percent year over year. Sales in the region, as adjusted, increased 13 percent year over year. Asia-Pacific components sales increased 20 percent year over year. Europe components sales increased 32 percent year over year. Sales in the region, as adjusted, increased 16 percent year over year. Global components first-quarter operating income increased 32 percent year over year. “As we expected, we are capturing strong leverage on our growing sales,” said Mr. Long.\nGlobal enterprise computing solutions first-quarter sales of $1.95 billion increased 16 percent year over year. First-quarter sales, as adjusted, increased 11 percent year over year. Americas enterprise computing solutions sales increased 9 percent year over year. Sales in the region, as adjusted, increased 12 percent year over year. Europe enterprise computing solutions sales increased 29 percent year over year. Sales in the region, as adjusted, increased 9 percent year over year. Global enterprise computing solutions first-quarter operating income grew 2 percent year over year and grew 1 percent year over year excluding amortization of intangibles expense. The divestiture of the systems integration business on March 2, 2018 resulted in an approximately $2 million unfavorable operating income comparison to the first quarter of 2017.\n“Value-added resellers and managed service providers are moving their businesses to Arrow due to our leadership in newer technologies, including cloud, security, and software-defined data center solutions,” added Mr. Long.\n“Return on invested capital increased year over year for the third straight quarter. First-quarter cash flow from operations was a seasonally negative $75 million. We expect the substantial investments we made to support our rapid growth, and our disciplined approach to working capital management, to drive further improvements in returns and cash flow in the coming quarters,” said Chris Stansbury, senior vice president and chief financial officer. “We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $40 million to shareholders through our stock repurchase program. We had approximately $319 million of remaining authorization under our share repurchase program at the end of the first quarter.”\n1 A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, including sales, as adjusted, operating income, as adjusted, net income attributable to shareholders, as adjusted, and net income per share, as adjusted, to GAAP financial measures is presented in the reconciliation tables included herein.\nGUIDANCE\n“As we look to the second quarter, we believe that total sales will be between $7 billion and $7.4 billion, with global components sales between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, and global enterprise computing solutions sales between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. As a result of this outlook, we expect earnings per share on a diluted basis, to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.90, and earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding certain items 1 , to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.20 per share. Our guidance assumes interest expense will be approximately $48 million. Our guidance also assumes an average tax rate of 23.5 percent to 25.5 percent and average diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 89 million. We are expecting the average USD-to-Euro exchange rate for the second quarter to be approximately $1.23 to €1,” said Mr. Stansbury.\nPlease refer to the CFO commentary, which can be found at investor.arrow.com , as a supplement to the company’s earnings release.\nArrow Electronics ( www.arrow.com ) is a global provider of products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing solutions.

Forward-looking statements are those statements which are not statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" and similar expressions. Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.\nFor a further discussion of factors to consider in connection with these forward-looking statements, investors should refer to Item 1A Risk Factors of the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the company also provides certain non-GAAP financial information relating to sales, operating income, net income attributable to shareholders, and net income per basic and diluted share. The company provides sales, income, or expense on a non-GAAP basis adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currencies and the impact of acquisitions/dispositions by adjusting the company's operating results, including the amortization expense related to acquired/disposed intangible assets, as if the acquisitions/dispositions had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented (referred to as \"impact of acquisitions\" and \"impact of dispositions\"). Operating income, net income attributable to shareholders, and net income per basic and diluted share are adjusted to exclude identifiable intangible amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, and certain charges, credits, gains, and losses that the company believes impact the comparability of its results of operations. These charges, credits, gains, and losses arise out of the company’s efficiency enhancement initiatives, acquisitions/dispositions (including intangible assets amortization expense), and financing activities. A reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial information to GAAP is set forth in the tables below.\nThe company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist in assessing and understanding the company’s operating performance and underlying trends in the company’s business because management considers these items referred to above to be outside the company’s core operating results. This non-GAAP financial information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating the company’s financial and operating performance. In addition, the company’s Board of Directors may use this non-GAAP financial information in evaluating management performance and setting management compensation.\nThe presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or alternative to, sales, operating income, net income and net income per basic and diluted share determined in accordance with GAAP. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.\nARROW ELECTRONICS, INC.
