We believe the current disparity between the public and private market valuations in retail real estate is unsupported as the operating fundamentals of our centers remain strong. We are confident that our best-in-class platform will continue to add value and drive growth at our grocery-anchored centers.”\nFirst Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Results\nNet (Loss) Income\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net loss totaled $1.8 million compared to net income of $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss was primarily driven by increased depreciation and amortization as a result of owning an additional 84 properties when compared to March 31, 2017.\nFunds from Operations (FFO) as Defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT)\nFor the first quarter of 2018, FFO attributable to stockholders and convertible noncontrolling interests increased 40.4% to $40.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, from $28.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in FFO was driven by an increase in net operating income generated by additional properties owned, $8.7 million of fee income for asset management and property management services generated by the investment management business acquired in the PELP transaction, and a 4.3% increase in pro forma same-center NOI.\nModified Funds from Operations (MFFO)\nFor the first quarter of 2018, MFFO increased 46.9% to $42.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $28.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, during the same year-ago quarter. The increase in MFFO was directly correlated to the increase in FFO.\nPro Forma Same-Center Results*\nFor the first quarter of 2018, pro forma same-center NOI increased 4.3% to $61.3 million compared to $58.8 million during the first quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven by a $0.21 increase in minimum rent per square foot on the company’s pro forma portfolio, as well as a $1.4 million decrease in operating expenses versus the comparable period.\nPro-forma same-center leased occupancy totaled 93.8% compared to 93.9% as of March 31, 2017.\n*For purposes of evaluating same-center NOI on a comparative basis, and in light of the acquisition of PELP in October 2017, the company is presenting pro forma same-center NOI, which includes all properties that were owned and operational for the entire portion of both comparable reporting periods for both Phillips Edison & Company and PELP. As such, contributing to pro forma same-center NOI were 226 properties.\nFirst Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Portfolio Results\nPortfolio Statistics\nAt quarter-end, the portfolio consisted of 237 properties, totaling approximately 26.4 million square feet located in 32 states. This compares to 154 properties, totaling approximately 16.8 million square feet located in 28 states as of March 31, 2017.\nLeased portfolio occupancy totaled 93.6% compared to 93.9% as of December 31, 2017.\nLeasing Activity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, a record 192 leases (new, renewal and options) were executed totaling approximately 821,000 square feet. This compares to 132 leases (new, renewal and options) executed totaling 557,000 square feet during the first quarter of 2017.\nComparable rent spreads during the quarter, which compare the percentage increase (or decrease) of new or renewal leases to the expiring lease of a unit that was occupied within the past 12 months, were 20.3% for new leases and 10.7% for renewal leases, excluding options.\nAcquisition Activity\nOne grocery-anchored shopping center was acquired for a total cost of $8.4 million during the first quarter of 2018. The property, located in Leesburg, Florida, outside Orlando, is anchored by Publix and totals approximately 135,000 square feet.\nInvestment Management Business\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the company generated $8.7 million of fee income for asset management and property management services rendered.\nAt quarter-end, the company had approximately $2.1 billion of third-party assets under management, which included Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc., Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT III, Inc., and Necessity Retail Partners (a joint venture between Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT II, Inc. and TPG).\nPhillips Edison Grocery Center REIT III\nPhillips Edison Grocery Center REIT III, Inc., Phillips Edison & Company’s third sponsored non-traded REIT, raised $56.8 million in a private offering of common stock. Additionally, on May 8, 2018, Phillips Edison Grocery Center REIT III had its registration statement pertaining to an initial public offering declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission and will offer up to an aggregate of $1.7 billion in common stock.\nBalance Sheet Highlights at March 31, 2018\nAt quarter-end, the company had $474.4 million of borrowing capacity available on its $500 million revolving credit facility. During the quarter, the company executed a delayed draw on its five-year term facility to pay down the revolving credit facility.\nNet debt to total enterprise value was 41.9% at March 31, 2018. Please see the Net Debt to Total Enterprise Value table for additional disclosure.\nAt quarter-end, the company's outstanding debt had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4%, a weighted-average maturity of 5.2 years, and 87.1% of its total debt was fixed-rate debt. This compared to a weighted-average interest rate of 3.4%, a weighted average maturity of 5.5 years, and 88.5% fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2017.\nEstimated Value Per Share\nEffective May 9, 2018, the company’s board of directors increased the estimated value per share of its common stock to $11.05 as of March 31, 2018.\nDuff & Phelps was engaged to provide a calculation of the range in estimated value per share of the company’s common stock as of March 31, 2018. Duff & Phelps prepared a valuation report based substantially on its estimate of the “as is” market values of the company’s portfolio, adjusted to reflect balance sheet assets and liabilities, and the estimated value of in-place contracts of the third-party asset management business provided by the company’s management as of March 31, 2018, before calculating a range of estimated per share values based on the number of outstanding shares of common stock and operating partnership units (OP units) as of quarter end. These calculations produced an estimated value per share in the range of $10.35 to $11.75.\nFor a full description of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the estimated value per share, see the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to be filed with the SEC, which will be accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nFirst Quarter 2018 Distributions\nGross distributions of $38.3 million were paid to common shareholders and OP unit holders during the first quarter of 2018, including $12.8 million reinvested through the distribution reinvestment plan, for net cash distributions of $25.5 million.\nDuring the quarter, FFO was $40.4 million, which totaled 104% of the company's gross distributions.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the company's board of directors authorized distributions for June 2018, July 2018, and August 2018 in the amount of $0.05583344 per share to the shareholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018, July 16, 2018, and August 15, 2018, respectively. OP unit holders will receive distributions at the same rate, subject to required withholding.\nShare Repurchase Program (SRP)\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, approximately 366,000 shares of common stock, totaling $4.0 million, were repurchased.\nSubsequent to the quarter end, in April 2018, approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock, totaling $37.4 million, were repurchased at $11.00 per share under the SRP. Standard repurchase requests surpassed the funding limits under the SRP resulting in the company processing standard requests on a pro rata basis.\nThe company will continue to fulfill repurchases sought upon a stockholder’s death, “qualifying disability,” or “determination of incompetence” in accordance with the terms of the SRP.\nDue to the program’s funding limits, the company does not expect funding to be available for standard repurchases for the remainder of 2018. Cash available for standard repurchases on any particular date under the SRP is generally limited to the proceeds from the dividend reinvestment plan during the preceding four quarters, less amounts already used for repurchases during the same time period.\nStockholder Update Call\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Edison, Chief Financial Officer Devin Murphy, and Executive Vice President Mark Addy will host a live presentation addressing the company’s results on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nFollowing management’s prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session.

For purposes of evaluating Same-Center NOI on a comparative basis, and in light of the company’s acquisition of 76 shopping centers and the investment management business from PELP, the company is presenting Pro Forma Same-Center NOI, which is Same-Center NOI on a pro forma basis as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017. This perspective allows the company to evaluate Same-Center NOI growth over a comparable period. Pro Forma Same-Center NOI is not necessarily indicative of what actual Same-Center NOI and growth would have been if the PELP transaction had occurred on January 1, 2017, nor does it purport to represent Same-Center NOI and growth for future periods.\nPro Forma Same-Center NOI highlights operating trends such as occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs on properties that were operational for both comparable periods. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating Same-Center NOI, and accordingly, Pro Forma Same-Center NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\nPro Forma Same-Center NOI should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the company’s financial performance since it does not reflect the operations of the company’s entire portfolio, nor does it reflect the impact of general and administrative expenses, acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other income, or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of company properties that could materially impact its results from operations.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nFFO is a non-GAAP performance financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines FFO as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for impairment losses on depreciable real estate and impairments of in-substance real estate investments in investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The company calculates FFO Attributable to Stockholders and Convertible Noncontrolling Interests in a manner consistent with the NAREIT definition, with an additional adjustment made for noncontrolling interests that are not convertible into common stock.\nMFFO is an additional performance financial measure used by the company as FFO includes certain non-comparable items that affect the company’s performance over time. MFFO excludes the following items:\nacquisition and transaction expenses; straight-line rent amounts, both income and expense; amortization of above- or below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; amortization of discounts and premiums on debt investments; gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; gains or losses on the extinguishment of derivatives, except where the trading of such instruments is a fundamental attribute of company operations; gains or losses related to fair value adjustments for derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting; and adjustments related to the above items for joint ventures and noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities in the application of equity accounting.\nThe company believes that MFFO is helpful in assisting management and investors with the assessment of the sustainability of operating performance in future periods. The company believes it is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides an additional measure to compare its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that may cause short-term fluctuations in net income (loss) but have no impact on cash flows.\nFFO, FFO Attributable to Stockholders and Convertible Noncontrolling Interests, and MFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations under GAAP, as an indication of liquidity, nor as an indication of funds available to cover the company’s cash needs, including its ability to fund distributions. MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if the company does not continue to operate its business plan in the manner currently contemplated.\nAccordingly, FFO, FFO Attributable to Stockholders and Convertible Noncontrolling Interests, and MFFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements, and should not be viewed as more prominent measures of performance than net income (loss) or cash flows from operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company’s FFO, FFO Attributable to Stockholders and Convertible Noncontrolling Interests, and MFFO, as presented, may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs.\nPHILLIPS EDISON & COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF MARCH 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ASSETS Investment in real estate: Land and improvements $ 1,125,816 $ 1,121,590 Building and improvements 2,274,876 2,263,400 Acquired in-place lease assets 314,378 313,432 Acquired above-market lease assets 53,597 53,524 Total investment in real estate assets 3,768,667 3,751,946 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (504,912 ) (462,025 ) Total investment in real estate assets, net 3,263,755 3,289,921 Cash and cash equivalents 14,690 5,716 Restricted cash 17,279 21,729 Account receivable - affiliates 6,935 6,102 Corporate intangible assets, net 52,200 55,100 Goodwill 29,066 29,066 Other assets, net 135,102 118,448 Total assets $ 3,519,027 $ 3,526,082 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Liabilities: Debt obligations, net $ 1,834,829 $ 1,806,998 Acquired below-market lease liabilities, net of accumulated amortization of $29,946 and $27,388, respectively 88,523 90,624 Accounts payable – affiliates 1,733 1,359 Accounts payable and other liabilities 132,670 148,419 Total liabilities 2,057,755 2,047,400 Commitments and contingencies — — Equity: Preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, 10,000 shares authorized, zero shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively — — Common stock, $0.01 par value per share, 1,000,000 shares authorized, 186,027 and 185,233 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively 1,860 1,852 Additional paid-in capital 1,638,176 1,629,130 Accumulated other comprehensive income 27,381 16,496 Accumulated deficit (634,164 ) (601,238 ) Total stockholders’ equity 1,033,253 1,046,240 Noncontrolling interests 428,019 432,442 Total equity 1,461,272 1,478,682 Total liabilities and equity $ 3,519,027 $ 3,526,082 PHILLIPS EDISON & COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\n(Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues: Rental income $ 71,449 $ 51,093 Tenant recovery income 22,437 16,936 Fees and management income 8,712 — Other property income 601 274 Total revenues 103,199 68,303 Expenses: Property operating 18,115 11,432 Real estate taxes 13,147 10,258 General and administrative 10,461 7,830 Depreciation and amortization 46,427 27,624 Total expenses 88,150 57,144 Other: Interest expense, net (16,779 ) (8,390 ) Other expense, net (107 ) (1,635 ) Net (loss) income (1,837 ) 1,134 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 237 (28 ) Net (loss) income attributable to stockholders $ (1,600 ) $ 1,106 Earnings per common share: Net (loss) income per share attributable to stockholders - basic and diluted $ (0.01 ) $ 0.01 Weighted-average common shares outstanding: Basic 185,899 183,230 Diluted 230,352 186,022 Comprehensive income: Net (loss) income $ (1,837 ) $ 1,134 Other comprehensive income: Change in unrealized gain on interest rate swaps 13,488 1,816 Comprehensive income 11,651 2,950 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 237 (28 ) Other comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests (2,603 ) — Comprehensive income attributable to stockholders $ 9,285 $ 2,922 The table below compares Pro Forma Same-Center NOI and 2017 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, Favorable (Unfavorable) Change 2018 2017 (1)\n$ %\nRevenues: Rental income (2) $ 65,453 $ 64,521 $ 932 Tenant recovery income 21,181 21,127 54 Other property income 570 474 96 Total revenues 87,204 86,122 1,082 1.3% Operating expenses: Property operating expenses 13,630 14,609 979 Real estate taxes 12,298 12,752 454 Total operating expenses 25,928 27,361 1,433 5.2% Total Same-center NOI $ 61,276 $ 58,761 $ 2,515 4.3% (1) Adjusted for PELP same-center operating results prior to the transaction for these periods.
