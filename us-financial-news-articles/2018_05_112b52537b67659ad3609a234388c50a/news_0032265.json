Burberry’s results are nevertheless a touch above market expectations,” said Morgan Stanley analysts.\nOverall the UK earnings season has driven sharp share price reactions, with a negative skew.\n“Those companies that are disappointing relative to expectations are being treated pretty harshly by the market, and conversely those with very low expectations and particularly a big short position are being relatively rewarded for at least meeting expectations,” said Guy Ellison, head of UK equities at Investec .\nSeveral mid-cap stocks suffered sharp falls after results.\nHomebuilder Crest Nicholson sank 12.5 percent to the bottom of the FTSE 250 after saying rising construction costs were hurting the pricing of its homes, forcing it to cut its full-year operating margin forecast.\nRising costs were also cited by pub firm Mitchells & Butlers as a reason for its profit dip, causing the shares to tumble seven percent.\nPeer Marston’s also fell 5.5 percent after reporting half-year results.\n“Anything consumer-facing that’s having to pay UK wages and UK rates is facing cost inflation,” said Investec’s Ellison.\nMeanwhile M&A news continued to drive shares.\nPaddy Power Betfair rose 5.5 percent after the bookmaker said it was in discussions to combine its U.S. business and fantasy sports company Fanduel, to target the prospective U.S. sports betting market after a Supreme Court ruling on Monday paved the way for states to legalise sports gambling.\nAmong small-caps, shares in formalwear retailer Moss Brothers jumped 8.4 percent after the firm said its sales decline had slowed.\nOverall earnings from UK companies have been encouraging this quarter, while macroeconomic data has been poor.\n“It seems the first quarter for UK companies was better than for the UK economy,” said Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management. “We expect a modest upside over the next six months but we don’t expect it to outperform other markets.”\nAnalysts are downgrading their earnings expectations for the UK, however, as the results season draws to a close.
