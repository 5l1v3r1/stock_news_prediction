S&P 500 e-minis were up 4.75 points, or 0.17 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 21.75 points, or 0.31 percent.\nAmong other gainers, Kohl’s was up 5.9 percent after the department store chain topped quarterly profit estimates and lifted its annual profit forecast.\nRival Macy’s, which reported strong quarterly results last week, gained more than 2 percent while discount operator TJX rose 0.6 percent after results.\n“It’s comforting to know that retailing side is not dead. Consumer discretionary stocks have done very well for a while now and that’s a small sign but it’s another advocate for a strong economy,” Bakhos said.\nAmong decliners, Toll Brothers slid 4.2 percent after disappointing second-quarter profit and weighed on other homebuilders. Lennar dipped 1.1 percent, while PulteGroup slipped 0.5 percent.\nMicron, which raised its quarterly forecast and led the chipmakers higher on Monday, jumped 6.7 percent after announcing a $10 billion share buyback.\nFacebook edged up 0.3 percent ahead of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s defense of the company’s data practices to European lawmakers in Brussels. The testimony starts at 12:15 p.m. ET and comes three days before tough new European Union rules on data protection take effect.\nThe possibility of a ZTE reprieve boosted shares of optical component makers. Acacia Communications, which got 30 percent of its 2017 revenue from ZTE, rose 4.5 percent, while Oclaro gained 1.7 percent.
