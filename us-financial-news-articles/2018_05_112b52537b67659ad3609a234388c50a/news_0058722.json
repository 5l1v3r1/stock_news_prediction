REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo Industrial output rose just 0.3 percent in April from the previous month, official data showed on Thursday, well below the median forecast for a 1.2 percent increase and a 1.4 percent rise in March.\nMuch of the slowdown was due to a 5.6 percent decline in production of electronic parts while inventories rose for a third straight month, adding to fears of weakening overseas demand.\nOutput is seen likely to weaken further as companies focus on lowering inventories of unsold goods, suggesting Japan’s economic performance peaked last year and this year growth will be more modest.\n“Production is slowing overall because companies with high inventories are cutting their output,” said Asuka Sakamoto, economist at Mizuho Research Institute.\n“Output will fall in the coming months, but I expect consumer spending to rebound in the second quarter, which should be supportive for economic growth. I’m not worried about a recession.”\nManufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expected output to rise 0.3 percent in May but to fall 0.8 percent in June.\nJapan’s economy contracted in the first quarter as weak investment, consumption and exports took their toll, with Thursday’s output data and forecasts adding to concerns over how quickly the economy can return to growth.\nOn the positive side, production of cars and machines used in factories accelerated in April.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Eric Meijer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
