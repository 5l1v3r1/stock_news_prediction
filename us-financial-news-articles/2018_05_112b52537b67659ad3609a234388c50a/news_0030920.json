Industrial output in April is expected to rise by 1.3-1.8 percent from 1 percent in March in year on year terms, it said in the document.\nThe central bank forecasts 2018 GDP growth of 1.5-2 percent, while analysts polled by Reuters expect the economy to expand at an average of 1.7 percent this year.\nReporting by Katya Golubkova and Polina Nikolskaya; Editing by Toby Chopra\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
