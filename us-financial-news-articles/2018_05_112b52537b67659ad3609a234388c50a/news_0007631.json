Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $11.4 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 14.3% above the first quarter of 2017. These results are preliminary and unaudited and are subject to change based on the completion of the company's normal quarter-end review process. As a result, these preliminary results may be different from the actual results that will be reflected in Lazydays consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company expects to report its final first quarter financial results and hold a conference call on Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nAbout Lazydays\nLazydays, The RV Authorityâ„¢, is an iconic brand in the RV industry. Home of the world's largest recreational dealership, based on 126 acres outside of Tampa, Florida, Lazydays also has dealerships located in Tucson, Arizona, and Loveland, Denver and Longmont, Colorado. Offering the nation's largest selection of leading RV brands, Lazydays features more than 2,500 new and pre-owned RVs, over 300 service bays and two on-site campgrounds with over 700 RV campsites. Lazydays also has rental fleets in Florida, Arizona and Colorado.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding depreciation and amortization, non-floor plan interest expense, interest income, income tax expense, stock option expense, transaction costs and other supplemental adjustments. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when considered along with other performance measures, is a useful measure as it reflects certain operating drivers of the business, such as sales growth, operating costs, selling and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. Adjusted EBITDA is also frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations, or a measure comparable to net income as it does not take into account certain requirements such as non-recurring gains and losses which are not deemed to be a normal part of the underlying business activities. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies within the industry. Our earnings press release for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, which we expect to release on May 10, 2018, will provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
