Wainwright & Co analyst Ed Arce said a partnership is now fairly likely as the company would need additional funds to see through a late-stage trial.\n“We are in a much better position to talk to people who might be interested in partnering with us,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Friedman said on a conference call with analysts.\nMadrigal will have to jostle with other drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences, Allergan Plc and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, who are all developing treatments for the disease.\nHowever, experts believe the market is large enough to accommodate more than one treatment option.\n“This is much less about a ‘winner takes it all’ market,” Arce said.\nMadrigal’s shares have risen over seven-fold over the past year and were trading at $244.32 on Thursday morning.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:27:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
