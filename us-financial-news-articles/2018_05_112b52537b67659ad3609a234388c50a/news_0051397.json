Their “low horsepower” has limited use to fast-food outlets, shops, banks, health clinics and similar situations where a single lightweight and mobile device is shared by many employees, said Linn Huang, research director at technology advisory firm IDC.\n“Chromebook from the gate has been that just-good-enough for your grandma device,” Huang said.“They are still leaps and bounds behind, but this year and next year Google will make massive corrections to close the gap.”\nGoogle also is working to up the capabilities of its software to suit business needs. Double-sided printing now works, though printing securely with identity badge scanning and printing multiple pages on one are still under development.
