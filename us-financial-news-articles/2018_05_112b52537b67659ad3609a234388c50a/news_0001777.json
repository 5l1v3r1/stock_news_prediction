The U.S. is among those that benefited, although the Trump administration has been arguing against free trade, which it blames for hurting American workers and companies.\nNakao acknowledged that some workers may have been sidelined in an open trade system. But governments should address that, and it shouldn't come at the expense of free trade, he added.\n\"What is the most important is to look at the benefit side of trade and we should keep and strengthen open trade and investment system, although we must address those issues on workers,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T08:37:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
