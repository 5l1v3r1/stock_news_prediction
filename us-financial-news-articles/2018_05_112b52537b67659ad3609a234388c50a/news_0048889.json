As part of the Serbia and Montenegro state union, the team made a group-stage exit in the 2006 tournament and they reached the last 16 as part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (also consisting of Serbia and Montenegro) in the 1998 World Cup.\nCoach: Mladen Krstajic\nThe 44-year old Bosnian Serb from Zenica is a complete novice at the top level, with the Group E opener against Costa Rica in Samara on June 17 being his competitive debut as a head coach in any category. The former Schalke and Werder Bremen defender had a solid international career, making 59 appearances for his country. Having served as an assistant to Savoljub Muslin during Serbia’s qualifying campaign, he took over after his former boss clashed with the Serbian FA over refusing to include young players in the squad.\nKrstajic has made a reasonable start at the helm, with 2-0 friendly wins over China and Nigeria, a 1-1 draw against South Korea and a 2-1 defeat by Morocco.\nKey players:\nNemanja Matic: The Manchester United enforcer pulls the strings in midfield and is expected to protect the back four as well as orchestrate the attacks. His versatility and consistency will be key to Serbia’s hopes of advancing into the knockout stages.\nDusan Tadic: The Southampton winger was instrumental in the first half of the qualifying campaign, having been involved in 11 of Serbia’s 12 goals (four goals and seven assists) in the opening five games. Tadic has plenty of pace, a bag of tricks and is a decent finisher, making him one of the team’s most reliable forwards.\nAleksandar Mitrovic: The Newcastle United striker was Serbia’s top scorer in qualifying with six goals and has been in good club form recently after moving to Fulham on loan in January. The 23-year-old is a robust, old-fashioned striker, always a handful for his markers in the penalty box with two good feet and aerial power.\nForm Guide:\nSerbia enjoyed a consistent qualifying campaign with six wins, three draws and one defeat under Muslin, followed by two wins, a draw and a defeat in warm-ups under Krstajic. The Serbians scored in every 2018 qualifier and averaged two goals per game.\nHow they qualified:\nSerbia finished top of Europe’s Group D with 21 points from 10 games, two ahead of Ireland and four clear of Wales. They clinched their berth with a 1-0 home win over Georgia in the final game, having previously tightened their grip with a vital 1-0 victory in Ireland.\nProspects:\nSerbia’s chances of advancing to the knockout stages of the tournament are likely to rest on the opening two games against Costa Rica and Switzerland, as they will be underdogs in their final group match against Brazil, winners of a record five World Cups.\nThere is plenty of potential in an experienced side including only three survivors from the 2010 World Cup squad and how the young players cope with the pressure will be vital.\nWriting by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing By Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:17:19.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
