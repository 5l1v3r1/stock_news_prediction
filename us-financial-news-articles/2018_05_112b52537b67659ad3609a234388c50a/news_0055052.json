It’s difficult because it’s five sets. I don’t know why but there could be an opportunity. He is the best player of all time on clay.”\nIf Thiem cannot deliver, the 21-year-old Alexander Zverev might be the man in the absence of Roger Federer, who is skipping the claycourt season.\n“(Zverev) is way more mature now in the last two or three months, even since Australia,” three-times French Open champion Mats Wilander told Reuters.\n“He is more certain of how he needs to play.”\nZverev lost to Nadal in the Rome final but showed the full potential of his game when he took the second set 6-1 before fading away.\n“Nadal doesn’t really have a weakness,” added Wilander.\n“The only thing is that the next generation, the 19-23 year-olds, they don’t have the fear factor against him like the likes of Nishikori, Dimitrov, Raonic have.\n“They have less baggage. Zverev, his game-plan against Nadal is pretty clear.\n“He has the kind of game-plan that Soderling and Djokovic had when they beat Rafa at the French, which is, don’t stay away from his forehand but hit hard on his forehand to open up the backhand side.”\nAlthough ranked outside the top 20, the 2016 champion Djokovic will also be closely watched, having shown signs that he is emerging from the toughest spell of his career.\nThe 12-times grand slam champion was beaten 7-6(4) 6-3 by Nadal at the Rome semi-finals but produced a level of tennis that should leave potential opponents in the draw nervous.
