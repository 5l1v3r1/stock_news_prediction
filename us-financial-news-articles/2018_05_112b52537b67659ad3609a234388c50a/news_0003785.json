(NYSE:HCI), a holding company primarily engaged in homeowners insurance, with additional operations in reinsurance, real estate and information technology, reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 - Financial Results\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $10.8 million or $1.11 diluted earnings per share compared with $12 million or $1.15 diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure which excludes unrealized gains or losses on equity securities) for the quarter was $12.7 million or $1.26 per fully diluted share. The company has included in this press release an explanation of adjusted net income as well as a reconciliation to GAAP net income and earnings per share.\nGross premiums earned totaled $85.8 million compared with $91.6 million in the same period in 2017. The decrease in 2018 was primarily attributable to policy attrition.\nGross premiums written were $70.1 million compared with $71.4 million in the same quarter of 2017.\nPremiums ceded increased to $32.3 million or 37.6% of gross premiums earned from $28.6 million or 31.2% of gross premiums earned in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of ceded premiums attributable to retrospective provisions under certain reinsurance contracts as opposed to a net reduction in ceded premiums in the same period in 2017.\nNet premiums earned (defined as gross premiums earned less premiums ceded to reinsurance) were $53.5 million compared with $63 million in the same period in 2017.\nNet premiums written (defined as gross premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurance) were $37.9 million compared with $42.8 million in the same period in 2017.\nNet realized investment gains were $2.2 million compared with $0.7 million in the same period in 2017. The gains in 2018 resulted primarily from sales intended to rebalance the company’s investment portfolio. Net unrealized investment losses were $2.6 million representing a net unfavorable change in the fair value of equity securities during the first quarter of 2018 subsequent to the adoption of a new accounting standard requiring unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities to be reported in the statement of income.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses were $19.7 million compared with $25.5 million in the same period in 2017. There were two reasons for the decrease. The $25.5 million in 2017 included loss reserve strengthening of $2.5 million in response to trends involving assignment of insurance benefits and related litigation, and there was no material reserve strengthening in the first quarter of 2018. Second, there was a substantial decrease in the number of non-catastrophe claims in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative personnel expenses were $6.3 million compared with $7 million in the same period in 2017.\nThe decrease related to lower stock-based compensation and payroll costs associated with the processing and settlement of Hurricane Irma claims which are recoverable from reinsurers.\nInterest expense was $4.5 million compared with $3.5 million in the same period in 2017. The change primarily resulted from interest expense related to the 4.25% convertible debt offering which was completed in March 2017.\nIncome tax expense was $4 million compared to $7.1 million in the same quarter in 2017, which resulted primarily from a reduced federal tax rate attributable to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 that became effective January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 27.1% as compared to 37.2% in the same quarter of 2017.\nBook value per share, defined as shareholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period, was $22.45 at March 31, 2018 compared with $22.14 at December 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 - Financial Ratios\nThe loss ratio (defined as losses and loss adjustment expenses related to net premiums earned) for the first quarter of 2018 was 36.7% compared with 40.5% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to fewer losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe expense ratio (defined as underwriting expenses, general and administrative personnel expenses, interest and other operating expenses related to net premiums earned) was 43.5% compared with 36.6% in the same prior year period in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in net premiums earned.\nThe combined ratio (total of all expenses in relation to net premiums earned) is the measure of overall underwriting profitability before other income. The combined loss and expense ratio for the current quarter was 80.2% compared with 77.1% in the same prior year period of 2017.\nDue to the impact reinsurance costs have on net premiums earned from period to period, the company believes the combined ratio measured to gross premiums earned is more relevant in assessing overall performance. The combined ratio to gross premiums earned was 50.1% for the quarter compared with 53% for the first quarter of 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“Our insurance operations have reached an important inflection point,” said Paresh Patel, HCI Group’s chairman and chief executive officer. “The recent implementation of our positive underwriting technology now gives HCI the ability to deliver superior underwriting results.”\nConference Call\nHCI Group will hold a conference call later today, May 1, 2018, to discuss these financial results.

This financial measurement is not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.
