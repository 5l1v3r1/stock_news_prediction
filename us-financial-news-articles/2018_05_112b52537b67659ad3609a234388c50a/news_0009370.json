Between 2016-2017, NLMK Pennsylvania was only able to secure 2 percent of total receipts domestically and was forced to import the remaining amount,” Miller said.\nU.S. tariffs threaten over 9,000 jobs at NLMK USA’s Pennsylvania and Indiana mills, Miller wrote, as well as the more than 2,000 jobs a new NLMK marine terminal for the transportation of steel is expected to create.\n“NLMK plans to nearly double its current investments ($800 million) with another $664 million between now and 2022. Tariffs on slabs put these investments on hold pending the outcome of the exclusion process,” Miller said.\nRevenues of NLMK’s U.S. division, at $1.67 billion in 2017, represented 16.5 percent of the company’s total revenue worldwide that year.\nTrump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China.\nHe has since temporarily excluded Canada, the European Union and Mexico from the duties until June 1, and has negotiated permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil.\nRussia, which has not received an exemption, has filed a request to join China in its official disputing of the tariffs at the World Trade Organization.\nAdditional reporting by Anastasia Lyrchikova; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T20:35:12.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
