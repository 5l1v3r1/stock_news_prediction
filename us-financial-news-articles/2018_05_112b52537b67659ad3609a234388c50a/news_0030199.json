(“Standard Diversified” or the “Company”) (NYSE American:SDI) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. In addition to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has also made available an updated Investor Presentation on its corporate website at www.standarddiversified.com .\nManagement Commentary\nIan Estus, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are extremely excited about the growth and momentum generated during the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven through acquisitions, including the purchase of an insurance business with roughly $50 million in assets, and an expansion of our outdoor advertising operations with the acquisition of 374 billboard new faces across the Southeastern U.S. Additionally, during the quarter we closed on a $25 million loan facility and our class A common shares were up-listed to the NYSE American exchange. Standard Diversified also benefitted from a strong start to 2018 from Turning Point Brands, Inc. (NYSE: TPB) (“Turning Point”), in which the Company holds a majority position. Turning Point continued a recent trend of solid organic growth with a widely recognized brand portfolio including Stoker’s in Smokeless, Zig-Zag in Smoking and VaporBeast. We look forward to their continued integration and growth of these businesses, as we build a long-term value creation platform, with a focus on asset growth and the minimization of the costs at our subsidiaries.”\nUpdate on Operating Subsidiaries / Recent Acquisitions\nTurning Point Brands, Inc.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company held a 51.2% ownership interest in Turning Point, which comprises a sizable portion of the Company’s consolidated financial results.\nTurning Point is a leading independent provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”) in the U.S. Its products include moist snuff tobacco (“MST”), loose leaf chewing tobacco, premium cigarette papers, make-your-own (“MYO”) cigar wraps, cigars, liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. Turning Point does not sell cigarettes.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same quarter in 2017, Turning Point achieved a 10.7% increase in net sales, 15% increase in gross profit, and net income of $3.0 million. Turning Point’s focus brands, which include Stoker’s, Zig-Zag and VaporBeast, remain its largest growth drivers and its management continues to evaluate potential acquisitions.\nTurning Point reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on May 9, 2018.\nPillar General\nPillar General is the wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of Standard Diversified. On January 2, 2018, Pillar General acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Interboro Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiary, Maidstone Insurance Company (“Maidstone”), which writes personal automobile and homeowners insurance primarily in New York State.\nStandard Outdoor\nStandard Outdoor is an out-of-home advertising business and wholly-owned subsidiary of Standard Diversified.\nIn two separate transactions during January and February of 2018, Standard Outdoor acquired 374 billboard faces, expanding its geographic presence to Alabama, Georgia and Florida, in addition to its operations in Texas.\nStandard Outdoor remains focused on leveraging its relationships and expertise to target opportunities in local markets that are primed for growth.\nFinancial Results for the Quarter ended March 31, 2018\nThe Company’s financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 are primarily comprised of its 51.2% holding in Turning Point and the results of Maidstone starting from its January 2, 2018 acquisition date.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s overall net sales increased 11.3% to $74.3 million from $66.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by volume growth in the NewGen segment which included the acquisition of Vapor Shark in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, the Company recognized $7.7 million of revenues from Maidstone, primarily from earned insurance premiums.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company had an increase in gross profit (consisting of net sales less cost of sales, and excluding the revenues from Maidstone) of 15.3% to $31.9 million from $27.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily driven by increased net sales and a favorable LIFO impact. The categorical breakdown is as follows:\nSmokeless products gross profit increased by 18.7% to $11.0 million from $9.3 million. NewGen products gross profit increased by 62.4% from $4.7 million to $7.7 million. Smoking products gross profits were $13.2 million.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s gross margin increased to 42.9% from 41.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Maidstone contributed $0.6 million of operating income to the Company in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company’s consolidated income tax expense of $0.8 million was 28.8% of the Company’s consolidated income before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company’s consolidated income tax expense is fully attributable to Turning Point. The Company’s income tax benefit of $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily a result of tax benefits from the exercise of Turning Point’s stock options during the quarter.\nDue primarily to the factors described above, the inclusion of corporate costs, including interest expense, and the allocation of noncontrolling interest to shareholders of Turning Point other than the Company, net income attributable to Standard Diversified for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $0.5 million compared to net income attributable to Standard Diversified for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $1.9 million.\nBalance Sheet / Available Liquidity\nStandard Diversified had cash and cash equivalents totaling $5.6 million as of March 31, 2018.\nOn February 2, 2018, Standard Diversified entered into a term loan agreement with Crystal Financial LLC (“Crystal Term Loan”). The Crystal Term Loan provides for an initial term loan of $10.0 million with an additional undrawn commitment of $15.0 million. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Company may request an additional increase in the commitment of up to $25.0 million. The Crystal Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the three-month “Libor Rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal plus 7.25%. Interest under the Crystal Term Loan Agreement is payable monthly and is also subject to an initial commitment fee of $350,000 and an annual agency fee of $50,000. The principal balance is payable at maturity on February 2, 2023.\nThe initial proceeds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of certain billboard structures, certain fees and expenses, and provide working capital for the Company.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, SDI had cash inflows from financing activities of $11.1 million from borrowings under the Crystal Term Loan and proceeds from a private placement stock issuance in January 2018.\nAbout Standard Diversified Inc.\nStandard Diversified Inc. is a holding company that owns and operates subsidiaries in a variety of industries, including insurance, other tobacco products and outdoor advertising.
