The country’s autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation must also submit to parliament a draft law on personal income tax and social security contributions, the IMF said.\nBosnia’s economic progress remained on track and all the programme’s fiscal targets have been met, with the combined budget surplus reaching 2 percent of national output in 2017 as authorities restrained overall spending, it added.\nIn February, the IMF cut Bosnia’s 2018 economic growth forecast to 3.2 percent from 3.5 percent, citing downside risks from domestic politics although macroeconomic conditions remain stable.\nBosnia has presidential and parliamentary elections in October. Campaigning with nationalist overtones in its two autonomous regions - the Federation and the Serb Republic - may slow down its economic development and EU ambitions, diplomats say.
