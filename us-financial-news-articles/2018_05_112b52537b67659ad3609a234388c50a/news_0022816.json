This performance was driven by Novelis' focused strategy to improve operational efficiencies, increase shipments of premium products, and make key investments to grow automotive capacity. Fiscal 2018 net income attributable to its common shareholder was $106 million for the fourth quarter and $635 million for the full year.\nExcluding tax-effected special items in both years, Novelis grew its fourth quarter fiscal 2018 net income 38 percent to $101 million, and increased full year net income by 80 percent to $420 million. This increase reflects a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA, as well as lower interest expense, a result of the company's long-term debt refinancing actions during fiscal 2017.\n\"Our strategy to focus on safety, customer service and operational excellence has delivered a record-setting year for Novelis both in our financial performance and overall execution,\" said Steve Fisher, President and CEO, Novelis, Inc. \"We've increased our leadership position in the key growth category of automotive aluminum sheet by making the right strategic investments in capacity globally to be the clear partner-of-choice for innovative solutions. In addition, we will continue to evaluate opportunities in the market that further maximize our capabilities that deliver value to our customers and stakeholders.\"\nKey achievements in fiscal 2018 include:\ncompleted a joint venture to establish Ulsan Aluminum by selling approximately 50 percent of its ownership of the Ulsan, South Korea plant, to Kobe Steel for $314 million; announced plans to expand production in the US with an automotive finishing investment in Guthrie, Kentucky, adding approximately 200 kilotonnes of nameplate capacity; agreed to acquire operating facilities and manufacturing assets in Sierre, Switzerland, that have historically been leased; achieved record automotive sheet shipment levels to support new product launches including the Land Rover Velar, Jaguar I-PACE, Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and Jeep Wrangler; continued electric vehicle platform collaboration with NIO and London Electric Vehicle Company to launch the new NIO ES8 and London Electric Taxi; launched Novelis Advanzâ„¢ 6HF -e/s200 alloy in North America, a heat-treatable alloy that provides automakers greater design flexibility due to its superior formability, strength performance and weight savings; increased recycled content from 55 percent to 57 percent for the full year.\nBy strengthening its automotive portfolio and making strategic investments to increase capacity, Novelis broadened its leadership position within the industry and is committed to developing next-generation high-strength, highly-formable 6xxx and 7xxx series alloys for future vehicle design. As projections for aluminum adoption increase, Novelis will continue to partner with OEMs to develop more aluminum based vehicle architecture from hang-on parts to complete structural aluminum-intensive bodies. As a result, the company will pursue significant growth opportunities from incremental aluminum adoption in niche premium cars as well as higher mass production mix-material vehicles.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nNet sales increased 17 percent over the prior year to $3.1 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, driven by higher average aluminum prices, higher total shipments, and a favorable impact from record automotive shipments. Shipments of flat rolled products increased two percent to a record 805 kilotonnes.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased nine percent to $319 million as compared to $292 million in the prior year. This increase reflects higher shipments as well as the company's strategy to deliver a more profitable product mix with higher automotive shipments, and increased operational efficiencies including a more favorable metal input mix.\nFull Year Fiscal 2018 Results\nNet sales grew 20 percent to $11.5 billion in fiscal 2018. The increase was driven by higher average aluminum prices, record shipments and increased shipments of higher conversion premium products. Total shipments of flat rolled products grew four percent to 3,188 kilotonnes. For fiscal 2018, the percentage of the company's shipment portfolio stemming from automotive sheet grew to 20 percent, up from 18 percent in the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 12 percent to $1,215 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $1,085 million in fiscal 2017. The increase was driven by higher shipments and strong operational efficiencies, as well as favorable product mix, metal costs and currency impacts, partially offset by lower can prices.\nFull year free cash flow increased 12 percent to $406 million in fiscal 2018 driven by stronger adjusted EBITDA and lower interest, despite significant working capital pressure from higher aluminum prices. Capital expenditures increased slightly to $226 million as compared to $224 million in the prior year.\n\"With robust free cash flow generation and a significant improvement in net debt leverage to 3.0x, we are excited to begin a bold yet balanced growth phase for Novelis,\" said Devinder Ahuja, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"Strong operating cash flow will be utilized to fund a disciplined increase in strategic investments in fiscal 2019, particularly in our automotive business to meet growing customer demand.\"\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company reported a strong liquidity position of $1.9 billion.\nFourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nNovelis will discuss its fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 results via a live webcast and conference call for investors at 8:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 8, 2018.
