He threatened the regime and the people, saying I’ll do this and that. Mr. Trump I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You’ve made a mistake.”\nKhamenei, the highest authority in Iran, reluctantly gave his backing for the Iran nuclear deal and has publicly criticized the U.S. multiple times for not following through on its promises under the agreement.\nReporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:20:34.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
