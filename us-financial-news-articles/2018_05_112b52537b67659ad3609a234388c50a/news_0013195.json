The Argentine, who was sent off in the first leg of Atletico’s 2-1 aggregate Europa League semi-final victory over Arsenal, received a four-game suspension from European soccer’s governing body for the incident which led to him being sent to the stands.

There’s no reason that the side playing the second leg away from home should have 30 extra minutes and the chance to score a more valuable goal.\n“I’m sure they’re very capable of seeing it and it’d help it be more even for everyone, because if not, injustices start to appear.” Reporting by Joseph Cassinelli, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T20:10:21.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
