Those cuts—among OPEC’s 14 members and a group of 10 outside the cartel led by Russia—drained a global oil glut and have helped oil prices rise by 60% to over $80 a barrel since November 2016.\nIran is Saudi Arabia’s top political rival in the Middle East, but Kuwait is seen as a mediator in OPEC disputes. Kuwait’s unease with the Saudi position signals that there is deep discord in OPEC, which could send oil prices lower if it derailed the entente with Russia, the world’s largest oil producer.\nThe price of oil had already fallen $5 a barrel to $75 after Saudi and Russian officials said last week it was time to start releasing more oil into the global market Their move came amid speculation that prices were headed toward $100 a barrel, and the average cost of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. climbed toward $3 a gallon , the most expensive in more than three years.\nThe decision came about a month after President Donald Trump tweeted about his concerns over rising oil prices , for which he blamed OPEC. Russian oil companies have also called for the easing of output cuts, which have cost them profits.\nKuwait, Iran and other OPEC members say Saudi Arabia has allowed its political alliance with the Trump administration over Iran to affect its judgment on oil policy.\n“Saudi Arabia won’t let oil prices go to $100 because they listen to Trump,” a Kuwaiti oil official told The Wall Street Journal.\nThe Trump administration, with Saudi backing, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and is moving to reimpose tough sanctions on Tehran.\nIn a letter sent Saturday to OPEC, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh demanded that the cartel support Iran in the face of U.S. sanctions, calling them “illegal, unilateral and extraterritorial.” He asked that the topic of U.S. sanctions be placed on OPEC’s agenda at its next meeting on June 22, setting up a delicate set of talks with the Saudis and other OPEC members who support such penalties.\n“Some OPEC members [are] playing into U.S. hands,” Mr. Zanganeh said earlier this month.\nSaudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih is set to go to Kuwait to mend fences with oil officials on Saturday. He will be accompanied by United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Suhail al-Mazroui, a key Saudi alley and OPEC’s current president, according to people familiar with the trip.\nThe Saudis and Emiratis “are concerned that Kuwait is not aligned with the Russian and Saudi statements,” said one of the people.\nRelated\nRussia, Saudi Arabia Near Deal to Lift Output (May 25) Gas Is Headed for $3. What That Means for the U.S. Economy (May 14) OPEC, Russia Oil Officials Hint at Extending Production Cuts (April. 20) Spokespeople for the energy ministries of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. and for OPEC didn’t respond to requests for comment. Spokeswomen for Russia’s Energy ministry and Iran’s oil ministry couldn’t immediately comment.\nThe Kuwait City meeting marks the first time that OPEC members have openly questioned Saudi Arabia’s closeness to the U.S., which remains a major oil importer and OPEC customer despite its burgeoning crude output. The gathering also the most vivid illustration yet of the tensions caused by OPEC’s experimental collaboration with Russia and other big producers.\nThe alliance magnified OPEC’s power after U.S. shale-oil companies produced enough crude to swamp the market in 2014, crashing prices. OPEC didn’t come up with an effective response until it joined forces with Russia in December 2016.\nSome OPEC members say their voice has been sidelined as the Saudis and Russians plot their own oil-market policy. Though Saudi Arabia pumps up about a third of the group’s output, OPEC normally makes decisions collegiality and unanimously and prides itself on independence from outside influence.\nAt the same time, there is disagreement between Saudi Arabia and Moscow about how far prices should come down.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that “a bit over $60, in our opinion, that was a balanced price.” The Saudis don’t want to see oil prices fall back down to $60 a barrel, OPEC officials said, as the kingdom takes on a series of economic and social reforms, keeps military spending high and prepares for the initial public offering of its state oil company, known as Aramco.\nMr. Mazroui of the U.A.E. is considering flying to Moscow to try to settle differences between the positions of the Kingdom and Moscow, and smooth out Moscow’s relationship with the rest of OPEC, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com and Benoit Faucon at benoit.faucon@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:20:34.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
