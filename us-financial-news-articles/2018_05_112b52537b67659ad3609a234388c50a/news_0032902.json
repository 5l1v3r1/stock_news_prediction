(Reuters) - Webb Simpson heard the roars echoing across TPC Sawgrass as Tiger Woods made a charge but in the end he had a large enough cushion to clinch a comfortable four-stroke victory at the Players Championship on Sunday. May 13, 2018; Ponte Vedra Beach, FL, USA; Webb Simpson holds up the trophy after winning the final round of The Players Championship golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass - Stadium Course. Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\nThe 2012 U.S. Open champion was never seriously challenged after starting the day with a seven-shot lead, though Woods briefly got within four strokes after making six birdies in the first 12 holes.\n“There’s so much noise in front of us with Tiger,” said Simpson. “His roars are definitely a different sound than everybody else’s but I knew he started 10 or 11 shots back, so he would have to do something really special.”\nWoods would stall later in the round, dropping three shots.

So once that happened, internally I was celebrating.”\nSimpson dedicated the victory to his parents — his late father Sam who died last November, and his mother Debbie back home in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n“My dad got me started in the game,” Simpson said.\n“He kept me in other sports but he could tell that I was better in golf.\n“I also felt unconditional love from my mum no matter how I played.” Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ian Ransom/Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T03:08:31.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
