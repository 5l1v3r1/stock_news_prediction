The listing values the U.S. entity at $11.22 billion.\nThe AXA Equitable flotation and the XL purchase are a test for Chief Executive Thomas Buberl, who after almost two years at AXA's helm is striving to make his mark.\nFaced with tighter regulation and low investment returns, AXA is seeking growth in areas such as property and casualty insurance for businesses, capital-light savings products, health insurance, as well as in Asia.\nThe acquisition of commercial insurer and reinsurer XL Group would see property and casualty insurance (P&C) rising to half of AXA's earnings, from 39 percent now.\nInvestors appear unimpressed with the XL deal, announced in March. AXA's stock is down 9 percent in 2018, underperforming the European insurance index, which is up 3.3 percent, and reflecting a view among analysts that it is paying a high price for XL and that its debt ratio is set to become stretched.\nTOUGH MARKET\nAXA Equitable was not the first U.S. insurance IPO this year to price below its target range, after Goosehead Insurance Inc did the same in April.\nInvestors have previously voiced concerns about the exposure of U.S. insurers to the long-term care (LTC) industry, pays out for end-of-life medical care, such as when a person needs assistance bathing or feeding themselves.\nAXA Equitable offers such protection to clients through a rider on life insurance products. It is one of America's oldest life insurers, with roots going back to 1859 in New York. AXA acquired the business in 1992.\nAXA launched the IPO in a tough market that has seen some players withdraw their offerings amid lackluster demand. Shares in life insurance peers such as Prudential Financial, MetLife, and Lincoln Financial have been under pressure following weak earnings results.\nMorgan Stanley, JP Morgan Barclays and Citigroup are the main investment banks involved in the IPO.
