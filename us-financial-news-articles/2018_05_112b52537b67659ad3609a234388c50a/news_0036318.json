Damien said he was taken to a police station overnight and questioned.\nDamien said he was asked to sign a pledge promising to cancel upcoming events and in return he would be released.\nThe Interior Ministry said it was unable to provide immediate comment.\nDamien said he was told that if he refused to sign the pledge, he would be “referred to the investigation judge who will interrogate me on the basis of articles pertaining to the incitement to immorality and to the breach of public morality for coordinating the activities.”\nOn legal advice, Damien signed the pledge, he said in the statement.\nLebanon’s laws prohibit “unnatural” sex, without giving further definition, which has been used to criminalise gay sex. Last year a Lebanese judge said same-sex relations do not contradict laws of nature, a move welcomed by rights activists.\nDamien also said the public prosecution had received an Arabic version of the Beirut Pride programme which was “completely distorted, making the happenings of Beirut Pride appear like events of debauchery, disrespect of general law, while using derogatory terms to refer to LGBT individuals.”\nReporting by Lisa Barrington; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:03:52.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
