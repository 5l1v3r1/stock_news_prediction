He added that the unit’s order book grew 30 percent in the first quarter.\nBoursier also said that Suez plans to save 40 million euros in costs in France from 2019 and 20 million in Spain from 2020.\n$1 = 0.8462 euros Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:45:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
