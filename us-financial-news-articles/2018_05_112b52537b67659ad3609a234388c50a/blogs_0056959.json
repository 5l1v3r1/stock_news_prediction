When that vehicle switched lanes, the Tesla automatically accelerated to its preset speed of 60 mph, neglecting to detect a group of stopped vehicles ahead, police say.\nPhoto released by the South Jordan Police Department shows a traffic collision involving a Tesla Model S sedan with a Fire Department mechanic truck stopped at a red light in South Jordan, Utah on May 11, 2018. AP/REX/Shutterstock Although the vehicle’s driver, Heather Lommatzsch, 29, tried to brake manually at the last second, it was not enough to prevent the car from rear-ending the fire truck. Lommatzsch, who according to car data did not touch the steering wheel for more than a minute before the crash, suffered a broken ankle. The fire truck driver sustained whiplash injuries, but opted not to go to a hospital.\nJust three days after the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted his disdain for the media’s coverage, stating that, “It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage[.]”\nPhoto released by the South Jordan Police Department shows a traffic collision involving a Tesla Model S sedan with a Fire Department mechanic truck stopped at a red light in South Jordan, Utah on May 11, 2018. AP/REX/Shutterstock The crash comes in the wake of several other incidents in which Tesla’s Autopilot has been investigated as the culprit. In March, a Tesla Model X driver was killed when his vehicle, which had Autopilot mode engaged, crashed into a California freeway barrier . Earlier this month, two 18-year-olds died in Florida after the Tesla Model S they were riding in crashed into a wall and caught on fire . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the incident, but does not suspect the vehicle’s Autopilot mode to be the focus.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/996131586469842945?lang=en", "https://apnews.com/6c51bdb26fa84b8dbcd4029b46ce200e"], "published": "2018-05-25T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:00:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
