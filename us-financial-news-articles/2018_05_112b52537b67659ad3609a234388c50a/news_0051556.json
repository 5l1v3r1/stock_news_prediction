They don’t have anything they can call their own,” she said.\nThe United Nations has described the military crackdown as “ethnic cleansing,” which Myanmar has denied, saying its security forces were conducting a legitimate counter-insurgency operation against “terrorists.”\nChopra urged the international community to tackle the issue of Rohingya children living without basic rights to food, clean water, shelter, proper sanitation and education.\n“There’s so much more to be done. They need your money, time, compassion,” she said.\nIn March the United Nations launched an appeal for $951 million to help the Rohingya refugees for the rest of the year, but it remains less than 20 percent funded.\nReporting by Ruma Paul; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:14:27.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
