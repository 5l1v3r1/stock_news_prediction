The gap over benchmark German Bund yields was at 181 bps, having widened to as much as 190 bps in the previous session.\n“Everybody is waiting to see what Mattarella will do,” said Martin van Vliet, senior fixed income strategist at ING.\n“For me the finance minister posting is more important than who is prime minister and the option raised yesterday is a eurosceptic, which Mattarella is unlikely to be happy with.” (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Catherine Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr"], "published": "2018-05-23T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:32:24.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
