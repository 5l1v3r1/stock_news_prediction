Justify made his racing debut on Feb. 18 and improved his undefeated record to 4-for-4.\nBaffert said Justify was “a handful” in the barn the morning after his Derby romp and will stay in Kentucky this week before heading to Baltimore for the May 19 Preakness Stakes.\nAlthough 20 horses entered the starting gate for the Derby, a much smaller field is likely for the Preakness.\nOf the Derby runners, only Bravazo, who finished sixth, appears headed for a rematch in the second leg of the Triple Crown. Good Magic, the second-place finisher, hasn’t been ruled out by trainer Chad Brown. Trainer Todd Pletcher ran four horses in the Derby, but none are expected to challenge Justify in two weeks.\nAll of Baffert’s previous four Derby winners went on to win the Preakness, including American Pharoah, War Emblem (2002), Real Quiet (1998) and Silver Charm (1997). Baffert has now won a total of 13 Triple Crown races in his Hall of Fame career.\nWrite to Jim Chairusmi at jim.chairusmi@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-06T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T02:14:40.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
