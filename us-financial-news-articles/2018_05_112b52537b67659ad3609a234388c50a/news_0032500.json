I lost the rear end in turn three and I just spun. If you look at the footage, I had wanted to avoid contact with my teammate,” said the Frenchman.\n“Kevin (Magnussen) had a bit of a wobble, I lifted off the throttle, and then the car just went. I’m sorry for the others that were involved — there wasn’t much I could do once the car went.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ian Chadband\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:27:10.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
