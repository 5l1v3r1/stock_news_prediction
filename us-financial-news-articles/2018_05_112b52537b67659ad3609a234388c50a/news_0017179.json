(TSX:ARG) (“Amerigo” or the “Company”) announced today financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The Company posted revenue of $33.9 million and net income of $1.2 million. Cash of $5.9 million was generated from operations before working capital changes. At March 31, 2018, cash balance was $29.9 million. The Cauquenes Phase Two expansion project was 51% complete at quarter end, on time and budget.\nRob Henderson, Amerigo’s President and CEO, stated “MVC’s robust production results together with stronger metal prices have improved our financial position and our focus is to safely complete our expansion to 85 – 90 million pounds of copper per year on budget in Q4-2018.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue was $33.9 million (Q1-2017: $29.8 million), including copper revenue of $29.5 million (Q1-2017: $25.3 million) and molybdenum and other revenue of $4.4 million (Q1-2017: $4.4 million).\nCopper revenue is calculated from MVC’s gross value of copper produced of $45.9 million (Q1-2017: $38.7 million) less notional items including DET royalties of $10.8 million (Q1-2017: $7.7 million), smelting and refining of $5.0 million (Q1-2017: $5.1 million) and transportation of $0.6 million (Q1-2017: $0.5 million).\nIn Q1-2018, MVC’s copper price was $3.09 per pound (“/lb”) (Q1-2017: $2.65/lb) and MVC’s molybdenum price was $12.12/lb (Q1-2017: $8.01/lb).\nTolling and production costs were $28.7 million (Q1-2017: $27.8 million), driven by higher power, lime and grinding media costs. Unit tolling and production costs were $1.98/lb (Q1-2017: $1.83/lb).\nCash cost (a non-GAAP measure equal to the aggregate of smelting and refining charges, tolling/production costs net of inventory adjustments and administration costs, net of by-product credits) before DET notional copper royalties and DET molybdenum royalties increased to $1.77/lb (Q1-2017: $1.71/lb) due to higher production costs offset by higher molybdenum by-product credits.\nTotal cost (a non-GAAP measure equal to the aggregate of cash cost, DET notional copper royalties and DET molybdenum royalties of $0.80/lb and depreciation of $0.25/lb) increased to $2.83/lb (Q1-2017: $2.52/lb), due to higher DET notional royalties from higher metal prices.\nGross profit was $5.2 million (Q1-2017: $2.0 million). Net income was $1.2 million (Q1-2017: net loss of $1.3 million).\nEarnings per share were $0.01 (Q1-2017: loss per share of $0.01).\nThe Company generated operating cash flow before changes in non-cash working capital of $5.9 million (Q1-2017: $4.3 million).\nProduction\nQ1-2018 production was 14.2 million pounds of copper, 6% lower than the 15.1 million pounds produced in Q1-2017, which included 0.9 million pounds of copper produced pursuant to a tolling contract with Minera Maricunga.\nQ1-2018 copper production includes 8.9 million pounds from Cauquenes (Q1-2017: 9.6 million pounds) and 5.3 million pounds from fresh tailings (Q1-2017: 4.7 million pounds).\nMolybdenum production was 0.4 million pounds (Q1-2017: 0.3 million pounds).\nCash and Working Capital\nAt March 31,2018, cash balance was $29.9 million (December 31, 2017: $27.5 million), including $22.5 million in operating accounts and $7.3 million in a debt service reserve account.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had a working capital deficiency of $3.7 million (December 31, 2017: $4.5 million), caused by the Company’s current estimated DET Price Support Facility repayment scheduled to be completed in September 2018, which may change depending on MVC’s actual cash flows. The Company does not consider its working capital deficiency constitutes a liquidity risk, as it is only required to repay the DET Price Support Facility by December 2019 and at a rate of $1.0 million per month, and the Company anticipates generating sufficient operating cash flow to meet current liabilities as they come due. Working capital deficiencies are not uncommon in companies with short-term debt.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $30.5 million of undrawn, committed credit facilities, $17.5 million from the Phase Two expansion loan and $13.0 million from a shareholders’ standby line of credit.\nOutlook\nThe Company continues to expect full year production of 65.0 to 70.0 million pounds of copper at a cash cost of $1.45 to $1.60/lb and annual molybdenum production of 1.5 million pounds. Stronger production and lower cash costs are expected in H2-2018 when better quality material in Cauquenes is accessed and plant recoveries improve on completion of Phase Two.\nConstruction of Phase Two is on track for completion in Q3-2018, with full production in Q4-2018. MVC expects to complete the project within budget of $35.3 million including contingencies. Phase Two will improve flotation recovery efficiency, allowing MVC to increase production to 85.0 to 90.0 million pounds of copper per year.\nIn 2018, MVC expects to incur up to $23.5 million in Phase Two capital expenditures (“Capex”) and $5.5 million in sustaining Capex. MVC will also invest an additional $1.5 million in various Capex projects to improve safety and process efficiencies and is undertaking an expansion of its molybdenum plant at a Capex of $7.9 million financed by way of a seven-year lease and operating contract.\nMVC expects to draw the remaining $17.5 million from the Phase Two expansion loan and continue reducing its debt in 2018. Total borrowings at year end are expected to be $67.5 million.\nAmounts in this news release are reported in U.S. dollars except where indicated otherwise .\nThe information and data contained in this news release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2017, available at the Company’s website at www.amerigoresources.com and at www.sedar.com .\nConference Call Participation\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call on Thursday May 10, 2018 at 11:00 am Pacific Standard Time/2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.\nTo participate in the call, please dial 1-866-225-0198 (Toll-Free North America) and let the operator know you wish to participate in the Amerigo Resources conference call.

The use of any of the words \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"predict\", \"potential\", \"should\", \"believe\" and similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Company’s control, the Company cannot assure that it will achieve or accomplish the expectations, beliefs or projections described in the forward-looking statements.
