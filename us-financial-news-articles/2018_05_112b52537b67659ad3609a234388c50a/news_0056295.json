Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 28, 2018 France's Kristina Mladenovic in action during her first round match against Germany's Andrea Petkovic REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\nThe Frenchwoman, who had slipped down the rankings after 15 consecutive defeats between the end of July and mid-January, seemed on her way up again thanks to some recent landmark wins.\nIt appeared that a year after reaching the quarter-finals, she could make light work of German Petkovic, a former semi-finalist at Roland Garros. However, two consecutive double faults as she had three set points in the opening set’s tiebreak threw her off balance.\nMladenovic, who recently beat former French Open finalist Sam Stosur, never recovered and allowed world number 107 Petkovic to claim only her third victory on the main tour this year — also her fifth in as many encounters between the two.\nMladenovic started confidently on the Suzanne Lenglen court, where last year she beat then defending champion Garbine Muguruza to reach the last eight, opening up a 2-0 lead.
