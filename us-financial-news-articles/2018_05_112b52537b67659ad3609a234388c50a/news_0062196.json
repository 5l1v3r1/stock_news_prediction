Political developments in Italy have reintroduced some risk, and financial conditions in the euro area have worsened somewhat in response,” Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in prepared remarks.\n“I continue to view gradual increases in the federal funds rate as the appropriate path, although I will remain vigilant for the emergence of risks and prepared to adjust if conditions change,” she added.
