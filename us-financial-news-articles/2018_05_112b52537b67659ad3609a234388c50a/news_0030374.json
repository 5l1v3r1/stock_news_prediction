Continued strong profitability:\n- Q1 2018 GAAP operating income rose to $3.7 million from $0.02 million in Q1 2017.\n- Q1 2018 Non-GAAP operating income rose to $5.1 million, or 108% year over year.\n- Q1 2018 GAAP net income was $2.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with a GAAP loss of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in Q1 2017.\n- Q1 2018 non-GAAP net income increased year over year to $3.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, versus $1.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in Q1 2017.\n- Q1 2018 Adjusted EBITDA increased 78% year over year to $7.5 million, or 11.2 % of revenues.

The quarter was very positive from a business perspective, with significant wins and achievements.\n\"We won with Speedcast a substantial deal of tens of millions of dollars for NBN in Australia to meet the demand for broadband services for businesses and government customers.\n\"In addition, we made progress on the Telco backhaul front with additional Mobile Network Operators expanding several cellular backhaul networks, as well as securing a backhauling deal for critical communications with Altice in Portugal.\n\"And we also launched Gilat's complete dual-band aero terminal for commercial in-flight connectivity, which achieved noteworthy performance during a live customer demonstration in China, in both Ku and Ka, with unprecedented download speeds of 130Mbps with dozens of concurrent users.\n\"Our strong year-over-year financial performance in this quarter is the targeted outcome of the continued progress in our business and of our strategic growth engines of mobile cellular backhaul and mobility IFC, and is evident across all measures including the substantial increase in operating income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and the continued growth in Adjusted EBITDA to $7.5 million, an increase of 78% from Q1 2017. We also further delivered on our commitment to GAAP profitability with first quarter net income of $2.3 million compared with a loss of $0.8 million in the first quarter last year.\"\nMr. Ovadia concluded: \"The strong first quarter with the closing of the substantial deal with NBN in Australia, gave us a good start to the year. We remain strongly confident with our strategy and achieving our targets for the year.\"\nKey Recent Announcements:\nGilat Launches Complete Dual Band Aero Terminal for Commercial In-Flight Connectivity Altice Portugal Selects Gilat to Support Backhauling to Critical Communications Hispasat Selects Gilat for a Multi-Million Dollar Project to Deliver Broadband Services in Mexico\nConference Call and Webcast Details:\nGilat management will host a conference call today, Tuesday, May 15, to discuss the first quarter results.

To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company presents Non-GAAP presentations of net income, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. The adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results, trends and performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA (operating income before depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, costs related to acquisition transactions, restructuring cost, goodwill impairment, impairment of long lived assets, trade secrets litigation expenses and expenses under amnesty program) is presented to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods and evaluate the Company's financial and operating results on a consistent basis from period to period. The Company also believes this measure, when viewed in combination with the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, provides useful information to investors to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends. Adjusted EBITDA, however, should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income for the period and may not be indicative of the historic operating results of the Company; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures for other companies. Reconciliation between the Company's Operating income and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the attached summary financial statements.\nThis news release also contains a forward-looking estimate of Adjusted EBITDA projected to be generated by Gilat in 2018. A forward-looking estimate of net income and reconciliations of the forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA to net income are not provided because the items necessary to estimate net income are not estimable at this time. Non-GAAP presentations of net income, operating income, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any of the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as an indication of Gilat's operating performance or liquidity.\nAbout Gilat\nGilat Satellite Networks Ltd.
