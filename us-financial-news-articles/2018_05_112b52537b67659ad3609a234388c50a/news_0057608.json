(“Evine”) (NASDAQ:EVLV) today announced results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018. The Company posted quarterly net sales of $156.5 million, compared to $156.3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The Company realized a net loss of $3.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million, as compared to a net loss of $3.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Highlights\nNet sales were $156.5 million, a 0.1% increase year-over-year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%. Excluding contract termination costs of $753,000, which had a 50 basis point impact, gross profit as a percentage of sales would have been 36.4%, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. Net loss was $3.0 million, a 7% improvement year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 million, a 7% increase year-over-year. EPS was ($0.05), flat to the prior year and includes ($0.03) impact for executive transition expenses and contract termination costs.\n“I am very encouraged by our first quarter operating results,” said CEO Bob Rosenblatt. “It was a very productive quarter for us and the results reflect the hard work and focus of many over the past two years towards our turnaround efforts.”\n“Strategically, 2018 is about profitable revenue growth, product development and increasing our customer base,” continued Rosenblatt. “We can achieve our goals if we maintain our focus and deliver on our stated strategy to position Evine as a leading omni-channel purveyor of proprietary, exclusive, and under-discovered goods. This, when combined with our fully built out direct-to-consumer and increasingly valuable video commerce platform, will deliver increased value for our shareholders, customers and vendors.”\nSUMMARY RESULTS AND KEY OPERATING METRICS ($ Millions, except average selling price and EPS) Q1 2018\n5/5/2018 Q1 2017\n4/29/2017 Change Net Sales $ 156.5 $ 156.3 0.1 % Gross Margin % 35.9 % 36.0 % (10 bps ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 3.3 $ 3.1 7 % Net Loss $ (3.0 ) $ (3.2 ) 7 % EPS $ (0.05 ) $ (0.05 ) 0 % Net Shipped Units (000s) 2,472 2,580 (4 %) Average Selling Price (ASP) $ 57 $ 54 6 % Return Rate % 18.9 % 18.8 % 10 bps Digital Net Sales % 53.0 % 50.6 % 240 bps Total Customers - 12 Month Rolling (000s) 1,269 1,409 (10 %) % of Net Merchandise Sales by Category Jewelry & Watches 40 % 41 % Home & Consumer Electronics 22 % 21 % Beauty & Wellness 19 % 16 % Fashion & Accessories 19 % 22 % Total 100 % 100 % First Quarter 2018 Results\nThe top performing category in the quarter was Beauty & Wellness, which grew 17.3% year-over-year, reflecting strong results from our subscription business. Home and Consumer Electronics also had strong year-over-year growth of 5.5% with strength in our tabletop category. Digital net sales as a percentage of total net sales increased 240 basis points to 53.0%, reflecting our continued focus on making the customer experience as frictionless as possible across all devices. The return rate for the quarter was 18.9%; relatively flat year-over-year and within our expectations based on our merchandise mix. Gross profit dollars were flat year-over-year at approximately $56.3 million. Excluding contract termination costs of $753,000, gross profit dollars would have been approximately $57.0 million, or 1.3% better than last year. Operating expenses increased 2.3% or $1.3 million year-over-year to $58.2 million, including a $518,000 increase for executive transition expenses. The remaining increase was due to investments in our organization to support growth. Additionally, year-over-year increases in program distribution costs associated with high definition carriage were mostly offset by savings related to favorable negotiations for other carriage.\nExecutive Team Changes\nFurther strengthening the organization’s operations, during the quarter, the Company announced two new members to its senior leadership team. As previously announced, Diana Purcel was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mark Locks was appointed as Executive Vice President of Product Sourcing and Business Development. Both are highly experienced executives with careers spanning a diverse group of retail companies. Mrs. Purcel replaced Tim Peterman, formally Chief Operating Officer / Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Peterman’s Chief Operating Officer responsibilities have been absorbed by the executive team.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of May 5, 2018, total unrestricted cash was $30.1 million, compared to $23.9 million at the end of fiscal 2017. The Company also had an additional $14.2 million of unused availability on its revolving credit facility, which gives the Company total liquidity of $44.3 million as of the end of the first quarter.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nNote: Fiscal 2018 has 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in Fiscal 2017.\nWe affirm our expectations for the year. We continue to expect normalized sales growth in the 2% to 5% range on a 52-week over 52-week basis, which equates to 0% to 3% on a reported basis due to the extra week in fiscal 2017. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be in the $19 to $21 million range, which would equate to growth of 5% to 17% year-over-year.

These adjustments may include the impact of such items as loss on debt extinguishment, gain on sale of assets, executive and management transition costs, restructuring charges, the effect of other certain one-time items, and the income tax effect of such items. We are unable to quantify these types of adjustments that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts. In addition, we believe such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision on inherently unpredictable events in our outlook that could be confusing to investors.\nEVINE Live Inc.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding non-operating gains (losses); executive and management transition costs; loss on debt extinguishment; contract termination costs; gain on sale of television station and non-cash share-based compensation expense. The Company has included the “Adjusted EBITDA” measure in our EBITDA reconciliation in order to adequately assess the operating performance of our television and online businesses and in order to maintain comparability to our analyst's coverage and financial guidance, when given. Management believes that the Adjusted EBITDA measure allows investors to make a meaningful comparison between our business operating results over different periods of time with those of other similar companies. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a metric to evaluate operating performance under the Company’s management and executive incentive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be construed as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. The Company has included a reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in this release.\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis document may contain certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
