REUTERS/Jason Reed/File photo\nThe new offer is equivalent to A$6.95 a share at an exchange rate of 75 U.S. cents to 1 Australian dollar, and is at an 11.2-percent premium to the last close of Santos shares on Friday.\nA successful bid would mark the biggest takeover of an Australian oil and gas producer.\nThe revised proposal, up 4.6 percent from an earlier offer, is conditional on Santos undertaking additional hedging of oil-linked production in 2018 of about 30 percent and changes to hedging in 2019, Santos said in a statement.\nHarbour said the offer price would be increased to a U.S. dollar amount equivalent to A$7.00 per share if Santos agreed to hedge 30 percent of oil-linked production in 2020.\nThe requirement for Adelaide-based Santos to step up its hedging is tied to securing funding for the deal, as Harbour will be taking on a lot of debt for the acquisition on top of Santos’ existing net debt of around $2.5 billion. Hedging would ensure cash flows needed to pay down debt, protecting the company from oil price volatility.\nOil prices LCOc1 have risen about 17 percent since Santos received Harbour’s $4.98 per share offer in April.\nIndependent directors of Santos will consider the revised Harbour proposal, the company said.
