That’s not so easy. Because players (are) coming back from injury.\nSoccer Football - FIFA World Cup - Australia Training - Antalya, Turkey - May 29, 2018 Australia coach Bert van Marwijk and players before training REUTERS/Murad Sezer “It’s a very big difference and you want to prepare but you don’t have a lot of time.\n“That’s my problem. I knew it before, I knew I can’t change it, I cannot blame anybody, but I’m happy everybody is here and I can train with all players.”\nBarring a few minutes at the start of sessions, media have been barred from training as Van Marwijk imprints his game plan upon a squad that made hard work of Asian qualifying and struggled to score goals.\nThe manager has been cagey about his set-up, but has shelved his predecessor Ange Postecoglou’s 3-2-4-1 formation in favor of four at the back.\nPlayers are still being tested in different roles but defensive midfielder Mark Milligan has been told he will only be used as a central defender, meaning Jedinak is likely to retain his holding midfield role.\nSoccer Football - FIFA World Cup - Australia Training - Antalya, Turkey - May 29, 2018 Australia coach Bert van Marwijk before training REUTERS/Murad Sezer “I don’t mind,” Milligan told Australian media. “It’s nice to know what position I’m being looked at.”\nAustralia have never lacked for hard-working footballers and their discipline has impressed Van Marwijk, but he is concerned their eagerness to follow his orders has made them reluctant to improvise.\n“But what I was a little bit surprised about was they did everything exactly the way I told them,” said Van Marwijk.\n“In life you (also) have to take decisions for yourself.\n“Sometimes, things change. Sometimes, they are different. Then you have to anticipate that.\n“I like discipline, but I also like players who develop themselves and who sometimes take their own decisions.”\nAfter a 4-1 loss to Norway and a 0-0 draw against Colombia in March, Van Marwijk will see how far his squad have come in a friendly against 45th-ranked Czech Republic on Friday in St Polten, Austria.\n(This story has been refiled to remove apostrophe in lead)\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:23:56.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
