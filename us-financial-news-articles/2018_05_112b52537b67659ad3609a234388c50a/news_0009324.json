He will also chair a new QIC U.S. Leadership Forum comprising representatives from QIC Global Real Estate, Global Infrastructure and Global Private Capital, responsible for implementing QIC's U.S. strategy.\nMr. Delaney will continue to serve on QIC's Executive Committee and report to QIC CEO Damien Frawley. He will relocate to the U.S. to assume this position and be based in QIC's Los Angeles office.\nDavid Asplin, currently Managing Director – Global Business Development, has been named Chief Operating Officer – Global Real Estate. In this newly created position, Mr. Asplin will manage the performance of QIC's Global Real Estate business as it enters its next phase of growth, reporting directly to and working closely with Steve Leigh, Managing Director – Global Real Estate. He will continue to serve on QIC's Executive Committee and be based in QIC's Brisbane office.\nBoth appointments are effective July 1, 2018.\nQIC recently reached an important milestone in its U.S. expansion, completing its acquisition of Forest City Enterprises' interest in six U.S. shopping centers and assuming operational control of all 12 shopping centers in QIC's U.S. portfolio. Today QIC has more than 200 employees based in the U.S., and, in addition to the 12 shopping centers, its U.S. investment portfolio includes three infrastructure investments.\nMr. Frawley said, \"Brian's appointment reflects the value that QIC places on further developing client relationships and business opportunities in the U.S. With the U.S. having become our second largest market in terms of both employees and assets, Brian's role will be crucial in growing our networks, particularly as we build QIC's brand and reputation in the U.S. and raise capital for the QIC U.S. Shopping Center Fund.\"\nMr. Delaney commented, \"I'm excited to assume this role at an important time in QIC's growth in the U.S. I look forward to working with my colleagues across our U.S. offices to further embed QIC's culture of high performance and inclusion, which has underpinned our achievements in recent years.\"\nCommenting on Mr. Asplin's appointment, Mr. Frawley said, \"David is a proven leader and experienced funds management executive who has been successful in guiding our global business development efforts. His leadership, skills and discipline will be important assets in managing the business performance of QIC Global Real Estate, the largest of our business units, and working to achieve the financial targets we have set for that business, especially now that we have assumed ownership and full operational control of our U.S. mall portfolio.\"\nIn conjunction with Mr. Asplin's appointment, QIC is putting in place an enhanced management structure for its Global Real Estate business to accommodate its greater size and complexity. The expanded team includes the appointments of Stuart Miller as Global Director – Asset Strategy, to lead strategic planning across U.S. assets; Brenton Watson as Executive Vice President – Asset Management U.S., focusing on performance of U.S. assets; and Joe Boehm, Executive Vice President – Retail, with responsibility for U.S. retail partnerships and leasing.\nBefore joining QIC, Mr. Delaney was with AMP Capital Investors for 14 years as Director of the Client, Product & Marketing division.
