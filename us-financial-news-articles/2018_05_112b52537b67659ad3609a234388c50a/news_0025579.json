REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/Files Bengaluru-headquartered Canara Bank Ltd, the biggest of the four, said its net loss was 48.6 billion rupees for the three months to March 31, compared with a net profit of 2.14 billion rupees a year earlier.\nAllahabad Bank reported a net loss of 35.1 billion rupees and UCO Bank a 21.34 billion rupee loss.
