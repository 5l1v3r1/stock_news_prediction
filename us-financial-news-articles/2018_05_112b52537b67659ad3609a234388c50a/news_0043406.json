First set was fantastic, in my opinion, in terms of everything,” he added.\n“Feeling, good shots, tactically — everything was, in my opinion great in the first set, no. Returning great. All the things that I wanted to do happened. So, it was a great set.”\nZverev, who had won back-to-back claycourt titles over the previous two weeks in Munich and Madrid, hit back to win the second set but a rain delay disrupted his rhythm and Nadal reeled off the last five games to seal his 78th career title.\nThe 21-year-old German will be second seed at Roland Garros and he took some positives from his performance in Rome.\n“I was not far away from beating Rafa on a clay court in a Masters final,” he said.\n“So I guess I can take that to Paris.”\nWriting by Nick Mulvenney in Sydney; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T12:13:41.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
