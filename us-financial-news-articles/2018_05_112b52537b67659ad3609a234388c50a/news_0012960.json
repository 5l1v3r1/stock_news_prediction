Italian Presidential Press Office/Handout via REUTERS “We trust that the president will give us the chance to find a majority in parliament,” Salvini told reporters after meeting President Sergio Mattarella at the head of a center-right alliance of parties.\nThe March 4 ballot produced a hung parliament, with the center-right bloc taking the most seats, and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerging as the biggest single party. It was far from clear if Salvini could muster enough votes in parliament to form a government.\nReporting by Gavin Jones; Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T20:02:06.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
