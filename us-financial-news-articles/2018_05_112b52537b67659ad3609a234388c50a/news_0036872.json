But it also led to new fund launches on an expectation of higher rates in the sector, particularly at renewal dates in June and July.\nTangency Capital, which has offices in London and Bermuda and will invest directly in non-life reinsurance risks, was founded by Dominik Hagedorn, Michael Jedraszak and Kai Morgenstern.
