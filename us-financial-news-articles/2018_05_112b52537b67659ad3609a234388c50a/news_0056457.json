Italian bank stocks were down 4.89 percent, their lowest in 13 months as investors looked to potential negative outcomes from likely fresh elections.\nThe euro also turned negative and was lower 0.3 percent, having been up as much as 0.6 percent earlier in the session.\nMeanwhile, Spanish government bond yields hit fresh 2-1/2 month highs on Monday, hit by concerns over a potential snap election and also by Italian political uncertainty, which affected sentiment throughout Southern Europe.\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will face a vote of confidence in his leadership on Friday as corruption convictions handed down to dozens of people linked to his centre-right People’s Party (PP) threatened his six-year rule.\nThe yield on 10-year Spanish government debt briefly touched 1.537 percent, the highest since March 5, before settling at 1.52 percent; still up 6 basis points on the day.\n“Political turmoil has put European government bond markets in crisis mode as snap election fears in Spain add to the uncertainty emanating from Italy,” ING analysts said in a note.\nThe premium investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year debt over the German equivalent was at its highest since the start of the year at 114 basis points.
