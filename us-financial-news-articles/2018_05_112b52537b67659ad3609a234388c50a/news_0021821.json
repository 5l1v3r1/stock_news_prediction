In exchange, Australia accepted 30 Central American refugees late last year.\nBut even if the United States accepted the full quota, more than 300 people are likely to remain in the Pacific camps, in two impoverished countries with little ability to effectively integrate them.\nBut asylum-seeker advocates fear the United States will not accept its full quota as Trump has vowed applicants would have to satisfy “extreme vetting”.\nU.S. processing has concentrated on individuals with applications that are seen as easier to verify through background checks and who come from counties with closer ties to the United States.\nPeople from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - countries included in Trump’s travel ban - have seen their applications lag, migrants say.\nThe prospect of hundreds of people being left behind has fueled condemnation of Australia’s immigration law.\n“There is no possibility of hundreds of refugees and asylum seekers to be resettled in PNG and Nauru,” said Ian Rintoul, a spokesman for the advocacy group, Refugee Action Coalition.\n“There are no services, no support, no jobs. They have no future.”\nAustralia defends its tough law saying it has deterred people from making dangerous sea journeys to try to reach its shores after thousands drowned.\nReporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T10:57:11.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
