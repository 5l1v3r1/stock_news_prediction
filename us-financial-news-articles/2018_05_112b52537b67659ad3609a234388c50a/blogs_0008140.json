Photo: De Agostini/Getty Images\nThe U.K. will require its overseas territories to develop public registries of the owners of companies formed there, marking a major victory for activists pursuing anti-money laundering reforms.\nA government minister backed down from earlier-stated opposition to an amendment to a sanctions and anti-money laundering bill that would require such registries from the overseas territories, which include financial hubs such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.\nThe amendment had cross-party support ahead of a vote Tuesday; it requires the territories establish the registries by the end of 2020.\nLeaders in the overseas territories opposed the amendment, saying it interfered with their internal affairs.\nPublic corporate-ownership registries are seen by some activists as a way to curb money laundering by piercing the veil of shell-company secrecy and by allowing the public to identify potential financial criminals. Such companies are legal but susceptible to abuse; they’ve increasingly become a focus of anti-money laundering activists in the wake of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks.\nThe U.K. has tried to stake a claim as a leader in global anticorruption reform in recent years. Antigraft group Transparency International said in early April the U.K. is the only country to make its corporate registry publicly available, but the study noted the overseas territories still posed problems. The territories have become havens for tax avoidance and financial secrecy , according to activists.\n“As we have documented at length, the U.K.’s financial secrecy network is the biggest in the world. While the UK itself is only moderately secretive…this reflects the deliberate outsourcing of secrecy to the crown dependencies, and the more numerous overseas territories,” said Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy and research group.\nThe move to approve the amendment is “a huge win in the fight against corruption, tax dodging and money laundering,” said Naomi Hirst, an anticorruption activist at London-based nonprofit Global Witness.\n“The U.K.’s tax havens have featured in countless corruption and money laundering cases–ending their corporate secrecy will throw a huge spanner in the works of corrupt dictators, tax evaders and organized criminals,” she said.\nOfficials in the territories were opposed of the registry ahead of the decision. The move is “undemocratic and undermines the people of British Virgin Islands,” said Lorna Smith, executive director of BVI Finance, in an interview with BBC Today posted to the government’s website . “This smacks of colonialism,” she said.\nThe amendment doesn’t capture the Crown Dependencies, which include Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man. A member of parliament was quoted by The Guardian newspaper as saying he expects the government to “make the point persuasively” to the crown dependencies that they should “embrace the same ethical position.”\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
