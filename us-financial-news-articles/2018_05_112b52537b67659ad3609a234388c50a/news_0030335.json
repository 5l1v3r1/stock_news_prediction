He also said he had suffered a heart attack a week ago.\nOn Tuesday, TMZ quoted Markle as saying he wanted to attend, if his health allows it.\n“I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle,” Markle, who lives in Mexico, told the website.\nMarkle added that if doctors let him out of the hospital he will risk his health and fly to England for Saturday’s wedding.\nKensington Palace, Harry’s office, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, it declined to comment on the TMZ report or Markle’s father’s plans.\n“This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding,” Kensington Palace, Harry’s office, said in a statement. “She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.” Related Coverage Timings for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding DEPENDS ON HIS HEALTH\nSamantha Markle, the actress’s half-sister, told the Good Morning Britain TV program she hoped he would still be there but it depended on his health.\n“He was really having heart pains and suffered a heart attack,” she said. “It was an unbelievable amount of stress.\n“I don’t know as of today what his plans are, but there’s a very real concern. I wanted to see him go (to the wedding). I didn’t want him deprived of that. But clearly the priority should be whether or not it’s safe for him to do that.”\nThe bride-to-be’s parents are divorced and while Harry has been pictured with her mother Doria Ragland, 61, there had been speculation about how Thomas Markle, a former lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms, would feature.\nHowever, Harry’s communications secretary told reporters last week he would have an important role and would give away his daughter on the couple’s big day. He had also been expected to meet the queen, her husband and the other senior members of the Windsor family this week.\nThousands of journalists from across the world are descending on the genteel town of Windsor for the wedding, and Thomas Markle told TMZ that the media attention had taken its toll. He said he had been offered up to $100,000 for interviews and been ambushed by paparazzi whose snaps had shown him buying beer and looking dishevelled.\nTMZ said he had agreed to the staged pictures, which showed him looking at images of the couple on a computer and being sized up for a suit, because he hoped they would improve his image.\nPrince Harry and his elder brother Prince William have both made clear in the past their dislike of the press, fueled by the death of their mother Princess Diana in a Paris car crash in 1997 as her limousine sped away from chasing paparazzi.
