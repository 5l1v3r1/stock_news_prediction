Election officials say the group is not a registered political action committee and they have no information about it.\nThe letters appear to have also been sent to voters in other states.\nThere’s nothing illegal about the group obtaining the information. It’s all part of the public record and available to anyone who wants it for $20 in Pennsylvania. The data includes personal information, including party affiliation, though it does not include a specific voting history. Candidates frequently use it for voter outreach.\nStill, residents are uncomfortable knowing that the information is now being shared with people in their neighborhood. And G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, called the mailings an inappropriate effort meant “to embarrass people into voting.”\nThe question no one can answer is: Why send the notes at all?\n“It’s really hard to say what their objective is,” Kyle Kopko, an Elizabethtown College political science professor, told Lancaster Online. “It could be to boost turnout overall, or target voters who might be sympathetic to a certain type of candidate, or something else altogether.”\nEven before the controversy, Pennsylvania’s primaries have been of particular interest to politicos. The state’s district map was recently redrawn , which could shift the political landscape, and there are seven vacancies for the House of Representatives, the most since 1976. A key Senate battle is also taking place in the state.
