We think there will be big swings ahead, but the price level will lie at a relatively high level in the near term, “ said Beltestad.\nDemand in China increased by 18 percent in January-March, he said, while in the European Union it rose by 7 percent. Meanwhile global supply of farmed fish is expected to grow by 3.7 percent this year against the 5 percent Leroey had forecast in February.\nPeer Norway Royal Salmon also anticipated “good” demand ahead with low growth in supply, after reporting a 5.8 percent drop in first-quarter operating profit.\nSlowing supply has made the market volatile for producers but Norway Royal Salmon said the outlook was positive despite the drop in operating profit.\n“Together with good demand for salmon, this provides the basis for a continued positive market outlook for the industry,” the company said in a statement.\nFish farms, which raise salmon and rainbow trout, have grown from being a side activity for Norwegian fishermen two decades ago into the country’s second-largest exports after oil and gas, with sales of 64.7 billion Norwegian crowns ($7.99 bln) in 2017.\nOn Monday, Bakkafrost a producer in the Faroes said it expected a tight salmon market ahead as supply growth abates after reporting below-forecast first-quarter earnings.\nMarine Harvest, the world’s largest fish farmer, will present its outlook on Wednesday after preliminary results on April 16 showed operating profit fell 31 percent from a year earlier, slightly below analysts’ forecasts and also hit by volatile supply conditions.
