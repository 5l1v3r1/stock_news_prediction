(NYSE:AMRC), a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy company, today announced financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company has also furnished supplemental information in conjunction with this press release in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The supplemental information includes non-GAAP financial metrics, and has been posted to the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website at www.ameresco.com .\nManagement Commentary\n“First quarter results were outstanding, demonstrating the momentum in our business,” said George P. Sakellaris, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ameresco. “All of our lines of business grew revenue meaningfully while expanding profitability. Our recurring revenue streams grew over 20% and contributed the majority of our profit, a direct result of our strategic focus. Efficiency project revenue was up over 30% with broad strength across the country complementing the continued momentum with the Federal government. Looking ahead, we are expecting the momentum to continue, which could help drive growth for years to come. Based on the strong first quarter results, we are reiterating the annual guidance we offered a few weeks ago, which reflects our confidence in the outlook for another year of accelerating growth.”\nFinancial Results\n(All financial result comparisons made are against the prior year period unless otherwise noted.)\nFirst Quarter 2018\nRevenues were $167.4 million, compared to $134.6 million. Operating income was $8.3 million, compared to operating loss of $0.6 million.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $7.0 million compared to a loss of $0.6 million, and net income per diluted share was $0.15 compared to a loss of $0.01. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.16, compared to a loss of $0.04.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $15.8 million, compared to $6.0 million.\nAdditional First Quarter 2018 Operating Highlights:\nCash flows used in operating activities were $37.1 million, compared to $32.0 million, and adjusted cash from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(0.5) million, compared to $3.2 million. Total project backlog was $1.9 billion and consisted of: $595.6 million of fully-contracted backlog, representing signed customer contracts for installation or construction of projects, which we expect to convert into revenue over the next two to four years, on average; and $1.3 billion of awarded projects, representing projects in development for which we do not have signed contracts. Assets in development were $221.4 million or 90 MWe.\nFY 2018 Guidance\nBased on year to date performance and expectations for the remainder of 2018, Ameresco is revising its 2018 outlook. Ameresco expects net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70 for 2018. Ameresco reaffirms total revenue to be in the range of $765 million to $800 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in 2018. This guidance excludes the impact of any non-controlling interest activity and our restructuring activities, as well as any related tax impact.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThrough the end of the first quarter, the Company repurchased 2,085,397 shares of its Class A common stock for $11.5 million. The Company has approximately $3.5 million of remaining authorization under the share repurchase program it announced in May 2016.\nWebcast Reminder\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss results.\nThe conference call will be available via the following dial in numbers:\nU.S. Participants: Dial 1-877-359-9508 (Access Code: 4396436) International Participants: Dial 1-224-357-2393 (Access Code: 4396436)\nParticipants are advised to dial into the call at least ten minutes prior to register.\nA live, listen-only webcast of the conference call will also be available over the Internet.

compensation 1,000 2,000 Restructuring and other charges — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 75,000 $ 85,000 Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measures defined and discussed below to provide investors and others with useful supplemental information to our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, please see Other Non-GAAP Disclosure and Non-GAAP Financial Guidance in the tables above.\nWe understand that, although measures similar to these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, they have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage investors to review our GAAP financial statements included above, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, loss related to a significant non-core project in Canada and charges related to a significant customer bankruptcy. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: adjusted EBITDA and similar non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon financing and accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the methods by which assets were acquired; securities analysts often use adjusted EBITDA and similar non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies; and by comparing our adjusted EBITDA in different historical periods, investors can evaluate our operating results without the additional variations of depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and loss related to a significant non-core project in Canada. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.\nOur management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as measures of operating performance, because they do not include the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of the business; to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and in communications with the board of directors and investors concerning our financial performance.\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, we changed our calculation and presentation of adjusted EBITDA to exclude restructuring charges and losses related to a significant non-core project in Canada and during the third quarter of 2016, we changed our calculation and presentation of adjusted EBITDA in order to exclude charges related to a significant customer bankruptcy. We do not consider these items indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for the prior periods have been recalculated to be presented on a comparable basis.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and EPS\nWe define non-GAAP net income and earnings per share (\"EPS\") to exclude certain discrete items that management does not consider representative of our ongoing operations, including restructuring charges, loss related to a significant non-core project in Canada, impact from redeemable non-controlling interest and charges related to a significant customer bankruptcy. We consider non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS to be important indicators of our operational strength and performance of our business because they eliminate the effects of events that are not part of the Company's core operations.\nAdjusted Cash from Operations\nWe define adjusted cash from operations as cash flows from operating activities plus proceeds from Federal ESPC projects. Cash received in payment of Federal ESPC projects is treated as a financing cash flow under GAAP due to the unusual financing structure for these projects. These cash flows, however, correspond to the revenue generated by these projects. Thus we believe that adjusting operating cash flow to include the cash generated by our Federal ESPC projects provides investors with a useful measure for evaluating the cash generating ability of our core operating business. Our management uses adjusted cash from operations as a measure of liquidity because it captures all sources of cash associated with our revenue generated by operations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005415/en/\nAmeresco, Inc.\nMedia Relations\nCarolAnn Hibbard, 508-661-2264\nnews@ameresco.com\nor\nInvestor Relations\nJohn Granara, 508-661-2215\nir@ameresco.com\nor\nThe Blue Shirt Group\nGary Dvorchak, CFA, 323-240-5796\nir@ameresco.com\nSource: Ameresco, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ameresco.com&esheet=51798489&newsitemid=20180501005415&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ameresco.com&index=2&md5=e452af6570bcb27ec3188fa2e9172bf8", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ameresco.com&esheet=51798489&newsitemid=20180501005415&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ameresco.com&index=3&md5=0eed84afed88c6e6efa5137f4b0163dd", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ameresco.com&esheet=51798489&newsitemid=20180501005415&lan=en-US&anchor=www.ameresco.com&index=1&md5=b9ef1bedfe46a068d8bd121898d011ca", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501005415/en/"], "published": "2018-05-01T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:35:39.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
