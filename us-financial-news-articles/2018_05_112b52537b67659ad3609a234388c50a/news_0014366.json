The immediate reaction to the lifting of maturity curbs on overseas buyers was less than inspirational, with foreigners selling a net $240.92 million of bonds on May 2 - a day after the RBI’s announcement.\nIndian bonds have seen massive swings in the last month and the level of selling has picked up sharply.\nForeign investors sold a net $2.39 billion in bonds in April, the biggest monthly selloff since December 2016.\nLate on Friday the RBI unexpectedly announced it would buy government bonds via open market operations, a signal intended to moderate yields.\nIndia needs robust dollar inflows to help bridge its widening current account deficit and support the steep fall in the currency, but the RBI’s new rules could make the economy more vulnerable to volatile dollar flows and scare off long-term ‘patient’ investors.\nThe new rules for foreign investors are not yet in force. The start date will be announced by the stock market authority that regulates foreign investors.\nThe rupee has fallen by 4.8 percent so far this year, weakening as much as to 67.0850 to the dollar on Monday, its lowest level since February 2017.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield has risen by as much as 50 basis points since start of January on top of a 82 basis point rise from July to December last year, severely undermining foreign investors’ bond holdings as prices fell accordingly.\n“We have seen some asset managers choose not to hedge open positions and so there are risks to investment in the rupee debt market,” said Li Huang, associate director, fund and asset manager rating group at Fitch Ratings in Shanghai.\nWith India importing 80 percent of its oil requirements, crude prices will be a key factor determining the country’s current account, rupee and inflation risks.\n“Despite real-money (foreign) investors not selling off India in a big way, bonds and the rupee have lost heavily,” said a trader acting for foreign investors.\n“I shudder to imagine what might happen once the hot money traders start moving in and out of India in extremely short time-spans. There is no sense for the RBI to take such short-term measures and attract opportunistic flows.” Reporting by Suvashree Choudhury and Krishna Merchant.
