Just under half of Ealing’s residents said they were Christian in a 2011 census.\n“It changed when the Irish came ... then we had the Indians and the West Indians with Wind Rush, it’s changed completely,” said Pemberton.\n“It’ll never be any other way, it (London) is almost like a magnet.”\n“Making Suburban Faith” aims to celebrate those changes through everything from architecture to food.\nFilmmaker Laura Cuch honed in on Ealing as a multicultural microcosm for her documentary about the links between food and spirituality, which can bring diverse faith communities together.\nHer film profiles a middle-aged Muslim man, an elderly Catholic woman and a young Jewish student in Ealing.\nIn it, neighbors learn about each other’s faiths through food - from a fruity Christmas pudding to a spicy Moroccan tagine and a chicken soup, known as Jewish penicillin for its cold-curing properties.\n“Food can bridge a gap, it’s always used to bring people together,” said Cuch at a recent screening of the film.\n“Ealing has its own identity as a very multicultural area with a very particular migration history that means that there are people from all over the world living together in this suburban area.”\nAs part of the project, international architect Ada Yvars Bravo worked with local schoolchildren in Ealing to help design mock shared religious spaces.\nThe project led to a wealth of ideas and designs including 3D modeling, stacked spaces and real-life visits to faith centers.\n“What we try to do is to say you don’t need to differentiate, that’s why we love what they’re doing,” said Bravo of Mangera Yvars Architects (MYAA), which has designed mosques in Qatar and Orthodox churches in Georgia.\n“It’s incredible because they are teaching people that everyone is the same and we can live all together.”\nReporting by Adela Suliman, Editing by Claire Cozens.
