It will take us 45-60 days more, but wells have already been connected,” Repsold told journalists.\nThe first of this year’s new platforms started service earlier this month. The remaining five platforms following Tartaruga will be installed mostly in December after they arrive from China, the executive added.\nPetrobras also plans to inaugurate an offshore platform off the coast of Nigeria this year.\nThe company increasingly is focusing on exploration and production to increase its oil output capacity by up to 1 million bpd next year, while divesting downstream assets.\nPetrobras is in talks with China’s state-run CNPC for sharing the Comperj refinery in Rio de Janeiro, whose construction is about 75 percent finished.\nIf the discussions are successful, the Chinese company would sign an offtake agreement and receive a portion of the facility’s products in payment, according to the executive.\n“We want to have a partner, we need it. We have spent a lot of money (in downstream) and now expect to focus on exploration and production. It would be nice to bring a partner to finance Comperj’s completion and make improvements to connect the production fields to the refinery,” Repsold said.
