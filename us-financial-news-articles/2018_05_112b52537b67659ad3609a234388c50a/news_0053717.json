The latest wave of hacking shows how the Kim Jong Un regime extended a longstanding pattern of aggressive behavior toward South Korea despite publicly pledging warmer relations as it prepared for a summit with President Trump. The U.S. called off the summit Thursday in response to new threats from Pyongyang. The decision shifts the U.S. approach to North Korea away from a rapprochement and back to a campaign of military and economic pressure . North Korea said it is still willing to meet with Mr. Trump. The planned meeting hit the rocks because neither side fully understood what the other was saying in the run-up, The Journal’s Gerald F. Seib writes .\nThe New Rules As Europe’s new privacy law takes effect, the focus has been on expected battles with technology giants such as Facebook and Alphabet’s Google. But the law’s impact is far broader . The new General Data Protection Regulation is forcing hundreds of thousands of companies—multinationals such as Mastercard and insurer Allianz, but also small manufacturers and even restaurants—to change how they gather and handle information about Europeans, even if the companies have no physical footprint in Europe. Companies are unlikely to be blindsided by harsh penalties . But sanctions for violations are likely to come soon, the European Union’s top privacy regulator warned. Our Europe tech correspondent Sam Schechner has answers to some common questions about the deadline.\nUber Fail The Uber self-driving car involved in a fatal crash in Arizona wasn’t set to stop in an emergency or alert the driver, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its preliminary report Thursday. The Uber vehicle identified an object on the road six seconds before impact and didn’t determine the need for emergency braking until nearly five seconds later. The March crash marked the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving car and ignited a broader discussion about whether the driverless technology that auto and tech companies are racing to develop is ready for the real world. It also illustrates the challenges Uber has faced in developing software that can detect hazards on the road and respond appropriately, as the ride-hailing company chases rivals such as Alphabet’s Waymo and GM’s Cruise Automation.\nLow-Cost Pond-Hopping For great-value flights to Europe’s top cities this summer, look to some new players on the trans-Atlantic scene. Conventional wisdom maintains that if you haven’t booked your summer vacation by May 1, you’ll either need to pay a fortune for flights or invest in an inflatable pool for the backyard. But thrifty procrastinators, take heart: This is no normal year. With newcomers duking it out over the Atlantic, air deals to some of Europe’s most popular destinations are still lurking, just not in the usual places. Air Italy and Primera Air are teasing bargain fares from the U.S. to Milan and London, respectively, and good-value budget airlines are expanding their reach.\nToday’s Video ‘Gerrymander’ or ‘Garymander’?

Having them built in other countries and importing them with high tariffs makes me think we need to build them here again. I recognize that globalism is multifaceted and complicated, but it should not get in the way of a nation being self sufficient.” Patricia Heng of Quote: : “When you look at the tremendous cost of lost jobs, factory closings [and] intellectual property stolen, [the] new tariffs on imported vehicles are ‘a drop in the bucket.’” And Daniel Brockman of California said: “The national-security fig leaf is utter nonsense. The [U.S.] retains [the] capability to build cars with or without tariffs. The tariffs will result in higher prices of cars—by approximately the amount of the tariff—for consumers….The tariffs will diminish competition among auto manufacturers in the U.S….The principal beneficiaries will be the owners of auto companies.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories.
