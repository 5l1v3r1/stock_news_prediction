CNBC.com Alexander Zemlianichenko | Reuters Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as they attend the Navy Day parade in St. Petersburg, Russia, July 30, 2017. Picture taken July 30, 2017.\nRussia quietly conducted the world's longest surface-to-air missile test, according to sources with direct knowledge of U.S. intelligence concerning the weapons program.\nThe S-500 surface-to-air missile system successfully struck a target 299 miles away, which the U.S. assessed is 50 miles further than any known test, said the sources, who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity.\nRussia claims that the ground-based missile system is capable of intercepting hypersonic missiles, drones, aircraft as well as stealth warplanes like the F-22 and the F-35. The S-500 system would expand the Kremlin's capabilities to engage multiple targets with precision strikes.\nRussia also claims the system has a range capable of destroying objects flying at near-space ranges or 62 miles above the Earth's surface.\nThe developments about the new missile system emerge as investigators claim that a Russian-owned surface-to-air missile blew up Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014 over eastern Ukraine. Russia has denied involvement in the incident. On Thursday, Moscow's defense ministry said none of the country's air-defense missile systems crossed the Russia-Ukraine border.\nA medium-range Buk surface-to-air missile system was reportedly used to down the plane, resulting in the deaths of nearly 300 people. The Buk system is from a different family of missile systems as the new S-500 and its predecessor, the S-300V4, which has been operational since the late 1970s.

Once launched, it uses aerodynamic forces to sail on top of the atmosphere.\nSources, who spoke to CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said Russia successfully tested the weapon twice in 2016 . The third known test of the device was carried out in October 2017 and resulted in a failure when the platform crashed seconds before striking its target.\nMeanwhile, Russia is expected to test their hypersonic glide vehicle again this summer. show chapters", "external_links": ["https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/24/europe/mh17-plane-netherlands-russia-intl/index.html", "http://tass.com/defense/1006070"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:51:21.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
