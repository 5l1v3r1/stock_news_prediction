The Model 3 has been plagued both by repeatedly missed production targets, and reports of a high volume of flawed parts and extensive rework on vehicles .\n\"There's no question we could have made the Model 3 much easier to produce than we have,\" Musk said. \"I think Model Y is going to be a manufacturing revolution.\"\nTesla is so far planning to begin production on the Model Y in 2020, Musk said on the call, later than the 2019 production date Reuters had previously reported .\nTesla plans to choose a facility for the Model Y no later than the fourth quarter, but will not be making it at Tesla's Fremont, California, production plant, which is already \"jammed to the gills,\" Musk said on the call.\nThe second-generation Roadster was unveiled along with the Tesla Semi in November of last year. Among other things, the Roadster is supposed to go from 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds. Tesla is currently taking $50,000 reservations for the Roadster, which will have a $200,000 base price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:43:28.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
