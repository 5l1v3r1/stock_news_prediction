Crime bosses run the show in this faction-ridden locale, where foot soldiers commit murders so that “someone else could make money.”\nInto this grim environment enters Martin Sivok, a 31-year-old Czech hood-for-hire with a shaved head and a case of culture shock. In his native land—which he’s had to flee under police pressure—Sivok was a trusted professional, well-paid for doing “some very dirty jobs.” But in Scotland, the fugitive expat perceives, “he was just a short man with a mean look and a funny accent.”\nHe quickly teams up with a young Glasgow-born Pakistani, Usman Kassar. Together, the two rob a bookmaker’s business used to store gang money, which puts them in the bad graces of the criminals they’ve stolen from. Lying low would seem to be their wisest strategy. But Kassar is impatient for more ill-gotten gains, and Sivok is anxious to pay his fair share in the relationship he’s begun with his noncriminal landlady—a bookstore owner, of all things. Soon, against his better judgment, Sivok finds himself caught in a downward spiral: “More money, more risk, more violence.”\nPhoto: Getty Images Mr. Mackay is a shrewd observer of his chosen turf, and an unsparing yet empathetic chronicler of its denizens. His bracing narrative, told mostly though flashbacks, never loosens its grip. Its pace is relentless, and there are just enough surprises in store—even for those who (think they) know the ending.\nAlan Parks’s grisly debut novel, “Bloody January” (World Noir, 331 pages, $17) , is also set in Glasgow—in the first month of 1973. Though snow is blanketing the streets, it can’t hide the corruption in a city where cops and criminals are often forced to keep each other’s secrets. “We use them, they use us,” 30-year-old Det. Harry McCoy explains to his new partner, Wattie, a rookie cop from outside the city. “Easier for everyone.”\nBut for McCoy, a “polis” with his own strict if unpredictable code of justice, there’s no ignoring the grotesque crimes occurring this month. For starters, a 19-year-old waitress and sex worker is shot dead in broad daylight, after which her assailant kills himself. The “who” and “how” of these deaths are known. But what about the “why”?\nAs additional murders take place in the city, McCoy and Wattie go searching for answers. McCoy is certain that the victims’ deaths can be traced to the door of the richest family in Glasgow—whose ice-cold patriarch and his wastrel son are rumored to host orgies laced with drugs and sadism. But the detectives are hindered by superiors reluctant to anger such influential figures. Complicating matters further is the fact that McCoy has his own ties to a local criminal network—to which he’s been beholden since childhood.\nDefying their bosses, McCoy and Wattie traverse Glasgow high and low, going from prisons to homeless encampments, old-money mansions to pop-music emporiums. Their persistence yields a break in the form of a trove of incriminating photographs, with which the sleuths may be able to confront the privileged villains they’ve been warned to leave alone. More than likely McCoy will pay an eventual price for his extra-judicial doings—but the resourceful avenger figures: “He’d worry about the rest later.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T18:48:04.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
