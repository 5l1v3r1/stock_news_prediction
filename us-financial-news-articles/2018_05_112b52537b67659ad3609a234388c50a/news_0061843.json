So far, only 147 city licenses have been issued to sell adult-use, recreational cannabis in Los Angeles. Many illegal marijuana shops operate in plain sight — out of storefronts in busy neighborhoods.\nSince the beginning of the year, officers targeting illegal marijuana businesses have served 54 search warrants and arrested 160 people, which includes the 142 people charged by the city attorney, said Lt. Stacy Spell of the LAPD's Gang and Narcotics Division.\nInvestigators have been prioritizing going after shops that are causing crime and generating complaints from the community, he said.\n\"We've tried to be very responsible with taxpayer money, understanding that we have limited resources and are not able to necessarily address all of the locations,\" Spell said.\nIn addition to the misdemeanor criminal charges, the city attorney's office will also send cease-and-desist letters to other illegal cannabis businesses that prosecutors have identified, Feuer said. He declined to say how many letters would be sent.\nEarlier this year, state regulators sent similar letters to about 1,000 marijuana businesses they said were operating illegally statewide.\nMike Balsamo is a member of AP's marijuana beat team.
