(TSX:DIV) (TSX:DIV.DB) (the “Corporation” or “DIV”) and Mr. Lube Canada Limited Partnership (“Mr. Lube”) announced today that effective May 1, 2018, the royalty rate paid by Mr. Lube to the Corporation on non-tire sales at flagship locations (the “Mr. Lube Royalty Rate”) has been increased by 0.5% from 6.95% to 7.45%. In addition, the Mr. Lube royalty pool (the “Mr. Lube Royalty Pool”) has been adjusted to include the royalties from two new Mr. Lube locations and to remove one Mr. Lube location that has been permanently closed. With the adjustment for these two openings and one closure, the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool now includes 118 flagship locations.\nSean Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer of DIV, stated, “The increase in the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate and the net addition to the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool is a testament to Mr. Lube’s market leading position, proven business model, strong store-level execution by its franchisees, experienced management team and strong performance since DIV purchased the royalty in August 2015. We look forward to Mr. Lube continuing to open new stores and expanding their market share as they execute on their growth strategy. Net of incremental interest expense on the new debt, these transactions are expected to add approximately $0.8 million to DIV’s distributable cash per year or approximately $0.01 per DIV share (which represents a pro forma increase of approximately 5%), improving DIV’s payout ratio. With approximately $83 million of cash currently on hand, DIV is well-positioned to pursue accretive royalty transactions.”\nStuart Suls, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mr. Lube, stated, “We are excited to be adding to the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool as well as increasing the royalty rate paid to DIV by 0.5%. These transactions are in alignment with DIV’s royalty model of partnering with market leading franchisors and acquiring incremental royalties as their businesses continue to expand. Mr. Lube is excited to continue opening new stores, growing the brand across Canada, expanding our tire related services offering and improving the store level economics of our franchisees. We also look forward to the continued mutually beneficial relationship with DIV.”\nMr. Lube Royalty Rate Increase\nMr. Lube has the option, subject to meeting certain performance criteria, to increase the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate in four, 0.5% increments. The increase of the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate from 6.95% to 7.45% on non-tire sales on May 1, 2018 represents the first such royalty rate increase. The royalty rate on tire sales remains unchanged at 2.50%.\nThe Mr. Lube Royalty Rate increase is expected to generate additional royalty revenue for the Corporation of approximately $1.0 million per annum, based on the 2017 non-tire system sales of the locations in the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool of $197.2 million. The total consideration paid to Mr. Lube for the increase of the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate was $9.2 million. DIV elected to pay for the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate increase in cash, which was partially financed by an increase in the term loan facility of ML Royalties Limited Partnership (“ML LP”) as described below.\nFor further details with respect to the manner in which the Mr. Lube royalty rate increase occurs and the agreements underlying the procedures therefor, see DIV’s Annual Information Form dated March 28, 2018, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nAddition to the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool\nSubject to certain performance criteria being met, the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool is adjusted annually on May 1 (the “Adjustment Date”) to include new Mr. Lube locations that have been open since July 1 of the previous reporting period and to remove Mr. Lube locations that have been permanently closed during the previous year.\nThe initial consideration payable to Mr. Lube for the estimated net additional royalty revenue is $0.9 million, representing 80% of the total estimated consideration of $1.2 million. DIV elected to pay the initial consideration to Mr. Lube in cash, which was partially financed by an increase in the term loan facility of ML LP as described below.\nThe remaining consideration payable for the net additional royalty revenue will be paid to Mr. Lube on May 1, 2019, the next Adjustment Date, and will be adjusted to reflect the actual system sales of the two new locations added to the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool for the year ended December 31, 2018, as determined through an audit.\nAfter taking into account the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate increase from 6.95% to 7.45%, the net addition to the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool is expected to generate additional royalty revenue for the Corporation of approximately $0.15 million per annum, based on the net estimated non-tire system sales of $2.0 million.\nFor further details with respect to the manner in which annual adjustments of the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool occur and the agreements underlying the procedures therefor, see DIV’s Annual Information Form dated March 28, 2018, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nAmendment of ML Royalties LP Credit Facility\nOn May 1, 2018, ML LP, the wholly owned subsidiary of DIV that owns the ML Rights, amended its credit agreement with a Canadian chartered bank to increase its non-amortizing term loan facility from $34.6 million to $41.6 million. The increase in the term loan facility was used to partially finance the consideration paid to Mr. Lube for the increase in the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate and the net addition to the Mr. Lube Royalty Pool. The incremental debt of $7.0 million bears interest at the banker’s acceptance rate plus 1.95% (estimated to be 3.60% using the current rates) and matures on July 31, 2022. ML LP may elect to enter into an interest rate swap arrangement for a portion or all of the incremental debt.\nMay 2018 Cash Dividend\nDIV is pleased to announce that its board of directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.01854 per common share for the period of May 1, 2018 to May 31, 2018, which is equal to $0.2225 per common share on an annualized basis. The dividend will be paid on May 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2018.\nAbout Diversified Royalty Corp.\nDIV is a multi-royalty corporation, engaged in the business of acquiring top-line royalties from well-managed multi-location businesses and franchisors in North America.

By considering these measures in combination with the most closely comparable IFRS measure, management believes that investors are provided with additional and more useful information about the Company than investors would have if they simply considered IFRS measures alone. The non-IFRS financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.

For further details, as to how DIV calculates “Distributable Cash” and “payout ratio” see the “Description of Non-IFRS and Additional IFRS Measures” in the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, a copy of which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . In this news release, such figures have been adjusted to give effect to the increase to the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate, the net addition to the Mr. Lube Royalty Rate and interest expense on the incremental debt obtained in connection with such transactions.\nTHE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE HAS NOT REVIEWED AND DOES NOT ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR THE ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information relating to the Corporation and other public filings, is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nContact:\nSean Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer\nDiversified Royalty Corp.\n(604) 235-3146\nGreg Gutmanis, Chief Financial Officer and VP Acquisitions\nDiversified Royalty Corp.\n(604) 235-3146\nSource: Diversified Royalty Corp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T17:38:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
