Analysts were expecting $1.51 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company cut its fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to $4.85-$4.95 per share from $5.25-$5.50 per share, reflecting a negative tax rate and Cordis's performance.\nNet earnings attributable to the company fell 33 percent to $255 million, or $0.81 per share, in the quarter.\nRevenue rose 5.7 percent to $33.63 billion.
