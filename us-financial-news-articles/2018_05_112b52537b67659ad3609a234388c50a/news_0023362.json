(“Carrols” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:TAST) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018 and updated its full year 2018 outlook.\nHighlights for first quarter of 2018 versus first quarter of 2017 include:\nRestaurant sales increased 13.2% to $271.6 million from $239.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 including contributions from 64 restaurants acquired in 2017; Comparable restaurant sales increased a solid 6.2% compared to a 0.6% decrease in the prior year quarter; Adjusted EBITDA (1) increased 36.3% to $18.9 million from $13.9 million in the prior year quarter; Net loss was $3.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter; and Adjusted net loss (1) was $2.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $4.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the definitions and reconciliation of these measures to net income (loss) or to income (loss) from operations in the tables at the end of this release.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2018, Carrols owned and operated 807 BURGER KING® restaurants.\nDaniel T. Accordino, the Company's Chief Executive Officer said, “Our strong start to 2018 included double-digit top line growth, a robust 6.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales, and solid improvements in restaurant-level EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as we successfully leveraged these sales increases against most expenses. We are pleased that BURGER KING’s impactful marketing strategy, effective balance of premium, value and limited time menu items, and its pipeline of innovation continues to resonate with consumers in a highly competitive QSR environment as evidenced by our sales performance. Notable promotions during the first quarter included the 2 for $6 WHOPPER® or Crispy Chicken Sandwich promotion, the extension of the KING™ Sandwich line, and the launch of the new Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich. These products positively contributed to both average check and transaction growth.”\nAccordino added, “Given our first quarter performance and continued sales momentum early in the second quarter, we are increasingly confident in our ability to meet our sales and Adjusted EBITDA outlook as updated for our first quarter results. Although labor costs continue to rise as expected, we now forecast that commodity inflation should be somewhat lower than our earlier guidance. With respect to acquisitions, we closed a small transaction in the first quarter and have two small transactions expected to close in the next few weeks. We also continue to focus on our acquisition pipeline and believe that as the year progresses that we will close additional transactions.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRestaurant sales increased 13.2% to $271.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $239.9 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nComparable restaurant sales increased 6.2%, including an average check increase of 5.9% and customer traffic increase of 0.3% from the prior year period.\nRestaurant-level EBITDA was $33.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 and increased 19.8% from $27.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Restaurant-Level EBITDA margin was 12.3% of restaurant sales and increased 67 basis points from the prior year period. Nearly all operating costs were favorably leveraged due to the strong sales performance in the quarter. Cost of sales, however, increased slightly as a percentage of restaurant sales as higher ground beef costs and increased promotional activity compared to the prior year quarter were offset by 3.3% of effective pricing and improved operating performance.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $16.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15.6 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of restaurant sales, general and administrative expenses decreased 55 basis points to 5.9% compared to the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 36.3% to $18.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 118 basis points to 7.0% of restaurant sales.\nIncome from operations was $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a loss from operations of $1.4 million in the prior year period.\nInterest expense increased to $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $4.8 million in the same period last year due to the Company’s $75 million add-on offering and issuance of senior secured second lien notes completed in the second quarter of 2017. Cash balances totaled $34.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018.\nNet loss was $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the prior year period.\nNet loss in the first quarter of 2018 included $0.3 million of impairment and other lease charges and $0.1 million of acquisition expenses. For the same period last year, net loss included $0.5 million of impairment and other lease charges and $0.7 million of acquisition expenses.\nAdjusted net loss in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $4.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the prior year period.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company is updating its guidance for 2018. As a reminder, while the Company may acquire additional BURGER KING® restaurants, this guidance does not include any impact from such potential acquisitions:\nTotal restaurant sales are expected to be $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion (previously $1.14 billion to $1.17 billion), including a comparable restaurant sales increase of 3% to 5%; Commodity costs are now expected to increase 1% to 2% (previously 2% to 3%) including a 2% to 3% increase in beef costs (previously 3% to 5%); General and administrative expenses are expected to be $58 million to $60 million, excluding stock compensation expense and acquisition-related costs; Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be $95 million to $102 million (previously $93 million to $100 million); An effective income tax rate of 0% to 5%. Capital expenditures before discretionary growth-related expenditures (i.e., new restaurant development and acquisitions) are expected to be $50 million to $60 million (previously $45 million to $50 million). In addition, capital expenditures for the construction of 10 to 15 new units and remaining costs from 2017 construction late in the year are expected to be $15 million to $25 million; Proceeds from sale/leasebacks are expected to be $10 million to $15 million; and The Company expects to close 20 to 25 existing restaurants, three of which were closed during the first quarter.\nThe Company has not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measure because it does not provide guidance for net income or for the various reconciling items. The Company is unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items since certain items that impact net income are outside of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted.\nConference Call Today\nDaniel T. Accordino, Chief Executive Officer, and Paul R.

Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited) Three Months Ended (a) April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: (a) Net loss $ (3,102 ) $ (5,596 ) Benefit for income taxes (138 ) (611 ) Interest expense 5,926 4,801 Gain on bargain purchase (22 ) — Depreciation and amortization 14,250 13,151 EBITDA 16,914 11,745 Impairment and other lease charges 309 531 Acquisition costs (b) 105 718 Stock-based compensation expense 1,585 883 Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,913 $ 13,877 Reconciliation of Restaurant-Level EBITDA: (a) Income (loss) from operations $ 2,664 $ (1,406 ) Add: General and administrative expenses 16,136 15,576 Depreciation and amortization 14,250 13,151 Impairment and other lease charges 309 531 Restaurant-Level EBITDA $ 33,359 $ 27,852 Reconciliation of Adjusted net loss: (a) Net loss $ (3,102 ) $ (5,596 ) Add: Impairment and other lease charges 309 531 Gain on bargain purchase (22 ) — Acquisition costs (b) 105 718 Income tax effect on above adjustments (c) (82 ) (475 ) Adjusted net loss $ (2,792 ) $ (4,822 ) Adjusted diluted net loss per share $ (0.08 ) $ (0.14 ) (a) Within our press release, we make reference to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net loss which are non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents net loss before benefit for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring income or expense. Restaurant-Level EBITDA represents income (loss) from operations as adjusted to exclude general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and other lease charges and other income. Adjusted net loss represents net loss as adjusted to exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs and other non-recurring income or expense. We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net loss because we believe that they provide a more meaningful comparison than EBITDA and net loss of the Company's core business operating results, as well as with those of other similar companies. Additionally, we present Restaurant-Level EBITDA because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other income, all of which are non-recurring at the restaurant level. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net loss, when viewed with the Company's results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations in the table above, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the Company's core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level EBITDA permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net loss are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income, income from operations or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies. The tables above provide reconciliations between net loss and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net loss and between income (loss) from operations and Restaurant-Level EBITDA. (b) Acquisition costs for the periods presented include legal and professional fees incurred in connection with restaurant acquisitions. (c) The income tax effect related to the adjustments for impairment and other lease charges and acquisition costs during the periods presented was calculated using an effective income tax rate of 21% for the three months ended April 1, 2018 and 38% for the three months ended April 2, 2017.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508005423/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nCarrols Restaurant Group, Inc.\n800-348-1074, ext. 3333\ninvestorrelations@carrols.com\nSource: Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carrols.com&esheet=51802490&newsitemid=20180508005423&lan=en-US&anchor=www.carrols.com&index=1&md5=526e2c03dc311808d4293ddfae362e45", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508005423/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.carrols.com&esheet=51802490&newsitemid=20180508005423&lan=en-US&anchor=www.carrols.com&index=2&md5=e01e8cde0461388833c7afe123ac5176"], "published": "2018-05-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T17:01:16.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
