(NYSE: BFS), an equity real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"), announced its operating results for the quarter (\"2018 Quarter\"). Total revenue for the 2018 Quarter decreased to $56.5 million from $58.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (\"2017 Quarter\"). Operating income, which is net income before the impact of change in fair value of derivatives, loss on early extinguishment of debt and gains on sales of property and casualty settlements, if any, decreased to $14.9 million for the 2018 Quarter from $17.4 million for the 2017 Quarter.\nNet income available to common stockholders decreased to $6.9 million ($0.31 per diluted share) for the 2018 Quarter compared to $10.6 million ($0.49 per diluted share) for the 2017 Quarter.\nSame property revenue decreased $1.9 million (3.3%) and same property operating income decreased $2.8 million (6.5%) for the 2018 Quarter compared to the 2017 Quarter. We define same property revenue as total revenue minus the sum of interest income and revenue of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable reporting periods. We define same property operating income as net income plus the sum of interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expense, loss on the early extinguishment of debt (if any), predevelopment expense and acquisition related costs, minus the sum of interest income, the change in the fair value of derivatives, gains on property dispositions (if any) and the results of properties which were not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods. Shopping Center same property operating income for the 2018 Quarter totaled $31.0 million, a $2.8 million decrease from the 2017 Quarter. The decrease in Shopping Center same property operating income was primarily due to (a) the impact of the terminations of Safeway at Broadlands and K-Mart at Kentlands ($3.3 million) and (b) higher property operating expenses net of recoveries ($0.2 million), partially offset by (c) higher base rent ($0.6 million). Mixed-Use same property operating income totaled $10.1 million, unchanged from the prior year.\nAs of March 31, 2018, 94.1% of the commercial portfolio was leased (not including the residential portfolio), compared to 95.6% at March 31, 2017. On a same property basis, 94.0% of the commercial portfolio was leased as of March 31, 2018, compared to 95.6% at March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the residential portfolio was 95.9% leased compared to 91.8% at March 31, 2017.\nFunds from operations (\"FFO\") available to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests (after deducting preferred stock dividends) was $20.6 million ($0.69 per diluted share) in the 2018 Quarter compared to $25.6 million ($0.87 per diluted share) in the 2017 Quarter. FFO for the 2018 Quarter decreased primarily due to (a) extinguishment of issuance costs upon redemption of preferred shares ($2.3 million), (b) the impact of the terminations of Safeway at Broadlands and K-Mart at Kentlands ($3.3 million), and (c) increased preferred stock dividends as a result of the 30-day overlap between sale of $75.0 million of Series D Preferred Stock and redemption of $75.0 million of Series C Preferred Stock ($0.3 million), partially offset by (d) higher base rent ($0.9 million). FFO, a widely accepted non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance for REITs, is defined as net income plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding gains and losses from property dispositions, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and extraordinary items.\nSaul Centers, Inc. is a self-managed, self-administered equity REIT headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, which currently operates and manages a real estate portfolio of 58 properties which includes (a) 49 community and neighborhood shopping centers and six mixed-use properties with approximately 9.2 million square feet of leasable area and (b) three land and development properties. Over 85% of the Saul Centers' property operating income is generated by properties in the metropolitan Washington, DC/Baltimore area.\nSaul Centers, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(Unaudited)\nAssets\nReal estate investments\nLand\n$\n450,256\n$\n450,256\nBuildings and equipment\n1,262,320\n1,261,830\nConstruction in progress\n108,735\n91,114\n1,821,311\n1,803,200\nAccumulated depreciation\n(498,002)\n(488,166)\n1,323,309\n1,315,034\nCash and cash equivalents\n8,979\n10,908\nAccounts receivable and accrued income, net\n50,821\n54,057\nDeferred leasing costs, net\n26,838\n27,255\nPrepaid expenses, net\n4,085\n5,248\nOther assets\n15,115\n9,950\nTotal assets\n$\n1,429,147\n$\n1,422,452\nLiabilities\nNotes payable\n$\n876,544\n$\n897,888\nRevolving credit facility payable\n12,930\n60,734\nTerm loan facility payable\n74,518\n—\nDividends and distributions payable\n18,158\n18,520\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities\n26,035\n23,123\nDeferred income\n27,605\n29,084\nTotal liabilities\n1,035,790\n1,029,349\nEquity\nPreferred stock\n180,000\n180,000\nCommon stock\n222\n221\nAdditional paid-in capital\n356,715\n352,590\nAccumulated deficit and other comprehensive loss\n(202,812)\n(198,406)\nTotal Saul Centers, Inc. stockholders' equity\n334,125\n334,405\nNoncontrolling interests\n59,232\n58,698\nTotal equity\n393,357\n393,103\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n1,429,147\n$\n1,422,452\nSaul Centers, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n(unaudited)\nBase rent\n$\n45,867\n$\n44,476\nExpense recoveries\n8,771\n8,594\nPercentage rent\n418\n382\nOther\n1,440\n5,014\nTotal revenue\n56,496\n58,466\nOperating expenses\nProperty operating expenses\n7,123\n6,652\nProvision for credit losses\n286\n343\nReal estate taxes\n6,845\n6,590\nInterest expense and amortization of deferred\ndebt costs\n11,526\n11,864\nDepreciation and amortization of deferred\nleasing costs\n11,349\n11,342\nGeneral and administrative\n4,420\n4,301\nTotal operating expenses\n41,549\n41,092\nOperating income\n14,947\n17,374\nChange in fair value of derivatives\n—\n—\nNet income\n14,947\n17,374\nIncome attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(2,359)\n(3,670)\nNet income attributable to Saul Centers, Inc.\n12,588\n13,704\nExtinguishment of issuance costs upon\nredemption of preferred shares\n(2,328)\n—\nPreferred stock dividends\n(3,403)\n(3,094)\nNet income available to common stockholders\n$\n6,857\n$\n10,610\nPer share net income available to common stockholders\nBasic and diluted\n$\n0.31\n$\n0.49\nWeighted Average Common Stock:\nCommon stock\n22,178\n21,745\nEffect of dilutive options\n40\n147\nDiluted weighted average common stock\n22,218\n21,892\nReconciliation of net income to FFO available to common stockholders and\nnoncontrolling interests (1)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited)\nNet income\n$\n14,947\n$\n17,374\nAdd:\nReal estate depreciation and amortization\n11,349\n11,342\nFFO\n26,296\n28,716\nSubtract:\nExtinguishment of issuance costs upon redemption of\npreferred shares\n(2,328)\n—\nPreferred stock dividends\n(3,403)\n(3,094)\nFFO available to common stockholders and\nnoncontrolling interests\n$\n20,565\n$\n25,622\nWeighted average shares:\nDiluted weighted average common stock\n22,218\n21,892\nConvertible limited partnership units\n7,567\n7,457\nAverage shares and units used to compute FFO per share\n29,785\n29,349\nFFO per share available to common stockholders and\nnoncontrolling interests\n$\n0.69\n$\n0.87\n(1)\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) developed FFO as a relative non-GAAP financial measure of performance of an equity REIT in order to\nrecognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income, computed in\naccordance with GAAP, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and excluding extraordinary items, impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or\nlosses from property dispositions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to\nfund cash needs, which is disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the applicable periods. There are no material legal or functional restrictions on\nthe use of FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income, its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of the Company's operating\nperformance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Management considers FFO a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it\nprimarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time (i.e. depreciation), which is contrary to what the Company believes\noccurs with its assets, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other\nREITs.\nReconciliation of revenue to same property revenue\n(in thousands)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nTotal revenue\n$\n56,496\n$\n58,466\nLess: Interest income\n(102)\n(13)\nLess: Acquisitions, dispositions and development\nproperties\n(1,210)\n(1,360)\nTotal same property revenue\n$\n55,184\n$\n57,093\nShopping Centers\n$\n39,762\n$\n42,077\nMixed-Use properties\n15,422\n15,016\nTotal same property revenue\n$\n55,184\n$\n57,093\nReconciliation of net income to same property operating income\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\n(unaudited)\nNet income\n$\n14,947\n$\n17,374\nAdd: Interest expense and amortization of deferred debt costs\n11,526\n11,864\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization of deferred leasing costs\n11,349\n11,342\nAdd: General and administrative\n4,420\n4,301\nLess: Interest income\n(102)\n(13)\nProperty operating income\n42,140\n44,868\nLess: Acquisitions, dispositions and development property\n(1,017)\n(903)\nTotal same property operating income\n$\n41,123\n$\n43,965\nShopping Centers\n$\n31,030\n$\n33,830\nMixed-Use properties\n10,093\n10,135\nTotal same property operating income\n$\n41,123\n$\n43,965\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saul-centers-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-earnings-300642501.html\nSOURCE Saul Centers, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saul-centers-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-earnings-300642501.html"], "published": "2018-05-04T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:40:56.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
