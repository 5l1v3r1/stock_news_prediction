The Chinese government considers those entities as part of China and objects to references that indicate they are independent.\n“China’s internal internet repression is world-famous,’’ Sanders said in the statement. “China’s efforts to export its censorship and political correctness to Americans and the rest of the free world will be resisted.’’\nThe sharply worded statement comes just hours after a high-level delegation from President Donald Trump’s administration returned from a visit to Beijing. The visit was part of a broader attempt to stave off a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.\nTrump said Friday on Twitter that he’d be receiving a briefing on Saturday about the visit.
