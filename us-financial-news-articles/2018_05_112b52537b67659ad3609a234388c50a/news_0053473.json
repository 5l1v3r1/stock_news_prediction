His appointment comes at a time investors and market players are looking for clearer regulations from the body, which had promised a range of moves including demutualisation and tough measures against market manipulators.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s coalition government has said it would investigate possible corruption in the previous administration but market players say such probes have been slow under the outgoing SEC chairman, Thilak Karunaratne who was appointed in 2015.\nKarunaratne and his predecessor resigned as chairman under the previous government after they came under pressure for tougher regulations amid complaints over “pump and dump” deals that dented the sentiment among local retail investors.\nThe Colombo stock index, which hit a record high of 7,863.74 in February 2011, has been on a downward trend after many investors complained about market manipulation and inaction by the SEC.
