I lost the rear end in turn three and I just spun. If you look at the footage, I had wanted to avoid contact with my teammate,” said the Frenchman.\n“Kevin (Magnussen) had a bit of a wobble, I lifted off the throttle, and then the car just went. I’m sorry for the others that were involved — there wasn’t much I could do once the car went.” (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ian Chadband)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T21:32:22.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
