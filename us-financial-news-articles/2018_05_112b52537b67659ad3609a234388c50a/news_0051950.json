Boeing, which sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers, jumped 3.4 percent, the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow and lifting the blue-chip index higher.\nAt 12:41 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 301.93 points, or 1.22 percent, at 25,017.02, the S&P 500 was up 20.44 points, or 0.75 percent, at 2,733.41 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 41.91 points, or 0.57 percent, at 7,396.25.\nGeneral Electric advanced 2.6 percent on an $11.1 billion deal to merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec, which jumped about 4.2 percent.\nStill, not all U.S. business leaders were happy with the trade war truce, with some cautioning that Washington would find it tough to rebuild momentum to address what they see as troubling Chinese policies.\nAK Steel and U.S. Steel both fell more than 4 percent following a delay in implementing tariffs on Chinese imports.\nMicron rose 3.9 percent, the most on the S&P, after the chipmaker lifted its current-quarter forecast.\nThe easing of the trade dispute also boosted the chipmakers, whose major clients include Chinese firms, with the Philadelphia chip index gaining 0.9 percent. The technology sector rose 0.8 percent.\nTesla jumped 2.9 percent on pricing of Model 3’s fully-loaded version and after brokerage Berenberg raised its already bullish price target.\nRegional lender MB Financial jumped 13.3 percent after agreeing to be bought for $4.87 billion by Fifth Third Bancorp, which fell 7.8 percent, the biggest percentage decliner on the S&P.\nOn the downside, Celgene fell 3.6 percent and hit a four-year low, dragging on the Nasdaq Biotech index 0.8 percent lower.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.67-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.64-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 32 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 149 new highs and 26 new lows.
