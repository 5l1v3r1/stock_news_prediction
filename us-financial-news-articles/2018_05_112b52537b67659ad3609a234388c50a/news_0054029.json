Some local people put the death toll at 12, with 28 wounded.\nThe latest figures from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan show 763 civilians were killed and 1,495 wounded in the first three months of the year, a similar level to the corresponding periods of the two previous years.\nThe violence has spread across Afghanistan in recent weeks with heavy fighting in provinces from Badakhshan, Baghlan and Faryab in the north to Farah in the west, where the Taliban briefly threatened to overrun the provincial capital, and Ghazni in the centre.\nOn Tuesday, officials said a district centre in Uruzgan province, on a key transit route from the drug producing regions of Helmand and Kandahar, was under serious threat.\nSecurity forces in Chora district in the middle of the province had abandoned the governor’s compound and police headquarters but fighting continued, said Hayatullah Fazli, a member of the provincial council.\nThe provincial governor’s office confirmed the fighting but denied reports that the district, which has seen heavy fighting in recent days, had fallen. The insurgents have put out videos of Afghan soldiers captured in the district urging others not to fight against the Taliban.
