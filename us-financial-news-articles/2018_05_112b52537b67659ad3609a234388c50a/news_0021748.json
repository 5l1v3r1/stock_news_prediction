For such a young horse he is just so big and talented,” he added of Justify, which has won all four of its starts.

I rank him up there with my top ones.”The win marks the sixth consecutive year where the favourite has won the race despite this year’s field being seen as the most competitive in recent years.\nMendelssohn, the Aidan O’Brien-trained colt looking to be the first European-based horse to win the Derby, collided into other horses shortly after the break and never recovered, finishing last.\nThe win came on the rainiest day in the race’s history with nearly three inches falling on the dirt track prior to the race, though the wet weather did little to dampen the enthusiasm of the 157,813 in attendance.
