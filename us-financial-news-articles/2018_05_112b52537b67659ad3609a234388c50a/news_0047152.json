Before 2012 some different firms were included in the top-12 group surveyed.\nBank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan benefited from lively U.S. stock trading, with equities revenues up 28 percent on the first quarter a year ago.\nThis trading boom, prompted by U.S. rate rises and global economic growth that compelled investors to adjust their portfolios, drove firms including Morgan Stanley to record first quarter profits.\nMeanwhile Europe’s former investment banking heavyweights are battling to find a sustainable and profitable business model, while meeting the costs of their missteps during and after the 2008 financial crisis.\nDeutsche Bank is abandoning its global ambitions to focus on retail banking and asset management after months of turmoil that led to its chief executive’s exit.\nMeanwhile Britain’s big banks, including Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, have only just completed lengthy restructurings, and are still battling litigation resulting from misconduct during the crisis.\nNot all trading businesses performed well in the first quarter, Coalition said, with fixed income products continuing a recent slump. Revenues from interest rate products linked to the G10 countries fell to their lowest in more than 5 years, with weak results in all major markets except Japanese yen, it added.
