But what we're worried about is the trade spat drags on … consumers stop spending so much, firms stop investing, confidence goes down, and we go to a less good growth path,\" he said.\nAnd if the world's two biggest economies enter a full-fledged trade war, it could cause a \"significant reduction\" in growth — although a global recession is unlikely, he told CNBC's Oriel Morrison at the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Manila.\nTrade talks are ongoing in Beijing between the two countries, which have announced plans to levy tariffs against each other.\nChina has canceled several shipments of U.S. soybeans in the past month.

That would start to go down the road to a better outcome.\"\n\"But right now if it's just a trade thing, that path doesn't look too good to us,\" he concluded.
