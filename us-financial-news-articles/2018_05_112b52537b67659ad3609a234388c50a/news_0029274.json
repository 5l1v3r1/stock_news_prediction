We are extremely pleased with the strong results achieved to date in 2018.\n\"Despite such successes, our intended migration to the Toronto Stock Exchange has been delayed pending the outcome of the strategic review process.\"\nBased on investment properties owned as of January 1, 2017 and throughout the comparative periods, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, Pure Multi-Family achieved same property revenue growth of 4.0% and same property net rental income (\"NOI\") growth of 9.7% compared to the same period in the prior year. Same property revenue growth was driven by increases in same property physical occupancy and same property average rent per occupied unit, coupled with a reduction in same property rental concessions. Same property NOI, over the same period, was positively impacted by the internalization of the property management function but partially offset by the inclusion of prior year property tax refunds recorded during the prior year period. Normalizing the impact resulting from the elimination of property management fees and the resolution of prior year property tax appeals, adjusted same property NOI for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased by 4.7% compared to the same period in the prior year.\nFor the three months ended March 31,\n(US$000's, except per unit amounts)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nWeighted Average Units Outstanding - Basic\n76,730,911\n56,068,506\nWeighted Average Units Outstanding - Diluted\n80,760,999\n60,137,533\nRental Revenue – Same Property (1)\n20,126\n19,361\n4.0%\nRental Revenue – Non-Same Property\n6,987\n1,476\n373.4%\nRental Revenue – Total\n27,113\n20,837\n30.1%\nNet Rental Income – Same Property (1)\n11,272\n10,277\n9.7%\nNet Rental Income – Non-Same Property\n3,864\n822\n370.1%\nNet Rental Income – Total\n15,136\n11,099\n36.4%\nFFO\n7,431\n5,428\n36.9%\nFFO Per Unit – Basic\n0.09\n0.09\n1.3%\nFFO Per Unit – Diluted\n0.09\n0.09\n1.3%\nFFO Payout Ratio\n100.2%\n101.4%\n(120bps)\nAFFO\n6,989\n5,087\n37.4%\nAFFO Per Unit – Basic\n0.09\n0.09\n1.6%\nAFFO Per Unit – Diluted\n0.09\n0.09\n1.6%\nAFFO Payout Ratio\n106.5%\n108.2%\n(170bps)\nAverage Rent Per Occupied Unit – Same Property (1)\n1,259\n1,246\n1.0%\nAverage Physical Occupancy – Same Property (1)\n94.7%\n93.2%\n150bps\n(1) Same Property – represents properties owned as at January 1, 2017 and throughout the comparative periods.\nPure Multi-Family incurred general and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses of $1,634,330 during the three months ended March 31, 2018, representing G&A expenses as a percentage of revenues of 6.0%, compared to $799,614 and 3.8%, respectively, during the same period in the prior year. The increase in G&A expenses during the current period compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the additional corporate level expenditures resulting from the internalized property management function. In the prior year period, these costs were presented within NOI as property management fees.\nIncluded in G&A expenses during the three months March 31, 2018 were non-recurring expenditures resulting from the strategic review process, which was initiated in response to an unsolicited offer to acquire all of the outstanding units of Pure Multi-Family, of approximately $170,000. Removing these non-recurring expenditures results in an adjusted G&A expense as a percentage of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of 5.4%.\nQ1-2018 Conference Call\nStephen Evans, CEO, Samantha Adams, SVP, and Scott Shillington, CFO, of Pure Multi-Family, will host the conference call at 10:00 am (PST), 1:00 pm (EST), on Thursday, May 10, 2018, to review the financial results and corporate developments for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nTo participate on the conference call, please dial one of the following numbers approximately 10 minutes prior to the commencement of the call, and ask to join the Pure Multi-Family REIT LP­ Conference Call.\nDial in numbers\n• Toll free dial in number (from Canada and USA):\n1-888-390-0546\n• International or Local Toronto:\n1-416-764-8688\nConference Call Replay\nIf you cannot participate on May 10, 2018, a replay of the conference call will be available by dialing one of the following replay numbers.

These measures are commonly used by entities in the real estate industry as useful metrics for measuring performance. However, they do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other publicly traded entities because the method of calculation may differ. These measures should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"intend\", \"should\", and similar expressions. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this news release include: (a) despite such successes, our intended migration to the Toronto Stock Exchange has been delayed pending the outcome of the strategic review process.\nAlthough Pure Multi-Family believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Pure Multi-Family can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, competitive factors in the industries in which Pure Multi-Family operates, prevailing economic conditions, the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or satisfy the conditions to closing any proposed acquisitions, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Pure Multi-Family.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Pure Multi-Family's expectations as of the date hereof, and are subject to change after such date.
