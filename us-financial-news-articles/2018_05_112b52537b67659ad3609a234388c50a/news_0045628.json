The optimistic mood also stemmed in part from strong results of a 30-year JGBs auction held last Tuesday.\nThe 20-year JGB yield fell 0.5 basis point to 0.535 percent, while the 30-year JGB yield fell 0.5 basis point to 0.755 percent.\nThe 10-year JGB yield was flat at 0.055 percent while 10-year JGB futures ended up 0.01 point at 150.71, with a trading volume of 21,768 lots.
