The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to higher group-wide gross gaming revenues in all gaming segments, partially offset by higher commissions reported as a reduction in revenue upon the Company’s adoption of a new revenue recognition standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “New Revenue Standard”). The Company adopted the New Revenue Standard using the modified retrospective method from January 1, 2018. Results for the period beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the New Revenue Standard, while prior year amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous basis. Under the previous basis, before the adoption of the New Revenue Standard, net revenue for the first quarter of 2018 would have been US$1,412.9 million, which would have represented an increase of approximately 11% from the US$1,277.2 million for the comparable period in 2017.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 was US$221.1 million, compared with operating income of US$158.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 40%.\nAdjusted property EBITDA (1) was US$401.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to Adjusted property EBITDA of US$353.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 14%. The year-on-year improvement in Adjusted property EBITDA was mainly attributable to the higher contribution from Studio City and Altira Macau driven by increased gross gaming revenues in all gaming segments.\nNet income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited for the first quarter of 2018 was US$156.6 million, or US$0.32 per ADS, compared with US$113.4 million, or US$0.23 per ADS, in the first quarter of 2017. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests during the first quarter of 2018 of US$6.7 million was related to Studio City and City of Dreams Manila.\nMr. Lawrence Ho, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented “Macau has had a strong start to the year with year-to-date gaming revenue growth at approximately 22% compared to the same period in 2017. We continue to be optimistic on the outlook of the Macau market as the city’s gaming and entertainment markets continue to benefit from the improving demand environment, the anticipated completion of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the ongoing build-out of Cotai.\n“Despite multiple new resorts opening, Melco remains the leader in Macau’s premium mass market with our dedication to quality recognized by the 2018 Michelin Guide Hong Kong Macau and Forbes Travel Guide, which awarded Melco with 7 Stars and 83 Stars, respectively, making us the integrated resort operator with the most Michelin-starred restaurants and Forbes Star awards in Asia. With the eagerly awaited opening of Morpheus, we expect to further solidify our leadership position in this important market segment as we will deliver a genuine landmark for all of Macau.\n“At Studio City, we are embarking on a series of property upgrades to refine the entertainment offerings and improve accessibility into the resort, which we believe will facilitate the continuing ramp up that the property has experienced over the past several quarters. As previously announced, the Macau government has recently granted an extension of the development period under the Studio City land concession contract to July 2021, enabling us to continue to develop our construction plan for the phase 2 expansion of Studio City, which we believe will augment the existing room inventory and entertainment offerings, as well as contribute to the continued growth and development of this property.\n“In the Philippines, City of Dreams Manila delivered another strong quarter, despite new supply coming on stream within Entertainment City. The 44% year-over-year increase in mass table gross gaming revenue in the first quarter was particularly encouraging and highlights our commitment to drive high quality earnings growth.\n“Aimed at optimizing our operating excellence, we announced the redeployment of our senior operating management in January. I am pleased to report that we have started seeing early signs of improvement, with City of Dreams’ mass hold rate trending up to over 32% and its mass table gross gaming revenue increasing over 8% sequentially in the first quarter of 2018.\n“As also previously announced, the Board has recently approved a new US$500 million share repurchase program, which is consistent with our strategy of, where appropriate, returning excess capital to shareholders.\n“Lastly, Japan continues to be a core focus for us. With the anticipated passage of the Integrated Resorts (IR) implementation bill later this year, the country will take a major step forward toward the development of the next generation of integrated resorts that will operate in this incredibly exciting, yet currently underpenetrated, tourism destination. With our focus on the premium end of the market, high quality assets, dedication to world-class entertainment offerings, market-leading social safeguards and compliance culture, and our commitment to being an ideal partner to local governments and communities alike, we believe Melco is in a strong position to help Japan realize the vision for integrated resort development with unique Japanese touches.”\nCity of Dreams First Quarter Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net revenue at City of Dreams was US$640.5 million compared to US$693.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.

These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (the “Company”) may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the Company’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) growth of the gaming market and visitations in Macau and the Philippines, (ii) capital and credit market volatility, (iii) local and global economic conditions, (iv) our anticipated growth strategies, (v) gaming authority and other governmental approvals and regulations, and (vi) our future business development, results of operations and financial condition. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may”, “will”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “target”, “aim”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “potential”, “continue”, “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions.

All information provided in this press release is as of the date of this press release, and the Company undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(1) \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, development costs, property charges and other, share-based compensation, payments to the Philippine parties under the cooperative arrangement (the “Philippine Parties”), land rent to Belle Corporation and other non-operating income and expenses. \"Adjusted property EBITDA\" is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, pre-opening costs, development costs, property charges and other, share-based compensation, payments to the Philippine Parties, land rent to Belle Corporation, Corporate and Other expenses and other non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA are presented exclusively as supplemental disclosures because management believes they are widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. Management uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA as measures of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors. The Company also presents adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA because they are used by some investors as ways to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures, and meet working capital requirements. Gaming companies have historically reported adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA as supplements to financial measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income as indicators of the Company's performance, as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to any other measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Unlike net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA do not include depreciation and amortization or interest expense and, therefore, do not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. The Company compensates for these limitations by using adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA as only two of several comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.\nSuch U.S. GAAP measurements include operating income, net income, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other recurring and nonrecurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA or adjusted property EBITDA. Also, the Company's calculation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted property EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are provided herein immediately following the financial statements included in this press release.\n(2) “Adjusted net income” is net income before pre-opening costs, development costs, property charges and other, net of noncontrolling interests and taxes calculated using specific tax treatments applicable to the adjustments based on their respective jurisdictions. Adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited per share (“EPS”) are presented as supplemental disclosures because management believes they are widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. These measures are used by management and/or evaluated by some investors, in addition to income and EPS computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an additional basis for assessing period-to-period results of our business. Adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited and adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited per share may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. Reconciliations of adjusted net income attributable to Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP are provided herein immediately following the financial statements included in this press release.\nAbout Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited\nThe Company, with its American depositary shares listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ: MLCO), is a developer, owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment casino resort facilities in Asia.
