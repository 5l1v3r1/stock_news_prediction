Revenue from mass market players gained 17 percent year on year to HK$6.7 billion.\nThe company outlined several of its development strategies in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Thursday including its development on Cotai, which will add 4,500 hotel rooms to a strip of flashy resorts built on reclaimed land modelled after Las Vegas.\nThe company is also planning to build a non-gaming resort on the neighbouring Chinese island of Hengqin.\nGalaxy, which announced in March plans to develop a $500 million casino resort in the Philippines holiday island of Boracay, said it was working with its local partner for further clarification after the government shut the island for restoration at the end of April.\nThe company said it was actively pursuing a resort in Japan and had expanded its team there with the appointment of Ted Chan as chief operating officer of Japan Development.
