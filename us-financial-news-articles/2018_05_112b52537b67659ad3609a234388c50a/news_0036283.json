The Plan received support from over 97% of the voting Term Loan Lenders and all of the voting Third Lien Noteholders.\nAs provided in the Plan, all shares of Remington’s common stock issued prior to the commencement of Remington’s bankruptcy proceeding were cancelled upon emergence, and Remington has issued new shares of common stock and, in some cases, warrants, to the holders of its previously outstanding funded debt in return for their allowed claims against Remington. The term of Remington’s previous Board of Directors expired upon emergence and a new Board of Directors shall be appointed immediately.\n“It is morning in Remington country,” said Anthony Acitelli, Chief Executive Officer of Remington.
