But despite the Pope’s preachings on humility and inclusion, the Met Gala will be anything but. Rather, it will continue its reign as perhaps the most exclusive party in the world with exorbitant ticket prices.\nI was getting tired, so I laid down on the stairs. #tbt #metgala pic.twitter.com/gS0m7BLyQz\n— Diddy (@Diddy) May 3, 2018\nThe cost of entry to this year’s affair is a whopping $30,000 apiece, according to the New York Times . Brands looking to sponsor tables with special guest celebrities will have to fork out $275,000. Even those patrons, along with prospective individual buyers, will have to be approved by Gala Queen Anna Wintour. Last year, 600 people accepted their invitations, raising close to $12 million for the Costume Institute.\nThe number of attendees this year remains to be seen ahead of the May 7 event, but it’s sure to be a coveted invite this year in particular. It marks the 70th anniversary of the Gala, which will be hosted by Wintour per usual, along with Rihanna, Donatella Versace, and Amal Clooney. Guests will expect the evening, in line with its theme this year, to be heavenly.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Diddy/status/992138417344532483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/tbt?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/fashion/what-is-the-met-gala-and-who-gets-to-go.html", "https://t.co/gS0m7BLyQz", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/metgala?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"], "published": "2018-05-07T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T11:46:47.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
