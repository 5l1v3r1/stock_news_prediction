We will do better,” said Lyons, who took the post in February when her predecessor stepped down amid the sex abuse scandal, citing health problems.\nExecutives from SafeSport and the national governing bodies for swimming, gymnastics, taekwondo and volleyball will join Lyons at the oversight subcommittee hearing.\nA background document posted on the subcommittee’s website said that SafeSport had received almost 500 complaints or reports of sexual abuse from its launch to mid-April, and resolved 156 cases.\nOf those, 120 people have been permanently barred from taking part in U.S. Olympic Committee sports.\nAn outside 2017 audit contracted by the U.S. Olympic Committee found that 43 of the 48 national governing bodies for sports had deficiencies in reporting abuses, such as inconsistent enforcement of criminal background checks, the document said.\nThe hearing comes two days after former Olympic swimmer Ariana Kukors Smith sued USA Swimming in California. She alleged that officials governing the sport knew her coach, Sean Hutchison, was sexually abusing her and failed to investigate or stop him.\nUSA Swimming said in a statement, “We have been in regular contact with her legal team over the last several months and will continue to work with them and Ariana through this process.”\nThe office of Hutchison’s Seattle attorney, Brad Meryhew, said he had no comment.\nReporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Frank McGurty and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:33:08.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
