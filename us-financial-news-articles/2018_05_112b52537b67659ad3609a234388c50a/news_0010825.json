And equally, on our mortgage book, it is very clear that customers are repaying their mortgages,” Gadhia told Reuters. $1 = 0.7272 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru, editing by Sinead Cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T11:35:43.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
