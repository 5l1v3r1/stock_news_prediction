NXP surged 9.9 percent and Qualcomm 2.8 percent.\nThe Philadelphia semiconductor index was up 1.6 percent.\nAt 11:25 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 142.51 points, or 0.57 percent, at 24,973.68. The blue-chip index was on track to post its eighth straight day of gains, with United Health’s 1.6 percent rise providing the biggest boost.\nThe S&P 500 was up 10.11 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,737.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 40.76 points, or 0.55 percent, at 7,443.64.\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow rose above their 100-day moving averages, a key technical level, for the first time in nearly a month last week on easing worries of inflation and a surge in oil prices.\n“Soothing economic reports, robust earnings and calmer trade headlines have allowed stocks to gain the footing here so far.” Augustine said.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology, healthcare and energy sectors leading the gains.\nThe biggest decliner was Xerox, which tumbled 8.4 percent after the U.S. photocopier maker scrapped a planned $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings.\nViacom Inc declined 5.8 percent after CBS Corp filed a lawsuit to stop controlling shareholder Shari Redstone from continuing with her plan to merge it with Viacom. CBS rose 4.9 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 100 new highs and 24 new lows.
