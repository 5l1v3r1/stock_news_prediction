Though security across Libya remains volatile, violence in the capital has recently been limited to localised clashes between armed groups.\nPictures posted on social media showed thick black smoke billowing from the site of the attack, in the Ghout al-Shaal district west of central Tripoli.\n“I saw two suicide bombers myself... they were shouting Allahu Akbar (God is greatest),” said Omar, adding that he had seen bombers’ body parts strewn on the ground.\n“A suicide bomber blew up himself inside the commission and the others set a part of the building on fire.”\nThe victims included three employees of the commission and four members of local security forces, Omar said. The health ministry put the toll at 11 dead and two wounded.\nLibya has been in a state of turmoil since a 2011 civil war resulted in the overthrow of longstanding ruler Muammar Gaddafi by rebel fighters backed by NATO air strikes.\nElections in 2014 were disputed, resulting in rival governments backed by competing military alliances in Tripoli and the east.\nMilitants linked to Islamic State have carried out suicide bombings across the north of the country in recent years, though the group lost most of its fighters in Libya when it was driven out of its stronghold in the central city of Sirte in 2016.\nLibyan and Western officials say militants, including fighters loyal to Islamic State and al Qaeda, are now concentrated in remote desert areas, but also have sleeper cells in coastal cities including Tripoli.\nSome Libyans and members of the international community have questioned the push for new elections this year, expressing concern about the lack of security as well as legal and logistical challenges.
