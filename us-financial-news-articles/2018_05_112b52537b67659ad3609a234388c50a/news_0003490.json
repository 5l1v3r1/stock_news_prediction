If the measure passes, President Pierre Nkurunziza, now 54 years old, would be free to run for office again in 2020.\nThe amendment would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms, but it would not take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza’s rule to 2034.\n“Conditions for holding a credible referendum deteriorate as days go by ... the regime is now afraid of the media’s force, which can derail their plan for the upcoming referendum and the 2020 elections,” said Léonce Ngendakumana, deputy chairman of the opposition party FRODEBU, the Front for Democracy in Burundi.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. State Department condemned recent political violence in Burundi and expressed concern that the vote could hurt the country’s institutions. Human rights groups say they do not think the vote will take place in a free and fair climate.\nNearly 430,000 people, including opposition politicians, have fled the East African nation of 10.5 million people since Nkurunziza won a third term in a 2015 election that led to violent clashes. His foes said he had no right to run again.\nWriting by Omar Mohammed, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T18:05:34.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
