REUTERS/Hannah McKay\nJavid will meet U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials over the coming days in his first trip to the United States since being appointed on April 30.\n“Top of the agenda will be cementing the leading role both countries play in tackling international terrorism, serious and organised crime and the threat posed by Russia,” a British interior ministry spokesman said.\nBritain’s relations with Russia are at a post-Cold War low following the poisoning of former Russian double-agent Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in March.\n“In the wake of the Salisbury attack, (Javid) will seek a coordinated approach against the threat of hostile state activity including targeting illicit finance and cyber attacks,” the spokesman for Javid added.\nBritish accusations that Russia was behind the nerve agent attack led to a diplomatic crisis in which Western governments, including the United States, have expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated by expelling Western diplomats.
