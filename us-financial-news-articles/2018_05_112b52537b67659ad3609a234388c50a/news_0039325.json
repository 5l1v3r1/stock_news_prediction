But with Duperreault and a new team at the helm, AIG's Property and Casualty insurance should be able to find its footing.\nIn addition to upgrading his rating on shares to buy from neutral, Meredith set the company's price target at $65, implying 21 percent upside over the next 12 months. Shares of AIG rose 0.9 percent in premarket trading following the analyst's bullish note.\n\"The foundation is in place for long-term, sustainable improvement in the Commercial P&C business profitability,\" Meredith wrote. \"While we expect some volatility in quarterly results to persist in the near term as the re-underwriting continues, we believe that consensus expectations have been reset, which should allow AIG to meet or exceed expectations.\"\n\"The Life & Retirement division should also benefit from a rising interest rate environment (improved spreads), an increase in index and variable annuity sales, opportunistic pension risk transfers deals, and M&A,\" he added.\n— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:09:27.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
