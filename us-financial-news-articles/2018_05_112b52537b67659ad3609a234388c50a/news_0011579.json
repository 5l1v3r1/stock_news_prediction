Of this, traders said Wilmar sold 12,909 lots.\nJuly raw sugar futures pared losses after falling by as much as 2 percent to 11.52 cents per lb on Tuesday morning.\n“The guess would be that Asia is swimming in sugar right now, what with India and Thailand producing a large amount,” said Michael McDougall, senior vice-president of sales for ED&F Man Capital Markets.\nOne dealer noted Wilmar delivering against the May contract is a “pretty significant event,” as it signals potentially weaker demand from refineries in Algeria, Morocco, and Indonesia.\n“It’s maybe a sign that demand going forward is not as robust ... Usually Wilmar would have homes for that sugar in Algeria and Morocco and Indonesia,” the dealer said.\nForecasts for a large global surplus have pressured prices, with the spot raw sugar futures contract falling to a 2-1/2-year low at 10.69 cents per lb last week.\nChina’s Cofco International [CNCOF.UL] was also a seller in this delivery, of 6,463 lots, traders said. A Cofco spokesman declined to comment.\n“As the owner of a couple of major refineries in China, if Cofco themselves are throwing in the towel and delivering, then it gives you signals about the demand for raw sugar from the refineries there,” the dealer said.\nTrade house Louis Dreyfus Co [AKIRAU.UL], bought more than half the delivery at 11,998 lots, traders said. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.\nAn Alvean spokesman confirmed the company, a joint venture of Cargill Inc [CARG.UL] and Brazilian sugarcane cooperative Copersucar, purchased 5,925 lots of the delivery.\nTrade house Sucres & Denrees (Sucden) was seen buying 3,098 lots, traders said. The company did not respond to a request to comment.\nReporting by Marcy Nicholson, additional reporting by Ana Ionova in London; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T20:40:16.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
