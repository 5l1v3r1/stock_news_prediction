(NASDAQ: SYBT), parent company of Stock Yards Bank & Trust Company, with offices in the Louisville, Indianapolis and Cincinnati metropolitan markets, today announced that James A. (Ja) Hillebrand will become Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective October 1, 2018. Hillebrand (49) currently serves as President of the Company and the Bank and has served on the Company's Board of Directors since 2008. Hillebrand succeeds David P. Heintzman (59), who will retire as Chief Executive Officer and move into the role of Executive Chairman of the Board through the end of 2018 and will continue as its Chairman thereafter. Also, as part of this leadership succession – which has been long planned and is unanimously supported by the Board – the Company announced that Philip S. Poindexter (52), who is currently Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, will become President of the Company and the Bank, effective October 1, 2018.\nCommenting on the announcement, Lead Independent Director Charles R. Edinger III said, \"We appreciate David's long and exemplary service to the Company. He leaves an indelible imprint on Stock Yards Bank & Trust for its dynamic and organic growth, guided by his keen eye for minimizing the risks associated with expansion. On the heels of record results, strong returns, exceptional credit quality and commendable cost efficiencies, this leadership transition comes at a good time for the Company.\"\n\"We are fortunate as a company to be able to attract superior talent, like Ja and Phil, to our outstanding management team and have a strong succession plan to facilitate a smooth leadership transition,\" Heintzman said. \"Ja and Phil have played integral roles in our consistent and attractive growth and are highly committed to the outstanding level of personalized customer service for which our company is known. Their achievements within our bank and across the communities we serve give me great confidence that their leadership abilities will help Stock Yards Bancorp continue its record as one of the best performing community banks in the country.\"\nHeintzman joined the Company in 1985 and progressed through management's ranks as Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and, in 1992 at age 33, was elected President.

David has been an important mentor to many of us, and the values and ethics that define him have made a lasting impact on our 600+ dedicated employees. Of all his leadership traits, none are greater or more apparent than his strength of character. David has overseen tremendous growth over many years of service, enabling our company to outperform financial benchmarks for our peers on a consistent basis – through good times as well as during the financial crisis a decade ago.\n\"The experiences of our 114-year history remain a model for all of us, and especially for Phil and me as we work to extend the Company's record of growth by focusing on our customers and the needs of the communities we serve,\" Hillebrand continued. \"Phil has been instrumental in the development and growth of several key lines of business across all three of our markets and his team-building skills, initiative and sense of urgency when taking care of our customers' needs will serve him well in his new role as President.\"\nHillebrand joined the Company in 1996 to develop its Private Banking Group.
