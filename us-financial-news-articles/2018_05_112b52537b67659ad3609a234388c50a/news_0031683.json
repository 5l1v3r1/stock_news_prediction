Workers hold a goal at Interplastic, a Polish manufacturing company who are supplying the football goalposts for the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia, in Chwaszczyno, Poland, May 16, 2018.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel\nSo says Jan Zoltowksi whose small family-owned Interplastic firm, based near Gdansk on Poland’s Baltic coast, is producing the aluminium goalposts and crossbars for the month-long tournament in Russia.\nMore than 100 employees manually manufacture or process most of more than 190 elements that go into the goal, and managing director Zoltowksi says each one demands the precision of an artist.

For us, it’s our life,” he told Reuters.\nMost of the components are made of aluminium profiles, with each pipe cut, ground, welded and drilled.\nThe last stage is powder painting. Steel fittings are bent, milled and galvanised. Plastic net hooks are also manufactured in-house. Only the nets come from a Spanish partner.
