(TSX:IMV) (OTCQX:IMMVD), a clinical stage immuno-oncology corporation, today released its financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“In continuing to deliver value to our shareholders and partners, IMV has made remarkable progress this quarter in validating our potential in immuno-oncology. Since the beginning of 2018, we have expanded our clinical collaboration with Incyte; observed the dosing of first patients in both Phase 2 combination trials evaluating DPX-Survivac with Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab; and, completed a $14.375 million financing that provides funds for the Corporation through Q4 of 2019, which is beyond our major upcoming clinical milestones,\" said Frederic Ors, IMV's Chief Executive Officer . “These achievements have significantly advanced our programs, and together with our anticipated milestones – including our oral presentation at this year’s ASCO conference as well as early data read-outs from our Phase 2 combination trials with Merck, we look forward to further advancing DPX-Survivac in the immunotherapy clinical landscape.\n“These achievements have come at a critical time in our Company’s history,” continued Mr. Ors. “We are now in a new phase of anticipated growth, announcing plans to list IMV common shares on the Nasdaq exchange, as well as changing the Company’s name from Immunovaccine to IMV, to better reflect the technologies we are advancing.”\nClinical program updates include:\nDPX-Survivac\nPhase 1b clinical trial in ovarian cancer with Incyte\nShortly following the end of the quarter, IMV announced an agreement with Incyte Corporation to expand the companies’ clinical trial collaboration, adding a Phase 2 component to the ongoing combination study. The Phase 2 arm will evaluate DPX-Survivac and low-dose cyclophosphamide with, and without, Incyte’s epacadostat in advanced ovarian cancer patients. In accordance with regulatory guidelines for combination trials, the goal of this portion of the program is to evaluate the clinical contribution of each investigational drug in the combination regimen. Phase 2 clinical trial in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) with Merck\nOn March 28, 2018, the Corporation announced that the first patient was treated in the Phase 2 study combining DPX-Survivac, low-dose cyclophosphamide, and Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, in patients with persistent or recurrent/refractory DLBCL.

The Company currently anticipates that, subject to the receipt of all required approvals, its common shares would begin trading on the Nasdaq before the end of Q2 2018.\nCompletion of a bought deal public offering: In February 2018, IMV completed a bought deal public offering of common shares of the Corporation, including the exercise of the overallotment option-in-full.
