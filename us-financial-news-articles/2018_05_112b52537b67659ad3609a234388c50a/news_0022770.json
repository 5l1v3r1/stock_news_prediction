As described in the Company’s previous disclosures, this new standard introduces significant volatility into the Company’s Net gains (losses) and therefore its Net earnings (loss). In reviewing the Company’s results, in addition to considering Net earnings (loss), it may therefore be beneficial for readers to consider other measures, such as operating earnings and EBITDA (1) , which provide views of the Company’s results without the volatility introduced by the new standard. Prior period figures have been restated to reflect the retrospective application of the new standard.\nThe Company closed, on January 2, 2018, the previously announced acquisition of a 70% interest in Alta Capital Management, LLC (“Alta”), a Utah-based, investment management firm with $3.2 billion USD in assets under management (“AUM”). The current quarter is the first reporting period to include the results of Alta.\nThe Company’s operating earnings for the quarter were $10.5 million, compared to $12.5 million during the same quarter in the prior year. This decrease in operating earnings was due to several factors. Firstly, the operating earnings contribution from the MGA business decreased in the current quarter by $1.5 million compared to the prior year. As previously reported, this was largely the result of the prior year’s operating earnings being unusually high as insurance sales volumes were higher due to incoming tax changes. Secondly, operating expenses were higher in both the Investment Management and the Financial Advisory Segments. The Investment Management Segment incurred a one-time expense of approximately $1 million related to the integration of Alta, and the Financial Advisory Segment incurred additional expenses related to its technology platform upgrade in the current quarter. Thirdly, operating earnings decreased in the Corporate Activities and Investments Segment by $0.7 million, largely due to the deconsolidation of earnings from the Global UCITS fund. Finally, these were partially offset by the operating earnings contribution from Alta of $1.9 million.\nAs a result of significant unrealized losses on securities, including the Bank of Montreal shares, the Company recognized $15.9 million in Net losses in the current quarter, compared to Net gains of $25.9 million in the prior year. In future periods, similar unrealized gains or losses will continue to be included in Net gains (losses) in arriving at the Company’s Net earnings.\nAs a result of the Net losses described above, the Company is reporting Net losses attributable to shareholders in the current quarter of $6.2 million, compared to Net earnings attributable to shareholders of $33.3 million in the prior year.\nThe Company’s AUM was $29.5 billion as at March 31, 2018, compared to $27.3 billion at the end of 2017 and $27.0 billion as at March 31, 2017. The increase in AUM is due largely to the addition of $4.2 billion ($3.2 billion USD) in client assets managed by Alta, partially offset by an outflow of assets and negative financial market performance. The Company’s assets under administration were $17.6 billion as at March 31, 2018, compared to $17.8 billion at the end of 2017 and $17.0 billion as at March 31, 2017.\nEBITDA (1) for the current quarter was $12.5 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to $13.3 million, or $0.46 per share for 2017. Adjusted cash flow from operations (1) for the current quarter was $8.8 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to $10.1 million, or $0.35 per share for 2017. These two non-IFRS financial measures used by the Company are defined in our quarterly and annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nThe Company’s shareholders’ equity as at March 31, 2018 was $624 million, or $21.98 per share, compared to $634 million, or $21.88 per share as at December 31, 2017, and $605 million, or $20.58 per share, as at March 31, 2017. The fair value of the Company’s Securities as at March 31, 2018 was $648 million, or $22.84 per share, compared to $652 million, or $22.49 per share, as at December 31, 2017, and $636 million or $21.63 per share, as at March 31, 2017.\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly eligible dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on July 18, 2018, to shareholders of record on July 11, 2018.\nThe following table summarizes Guardian’s the past eight quarters.\nFor the three months ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2017 Sep 30, 2017 Jun 30, 2017 Mar 31, 2017 Dec 31, 2016 Sep 30, 2016 Jun 30, 2016 ($ in thousand, except per share amounts) Net revenue $ 41,516 $ 39,097 $ 36,315 $ 37,208 $ 38,618 $ 38,240 $ 35,185 $ 34,191 Operating earnings 10,504 13,046 10,505 12,160 12,458 12,371 10,646 10,300 Net gains (losses) (2) (15,932 ) 38,186 4,068 (3,603 ) 25,871 45,511 26,492 14,831 Net earnings (loss) (2) (5,279 ) 44,466 12,555 7,493 33,800 49,514 32,197 21,234 Net earnings (loss) attributable to\nshareholders (2) (6,208 ) 43,982 12,310 7,242 33,285 49,072 32,075 20,952 Shareholders' equity 623,511 634,416 608,013 603,428 605,039 580,177 545,339 513,939 Per Class A and Common share (in $) Net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders (2) Basic $ (0.23 ) $ 1.59 $ 0.44 $ 0.26 $ 1.21 $ 1.74 $ 1.13 $ 0.74 Diluted (0.23 ) 1.51 0.42 0.25 1.14 1.65 1.07 0.70 Shareholders' equity (1) Basic $ 23.27 $ 23.20 $ 21.87 $ 21.75 $ 21.81 $ 20.75 $ 19.11 $ 18.08 Diluted 21.98 21.88 20.67 20.54 20.58 19.62 18.07 17.10 Dividends paid $ 0.100 $ 0.100 $ 0.100 $ 0.100 $ 0.085 $ 0.085 $ 0.085 $ 0.085 Guardian Capital Group Limited is a diversified financial services company founded in 1962.

These two measures do not have standardized meanings under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. However, management believes that most shareholders, creditors, other stakeholders and investment analysts prefer to include the use of these measures in analyzing the Company's results. The Company defines EBITDA as net earnings before interest, income taxes, amortization, stock-based compensation, net gains or losses and net gains or losses on securities held for sale, less amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. The Company defines Adjusted cash flow from operations as Net cash from operating activities, net of changes in non-cash working capital items and net of non-controlling interests. The most comparable IFRS measures are Net earnings (loss), which was $(5,279) for the three months (2017 - $33,800), and Net cash (used in) operating activities, which was $(5,381) for the three months (2017 - $(386)). The per share amounts for EBITDA, Adjusted cash flow (used in) operations, Shareholders' equity and Securities are calculated by dividing the amounts by diluted shares, which is calculated in a manner similar to the calculation of Net earnings available to shareholders per share.\nMore detailed descriptions of these non-IFRS measures are provided in the Company's quarterly and annual Management's Discussions and Analysis, including a reconciliation of these measures to their most comparable IFRS measures.\n(2) Prior period figures have been restated to reflect the retrospective application of IFRS 15, which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018.\nSource:Guardian Capital Group Limited", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1af92f0d-60c9-43f8-8b77-d256b3233791"], "published": "2018-05-11T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:29:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
