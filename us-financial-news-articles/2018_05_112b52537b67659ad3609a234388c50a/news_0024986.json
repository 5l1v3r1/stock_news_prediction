(TSX:ONC) (OTCQX:ONCYF), currently developing REOLYSIN ® (pelareorep), an intravenously delivered immuno-oncolytic virus turning cold tumors hot, today announced financial results and operational highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. All dollar amounts are Canadian unless otherwise noted.\n“The rapid and exciting evolution of Oncolytics has continued in 2018. We have presented exciting immuno-oncology data at a number of medical meetings which supports both our rationale for a phase 3 registration study of pelareorep in metastatic breast cancer and additional collaborations using checkpoint inhibitors,” said Dr. Matt Coffey, President and CEO of Oncolytics Biotech. “With this momentum we have begun to lay the groundwork for value driving catalysts over the next 18 months, including multiple near-term clinical programs evaluating the efficacy of pelareorep in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in a variety of cancer indications. Finally, management also advanced plans to relist Oncolytics’ shares on the NASDAQ Capital Market exchange and we continue to carefully evaluate the timing of this action.”\nSelected highlights since January 1, 2018\nClinical Updates\nPresented posters highlighting data from pelareorep studies at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2018. The presentations showed preclinical models demonstrating pelareorep increased PD-L1 expression in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer cells (CRC) and demonstrated efficacy for pelareorep and anti-PD1 agent combination. Presented positive pelareorep data in combination with Keytruda ® and anti-CD73 at the International Oncolytic Virus Conference 2018. The poster highlighted the effectiveness of pelareorep in combination with Keytruda ® and/or an anti-CD73 immunotherapy in prostate cancer cell lines. Presented poster highlighting results from the REO 024 study at the 2018 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium sponsored by ASCO. The poster described six efficacy evaluable, second-line, pancreatic cancer patients, including two with stable disease of 126 and 277 days and remarkably, one patient that had a partial response and remained on study for 504 days, through 35 cycles of treatment. Reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analysis approach for the company's phase 3 study evaluating pelareorep for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\nCorporate Updates\nReceived shareholder approval for the consolidation of the Company's common shares, which will enable Oncolytics to meet requirements for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAnticipated Milestones\nInitiate a phase 3 registration study of pelareorep in combination with paclitaxel, for the treatment HR+/HER2- mBC patients. Initiate a phase 2 partner-sponsored window of opportunity study of pelareorep in combination with standard of care therapy in the neoadjuvant setting in mBC in 2H 2018. Initiate multiple phase 2 partner-sponsored studies to generate important biomarker and efficacy data of pelareorep in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in 2H 2018. Expand the findings of REO 024 by initiating a phase 2 study examining pelareorep in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA ® ) in patients with relapsed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Re-list on NASDAQ.\nFinancial\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company reported $7.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.

The compound induces selective tumor lysis and promotes an inflamed tumor phenotype through innate and adaptive immune responses to treat a variety of cancers.\nAbout Oncolytics Biotech Inc.\nOncolytics is a biotechnology company developing REOLYSIN ® , also known as pelareorep, an intravenously delivered immuno-oncolytic virus. The compound induces selective tumor lysis and promotes an inflamed tumor phenotype -- turning \"cold\" tumors \"hot\" -- through innate and adaptive immune responses to treat a variety of cancers. Oncolytics' clinical development program emphasizes three pillars: chemotherapy combinations to trigger selective tumor lysis and immuno-therapy and immune modulator (IMiD) combinations to produce innate and adaptive immune responses. Oncolytics is currently planning its first registration study in metastatic breast cancer, as well as studies in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and targeted and IMiD therapies in solid and hematological malignancies.
