He had previously worked for the team as chief designer when they were under BMW ownership.\nSauber said the various heads of department and project leaders would continue to work on the development of this season’s and next year’s car under the supervision of team boss Frederic Vasseur.\nFerrari-powered Sauber were last overall in the 2017 championship but are currently ninth of the 10 teams with 10 points after four of 21 races — double their entire tally from last season.
