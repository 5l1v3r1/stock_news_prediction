The opposition said that figure was inflated, putting participation at nearer 30 percent.\n\"The process undoubtedly lacks legitimacy and as such we do not recognize it,\" said Falcon, a 56-year-old former state governor, looking downcast.\nMaduro had welcomed Falcon's candidacy, which gave some legitimacy to a process critics at home and around the world had condemned in advance as the \"coronation\" of a dictator.\nFalcon's quick rejection of Sunday's election, and call for a new vote, was therefore a blow to the government's strategy. Opposition abstainers saw it as vindicating their decision.\nFalcon, a former member of the Socialist Party who went over to the opposition in 2010, said he was outraged at the government's placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called \"red spots\" close to polling stations nationwide.\nshow chapters Nicolas Maduro re-elected president for fresh 6-year term 8 Hours Ago | 03:15 Mainly poor Venezuelans were asked to scan state-issued \"fatherland cards\" at red tents after voting in hope of receiving a \"prize\" promised by Maduro, which opponents said was akin to vote-buying.\nThe \"fatherland cards\" are required to receive benefits including food boxes and money transfers.\nA third presidential candidate, evangelical pastor Javier Bertucci, followed Falcon in slamming irregularities during Sunday's vote and calling for a new election.\nDespite his unpopularity over a national economic meltdown, Maduro benefited on Sunday not just from the opposition boycott but also from a ban on his two most popular rivals and the\nliberal use of state resources in his campaign.\nFighting 'imperialism' Maduro, the self-described \"son\" of former President Hugo Chavez, says he is battling an \"imperialist\" plot to crush socialism and take over Venezuela's oil. Opponents say he has\ndestroyed a once-wealthy economy and ruthlessly crushed dissent.\nIn many polling stations visited by Reuters reporters, from wealthy east Caracas to the Andean mountains near Colombia, attendance appeared thin. There were lines, however, at poorer government strongholds, where the majority of voters interviewed said they were backing Maduro.\n\"I'm hungry and don't have a job, but I'm sticking to Maduro,\" said Carlos Rincones, 49, in the once-thriving industrial city of Valencia, accusing right-wing business owners of purposefully hiding food and hiking prices.\nMany Venezuelans are disillusioned and angry over the election: They criticize Maduro for economic hardships and the opposition for its dysfunctional splits.\nReeling from a fifth year of recession, falling oil production and U.S. sanctions, Venezuela is seeing growing levels of malnutrition and hyperinflation, and mass emigration.\nVenezuelan migrants staged small anti-Maduro protests in cities from Madrid to Miami. In the highland city of San Cristobal near Colombia, three cloth dolls representing widely loathed officials — Electoral Council head Tibisay Lucena, Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello and Vice President Tareck El Aissami — were hung from a footbridge.\nBut streets were calm, with children playing soccer on one road in San Cristobal blocked off at past elections to accommodate long voter lines. For many Venezuelans, Sunday was a day to look for scant food or stock up on water, which is increasingly running short because of years of underinvestment.\n\"I'm not voting — what's the point if we already know the result? I prefer to come here to get water rather than waste my time,\" said Raul Sanchez, filling a jug from a tap by a busy road in the arid northwestern city of Punto Fijo because his community has not had running water for 26 days.\nWith the election behind him, Maduro may choose to deepen a purge of critics within the ruling \"Chavismo\" movement.\nHe faces a Herculean task to turn around the moribund economy, with the bolivar currency down 99 percent in the past year and inflation at an annual 14,000 percent, according to the National Assembly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T06:24:08.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
