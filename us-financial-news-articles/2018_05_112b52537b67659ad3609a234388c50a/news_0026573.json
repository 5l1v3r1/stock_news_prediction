They will now be evaluated by financial institutions before final approval.\nAs of January, the fund had received 29 proposals.\nChinese investment in Brazil surged last year, hitting a seven-year high of $20.9 billion, as the world’s most populous country looks to secure access to food and natural resources.\nIn the first four months of 2018, Chinese companies invested $1.3 billion in Brazil, up from $290 million in the same period a year prior, according to the ministry, which only accounts for deals in which the value is publicly disclosed.
