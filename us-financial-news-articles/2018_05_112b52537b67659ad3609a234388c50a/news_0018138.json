We are investigating whether there are more casualties and the cause of the blast,” police Captain Farah Ismail told Reuters.\n“The death toll may rise,” he added.\nResidents said the kiosks were busy with soldiers buying khat. “I counted five dead people, including two shoe shiners, a mother who sold khat and two customers. There were 10 other injured civilians,” shopkeeper Ahmed Mohamud told Reuters.\n“I could also see several soldiers in uniform being transported from the blast scene but I could not confirm whether they were dead or wounded.”\nIt was not immediately clear who was behind the blast.\nIn past incidents, the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militant group has claimed responsibility.\nAl Shabaab is fighting to overthrow Somalia’s central government and establish its own rule based on its interpretation of Islamic law.\nSince being pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011, the group has lost control of most of Somalia’s cities and towns. But it retains a strong presence in regions outside the capital.
