PTC's management and research teams provided an in-depth update on the Company's commercial products, Translarna and Emflaza, its scientific platforms including alternative splicing with Spinal muscular atrophy in pivotal trials and two indications, Huntington's disease and Familial dysautonomia which the company anticipates will enter the clinic in 2020. In addition to these indications, PTC also provided updates on our niche oncology pipeline. There are currently two advanced candidates, PTC596 which is currently in the clinic, and PTC299, which PTC anticipates will re-enter the clinic later this year. In 2018, PTC is expecting to initiate clinical trials in two solid tumor indications for PTC596. PTC299, a DHODH inhibitor, is planned to enter clinical trials in hematological tumors in the third quarter of this year. PTC also has a second DHODH inhibitor fast follower currently in late-stage chemical optimization.

Data recently presented at the American Academy of Neurology 2018 Annual Meeting from Part 1 of the FIREFISH study, the dose finding portion, showed that there have been no drug-related safety findings leading to withdrawal at any dose level of the investigational molecule RG7916. In addition, no babies have required a tracheostomy or permanent ventilation since study initiation and no baby has lost the ability to swallow. The median age of first dose was 6.7 months and the 21 babies in the study received RG7916 for a duration of up to 14.8 months. It was reported in January that two babies had died from causes related to disease progression and the deaths were determined not to be drug related. The primary endpoint of Part 2, the confirmatory part of the FIREFISH study, is the proportion of patients sitting without support after 12 months on RG7916 treatment. Recruitment is ongoing globally for FIREFISH Part 2. The SMA program is a collaboration between PTC, Roche, and the SMA Foundation. Review of the Translarna Pediatric Label Expansion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in progress. The application to expand the label of Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD patients who are 2-5 years is currently under review by the CHMP in Europe and a decision is expected mid-year. Dystrophin study for US NDA for ataluren (Translarna) in DMD to begin by the end of 2018. The Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production. PTC is working to design such a study and expects to initiate such a study by the end of 2018. Successful closing of public offering. PTC offered 4,600,000 shares of common stock, successfully raising $117.9 million in the public market. PTC intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund its research and development efforts, including clinical trials and studies with respect to its products and product candidates and potential additional indications, including its programs for alternative splicing for the treatment of rare disorders and oncology, commercialization activities for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD outside of the United States and Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn this press release, the financial results and financial guidance of PTC are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, the non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense.
