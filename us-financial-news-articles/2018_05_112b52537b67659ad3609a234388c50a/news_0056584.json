REUTERS/Michael Dalder Stadler also told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper that he did not rule out further vehicle recalls.\nAudi said this month it had discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars, dealing a fresh setback to its parent Volkswagen more than 2-1/2 years after it first admitted to cheating U.S. diesel exhaust tests.\n“We are still running into issues that we report immediately to regulators,” Stadler told the newspaper. “The diesel crisis hasn’t yet ended.”\nAudi’s chairman appealed to workers earlier this year to ignore a media report that Stadler was about to be ousted in an effort to quell further unrest Volkswagen.\nStadler told the newspaper he was not planning to give up.\n“I feel responsibility, and as long as I have the full support of the supervisory board and management, I accept this responsibility to solve the problem and lead the company into the future,” he said.\nReporting by Tom Sims; Editing by Edmund Blair\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
