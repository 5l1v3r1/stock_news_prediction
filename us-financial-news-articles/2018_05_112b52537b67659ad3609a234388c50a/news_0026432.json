They were up 2 percent at 137.7 pence at 0854 GMT.\n$1 = 0.7394 pounds Reporting by Carolyn Cohn; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-11T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:20:40.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
