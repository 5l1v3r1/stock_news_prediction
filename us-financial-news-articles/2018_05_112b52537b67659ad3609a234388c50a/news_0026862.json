(STI) (Nasdaq:SCON) reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nJeff Quiram, STI’s president and CEO, stated, “In the first quarter of 2018, as previously announced, we expanded our Conductus® wire product development efforts related to next generation electric machines (NGEMs) with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and widened our NGEM scope to multiple applications. We are now implementing a 2018 plan focused on producing wire optimized to operate at low temperatures in the presence of a magnetic field, the characteristics necessary for success in NGEM applications. Our product improvements in late 2017 and planned development in 2018 align our roadmap with market demand as our customers seek to secure wire supply for future projects.\n“Regarding our NGEM project with the DOE, all of our partners in the program, TECO Westinghouse Motor Company, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of North Texas, are actively engaged as we integrate our efforts to complete the program objectives as outlined in the statement of work. We will be providing an annual review on milestone progress to the DOE in July.”\nIn April, STI participated in the International Energy Agency (IEA) and The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) conferences. The company engaged with its customers and other industry leaders to review how STI can help them capitalize on several accelerating energy megatrends: decentralized renewable energy, high energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nSTI’s first quarter 2018 net revenues were $246,000, compared to $1,000 in the first quarter of 2017 and $305,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss for the first quarter 2018 was $2.2 million, or a loss of $0.20 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million, or a loss of $0.26 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017, and a net loss of $1.9 million, or a loss of $0.17 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOn March 7, 2018, STI raised approximately $1.7 million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering.
