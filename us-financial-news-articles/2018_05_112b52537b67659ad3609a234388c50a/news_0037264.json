Once the bill has passed, officials will have the power to begin the lengthy process of transposing EU laws into British laws.\nReporting by William James, editing by Elizabeth Piper\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T19:50:18.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
