REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\nSales of luxury watches have improved over the last year, after a severe downturn, but brands are under pressure to review their business models to better exploit digital sales channels and rekindle young people’s interest in traditional timepieces.\n“Our long-term approach does not preclude us from targeting strategic investments and divestments, as we have demonstrated over the past year,” the maker of Cartier jewelry and IWC watches said in a statement on Friday.\nJust like luxury peers, Richemont has recently made efforts to ramp up e-commerce operations and attract younger shoppers as online sales become an important growth driver.\nRichemont just acquired full control of online luxury retailer Yoox Net-a-Porter ( YNAP.MI ) for 2.6 billion euros (2.2 billion pounds), but its digital strategy suffered a slight setback when its chief technology officer quit earlier this month after just four months on the job.\nNet profit rose 1 percent to 1.221 billion euros, well below a 1.719 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts, partly due to inventory buybacks of watches of 203 million euros in 2017/18.\nThe Geneva-based company had already resolved to undertake a 278 million euro inventory buyback in fiscal 2016/17 when a sudden fall in demand led to overcapacity and massive overstock at retailers.\nIt said it would propose a dividend of 1.90 Swiss francs per share, up from 1.80 francs a year ago and ahead of a forecast for 1.81 francs in the poll.\nShares were indicated to open down 3.7 percent according to premarket indications provided by Bank Julius Baer.
