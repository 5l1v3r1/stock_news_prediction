(Nasdaq:ZFGN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary knowledge of MetAP2 systems biology to develop novel therapies for patients affected by a range of metabolic diseases, today reported its first quarter 2018 financial results.\n“Zafgen is building significant momentum across our pipeline in 2018, following intense foundational scientific work in 2017. The positive interim clinical data from our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial with ZGN-1061, as well as the initiation of IND enabling studies with ZGN-1258, demonstrate important progress across our two most advanced programs,” said Jeffrey Hatfield, Chief Executive Officer. “Our team has also produced multiple journal publications and scientific conference presentations outlining our scientific progress recently, with the opportunity to present more at the upcoming ADA Scientific Sessions. Additionally, we look forward to announcing full topline data from our Phase 2 ZGN-1061 proof-of-concept trial mid-year 2018 and initiating a Phase 1 clinical trial for ZGN-1258 by year end.”\nRecent Corporate and Clinical Highlights\nZGN-1061\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Zafgen announced positive interim data from the ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of ZGN-1061 in type 2 diabetes, including clinically and statistically significant efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared to placebo. Topline data from this ongoing clinical trial is expected mid-year 2018.\nBased on the positive efficacy, safety and tolerability data from this interim analysis, Zafgen has opted to explore the higher end of ZGN-1061’s target engagement range by adding a 1.8 mg dose cohort to the clinical trial. Results from this additional cohort are expected to be announced in early 2019.\nZafgen reports today that the American Diabetes Association has accepted three ZGN-1061 abstracts for presentation at the 78 th Annual Scientific Sessions which begin June 22, 2018. These include:\n• ZGN-1061 Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial update\n• ZGN-1061 and GLP-1 effects, alone and in combination, on A1C and weight in diet-induced obesity (DIO) rats, a standard model for diabetes and obesity\n• ZGN-1061 effects on metabolic parameters, hepatic pathology and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) in DIO-NASH mice\nZGN-1061 data were recently highlighted in two significant publications in peer reviewed journals:\n• ZGN-1061 SAD / MAD data were published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism\n• ZGN-1061 mechanism of safety differentiation published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics\nZGN-1258\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Zafgen advanced ZGN-1258 into IND enabling studies, focusing on Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) as an initial indication. The Company unveiled plans to return to the rare metabolic disease space and initially focus on PWS in January 2018. A Phase 1 clinical trial for ZGN-1258 is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018. Zafgen also plans to launch a global PWS natural history study mid-year 2018 to provide important context for the ZGN-1258 clinical program.\nPipeline\nZafgen continues to leverage its novel, proprietary MetAP2 biology platform to identify an orally dosed development candidate for liver specific metabolic conditions such as NASH by year end 2018. Zafgen presented early data from this program recently, at the annual NASH Summit conference in April.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\n“Zafgen is well positioned to support multiple potential value creating milestones in 2018 as we continue to progress ZGN-1061 towards a Phase 2 topline data readout mid-year and continues to advance ZGN-1258 towards the clinic later this year,” said Patricia Allen, Chief Financial Officer. “With a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $89 million at March 31, 2018, we expect our cash runway to extend into the second half of 2019.”\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $89.1 million.\nNet Loss\nThe Company reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2018 of $16.0 million, or $0.58 per share, compared to a net loss of $13.0 million, or $0.48 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe weighted average common shares (basic and diluted) outstanding used to compute net loss per share were 27,541,594 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 27,350,673 for the same quarter of 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.4 million compared to $9.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior year period was primarily due to increased costs related to ZGN-1258 as the program advances through IND enabling studies and an increase in discovery and screening of new MetAP2 inhibitors. The increase was partially offset by an overall decrease in spend related to the ZGN-1061 program, which had decreased nonclinical and manufacturing costs, partially offset by increased clinical trial costs, as compared to the prior year period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $3.3 million, compared to $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense as well as a decrease in professional fees.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be greater than $40 million as of December 31, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nZafgen will host an investor conference call today, May 8, 2018 at 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, to discuss the Company's first quarter 2018 results as well as other forward-looking information about Zafgen's business.
