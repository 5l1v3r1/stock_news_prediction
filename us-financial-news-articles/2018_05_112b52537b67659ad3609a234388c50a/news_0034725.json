Sometimes he played three at the back, sometimes four. He will always find something.\n“I think it’ll be a good game, lots of familiar faces on both sides. I hope it’ll be a good game with Chelsea as the winner.\n“We can know a little bit how he set up in the last two years against us, but that’s it.”\nA 3-0 defeat at Newcastle United on the final day of the league season ended Chelsea’s hopes of Champions League qualification as they finished fifth in the standings.\nHowever, Courtois is confident the recent results will have no impact on their preparations for the final at Wembley Stadium.\n“The confidence is all right,” he added. “It was not a good performance from us.
