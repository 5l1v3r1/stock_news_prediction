That has opened up a lot of new opportunities for engineering teams and allows them to turn out new products a lot faster.\nSource: General Motors The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 starts at about $62,000 and is powered by a 650-horsepower V8 engine, a considerable upgrade over the roughly $26,000 base model. \"It does feel like the pace has quickened,\" she said.\nThe segments catering to enthusiasts, such as sports cars and \"muscle cars,\" tend to have the most success with this strategy.\n\"These are high-image vehicles sold to people who are enthusiastic and passionate about what they drive, and they like to feel the car they have is special,\" she said.\nAnd the cars often are special, with changes to the vehicle's engineering that suit it better to certain driving situations.\nFord recently added another trim to its Mustang GT, which itself is already a step up from the base model Mustang.\nThe Performance Pack Level 2 is a $6,500 package that gives the GT some extra features, like wider wheels and street-legal tires that can also perform well on a track.\nThe option will only cater to a small demographic. Ford is only selling it in North America and it is only available on manual transmission Mustangs.\nIt follows the first-level GT Performance Package, which is about half the price and has some of the features in the Level 2. Bumping up the chain a bit there is the Shelby GT350, which starts at $57,240, about $30,000 more than the base model.\nSource: Ford Motor Company The Ford Shelby GT350 Mustang is the most powerful version of the iconic car, named after racer and designer Carroll Shelby. It's the same for the Dodge. The Challenger, for example, starts at about $27,000. But halfway up the long chain of trim levels, the Challenger R/T Scat Pack has 485 horsepower compared with the base model's 305, and costs about $39,000.\nAt the top, there is the Dodge Hellcat Widebody which starts at $71,495.\nThere are also six different trims available for the Chevrolet Camaro — from the base model, which starts at around $26,000 to the supercharged ZL1, which will cost above $60,000.\nAnd it is also about meeting customer demand, Brinley said, as many enthusiasts who buy these vehicles want a lot of these features. There is already a pretty large business in aftermarket parts for these vehicles and shops that perform custom work.\nSource: Fiat Chrysler 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat But it is also convenient for automakers.\nSports cars tend to see more sales at the beginning of their typically five- to six-year life cycle, and then they taper off, so this a way of keeping that momentum going, Brinley said.\nThese higher trims and special editions can give automakers higher profit margins — though the companies won't say what the margins on any of these vehicles are.\nIt also lets the manufacturers display engineering prowess and it provides a halo that feeds the image of the overall brand.\nMeanwhile, the companies get a lot of variety out of a single platform, while sharing parts, which allows them to better achieve economies of scale, said Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland.\n\"You have this broad market, it may not be very deep, but it is very broad,\" Lindland said.\nFor example, Ford sells base model Mustangs to rental fleets and Dodge can sell Chargers to police departments, and then each can sell different versions of the same car to racing enthusiasts.\n\"These types of vehicles can take on a lot of different personalities,\" she said. \"You have these extreme examples of use. But they can do all that for short money, because the investment is in the R&D and the tooling.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:24:33.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
