On the eve of the primary he said he was “Trumpier than Trump.”\nMr. Blankenship’s viability as a candidate shows the extent to which the president’s approach can resonate with voters, even though, in Mr. Blankenship’s case, President Donald Trump told voters in a tweet to pick someone else in a state he won in 2016 by 42 percentage points.\nThe West Virginia contest, like Republican primaries Tuesday in Indiana and Ohio, was marked by the candidates building their campaigns around their allegiance to President Donald Trump.\nIndiana Republicans nominated former state lawmaker Mike Braun over two members of Congress. In Ohio, Republicans chose Mike DeWine, the state’s attorney general, as their gubernatorial nominee. Mr. DeWine will face Richard Cordray, the former chairman of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nMr. Blankenship deliberately placed himself at the center of a weekslong media firestorm. It served as a distraction from politically troublesome facts, such as he is still on probation until Wednesday morning and he maintains a primary residence in Nevada.\nHow Trump Unites--and Divides--Republicans Mr. Blankenship said during an interview with Roll Call that his comment about Mr. McConnell’s wife, Taiwan-born Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, wasn’t racist because “races are negro, white Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian.” Mr. McConnell hasn’t responded to the swipes from Mr. Blankenship.\nAt his primary night party Tuesday in Charleston, W.Va., Mr. Blankenship appeared confident. He also said he was relieved that the campaign was over and that his probation would end at midnight, enabling him to travel freely again and get back guns he had to surrender during his prosecution.\nThe state’s Republican primary voters seemed to rally around him. After trailing in polling two weeks prior to the primary, Mr. Blankenship appeared to be in a dead heat with the other two leading candidates, according to private polls conducted by several campaigns in the final days.\n“A lot of Republican primary voters have replaced their anger with Obama with anger with the mainstream media,” said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains a close ally. “There is a knee-jerk conservative defense of a candidate who finds themselves in the eye of a media firestorm. I think that is an extremely regrettable reality.”\nMr. Blankenship faced Rep. Evan Jenkins, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and three other minor candidates in Tuesday’s primary. The winner will take on Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin.\nMr. Manchin is counted among the Senate Democrats’ most vulnerable incumbents, given Mr. Trump’s wide margin of victory in the state in 2016.\nRelated\nAttorney General Morrisey Wins GOP Senate Primary in West Virginia Cordray Wins Ohio Democratic Gubernatorial Primary Braun Wins Indiana’s Republican Senate Primary Pelosi Urges Democrats to Run on Economic Issues in Midterms Mr. Blankenship has spent $3.5 million of his own fortune on the race, according to the latest Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Jenkins has spent $1.4 million and Mr. Morrisey $1 million, mostly from funds they raised.\nMr. Blankenship was head of Massey Energy at the time of the Upper Big Branch mining explosion of 2010 that killed 29 people. Rivals have attacked him for his criminal record and his culpability in the mine disaster.\nMr. Jenkins spent his last day before the primary at a memorial for coal miners. Mr. Morrisey released an online ad warning “liberal Democrats will easily defeat him.”\nWashington Republicans have urged West Virginians to choose either Mr. Jenkins or Mr. Morrisey.\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC run by Mr. McConnell’s allies, has spent $1.3 million attacking Mr. Blankenship during the primary contest. Mr. Blankenship has said he won’t support Mr. McConnell as the party’s leader in the Senate, and he attacked his rivals for refusing to say so as well.\nRelated Video Four states will hold primaries on Tuesday, May 8. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib previews the key races, and explains why West Virginia's Republican Senate primary has become the main event. Photo: Getty Mr. Trump, before he tweeted about the race, invited Messrs. Jenkins and Morrisey—but not Mr. Blankenship—to an April event in the state to tout the new tax law. If Mr. Blankenship wins the nomination, top GOP officials would likely abandon the state, effectively ceding the election to Mr. Manchin.\nTop Washington Republicans involved in Senate campaigns quit the Alabama Senate special election contest last year after GOP nominee Roy Moore was engulfed by allegations of sexual misconduct with teenaged girls when he was in his mid-30s. He denies any misconduct.\nMr. Trump and the Republican National Committee eventually announced their support for Mr. Moore, who lost to Democrat Doug Jones in December. Mr. Jones is the first Democratic senator elected from the GOP-friendly state in 25 years, an upset that sent shock waves through Republican ranks.\nWest Virginia GOP Chairwoman Melody Potter said Tuesday that Mountain State Republicans will stick with whoever wins the primary.\n“Regardless of if the NRSC is in or out, we’re going to get our guy across the line to beat Joe Manchin,” Ms. Potter said. “If Don Blankenship is the nominee, we’re going to get him across the line regardless of who is there to help us.”\nElection 2018: Up Next View full election calendar —Kris Maher contributed to this article.\nWrite to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T04:35:32.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
