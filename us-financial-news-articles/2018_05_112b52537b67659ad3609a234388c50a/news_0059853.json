We expect strong oil prices and a further rise in investments,” said Chief Economist Kjetil Olsen.\nIt was SSB’s first release of companies’ forecasts for 2019 and the fifth prediction for 2018.\nReporting by Ole Petter Skonnord, writing by Terje Solsvik, editing by Gwladys Fouche\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T11:23:57.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
