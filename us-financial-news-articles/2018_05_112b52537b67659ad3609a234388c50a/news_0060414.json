Resign today and leave by your own will,\" Sanchez told Rajoy. \"You are part of the past, of a chapter the country is about to close.\"\n\"Frankenstein\" government The Basque PNV had backed Rajoy's budget as recently as last week but it decided to remove its support after dozens of people linked to the ruling People's Party (PP) were sentenced to decades in prison in a long-running corruption trial.\nSanchez said that if he took power he would stick to the budget approved by Rajoy, and would also seek to start a new dialogue with the restive region of Catalonia.\nDefending his record on Thursday, Rajoy told deputies his centre-right PP has a wide majority of members who are \"decent and honest.\"\n\"The Socialists have left us with a ruined country and we brought back growth and jobs,\" he said, adding that Sanchez was trying to put together a \"Frankenstein\" government that would damage the economy.\nTwo Catalan pro-independence parties as well as leftist Podemos, a relative newcomer, another small Basque group and a party from the Canary Islands have said they will back Sanchez.\nJose Luis Abalos, the member of parliament in charge of formally presenting the motion on behalf of the Socialists, told PP deputies that the court ruling had triggered a wave of indignation across the country.\n\"While families were suffering the crisis, you were becoming millionaires,\" he told PP members in parliament.\nRajoy, whose minority government has struggled after two inconclusive elections in 2015 and 2016 ushered in the most fragmented parliament since democracy returned to Spain in the 1970s, is also coming under fire for a perceived inability to solve a secession crisis in Catalonia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T19:30:52.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
