REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\nIn prepared remarks to be delivered in Japan, Bullard repeated his views that inflation expectations remain a bit below the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target, and that interest rates worldwide are being held down by longer term economic and demographic trends.\nThe U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates in June, and continue a gradual series of increases until perhaps the middle of next year.

It would also lower risks that short term interest rates might rise above long-term ones, an “inversion” of the yield curve that has often preceded a recession.
