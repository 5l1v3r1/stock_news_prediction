The CDH Proposal is subject to a number of conditions following completion of satisfactory confirmatory due diligence, notably the approval of CDH's Investment Committee and the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board.\nIn line with their fiduciary duties, the Sirtex board of directors has determined to engage with CDH Investments to further understand the conditions associated with the CDH Proposal. In light of these developments, Sirtex intends to seek an adjournment of the meeting of Sirtex stockholders to approve the Scheme Implementation Deed between Sirtex and Varian (Varian Scheme), which was scheduled to occur on Monday, May 7, 2018 (Sydney time) to a time and date to be determined.\nIn connection with this, Varian reiterates its belief that the Varian Scheme remains in the best interests of Sirtex and its stockholders.\n\"The Varian Scheme has been unanimously approved by both boards of directors, has fully committed financing and has received all necessary regulatory approvals. We believe the Varian Scheme offers more value and carries far less risk for Sirtex stockholders,\" said Dow Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Varian. \"We stand ready to complete the acquisition following the receipt of Sirtex stockholders' approval and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming our new Sirtex colleagues to Varian.\"\nVarian also notes that the directors of Sirtex continue to believe that the Varian Scheme is in the best interests of Sirtex shareholders and continue to unanimously support and recommend the Varian Scheme.\nAbout Varian\nVarian is a leader in developing and delivering cancer care solutions, and is focused on creating a world without fear of cancer.
