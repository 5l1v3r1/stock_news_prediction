Their dealings in China are opaque, and it is blatant that we have been unfairly prejudiced,” Sports Direct’s head of strategic investments, Liam Rowley, said.\nA spokeswoman for House of Fraser declined to comment.\nC.banner, a major retailer of mid-range to premium footwear brands in China, bought famous London toy shop Hamleys in 2015.\nHouse of Fraser was founded in 1849 and has stores in 59 locations across Britain and Ireland, including London’s Oxford Street.\nAs part of the restructuring, House of Fraser has said it will seek to sell stores via a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an agreement with creditors to pay them for a fixed period while it continues trading.\nHouse of Fraser intends to launch a formal CVA proposal early next month. A source close to the company said its management met regularly with Sports Direct founder and chief executive Mike Ashley, and would give him more details about the CVA when appropriate.\nSports Direct does not have a representative on House of Fraser’s board.
