Dena Bank, the smallest of the four, made a net loss of 12.25 billion rupees.\nIndian banks, already burdened by a near-record 9.5 trillion rupees of soured loans as of last year, were expected to report a further rise in bad loans in the March quarter after the central bank withdrew half a dozen loan-restructuring schemes and tightened some rules in February.\nNew Delhi owns majority stakes in 21 lenders that account for the bulk of the sector’s bad loans, forcing the government to announce a $32 billion bailout package to help the lenders set aside funds for the soured loans and kickstart new lending.\nCanara Bank’s gross non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans rose to 11.84 percent at the end of March, compared with 10.38 percent in the preceding quarter and 9.63 percent a year earlier. Provisions for non-performing assets almost tripled from a year earlier to 87.63 billion rupees.\nAllahabad, UCO and Dena also saw their bad loans and provisions for bad loans rise sharply in the quarter.\nUnion Bank of India, also state-run, reported on Thursday a 25.83 billion rupee net loss for the fourth quarter.\nTop state lenders State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India are due to report fourth quarter results in the coming days. $1 = 67.2750 Indian rupees Reporting by Vishal Sridhar, Devidutta Tripathy and Aby Jose Koilparambil; Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:59:13.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
