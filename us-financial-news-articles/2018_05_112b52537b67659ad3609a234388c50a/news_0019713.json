The four-well downspacing test consists of two Wolfcamp A2 wells, the Caprito 99-301H and Caprito 99-311H, and two Wolfcamp A1 wells, the Caprito 99-202H and Caprito 99-211H. Abraxas experienced 7\" casing integrity issues on the Caprito 99-301H and the 99-311H during the completion. The Caprito 99-301H was fully remediated and the completion of that well continues. The Caprito 99-311H will require minor remediation work following the completion of the other three wells. Abraxas plans to flow back three of the four wells while remediating the Caprito 99-311H. The Company plans to finish the completion of the Caprito 99-311H immediately following the remediation work. Henceforth, Abraxas will be utilizing tie-back strings during the completion to eliminate the risk of further 7\" casing integrity issues. Abraxas does not anticipate that these issues or delays will have any material impact on Abraxas' guidance laid out below. Abraxas owns a 57.8% working interest in the Caprito 99-301H, Caprito 99-311H, Caprito 99-202H and Caprito 99-211H.\nAbraxas recently participated in two non-operated Wolfcamp wells with approximately 5,000' laterals on the Company’s newly acquired acreage in Winkler County, Texas. The wells averaged 1,110 Boepd (963 barrels of oil per day, 883 mcf of natural gas per day) (1) over their first 30 days of production. Abraxas owns a 30% working interest in each well.\nAbraxas is currently drilling two 5,000’ lateral wells, the Greasewood 201H and 301H. These wells are being drilled on Section 94, Block F, which is three sections north of the Company’s previous drilling activity in Ward County, Texas. The two-well pad consists of one Wolfcamp A1 well, the Greasewood 201H, and one Wolfcamp A2 well, the Greasewood 301H. Abraxas owns a 100% working interest in the Greasewood 201H and 301H.\nWilliston Basin\nIn McKenzie County, North Dakota, Abraxas expects to begin the fracture stimulation of the Yellowstone 5H-7H and the Lillibridge 9H-12H wells in May and June, respectively. Both pads are expected to begin flowback in July. Abraxas owns a 52% working interest in the Yellowstone 5H-7H and a 25-29% working interest in the Lillibridge 9H-12H.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Production and Guidance Update\nProduction for the first quarter of 2018 averaged approximately 10,485 Boepd (6,715 barrels of oil per day, 13,180 mcf of natural gas per day, 1,573 barrels of NGL per day). Abraxas did not complete or put any wells onto production during the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter of $31.4 million consisted of $17.1 million for drilling and completions and $14.3 million for acquisitions.\nAbraxas is providing the following second quarter 2018 production, operating cost and capital expenditure guidance. Abraxas brought down or plans to bring down several high rate producing wells in the Bakken and Delaware Basin for planned offsetting fracture stimulations. Abraxas anticipates first production volumes from the new well completions and a return of production from the shut-in wells late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter. Quarterly lease operating expense (\"LOE\") guidance is biased toward the high end of annual guidance due to the associated costs with frac protecting wells from offsetting fracture stimulations. Capital expenditures for the second quarter includes approximately $20 million for planned acquisitions. Production guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018 remains unchanged at 10,000-12,000 Boepd at a planned capital expenditure budget of $140 million.\n2Q18E\nLow\nHigh\nProduction Total (Boepd) 9,000 9,500 % Oil 63% % NGL 15% % Natural Gas 22% Operating Costs LOE ($/Boe) $5.00 $6.00 Production Tax (% Rev) 7.5% 8.0% Cash G&A ($mm) $2.2 $2.4 CAPEX ($mm) $50 (1) The 30-day average rates represent the highest 30 days of production and do not include the impact of natural gas liquids and shrinkage at the processing plant and include flared gas.\nComments\nBob Watson, President and CEO of Abraxas, commented, “Despite continued midstream curtailments for both oil and gas in the first quarter of 2018, we remained in the middle of our production guidance. We continue to benefit from strong underlying well performance with shallower than anticipated declines. In the second quarter, we brought down or plan to bring down numerous high rate offsetting producing wells as we undertake a busy completion schedule. The completion of these seven Bakken and four Delaware Basin wells will lead to a substantial ramp in volumes in the third quarter of 2018.\n“We continue to work a number of deals around our existing assets in the Delaware Basin. Our ultimate objective is to prudently add acres and trade around our core position. With success, our acreage position will become more contiguous and lead to a more efficient and economic development of the asset. We look forward to updating you on the results of these efforts.”\nConference Call\nAbraxas Petroleum Corporation (NASDAQ:AXAS) will host its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call at 11 AM ET on May 9, 2018.

EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, impairments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, and stock-based compensation. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. EBITDA excludes some, but not all items that affect net income and may vary among companies. The EBITDA presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe have also disclosed Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. Our management believes that information regarding Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants is material to an understanding of our financial condition and liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods presented.\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 10,779 $ 13,690 Net interest expense 1,329 507 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 10,130 5,374 Amortization of deferred financing fees 96 137 Stock-based compensation 586 770 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts 4,094 (8,760 ) EBITDA $ 27,014 $ 11,718 EBITDA $ 27,014 $ 11,718 Expenses related to equity offering/loan amendments/permitted acquisitions 202 3,790 Adjusted EBITDA per bank loan covenants $ 27,216 $ 15,508 This release also includes a discussion of “adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items,” which is also a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC rules. The following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted net income, excluding ceiling test impairment and unrealized changes in derivative contracts. Management believes that net income calculated in accordance with GAAP is the most directly comparable measure to adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items. The calculation of adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nUnrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts are based on mark-to-market valuations which are non-cash in nature and may fluctuate drastically from period to period. As commodity prices fluctuate, these derivative contracts are valued against current market prices at the end of each reporting period in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815: Derivatives and Hedging as amended and interpreted, which requires Abraxas to record a gain or loss based on the calculated value difference from the previous period-end valuation for open contracts. For example, NYMEX oil prices on March 31, 2017 were $50.60 per barrel compared to $64.94 on March 31, 2018; therefore, the mark-to-market valuation changed considerably from period to period.\n(In thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 10,779 $ 13,690 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivative contracts 4,094 (8,760 ) Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items $ 14,873 $ 4,930 Net income per share – basic $ 0.07 $ 0.09 Net income per share – diluted $ 0.06 $ 0.09 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items, per share – basic $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Adjusted net income, excluding certain non-cash items, per share – diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.03 Liquidity is calculated by adding the net funds available under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents. We use liquidity as an indicator of the Company's ability to fund development and exploration activities. However, this measurement has limitations. This measurement can vary from year-to-year for the Company and can vary among companies based on what is or is not included in the measurement on a company's financial statements. This measurement is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our SEC filings and posted on our website.\n(In thousands) March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Borrowing base $ 175,000 $ 115,000 Cash and cash equivalents 5,645 1,061 Revolving credit facility - outstanding borrowings (104,000 ) (18,000 ) Outstanding letters of credit (250 ) (250 ) Liquidity $ 76,395 $ 97,811\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006607/en/\nAbraxas Petroleum Corporation\nGeoffrey King, 210-490-4788\nVice President – Chief Financial Officer\ngking@abraxaspetroleum.com\nwww.abraxaspetroleum.com\nSource: Abraxas Petroleum Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abraxaspetroleum.com&esheet=51803114&lan=en-US&anchor=www.abraxaspetroleum.com&index=2&md5=1fb87a6b87feacccddf50d44e88cb33f", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006607/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abraxaspetroleum.com&esheet=51803114&newsitemid=20180508006607&lan=en-US&anchor=www.abraxaspetroleum.com&index=1&md5=0b5ffd53679fd6c4cc07378a69ed540e"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T00:56:23.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
