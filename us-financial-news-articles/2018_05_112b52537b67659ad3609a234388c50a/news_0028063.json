The team is at a training camp in Pallekele, so we’ll give them until May 14 before we make a final decision on those two players.”\nThe first of three tests begins on June 6 at Queen’s Park Oval, Port of Spain.\nFull squad:\nDinesh Chandimal (captain), Mahela Udawatte, Kusal Mendis, Kusal Janith Perera, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Lahiru Gamage, Kasun Rajitha, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Kumara, Asitha Fernando.
