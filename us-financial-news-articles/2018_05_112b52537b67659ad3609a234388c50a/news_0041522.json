It is a lie. We are not dealing with political parties,” a spokesman for the company told Reuters.\nGlobal Trading Group had assets of some 26 million euros ($30.67 million) and an operating profit of 1.4 million euros in 2016 according to its most recent filing with the central bank.\nBelgium’s federal prosecutor was not immediately available for comment on whether the U.S. sanctions would lead to a separate investigation in Belgium.\nAsked whether the company feared consequences for its business from the U.S. sanctions, the spokesman said this was not the case.\n“No. We are a clean company, everything is in the open,” he said.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Alastair Macdonald and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:03:30.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
