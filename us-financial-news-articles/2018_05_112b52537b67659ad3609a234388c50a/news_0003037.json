The decrease in quarter-over-quarter total investment income resulted primarily from a decrease in portfolio debt investments and a $3.5 million decrease in non-recurring dividend and fee income. Net investment income during the first quarter of 2018 was $12.7 million, compared to net investment income of $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net investment income per share during the first quarter of 2018 was $0.27, based on weighted average shares outstanding during the quarter of 47.9 million, compared to $0.38 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 47.7 million.\nThe Company’s net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $14.5 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $23.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company’s net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $0.30 per share during the first quarter of 2018, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 47.9 million, compared to $0.50 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017, based on weighted average shares outstanding of 47.7 million.\nAs previously announced on April 4, 2018, the Company has entered into an asset purchase agreement with an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. (“BSP”) under which the Company, subject to stockholder approval, will sell its December 31, 2017 investment portfolio to funds advised by BSP for $981.2 million in cash. Simultaneously therewith, the Company entered into a stock purchase and transaction agreement with Barings LLC (“Barings”), through which Barings, subject to stockholder approval, will become the investment adviser to the Company in exchange for a cash payment from Barings of $85.0 million, or $1.78 per share, directly to the Company’s stockholders.\nBased on the terms of the asset purchase agreement under which BSP is deemed to have acquired the economics of Triangle’s investment portfolio at the signing thereof, the Company will not pay a quarterly dividend during the second quarter of 2018. Assuming that the Company receives the necessary stockholder approvals, the transactions are expected to close in June or July of 2018, at which time stockholders will receive the payment of $1.78 per share as part of the Barings externalization transaction.\nIn addition, given that BSP is deemed to have acquired the economics of Triangle’s investment portfolio upon signing of the asset purchase agreement, the Company will not be hosting a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $207.9 million and outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility of $125.0 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding non-callable, fixed-rate SBA-guaranteed debentures totaling $250.0 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.90%.\nRecent Portfolio Activity\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company made debt investments in four existing portfolio companies totaling $26.8 million and equity investments in five existing portfolio companies totaling $1.5 million. The Company had six portfolio company loans repaid at par totaling $64.0 million and received normal principal repayments and partial loan repayments totaling $4.7 million. The Company recognized $16.1 million of realized losses related to the exchange of one portfolio debt investment for equity in that portfolio company. The Company received a $3.8 million distribution from one portfolio company and recognized the distribution as long-term capital gain income. In addition, the Company received proceeds related to the sales of certain equity securities totaling $8.9 million and recognized net realized gains on such sales totaling $5.1 million.\nAbout Triangle Capital Corporation\nTriangle Capital Corporation ( www.TCAP.com ) has primarily invested capital in established companies in the lower middle market to fund growth, changes of control and other corporate events, and has offered a wide variety of debt and equity investment structures including first lien, unitranche, second lien, and mezzanine with equity components. Triangle’s investment objective is to seek attractive returns by generating current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity related investments. Triangle’s investment philosophy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions. Triangle has typically invested $5.0 million - $50.0 million per transaction in companies with annual revenues between $20.0 million and $300.0 million and EBITDA between $5.0 million and $75.0 million. As discussed in greater detail above and in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, if the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement with the BSP affiliate and the stock purchase and transaction agreement with Barings are completed, the Company will sell substantially all of its investment portfolio to the BSP affiliate and thereafter will commence operations as an externally managed BDC managed by Barings. In view of the foregoing, and in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement and the stock purchase and transaction agreement, the Company’s focus has shifted primarily to managing its existing portfolio in contemplation of the sale transaction and externalization rather than actively originating portfolio investments.\nTriangle has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"1940 Act\"). Triangle is required to comply with a series of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act as well as applicable NYSE, federal and state laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with any of the laws and regulations that apply to Triangle could have a material adverse effect on Triangle and its stockholders.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations and the proposed transactions.
