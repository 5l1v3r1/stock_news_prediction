The Times also cited video footage from Trump Tower and people briefed on the meeting.\nThe Times had previously reported that Columbus Nova decided to end the agreement with Cohen's company after just seven months and paying $580,000. Cohen had reportedly failed to deliver on Intrater's expectation to gain access to a slew of Republican donors for new deals and investors for Columbus Nova.\nshow chapters Treasury Secretary Mnuchin: Sanctions are targeting certain behaviors of Russian oligarchs 1:38 PM ET Fri, 6 April 2018 | 01:09 Vekselberg was banned from doing business in America earlier this year because of sanctions punishing Moscow for suspected interference in the U.S. presidential election.\nThe Russian billionaire is Columbus Nova's biggest client and maintains significant U.S. investments and assets, many of them frozen by the Treasury Department.\nHe has also been active in American charity causes that promote links between the U.S. and Russia, such as the nonprofit Renova Fort Ross Foundation, which Vekselberg created to preserve a California state park that was the site of a 19th-century Russian settlement.\nEssential Consultants was set up by Cohen in October 2016 and used that month to pay porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump years earlier. Daniels is now suing Trump and Cohen to be released from the nondisclosure agreement she signed.\nDaniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said the Times' story \"is consistent with our understanding of the facts that we have uncovered.\"\nCohen's lawyer, Stephen Ryan, and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.\nRead the full report on The New York Times' website.", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-renova/us-sanctions-on-vekselberg-have-15-2-billion-assets-frozen-sources-idUSKBN1HS0FB", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/michael-cohen-shell-company-payments.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/us/politics/michael-cohen-andrew-intrater.html"], "published": "2018-05-25T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:48:59.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
