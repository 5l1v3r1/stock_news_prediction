(\"Flex\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: FLEX) between January 26, 2017 and April 26, 2018, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\").

The independent outside counsel also notified the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the allegations.\"\nOn this news, Flex's stock fell $3.61 per share, or over 21%, from its previous closing price to close at $13.03 per share on April 27, 2018, damaging investors.\nIf you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 9, 2018. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as lead plaintiff. If you choose to take no action, you may remain an absent class member.\nSince 1993, Bernstein Liebhard LLP has recovered over $3.5 billion for its clients. In addition to representing individual investors, the Firm has been retained by some of the largest public and private pension funds in the country to monitor their assets and pursue litigation on their behalf. As a result of its success litigating hundreds of lawsuits and class actions, the Firm has been named to The National Law Journal's \"Plaintiffs' Hot List\" thirteen times and listed in The Legal 500 for ten consecutive years.\nPlease follow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bernstein-liebhard-llp/ and Twitter: https://twitter.com/bernlieb .\nATTORNEY ADVERTISING.
