His lawyer, Harpal Singh Grewal, declined to comment.\nAuthorities in six countries, including the United States, are investigating the fund.\nShortly after Najib and his long-ruling political coalition were defeated in the polls last week, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad barred him and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country.\nMahathir has said there was sufficient evidence for further investigations into 1MDB.\nPolice seized 284 boxes of designer handbags and dozens of bags filled with cash and jewellery on Friday from a luxury condominium in the city centre.
