It was the first time this season that Gibbons had been ejected.\nThe Twins added a run in the bottom of the third to move ahead 2-0 on an RBI groundout to first by Max Kepler. The Twins had loaded the bases on a single by Gregorio Petit, a walk by Jason Castro and a single by Joe Mauer.\nRomero allowed a two-out walk to Kevin Pillar — who had two singles on the day to extend his hit streak to seven games — in the sixth and was replaced by Trevor Hildenberger.\nMinnesota reliever Zach Duke pitched around a single in the seventh, and Addison Reed also pitched around a single in the eighth inning.\nAaron Loup replaced Stroman in the eighth inning, allowing one-out singles to Kepler, Eduardo Escobar and Rosario to load the bases. Robbie Grossman hit a sacrifice fly to right to increase the lead to 3-0.\nAfter a walk to Logan Morrison loaded the bases again, Carlos Ramirez replaced Loup and walked Petit to force in the second run of the inning.\nFernando Rodney pitched a perfect ninth for the Twins in a non-save situation.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:21:14.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
