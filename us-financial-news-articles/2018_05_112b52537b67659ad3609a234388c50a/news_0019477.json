(NYSE: WTR) today reported results for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nOperating results\nFor the first quarter 2018, net income was $50.8 million, a 3.6 percent increase compared to $49.1 million reported in the same quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.29 for the quarter, an increase of 3.6 percent compared to $0.28 in 2017. Rates, organic growth, lower income tax expenses and additional water consumption benefited earnings and were offset by the impact of increased expenses.\nRevenues for the quarter were $194.3 million, an increase of 3.5 percent compared to $187.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Rates, organic growth and higher consumption contributed to revenue growth. Infrastructure surcharges such as distribution system improvement charges contributed $5.1 million of additional revenue offset by a $2.5 million revenue reserve for savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is expected to be returned to customers.\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased to $73.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $67.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Higher employee costs, as well as overtime and repair costs related to severe winter weather, were offset by lower costs of production and market-based activities. On a normalized basis, the O&M expense growth would have been one-third of the reported increase and more in line with recent historical trends.\n“In the first quarter, we delivered solid earnings and revenue growth, while also making targeted investments in infrastructure to benefit the customers and communities we serve,” said Aqua America Chairman and CEO Chris Franklin. “Our strong financial position allows us to continue leading the way in providing a solution to cities and towns across the country struggling to address the problem of aging infrastructure.”\nAcquisition growth in regulated operations\nAqua added three water and wastewater systems and approximately 448 customer connections through acquisitions in the first quarter. Organic growth added another 1,811 customers.\nFranklin added, “Focus on the company’s growth strategy continues to provide a promising pipeline of opportunities. We expect to close several acquisitions totaling approximately 16,000 new customers in 2018. Additionally, this year we expect to reach over one million customers for the first time. We are proud to have the opportunity to provide safe and reliable water and wastewater services for our customers. This is an essential service that makes an important contribution to the quality of life and prosperity in the communities we serve across our eight states.”\nDividend\nOn April 25, 2018, Aqua America’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.2047 per share of common stock. This dividend will be payable on June 1, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 18, 2018. Aqua has paid a consecutive quarterly dividend for the last 73 years.\nCapital expenditures\nAqua invested $105.1 million in the first three months of the year to improve its infrastructure systems. The company expects to invest more than $500 million in 2018 and more than $1.4 billion through 2020. The capital investments made to rehabilitate and expand the infrastructure of the communities Aqua serves are paramount to helping it continue to protect and provide Earth’s most essential resource.\nRate activity\nTo date in 2018, the company’s state subsidiaries in Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas have received rate awards or infrastructure surcharges totaling an estimated increase to annualized revenues of $23.6 million.\nAdditionally, the company currently has rate or surcharge proceedings pending in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia collectively totaling $8.6 million.\nOn Dec. 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, which lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and made other tax law changes. The rate activity described above includes a reduction in revenues on an annualized basis of $7.1 million for the reduced income tax rate in jurisdictions where the regulator has determined there are income tax savings that are to be refunded to customers.\nFinancial information\nAt quarter-end, Aqua America’s weighted average cost of fixed-rate long-term debt was 4.36 percent and the company had $228.3 million available on its credit lines.\n2018 guidance\nAqua America continues to affirm guidance for 2018, which remains unchanged from last quarter:\nEarnings per diluted common share of $1.37 to $1.42 Approximately $500 million in infrastructure improvements in 2018 for communities served by Aqua Approximately $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvements planned through 2020 in existing operations to improve and strengthen systems Aqua Pennsylvania files a rate case in 2018 with resolution expected in 2019 Total customer growth of between 2 and 3 percent\nAqua America does not guarantee future results of any kind.
