He said the appeal of potentially joining the deal for his country was in large part due to American involvement.\n\"The benefit of the TPP is the access to the U.S. market,\" he said. \"If the U.S. is not there, then the relationship with the other members of TPP can be facilitated through RCEP.\"\nNevertheless, the remaining members of the TPP were able to come to an agreement for a new version: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership\nBut, for Indonesia, RCEP remains a focus, Brodjonegoro added.\n\"With the latest situation on the trade war, I believe the urgency to finish the agreement on RCEP will be very critical for everybody and I think everybody (is) trying to speed up the negotiation,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T08:48:43.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
