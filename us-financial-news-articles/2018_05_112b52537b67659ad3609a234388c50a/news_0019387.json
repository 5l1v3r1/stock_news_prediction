Correia e Silva, whose government took office in 2016, said he stood by a pledge to deliver annual growth of 7 percent.\n“NO THREAT TO ANYBODY” The prime minister said Cape Verde had passed legislation to abolish all visa requirements for Europeans and hopes the European Union will do the same.\n“We are a small nation and are no threat to anybody,” he said. Cape Verde has a population of 500,000 but has large emigrant communities in Portugal and elsewhere in Europe.\nCorreia e Silva said Cape Verde was changing laws to make it easier for foreign investors to invest. Legislation was recently passed to hold foreign exchange accounts and transfer funds without restrictions.\nThe country links its local currency to the euro, which circulates freely in the economy.\nThe prime minister said Cape Verde was also working to boost its position as a hub for air travel - between the Americas and Europe and Africa - as well as hoping to become a digital hub for Africa.\nReporting By Axel Bugge; Editing by Andrei Khalip and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T20:09:49.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
