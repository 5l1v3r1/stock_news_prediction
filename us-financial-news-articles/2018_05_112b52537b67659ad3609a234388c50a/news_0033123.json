The two smartphone vendors are arch-rivals in China as well as fast-growing India.\n“Until now it enjoyed a relatively benign competitive environment in Europe, while market leader Samsung has not been very dynamic in the mid-range segment,” he said. Huawei moved into Europe with its Honor line of phones three years ago.\nThe appeal of Honor, a sub-brand in Huawei’s broader smartphone portfolio aimed at the youth market, is that it packs many of the advanced features of the company’s premium line of Huawei-brand phones at significantly lower cost.\nFor example, the Honor 10 boasts a dual-lens camera with smart photo-taking features based on artificial intelligence technology it sells in high-end models.\nHuawei and Xiaomi have been grabbing share from Samsung in the region’s market for mid-range smartphones as well as from smaller brands such as TCL’s Alcatel, Sony and LG, according to first-quarter data published by market research firm Canalys.\nSamsung, which accounts for roughly one-third of Europe’s smartphone shipments, saw its growth decline by 15 percent during the first quarter. Apple, with 22 percent of smartphone shipments, saw growth decline by 5 percent by the same measure.\nHuawei captured 16.1 percent of the market as its shipments jumped 39 percent, Canalys said. Newer entrant Xiaomi snatched 5.3 percent of the regional market, while and HMD Global’s revived Nokia phones grabbed 3.5 percent.\nHuawei is the world’s No.3 smartphone vendor, with 11 percent of the global market in the first quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. More than one-third of Huawei phone shipments are under its Honor brand, the research firm said.
