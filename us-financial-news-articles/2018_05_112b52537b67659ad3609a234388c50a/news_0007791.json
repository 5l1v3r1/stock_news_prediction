During the quarter, a gain of $209 million (net of tax) was recorded, relating to the sale of our investment in a Chilean electricity transmission business. Results from the period reflect better operating performance generated across the majority of our operations, which was offset by higher depreciation and foreign exchange.\nFFO of $333 million increased by 28% compared to the prior year. Results reflect the contribution of new investments, as well as solid organic growth across our various businesses. Our payout ratio 6 for the period was 68%, which remains within our target range of 60-70%.\n“2018 is off to a good start. With the sale of our Chilean electricity transmission business, we continue to demonstrate our full cycle investment strategy,” said Sam Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure. “The proceeds dramatically increased our total liquidity, which now stands at over $4 billion. We can use this substantial liquidity to fund our strong backlog of organic growth projects and opportunistically deploy into new investment initiatives on a value basis.”\nSegment Performance\nOur utilities segment contributed FFO of $169 million compared to $100 million in the prior year. This step-change increase was primarily attributable to the contribution from our Brazilian regulated gas transmission business acquired in April 2017, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our rate base and upward inflation adjustments in our other utility businesses.\nOur transport segment reported FFO of $137 million in the period, compared to $123 million in the previous year. This increase was driven by higher tariffs and volumes in our Brazilian rail and South American toll road businesses. Results were partially offset by lower contribution from our ports business, and foreign exchange which reduced our results by $4 million.\nOur energy segment generated FFO of $66 million, compared to $62 million in the same period last year. This improvement captures the incremental contribution from new contracts, higher gas transport volumes and further equity invested into our North American natural gas transmission operations. Results were partially offset by lower contribution from our gas storage business that is being impacted by a weak spread environment.\nOur communications infrastructure segment generated FFO of $19 million for the first three months of 2018, which remained unchanged from the prior year. The business delivered results in-line with expectations due to its stable and predictable cash flow profile.\nThe following table presents FFO by segment:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31 US$ millions, unaudited 2018 2017 FFO by segment Utilities $ 169 $ 100 Transport 137 123 Energy 66 62 Communications Infrastructure 19 19 Corporate (58 ) (43 ) FFO $ 333 $ 261 Update on Strategic Initiatives\nWe have executed on several initiatives that will contribute to our results and liquidity:\n(I) Chilean Electricity Transmission – In March, Brookfield Infrastructure closed on the sale of its 28% interest in Transelec for $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion net of tax), achieving a compound internal rate of return of approximately 18% on a pre-tax basis. Transelec provided us with strong and predictable cash flows, however, we see opportunities to reinvest the net proceeds from the sale at significantly higher returns.\n(II) Colombian Gas Distribution – The previously announced acquisition of a controlling interest in Gas Natural S.A. ESP, the second largest gas distribution network in Colombia, is advancing well. We initially acquired 11% and are currently progressing the second phase of the acquisition. Upon completion, this would result in Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners owning a controlling interest in the company. In early April, we received anti-trust approval and once approvals have been received from the local securities regulator, we will launch a tender offer.\nDistribution\nThe Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.47 per unit, payable on June 29, 2018 to unitholders of record as at the close of business on May 31, 2018. This distribution represents an 8% increase compared to the prior year. The regular quarterly dividends on the Cumulative Class A Preferred Limited Partnership Units, Series 1, Series 3, Series 5, Series 7 and Series 9 have also been declared.\nAdditional Information\nThe Board has reviewed and approved this news release, including the summarized unaudited financial information contained herein.\nBrookfield Infrastructure’s Letter to Unitholders and Supplemental Information are available at www.brookfield.com/infrastructure .\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners is a leading global infrastructure company that owns and operates high quality, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, energy and communications infrastructure sectors across North and South America, Asia Pacific and Europe.
