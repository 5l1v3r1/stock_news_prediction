You have to be powerful, but yet you have to handle being vulnerable at moments when things don’t go your way.”\nSTRUGGLE FOR FORM Having ended 2017 outside the top 50, Sharapova endured one of the worst periods of her career as she lost four straight matches.\nIn March, she ended a four-year spell with Dutchman Sven Groeneveld and brought back her former coach from Sweden, Thomas Hogstedt, with whom she won her first French Open title in 2012 as she completed the career grand slam.\nNow, after strong performances in Madrid and Rome this month, Sharapova is back among the seeds and beginning to believe that she can win the title for a third time.\nFinally fully fit, Sharapova reached the quarter-finals in Madrid and beat reigning French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko to reach the semi-finals in Rome, a huge boost of confidence as she returns to the scene of her most successful grand slam.\nAfter losing a close three-set match to world number one Simona Halep in Rome, Sharapova called her progress “a step in the right direction”.\n“After losing those matches, you still have to put yourself on the line and show up and deliver, and do it with authority,” she told reporters at Rome’s Foro Italico.\n“What I’m most proud of is (that) I had a lot of opportunities in the last few weeks in Madrid and here to just back down, to let little things bother me. But I got through them.\n“I set up real good situations for myself; a lot of court time and match play. All good things that I wanted.”\nEditing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T05:34:01.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
