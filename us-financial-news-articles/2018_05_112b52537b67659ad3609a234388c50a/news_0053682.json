The difference between winning and losing for Liverpool this weekend, is a mere £4 million in distributions from (European football body) UEFA and they are already assured of appearing in next year's competition.\" Dan Jones, a partner and head of the Sports Business Group at audit firm Deloitte, said in a press release.\nNeville Williams | Aston Villa FC | Getty Images Ahmed Elmohamady of Aston Villa during the Sky Bet Championship match between Fulham and Aston Villa at Craven Cottage on February 17, 2018 in London, England. In the last 10 seasons, 20 of the 30 clubs promoted to the English Premier League have avoided relegation in their first campaign. The 2017/18 season was the first in seven years where all three of the promoted clubs avoided first-year relegation.\nBrand exposure for a team once it has made it into England's top division is also lucrative, with a huge global reach compared to the league below, largely thanks to a much bigger share of TV rights money.\n\"There's a marked difference between Premier League awareness and familiarity and Championship familiarity and awareness. It's about a 30 percent differential. The Premier League is broadcast to over 600 million homes across the globe, with an estimated viewership of around 4.5 billion people, whereas the Championship is around a couple of hundred million at most.\" Declan Ahern, sports director at consultancy Brand Finance, told CNBC.\nThe two teams involved at Wembley are both currently backed by billionaire foreign owners. Shahid Khan owns Fulham as well as NFL team the Jacksonville Jaguars. Earlier this month he also launched a bid to buy Wembley Stadium from the English Football Association.\nshow chapters Soccer embraces digital disruption 4:22 AM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 05:22 The Chinese businessman Tony Xia, the owner and CEO of Recon Group, is in charge at Aston Villa.
