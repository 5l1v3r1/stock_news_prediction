Barclays analyst Phillip Huang expected postpaid additions of 39,000.\nWireless customers on average paid C$66.51 a month on Telus’ network, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier. However, its postpaid churn — the amount of defecting customers — rose to 0.95 percent from 0.93 percent.\nTelus’s net income fell to C$412 million, or 69 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from C$422 million, or 70 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, Telus earned 73 Canadian cents per share, missing analysts’ average estimate by 2 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOperating revenue rose to C$3.38 billion from C$3.18 billion.\nShaw Communications ( SJRb.TO ) last month posted a quarterly profit that easily topped analysts’ estimates, boosted by investments in its wireless business which helped more than double subscriber additions.\n(Corrects to “Vancouver-based” from “Calgary-based” in paragraph 3)\nReporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:36:42.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
