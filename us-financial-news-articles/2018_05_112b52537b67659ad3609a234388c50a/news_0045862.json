I have ordered the BAMF to carry out the process with the highest priority,” Bild Quote: d Seehofer as saying in an online report.\nSeehofer said he would keep close tabs on the process and that Germany’s constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights had both signaled that suspected Islamist radicals could be expelled.\nEarlier this month Germany deported another Tunisian man, Haikel S., who is a suspected member of Islamic State and accused of being involved in a number of militant attacks in Tunisia, including one at the Bardo Museum in 2015 in which more than 20 people were killed.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:28:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
