Other data showed a pickup in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region this month, with manufacturers saying they were asking for higher prices for their products.\nThe industrial sector was up 0.61 percent, the second-biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors.\n“You have kind of a mixed bag of earnings numbers ... the economic data generally speaking was pretty good and that’s leading to a little bit of mild buying in the market,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\nOn the Russell 2000, Nolte said, “I think you’re starting to see people come into that because it’s the only index that has put in a new high and you’ve got some interest.”\nAt 11:46 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.33 points, or 0.12 percent, at 24,799.26, the S&P 500 was up 5.79 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,728.25 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 14.08 points, or 0.19 percent, at 7,412.37.\nThe three rate-sensitive sectors, real-estate, utilities and telecoms, were slightly lower.\nThe market had opened in the red, weighed by a drop in Cisco and on jitters as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields hovered at 7-year highs and the United States and China started trade talks to try to avert a damaging tariff war.\nWhite House Chief Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow expects China to bring a proposal to the talks which would “extend the conversation and permit additional negotiations”.\nKeeping the gains in check were Cisco’s 2.8 percent drop, the most on the Dow, after the company’s forecast indicated its transition to a software-focused business was a work in progress.\nWalmart slipped 1.1 percent, reversing premarket gains, after it said profit margins were under pressure, despite sales and earnings beating expectations.\nJ.C. Penney tumbled 10.7 percent after its same-store sales missed estimates and the company cut its full-year profit forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.55-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 108 new highs and 20 new lows.
