This is a pivotal time for OncoQuest's oregovomab, a novel immunotherapy, the Company's lead compound. In Phase 2, oregovomab showed great promise as a frontline therapy for ovarian cancer where the standard of care has not changed for decades, and I look forward to leading it to potential registration. The opportunity to help grow a company that has the possibility of altering the way in which cancer is treated is, as always, very compelling to an oncologist,\" commented Dr. Bayever.\nAbout OncoQuest\nOncoQuest is a subsidiary of Quest PharmaTech Inc.
