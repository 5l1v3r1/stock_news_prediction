We have announced the signing of definitive agreements for two divestitures so far in 2018. We are also divesting approximately $500 million of additional revenue from certain Customer Care contracts. These are important steps in strengthening our balance sheet, solidifying the core of our business and positioning the company for long-term, profitable growth,\" said Ashok Vemuri, CEO of Conduent. \"In the first quarter, our Commercial revenue, excluding one-time items and strategic actions, grew three percent as the investment in our core is starting to yield results. Profitability improved across key segments with higher service line penetration, better pricing and deployment of platforms and software.\"\n(1)\nSigned deals are subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $1,420 million, down 8.6% compared to Q1 2017.

There is no impact to Free Cash Flow from this accounting standard adoption.\n(4)\nSigned deals are subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\n\"The progress we are making executing targeted divestitures and improving our margin profile within our core business has been encouraging,\" said Brian Webb-Walsh, CFO of Conduent. \"We updated our guidance for the impact of the recently signed divestitures, but excluding these factors, we would have been in-line with our previous guidance.\"\nConference Call\nManagement will present the results during a conference call and webcast on May 9, 2018 at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe call will be available by live audio webcast with the news release and online presentation slides at https://investor.conduent.com/ .\nThe conference call will also be available by calling 877-883-0383 (international dial-in 412-902-6506) at approximately 9:45 a.m. ET.\nA recording of the conference call will be available by calling 877-344-7529, or 412-317-0088 one hour after the conference call concludes on May 9, 2018.

Learn more at www.conduent.com .\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, we have discussed our financial results using non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods' results against the corresponding prior periods' results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and providing such non-GAAP financial measures to investors allows for a further level of transparency as to how management reviews and evaluates our business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods. Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section attached to this release for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and their reconciliation to the reported GAAP measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Report and any exhibits to this Report may contain \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Financial Measures\nWe have reported our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we have discussed our results using non-GAAP measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Accordingly, we believe it is necessary to adjust several reported amounts, determined in accordance with GAAP, to exclude the effects of certain items as well as their related tax effects. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional means of analyzing the current periods' results against the corresponding prior periods' results. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable U.S. GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions, and providing such non-GAAP financial measures to investors allows for a further level of transparency as to how management reviews and evaluates our business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods . Compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided below.\nThese reconciliations also include the income tax effects for our non-GAAP performance measures in total, to the extent applicable. The income tax effects are calculated under the same accounting principles as applied to our reported pre-tax performance measures under ASC 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method including an adjustment for estimated Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). The noted income tax effect for our non-GAAP performance measures is effectively the difference in income taxes for reported and adjusted pre-tax income calculated under the annual effective tax rate method. The tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments was calculated based upon evaluation of the statutory tax treatment and the applicable statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions in which such charges were incurred.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate\nWe make adjustments to Income (Loss) before Income Taxes for the following items for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of intangible assets is driven by acquisition activity, which can vary in size, nature and timing as compared to other companies within our industry from period to period. Restructuring and related costs. Restructuring and related costs include restructuring and asset impairment charges as well as costs associated with our strategic transformation program. Separation costs. Separation costs are expenses incurred in connection with the separation from Xerox Corporation into a separate, independent, publicly traded company. These costs primarily relate to third-party investment banking, accounting, legal, consulting and other similar types of services related to the separation transaction as well as costs associated with the operational separation of the two companies. Other (income) expenses, net. Other (income) expenses, net includes currency (gains) losses, net and all other (income) expenses, net. NY Medicaid Management Information System (NY MMIS). Costs associated with the company not fully completing the State of New York Health Enterprise platform project. Health Enterprise (HE charge). Cost associated with not fully completing the Health Enterprise Medical platform implementation projects in California and Montana. Litigation costs (recoveries), net. (Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs.\nThe Company provides adjusted net income and adjusted EPS financial measures to assist our investors in evaluating our ongoing operating performance for the current reporting period and, where provided, over different reporting periods, by adjusting for certain items which may be recurring or non-recurring and which in our view do not necessarily reflect ongoing performance. We also internally use these measures to assess our operating performance, both absolutely and in comparison to other companies, and in evaluating or making selected compensation decisions.\nManagement believes that adjusted effective tax rate, provided as supplemental information, facilitates a comparison by investors of our actual effective tax rate with an adjusted effective tax rate which reflects the impact of the items which are excluded in providing adjusted net income, and may provide added insight into our underlying business results and how effective tax rates impact our ongoing business.\nAdjusted Revenue and Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin\nWe make adjustments to Revenue, Costs and Expenses and Operating Margin for the following items, for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets. Restructuring and related costs. Separation costs. Interest expense. Interest expense includes interest on long-term debt and amortization of debt issuance costs. Other (income) expenses, net. NY MMIS. HE charge. Litigation costs (recoveries), net. (Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs. ASC 606 adjustment. (Revenue) / (Income) loss from divestitures.\nWe provide our investors with adjusted revenue, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin information, as supplemental information, because we believe it offers added insight, by itself and for comparability between periods, by adjusting for certain non-cash items as well as certain other identified items which we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing business, and may also provide added insight on trends in our ongoing business.\nAdjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA Margin as an additional way of assessing certain aspects of our operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our on-going business. Adjusted EBITDA represents income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for the following items. EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by adjusted revenue.\nRestructuring and related costs. Separation costs. Other (income) expenses, net. NY MMIS. HE charge. Litigation costs (recoveries), net. (Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs. ASC 606 adjustment. (Revenue) / (Income) loss from divestitures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows from operations, operating income (loss) or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP as indicators of operating performances. Management cautions that amounts presented in accordance with Conduent's definition of Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the same manner.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities as reported on the consolidated statement of cash flows, less cost of additions to land, buildings and equipment, cost of additions to internal use software, vendor financed capital lease additions and proceeds from sales of land, buildings and equipment. We use the non-GAAP measure of Free Cash Flow as a criterion of liquidity and performance-based components of employee compensation. We use Free Cash Flow as a measure of liquidity to determine amounts we can reinvest in our core businesses, such as amounts available to make acquisitions, invest in land, buildings and equipment and internal use software, make principal payments on debt. In order to provide a meaningful basis for comparison, we are providing information with respect to our Free Cash Flow reconciled to cash flow provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the most directly comparable measure under U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nAdjusted free cash flow is defined as free cash flow from above plus deferred compensation payments.\nAdjusted Cash\nAdjusted cash is defined as the cash and cash equivalents less cash from terminated deferred compensation to be paid to plan participants.\nConstant Currency\nTo better understand trends in our business, we believe that it is helpful to adjust revenue to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. We refer to this adjusted revenue as \"constant currency.\" Currency impact is the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates.\nNon-GAAP Outlook\nIn providing outlook for adjusted EBITDA we exclude certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measure. A description of the adjustments which historically have been applicable in determining adjusted EBITDA are reflected in the table below. We are providing such outlook only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments for the forward-looking period, such as amortization, restructuring, separation costs, NY MMIS, HE charge, and certain other adjusted items, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted. Based on past reported results, where one or more of these items have been applicable, such excluded items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to reported results.\nNet Income (Loss) and EPS Reconciliation:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n(in millions, except earnings per share)\nNet Income\n(Loss)\nDiluted EPS\nNet Income\n(Loss)\nDiluted EPS\nGAAP as Reported From Continuing Operations\n$\n(50)\n$\n(0.26)\n$\n(10)\n$\n(0.06)\nAdjustments:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n61\n61\nNY MMIS\n—\n8\nRestructuring and related costs\n20\n18\nHE charge\n—\n(5)\nSeparation costs\n—\n5\n(Gain) loss on divestitures and transaction costs\n15\n—\nLitigation costs (recoveries), net\n31\n(11)\nOther (income) expenses, net\n(1)\n(1)\nLess: Income tax adjustments (1)\n(29)\n(30)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and EPS\n$\n47\n$\n0.22\n$\n35\n$\n0.16\n(GAAP shares)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n205\n203\nRestricted stock and performance units / shares\n—\n—\nAdjusted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding (2)\n205\n203\n(Non-GAAP shares)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n205\n203\nRestricted stock and performance shares\n3\n2\nAdjusted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding (2)\n208\n205\n(1)\nReflects the income tax (expense) benefit of the adjustments.
