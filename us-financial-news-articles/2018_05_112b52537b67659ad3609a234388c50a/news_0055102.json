It did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.\nOne of the panellists, Russian foods tycoon David Yakobashvili, said of Huntsman: “Unfortunately he is not here, but I am sure he is here in spirit.”\nThe most senior U.S. executive at the event was Bertrand-Marc Allen, President of Boeing International.\nHe arrived after the session started and went straight to his seat on the panel, four places away from Vekselberg, without shaking hands with fellow panellists.\nSergei Kislyak, the former U.S. ambassador to Washington, was in the second row of the audience.\nHe was ambassador at a time when, U.S. intelligence officials allege, Moscow was interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Donald Trump win.\nRussian denies any interference and the Trump White House denies collusion with Moscow.
