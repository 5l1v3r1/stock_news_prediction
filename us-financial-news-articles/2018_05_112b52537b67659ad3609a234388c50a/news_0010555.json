Sales could have been greater had it not been for an unusual warm spell in March in much of Brazil, it added.\nIn an interview, Renner CFO and investor relations officer Laurence Gomes said the company was not backing off its plan to invest 620 million reais this year to open 70 new stores, even though it had only opened four in the first quarter.\nHe added that Renner was still developing its so-called ‘multi-channel’ strategy to make shopping more convenient by allowing pick-ups and returns of online purchases at physical stores, among other services.\n“Multi-channel is continuing along the course of the year, and we’re passing through a moment where our business is changing,” Gomes said.\n“Its essence isn’t changing, but we’re adapting to the behavior of the consumer.”\n$1 = 3.53 reais Reporting by Flavia Bohone; Writing by Gram Slattery; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Richard Chang\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:49:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
