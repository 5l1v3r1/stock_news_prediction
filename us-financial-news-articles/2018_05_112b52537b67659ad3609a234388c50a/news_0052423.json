But researchers have needed specialized lab equipment to put the work into practice.\nThat's where the pill comes in. Here's how it works, as explained by MIT: Bacteria is placed in the capsule, which allows molecules to flow through. The capsule has tiny phototransistors that send the light information to a microprocessor, which broadcasts it wirelessly to a computer or smartphone.\nThe MIT researchers successfully tested the roughly 1.5-inch capsule in pigs to detect for stomach bleeding.\nThe hope is researchers can make the device smaller for human use. The capsules could be used to check for disease or conditons in the digestive tract.\n\"By combining engineered biological sensors together with low-power wireless electronics, we can detect biological signals in the body and in near real-time, enabling new diagnostic capabilities for human health applications,\" said Timothy Lu, MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science as well as biological engineering.\nThe study's co-lead author is former MIT postdoc Phillip Nadeau. Senior authors were Lu and Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the MIT School of Engineering.\nâ€” Sean Rossman, USA Today", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/05/09/foods-make-you-happy/307583001/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/30/competitive-eating-how-do-they-do-it/437541001/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/22/what-probiotics-and-why-they-good-you/421243001/", "http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/915.full"], "published": "2018-05-25T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:02:47.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
