There are many people who present themselves as Ogiek, and they are not, or there are some people who are Ogiek and are not included.”\nThe case has nationwide implications, he said.\n“This is a forest community and so this decision has a precedence value vis-a-vis other communities that are similarly situated,” he said.\n“There is no magic bullet to this implementation. It’s going to be a fairly lengthy process.”\nReporting by Kevin Mwanza; editing by Katy Migiro.
