For example, Alphabet CEO Larry Page only made a salary of $1 in 2017. But, he also owns 42.5 percent of Alphabet's Class B stock and is worth nearly $50 billion. So the ratio of his salary to his employees' salary is meaningless. show chapters 10:09 AM ET Fri, 24 March 2017 | 00:59\nIt's much more interesting to look at the differences in salaries across the tech sector:\nThe \"median\" compensation, which includes salary and total other benefits, is right in the middle of a company's total pay scale, excluding the CEO in this case.\nAmazon and Tesla employ warehouse and factory workers, so their median compensation packages are lower than those of companies that primarily offer white-collar jobs.\nAs part of their calculations, companies could annualize pay for people who worked a partial year and could also exclude the pay of some employees who work outside the U.S., up to 5 percent of its employee base.\nThe calculations do not include independent contractors who work for the companies. For example, both Facebook and Google employ many low-wage content moderators through staffing firms. If those employees' salaries were included, the median salary would be lower.\nAlso, only companies whose fiscal year ended December 31 had to report their pay ratio in their latest proxy, so Apple, Snap, and Microsoft are all off the hook, for now. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T16:02:01.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
