We want “even more positive transformations in the country.”\nThe cautious opening up in Uzbekistan is being welcomed by the world’s big multilateral financial institutions, though human rights issues are still causing alarm.\nA report from the Human Rights Watch group this year said “grave rights violations such as torture, politically motivated imprisonment, and forced labor in the cotton fields remain widespread.”\nEarlier this week an Uzbek journalist was cleared of conspiring against the government and released, in a court ruling that Amnesty International said offered a “glimmer of hope” after years of crackdowns on reporters and dissidents.\nReporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:44:42.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
