For information, visit sharespost.com .\nAbout the SharesPost 100 Fund\nThe SharesPost 100 Fund was launched in March 2014 to provide all investors access to a portfolio of late-stage, private growth companies, an asset class that has traditionally been only available to institutional investors and the very wealthy. The Fund has no accreditation requirements and is available for a $2500 minimum investment. Through the company’s growing list of advisors, retail investors can now invest in a ’40 Act registered fund, which targets investments exclusively in late-stage private growth companies.\nImportant Disclosure\nInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus with this and other information about the Fund, please download here . Read the prospectus carefully before investing.\nPast performance does not guarantee future results.\nInvestment in the SharesPost 100 Fund involves substantial risk. The Fund is not suitable for investors who cannot bear the risk of loss of all or part of their investment. The Fund is appropriate only for investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment. The Fund has no history of public trading and investors should not expect to sell shares other than through the Fund's repurchase policy regardless of how the Fund performs. The Fund does not intend to list its shares on any exchange and does not expect a secondary market to develop.\nAll investing involves risk including the possible loss of principal. Shares in the Fund are highly illiquid, and you may not be able to sell your shares when, or in the amount that, you desire. The Fund intends to primarily invest in securities of private, late-stage, venture-backed growth companies. There are significant potential risks relating to investing in such securities. Because most of the securities in which the Fund invests are not publicly traded, the Fund’s investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser pursuant to fair valuation procedures and methodologies adopted by the Board of Trustees. While the Fund and the Investment Adviser will use good faith efforts to determine the fair value of the Fund’s securities, value will be based on the parameters set forth by the Prospectus. As a consequence, the value of the securities, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, may vary. Due to transfer restrictions and the illiquid nature of the Fund’s investments, you may not be able to sell your investments when you wish to do so. There are significant potential risks associated with investing in venture capital and private equity-backed companies with complex capital structures. The Fund focuses its investments in a limited number of securities, which could subject it to greater risk than that of a larger, more varied portfolio. There is a greater focus in technology securities that could adversely affect the Fund’s performance. If the Fund does not have at least 500 Members for an entire taxable year, you could receive an adverse tax treatment. The Fund’s quarterly repurchase policy may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Investment Adviser would otherwise do so, and may also result in an increase in the Fund’s expense ratio. This is not a complete enumeration of the Fund’s risks. Please read the Fund prospectus for other risk factors related to the Fund, its investment strategy and your investment in the Fund, and other additional details.\nCertain potential conflicts of interest involving the Fund’s Investment Adviser and its affiliates could impact the Fund’s investment returns and limit the flexibility of the implementation of its investment policies. New investment opportunities that meet the Fund’s investment objectives might not be offered, or otherwise made available to the Fund, due to affiliations between entities related to the Fund. Prospective investors should review the conflicts of interest described in the section entitled “Conflicts of Interest” in the Prospectus prior to making an investment in the Fund.\nThe SharesPost 100 Fund is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005383/en/\nBlue Marlin Partners\nGreg Berardi, 415-239-7826\ngreg@bluemarlinpartners.com\nSource: SharesPost, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharespost.com%2F&esheet=51814092&newsitemid=20180530005383&lan=en-US&anchor=sharespost.com&index=2&md5=62fa10de08e1f956be181d5e629de1e3", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluemarlinpartners.com&esheet=51814092&lan=en-US&anchor=Blue+Marlin+Partners&index=5&md5=5aa7705d20c047322b2e43cab560e389", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharespost.com%2F&esheet=51814092&newsitemid=20180530005383&lan=en-US&anchor=SharesPost%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=1823b466832550567dbeaf66069e9b67", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fforeside.com%2F&esheet=51814092&newsitemid=20180530005383&lan=en-US&anchor=Foreside+Fund+Services%2C+LLC&index=4&md5=f796b84cd584ff2dd173ff83bdf0542b", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180530005383/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsharespost.com%2Fdownloads%2FSharesPost-100-Prospectus-and-SOI.pdf%3Fnc%3D2&esheet=51814092&newsitemid=20180530005383&lan=en-US&anchor=download+here&index=3&md5=670b922ac4a0da386ffea08913026303"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:13:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
