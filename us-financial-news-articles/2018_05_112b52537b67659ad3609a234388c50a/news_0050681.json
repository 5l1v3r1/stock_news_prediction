The approved bill also defines passive investments, which CFIUS normally considers approvable.\nThe House Financial Services Committee is expected to consider similar amendments on Tuesday.\nSenator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate and lead sponsor of the legislation, told reporters it would be “ideal” to attach CFIUS to the defense authorization bill or some other “must-pass” legislation.\n“What we need to do is elevate everybody’s understanding of what China’s strategic long-term goals are and they are to dominate the United States economically and militarily,” said Cornyn. “They’ve got a very clear strategy for doing that and we need to wake up to that and make sure we’re responding in kind.”\nThe Senate Banking Committee voted to tack onto the bill a measure that would make it more difficult for the president to modify penalties on Chinese telecommunications companies such as ZTE Corp.\nU.S. lawmakers have expressed concern that President Donald Trump would ease tough penalties on ZTE, saying the United States should not bow to pressure from Beijing to help the smartphone maker.\nReporting by Diane Bartz; Additional reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-23T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:09:32.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
