Last year, the company enjoyed a nearly 20 percent increase in revenue to $8.35 billion.\nThe company also said it planned to increase capital spending to improve the flexibility of its plant production to around $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion for the full year, up from its previous target of $1.1 billion. It spent $1.3 billion in 2017 as it raced to increase chip manufacturing capacity.\nChief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro, who is set to retire later in 2018, said ST is taking advantage of structural growth in automotive and industrial markets and in certain favourable segments of the otherwise lacklustre smartphone market.\nThe company’s recovery and growth has been held back by weak demand in the first half of 2018 for smartphones. Analysts blamed order delays from Apple for imaging chips used in the forthcoming upgrade of the iPhone X later this year.\nThe company generates 53 percent of sales from automotive and industrial end markets, compared to its peer group, which generates only 22 percent from these favourable growth markets. By contrast, ST’s exposure to smartphones is just 18 percent of its total revenue, versus 28 percent, on average, for key peers.\n“We are ahead of the curve in the major trends,” Marco Cassis, the company’s designated sales chief, said of ST’s strong and growing share in chips used in advanced collision detection and electrification features for cars.\nSTMicroelectronics’ shares were up 2 percent in Paris at 1020 GMT, among the top performers in the blue-chip CAC-40 index. The stock is up around 13 percent year-to-date.
