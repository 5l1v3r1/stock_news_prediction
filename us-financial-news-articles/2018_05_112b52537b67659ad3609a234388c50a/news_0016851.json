At some point companies have to hire again. You cannot freeze activities indefinitely.”\nSuch an environment can benefit companies like Adecco Group that help employers find staff.\n“On the one hand for sure it helps because companies tend to hire more temporary solutions to cope with the uncertainty. But at some point you can’t wait indefinitely and you need to hire competitively and this is probably what we will see in the quarters to come. At least this will stabilise the decrease we had in the UK,” he said.\nDehaze said wage inflation was likely to continue its recent pattern, with price pressure centered on the United States and Germany at around 2 to 4 percent.\nHe said Adecco Group planned no more significant acquisitions this year after last month buying U.S.-based technology education firm General Assembly.
