A logo of Standard Chartered is displayed at the financial Central district in Hong Kong, China November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Bobby Yip\nPre-tax profit for StanChart, which focuses on Asia, Africa and the Middle East, rose to $1.26 billion in the quarter to the end of March, from $1.05 billion in the same period a year ago, helped by improvements in asset quality.\nHowever revenues — closely watched by investors who want to see growth driven by income rather than lower impairments — fell short of market expectations at $3.9 billion, despite being the bank’s best since the second quarter of 2015.\nThis underscores the challenge for StanChart in meeting its already modest targets.\n“Overall the key disappointment will be that the strong income start flagged at the full year hasn’t persisted,” said Richard Smith, analyst at KBW in London.\nThe first-quarter profit jump follows some early signs of success including a return to dividend payments, for StanChart, which has undergone a sweeping restructuring under the leadership of Chief Executive Bill Winters since 2015.\nStanChart shares rose 1 percent in London by 0745 GMT, echoing earlier gains in the lender’s Hong Kong-listed shares.\nStanChart in February unveiled a new medium-term goal of an 8 percent return on equity, as it recovers from a restructuring that saw the key profitability metric fall into the negative. It has not announced the timetable for achieving the goal. NO SHORTCUTS\nAchieving the target will involve improving income across all of the bank’s main business lines, with the first quarter showing mixed results.\nWhile income for its private banking business climbed 23 percent from the same first-quarter period a year ago, albeit off a low base, income in the key financial markets trading business rose only 2 percent.\nThat compares with record profits for the quarter posted by U.S. investment banks, which reaped bumper trading profits in the first two months of the year as investors reacted to volatility across stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.\nStanChart posted an annualized return on equity of 7.6 percent in the March quarter, compared to 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017.\n“There are no shortcuts but we are gathering momentum and gaining in confidence,” Finance Director Andy Halford told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday.\nStanChart did show continued signs of improving its balance of bad loans, with net impairment on financial assets in the quarter 29 percent lower than in the previous period.\nLosses from bad debts had plagued StanChart in the recent past, but the bank has since tightened limits on who can make decisions about such big loans and decreased internal limits for exposure to a single client.
