As many as 10 million hectares are contaminated by heavy metals, according to 2015 figures.\nWhile China aims to make 90 percent of contaminated land safe for planting by the end of 2020, it is also committed to an extensive reforestation program as well as an “ecological red line” system that will put large parts of the country out of bounds for both agriculture and industry.\nThe cabinet, the State Council, said earlier this year that it would hold local governments fully responsible for retaining and protecting arable land under their jurisdiction, and for improving food quality, with failures likely to affect promotion prospects and even result in dismissal.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:19:47.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
