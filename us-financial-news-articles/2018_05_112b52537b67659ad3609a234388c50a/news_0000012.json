Features like Clear History are a must if Facebook will ever be able to regain consumer trust and answer the myriad questions about what happens with its users data.\n“One thing I learned from my experience testifying in Congress is that I didn’t have clear enough answers to some of the questions about data,” Zuckerberg writes in the Clear History post. “We’re working to make sure these controls are clear, and we will have more to come soon.”\nThe announcement does not say when Clear History will be released.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104899855107881"], "published": "2018-05-02T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T00:02:43.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
