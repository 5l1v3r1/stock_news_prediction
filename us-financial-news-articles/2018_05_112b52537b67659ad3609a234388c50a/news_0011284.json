Total deferred revenue from annual software sales and maintenance contracts increased by 2,116 kEUR to 20,839 kEUR from 18,723 kEUR at the end of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 85.7% from 2,813 kEUR for the first quarter of 2017 to 5,224 kEUR. Net result was (183) kEUR, or 0.00 EUR per diluted share, compared to (816) kEUR, or (0.02) EUR per diluted share, over the same period last year.\nExecutive Chairman Peter Leys commented, “In the year’s opening quarter, we focused as planned on advancing the many initiatives and collaborations we have implemented in recent years to position Materialise at the heart of the additive manufacturing ecosystem. Our efforts showed particular success in Materialise Medical, where we realized revenue growth of 20% and achieved a record EBITDA margin of 17%. Our recently acquired ACTech business also turned in an excellent performance and is strengthening our multi-faceted business model. We believe we are on track to meet our financial guidance for 2018.”\nACTech\nOn October 4, 2017, we acquired ACTech, a full-service manufacturer of complex metal parts. As described in more detail below, the acquired business has increased the scope of our Materialise Manufacturing segment's operations and had a significant impact on our results of operations for the first quarter of 2018, resulting in increases to our revenues, operating expenses and net result, among other items.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 37.5% (2.4% excluding ACTech) to 43,899 kEUR (32,702 kEUR excluding ACTech) compared to 31,921 kEUR for the first quarter of 2017. Total deferred revenue from annual software sales and maintenance contracts amounted to 20,839 kEUR at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to 18,723 kEUR at the end of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 5,224 kEUR from 2,813 kEUR primarily as a result of the contribution by ACTech. Excluding ACTech, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to 2,383 kEUR. The Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue) in the first quarter was 11.9% (7.3% excluding ACTech) compared to 8.8% in the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenue from our Materialise Software segment decreased 2.9% to 8,326 kEUR for the first quarter of 2018 from 8,575 kEUR for the same quarter last year. Including deferred revenues from software sales and maintenance of 1,807 kEUR, the segment’s sales increased 7.5% compared to the prior-year period, reflecting a 26.4% increase of recurrent sales from annual and renewed licenses and maintenance fees. Segment EBITDA decreased to 2,324 kEUR from 2,993 kEUR while the segment EBITDA margin was 27.9% compared to 34.9% in the prior-year period.\nRevenue from our Materialise Medical segment increased 20.3% to 11,946 kEUR for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 9,932 kEUR for the same period in 2017. Compared to the same quarter in 2017, revenue from our medical software grew 18.1%, and revenue from medical devices and services grew 21.5%. Segment EBITDA was 2,060 kEUR compared to 314 kEUR while the segment EBITDA margin increased to 17.2% from 3.2% in the first quarter of 2017.\nRevenue from our Materialise Manufacturing segment increased 76.3% to 23,632 kEUR for the first quarter of 2018 from 13,407 kEUR for the first quarter of 2017. Segment EBITDA increased to 3,133 kEUR from 1,322 kEUR while the segment EBITDA margin increased to 13.3% from 9.9% for the same quarter in 2017. ACTech contributed revenue of 11,202 kEUR and segment EBITDA of 2,841 kEUR, with a segment EBITDA margin of 25.4%. Excluding ACTech, revenue decreased 7.3% to 12,430 kEUR and segment EBITDA decreased to 292 kEUR.\nGross profit was 23,955 kEUR, or 54.6% of total revenue, for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding ACTech, gross profit was 19,938 kEUR, or 61.0% of total revenue, compared to 18,477 kEUR, or 57.9% of total revenue, for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”) and general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses increased, in the aggregate, 19.4% to 23,374 kEUR for the first quarter of 2018 from 19,579 kEUR for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding ACTech, operating expenses increased, in the aggregate, 9.6% to 21,456 kEUR. Excluding ACTech, R&D expenses increased from 4,592 kEUR to 5,610 kEUR while S&M expenses increased from 9,608 kEUR to 9,844 kEUR and G&A expenses increased from 5,379 kEUR to 6,002 kEUR.\nNet other operating income decreased by 469 kEUR to 549 kEUR compared to 1,018 kEUR for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding ACTech, net other operating income decreased by 172 kEUR. Net other operating income consists primarily of withholding tax exemptions for qualifying researchers, development grants, partial funding of R&D projects, currency exchange results on purchase and sales transactions, and the depreciation of intangible assets from business combinations.\nOperating result increased to 1,130 kEUR from (84) kEUR for the same period prior year, primarily as a result of the contribution by ACTech. Excluding ACTech, operating result amounted to (672) kEUR. The decrease in the operating result (excluding ACTech) was the result of the 9.6% increase in operating expenses, which was offset in part by the 7.9% increase in gross profit. The operating result was also negatively affected by depreciation cost, which increased from 2,568 kEUR to 4,006 kEUR (or to 2,968 kEUR excluding ACTech).\nNet financial result was (710) kEUR compared to (142) kEUR for the prior-year period. The financial result included (167) kEUR net financial expenses related to ACTech. Excluding ACTech, the variances primarily reflected increases in the interest expense on the company’s financial debt and variances in the currency exchange rates, primarily on the portion of the company’s IPO proceeds held in U.S. dollars versus the euro. The share in loss of joint venture decreased to (103) kEUR from (389) kEUR for the same period last year.\nThe first quarter of 2018 contained income tax expense of 500 kEUR, of which 416 kEUR was related to ACTech, compared to 201 kEUR in the first quarter of 2017.\nAs a result of the above, net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was (183) kEUR (or (1,402) kEUR excluding ACTech), compared to net loss of (816) KEUR for the same period in 2017. Total comprehensive loss for the first quarter of 2018, which includes exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, was (278) kEUR compared to a loss of (694) kEUR for the same period in 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had cash and equivalents of 44,697 kEUR compared to 43,175 kEUR at December 31, 2017. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2018 was 6,200 kEUR compared to 1,603 kEUR in the same period in 2017. Net shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 was 76,631 kEUR compared to 77,515 kEUR at December 31, 2017.\n2018 Guidance\nAs detailed in the company’s year-end fiscal 2017 earnings announcement, in fiscal 2018, management expects to report consolidated revenue between 180,000 - 185,000 kEUR and Adjusted EBITDA between 22,000 – 25,000 kEUR. Management also expects the amount of deferred revenue the company generates from annual licenses and maintenance in 2018 to increase by an amount between 2,000 - 4,000 kEUR as compared to 2017.\nNon-IFRS Measure\nMaterialise uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental financial measures of its financial performance. EBITDA is calculated as net profit plus income taxes, financial expenses (less financial income), shares of loss in a joint venture and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is determined by adding non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and acquisition-related expenses of business combinations to EBITDA. Management believes these non-IFRS measures to be important measures as they exclude the effects of items which primarily reflect the impact of long-term investment and financing decisions, rather than the performance of the company's day-to-day operations. As compared to net profit, these measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in the company's business, or the charges associated with impairments. Management evaluates such items through other financial measures such as capital expenditures and cash flow provided by operating activities. The company believes that these measurements are useful to measure a company's ability to grow or as a valuation measurement. The company's calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net profit or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS. The company's presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nExchange Rate\nThis press release contains translations of certain euro amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.
