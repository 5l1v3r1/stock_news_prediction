It's going to be very difficult to overcome this level on a sustainable basis before the OPEC meeting.\"\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may decide in June to lift output to make up for reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela and in response to concerns from Washington about a rally in oil prices, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters.\nVenezuela's output has fallen amid an economic crisis, while Iran's supply is threatened by U.S. sanctions.\nThese factors have helped push Brent and WTI to multi-year highs, with Brent breaking through an $80 threshold last week for the first time since November 2014.\nOPEC and some non-OPEC major oil producers, which are scheduled to meet in Vienna next month, previously agreed to curb their combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to boost oil prices and clear a supply glut.\nGlobal inventories have been broadly falling. But commercial U.S. crude inventories rose <C-STK-T-EIA> by 5.8 million barrels in the week to May 18, beating analyst expectations for a drop of 1.6 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.\nThe premium of Brent crude over U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures neared $8 a barrel, close to its widest in three years. <CL-LCO1=R>\nInventories of gasoline rose by 1.9 million barrels in the same week, just ahead of the Memorial Day holiday in the United States which typically marks the start of the summer driving season.\nRefinery runs fell 7,000 bpd to 16.63 million bpd, 3.8 percent below the same week last year, according to the EIA data.
