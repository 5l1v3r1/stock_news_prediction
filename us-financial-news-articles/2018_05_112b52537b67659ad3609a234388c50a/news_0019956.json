One out later, Chris Young hit another solo homer, his second, to left-center.\nIt remained 2-0 until the sixth. With two outs, Young swung and missed a 1-2 pitch from Hernandez but the ball got past catcher Mike Zunino. The wild pitch allowed Young to reach first base. No. 9 hitter Rene Rivera doubled to right field, scoring Young. After Ian Kinsler walked, Bradford replaced Hernandez. On a 1-0 pitch, Trout homered to left field to double the lead.\nIn 5 2/3 innings, Hernandez allowed five runs on seven hits. He walked four and struck out five.\nOhtani allowed two runs on six hits in six-plus innings, with two walks and six strikeouts.\nThe Mariners finally got to Ohtani in the seventh. Mitch Haniger led off by grounding a ball sharply into center field and Ryon Healy followed by hitting a 3-2 pitch over the left-field wall. It was Healy’s fifth home run of the season. After a walk to Zunino, Ohtani was replaced by Jose Alvarez.\nThe Angels added two runs in the ninth. With one out, Cozart was hit by a pitch and Jabari Blash singled to left field off Mariners reliever Casey Lawrence. After Young walked to load the bases, Rivera hit a two-run single to center.\nAlvarez pitched two hitless innings of relief before Cam Bedrosian walked the bases loaded with one out in the ninth. Noe Ramirez came on and got Dee Gordon to ground into a double play on his first pitch to end the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-07T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:48:04.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
