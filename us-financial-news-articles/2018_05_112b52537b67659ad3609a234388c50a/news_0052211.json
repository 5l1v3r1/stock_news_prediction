So you should invest in a great pair of jeans, in a great cashmere sweater. You should have things that are higher quality that last.\"\nMeet the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies \"But for everything else, you should just have that on rotation and have the ability to take risks and constantly have newness and variety,\" she continued. \"And that's a subscription [to Rent the Runway].\"\nMore from CNBC Disruptor 50:\nHow we chose the 2018 CNBC Disruptor 50 innovators\nHow Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX beat Boeing to become a $28 billion aerospace juggernaut\n23andMe: Disrupting genetic testing\nRent the Runway began as a rental service for special-occasion dresses, but the company has recently expanded its offerings to include everyday clothing.
