Lavallee left CPPIB earlier this month as part of a management shake-up.\nThe infrastructure bank is courting pension funds in Canada and overseas and other investors such as sovereign wealth funds to supplement government investment in projects such as new roads and bridges.\nThe government advisory panel that recommended the bank’s creation had said it could look to raise C$4 to C$5 of private funding for every C$1 provided by taxpayers to fund projects.\nThe infrastructure bank, set up in 2017, has yet to facilitate funding for any projects.
