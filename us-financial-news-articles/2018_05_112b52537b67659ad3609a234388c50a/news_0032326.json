The Italian has previously held other financial and marketing roles within the group after she joined Omnitel Pronto Italia - which later became Vodafone Italy - in 1994.\nThe announcement came as the company reported a 1.4 percent rise in organic service revenue for its fourth quarter, beating analyst forecasts of a 1.1 percent rise.\nFull year core earnings rose 11.8 percent to 14.7 billion euros, beating guidance for \"around 10 percent\" organic growth and just ahead of analyst forecasts of 14.6 billion euros.\nFor 2019, the group forecast organic adjusted core earnings growth of between 1 and 5 percent, and free cash flow before spectrum costs of at least 5.2 billion euros, slightly down on the 2018 number of 5.4 billion euros.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:17:27.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
