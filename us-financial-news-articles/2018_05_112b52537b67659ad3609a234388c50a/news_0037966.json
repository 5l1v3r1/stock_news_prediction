They also voted to name Bruce Kobayashi, who teaches at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, to head the Bureau of Economics.\nSimons said that he was “disappointed” that the two Democratic commissioners, Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Slaughter, had turned Smith’s appointment “into a source of unnecessary controversy.”\nSome consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers had expressed concern about Smith’s appointment because of his work for the Consumer Data Industry Association, whose members include credit reporting companies like Equifax, which is under FTC scrutiny following a massive data breach last year.\nSmith, a partner at Covington and Burling, LLP, will be recused from the Equifax probe and perhaps others.\nBefore joining the law firm Covington and Burling, LLP, Smith worked for the FTC in enacting a law aimed at improving the accuracy of consumers’ credit records.\nSlaughter said that she voted against Smith because he would be recused from the Equifax probe and perhaps others.\n“I am concerned that selecting a director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection who is barred from leading on data privacy and security matters ... potentially undermines the public’s confidence in the commission’s ability to fulfill its mission,” she wrote.\nThe other FTC Democrat, Rohit Chopra, agreed.\n“The director should be our quarterback on the agency’s top priorities. But I fear our quarterback will be spending too much time on the sidelines,” he wrote.\nIn addition to the Equifax probe, the FTC is also reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 FTC consent decree over its privacy practices following allegations that Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to user data for 50 million people without users being notified.\nUber [UBER.UL] has settled with the FTC over a 2016 cyber security hack and over allegations that it misled drivers about potential earnings.\nReporting by Diane Bartz, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:50:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
