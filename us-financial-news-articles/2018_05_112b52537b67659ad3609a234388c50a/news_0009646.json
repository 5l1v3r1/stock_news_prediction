Reduced net loss from $1,213,490 ($0.02/share) for three months ended December 31, 2016 to $132,726 or ($0.00/share) for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

While we expected the move to generate savings of approximately $ 80,000 per month, the actual savings turned out to be roughly $230,000 per month as borne out by our year over year financials,” said Guy Cook, CEO of Lattice Biologics.\n“As a result, we have had our first quarter of being cash flow positive from operations, and a substantial increase in margins to 66% of revenues. Although sales are down year over year and quarter over quarter, the Company thought it would be prudent to not recognize revenues in the personal injury market until we have a clearer understanding of timeliness associated with reimbursements in this market.\n“We remain focused on higher margin products as we continue to grow the business. With the reduction in overhead and associated expenses, the Company is well positioned to grow and be profitable in 2018 and beyond,” continued Cook.\nThe Company continues to make significant improvements on the balance sheet, and is working with creditors to convert certain balances to equity for working capital purposes.\nThe Company restructured Grenville debt to favorable terms, including the conversion of $2.7 million of royalty funding into equity, reduction of interest payments on the Grenville Secured Note from 12.5% to 4.244%, and reduced remaining royalty charges from 6% to 1.25%.\nLattice Biologics maintains its commitment to honoring the gift of donation by implementing a strong quality control environment for the recovery and processing of donors. The Company has significantly increased its processing efficiencies, and has substantial inventory reserves to meet customer demand.\nAs indicated below, the Company continues efforts to diversify the sales mix across the new higher margin product lines added in 2015, 2016, and 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Year End Financial Results (all figures denoted in USD):\nThe product launches have been well received by surgeons and the Company continues to replace unprofitable legacy contracts and focus on the newer higher margin products.
