But when the Jackson camp first raised objections last week, the network defended the special as a legal work of journalism on a newsworthy subject that \"does not infringe on his estate's rights.\"\nThe network said that as a courtesy it stopped using an image of Jackson to promote the show that the estate had objected to.\nAs a work of news, the special would be entitled to fair use of excerpts of Jackson's work, but the lawsuit dismisses the idea that the documentary had any news value, calling it \"a mediocre look back at Michael Jackson's life and entertainment career.\"\nThe lawsuit says warning letters sent to Disney attorneys before the airing went unanswered.\nThe special focused on Jackson's apparent decline in the run-up to his death on June 25, 2009. The 50-year-old left behind heirs that include his mother and three children.\nJackson died of acute intoxication of propofol, a prescription anesthetic he had been taking as a sleep aid during preparations for a series of comeback concerts.\nFormer cardiologist Conrad Murray was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson a fatal dose of the drug. He served two years in jail, and his conviction was upheld in 2014.\nFollow Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton"], "published": "2018-05-30T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:43:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
