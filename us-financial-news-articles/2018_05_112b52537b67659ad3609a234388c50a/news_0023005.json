She explains.\n• Roku earnings, historically have had some notable moves after its earnings. Two quarters ago, on Roku's first quarterly earnings report as a public company, the stock soared 55 percent; last quarter it tumbled 18 percent.\n• Heading into earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, the options market's implied move is roughly 15 percent in either direction. This double-digit move is still a notable move, though less volatile than the prior two quarters.\n• The market is suggesting that investors are not expecting to see many surprises. If a surprise does indeed arise, the stock could see an outsized move.\n• For investors who believe the stock could continue to see earnings volatility similar to past reports, the options are attractive and consistent with that fundamental thesis.\nBottom line: The options market is implying Roku shares are expected to see a move of around 15 percent in either direction earnings, Gilbert said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T15:15:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
