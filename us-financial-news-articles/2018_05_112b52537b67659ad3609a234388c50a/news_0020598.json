However, exchanges only offer trading until 3:30 PM.\nStock exchanges, which have been keen to extend the trading hours for equity derivatives to allow Indian traders to hedge any event risk that arises late at night, welcomed the move.\n“This is a positive thing. It actually brings our markets in line with international market,” Vikram Limaye, chief executive of India’s biggest bourse, National Stock Exchange (NSE), told Reuters.\nNSE and its smaller rival BSE said they would look to extend trading hours and work out plans before October.\n“Globally, the derivative exchanges are already following the extended trading hours,” said Ashishkumar Chauhan, chief executive of BSE, Asia’s oldest exchange.\nStock exchanges wanting to extend trading hours will have to seek approval from SEBI with a proposal detailing their framework for issues such as risk management, settlement process and availability of manpower, the regulator said.
