The DAX (German stock index) logo is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nWhile some solid earnings updates also provided support, shares in companies with exposure to Iran fell, with plane maker Airbus and car makers Renault and PSA trading down between 0.4 and 1.7 percent.\nBy 0727 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 had risen nearly 0.2 percent, while higher crude prices helped the commodity-stocks-heavy FTSE index gain 0.4 percent.\nOil and gas was the biggest sectoral gainer, with its index up 1.5 percent at a three-year high as crude rallied after Trump’s move on Iran raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East and cast uncertainty over global oil supplies.\nShares in oil majors Total, Royal Dutch Shell and Eni were all trading up between 0.9 and 2 percent.\nBut higher oil prices weighed on travel stocks like airlines, whose sector index was also hit by a drop in Europe’s largest travel and tourism group TUI Group, as its earnings update failed to inspire.\nElsewhere, Siemens rose 4.2 percent after the German industrial giant raised its full year profit guidance, offsetting worries over exposure to Iran.\nAB Inbev gained 3 percent after a reassuring quarterly update from the world’s largest brewer.
