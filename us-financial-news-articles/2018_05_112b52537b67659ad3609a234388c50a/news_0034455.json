Tennis - ATP 1000 - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 13, 2018 Germany's Alexander Zverev celebrates winning the final against Austria's Dominic Thiem REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nThe second seed broke a nervy-looking Thiem in the opening game thanks to a double-fault and was never really challenged as he claimed his third Masters 1000 title.\nZverev, 21, broke again right at the start of the second but squandered the chance of a double-break two games later as Thiem, conqueror of Rafael Nadal in the last eight, hung on.
