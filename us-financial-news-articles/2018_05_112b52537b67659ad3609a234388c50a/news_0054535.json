Throughout my single week on the diet, I separately contemplated buying tickets to an event and ordering household supplies via Amazon, only to backtrack after realizing those purchases would break my rule.\nTo some extent, that was the point of the experiment. I wasn't able to impulsively spend $40 on a concert or $10 downloading a new Kindle book. If I had to go out of my way to buy something, I thought twice about whether it was worth the chunk of my weekly budget it would cost.\nHowever, I couldn't see myself sticking to that system long-term. Going back and forth between cash and credit was too hard to keep track of. I prefer to charge everything I can to my credit card and pay it off each month. That way I have an electronic record of every single purchase I've made. After all, i f you're not keeping a close eye on cash, it can begin to feel like Monopoly money. show chapters 3:09 PM ET Wed, 10 May 2017 | 02:35 The upsides\nFor many, going cash-only creates a helpful physical barrier to overspending. Take my colleague Kathleen Elkins, who went on a two-month-long cash diet last winter. After living on $60 a week for eight weeks, she was able to save over $1,000 .\n\"It's easy to mindlessly swipe a credit card and forget you even bought something,\" she writes. \"Try handing over physical bills and watching your money disappear right in front of your eyes. Chances are, you'll start to think longer and harder before making purchases.\"\n\"On the cash diet, I've become a much more conscious spender, buying more of what I need and less of what I want in the moment,\" she adds.\nNo matter what your method for saving is, it's helpful to have a specific goal in mind. It shifts your focus from \"I wish I could buy X now!\" to \"I'm excited to buy Y later!\"\nFor Elkins, she knew she would celebrate the end of her cash diet at Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and having a goal helped her save. \"Those $5 lattes and $2 Vitamin Waters are much less tempting when I think about all the beignets that money could buy over the course of my trip,\" she says. show chapters 6:29 PM ET Wed, 18 Jan 2017 | 02:40\nIt's the same lesson I learned when I challenged myself to rack up \"zero spend\" days in January and then lost my motivation halfway through. I realized that I needed a goal. \"The ambiguity of having more spend-free days on my calendar wasn't enough of a draw to keep me from the small impulsive purchases that drain my bank account,\" I wrote then.\nWhat failing at a second savings challenge taught me isn't that I'm bad with money. In fact, I generally make smart spending choices and I'm able to save a large chunk of my pay each month.\nRather, I've learned that you have to find the system that works for you. Just because going cash-only works for your colleague doesn't mean it's the magic answer to improving your own finances.\nI've found that it's worth it to invest time in trying different systems and figuring out which strategy will work long-term. For me, that means using credit cards responsibly and making everything automatic . I'm not ready to ditch the plastic just yet.
