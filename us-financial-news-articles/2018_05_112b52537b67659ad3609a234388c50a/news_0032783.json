He faces up to 20 years in prison on each fraud count if convicted. The SEC is seeking to recoup illegal profit, impose civil fines, and obtain an asset freeze.\nThe cases are U.S. v. Borland, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-mag-04035; and SEC v Borland et al in the same court, No. 18-04352.
