Martin Maldonado hit a solo homer, his second, and had two RBIs, Zack Cozart added two RBIs and Luis Valbuena had one for Los Angeles, which snapped its season-high five-game skid.\nJohnny Field clubbed a solo blast for his fourth homer of the year and Denard Span also had an RBI for Tampa Bay, which couldn’t build on its major league-leading win streak.\nThe Rays outscored the Angels 20-7 in winning the first three games of the series.\nTampa Bay started reliever Sergio Romo for the second straight game after the former San Francisco Giants closer struck out the side in his one-inning start during Saturday’s 5-3, series-clinching victory.\nRomo, making just his second career start in 590 games, pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings with two walks and three strikeouts in a no-decision.\nMatt Andriese (1-2) relieved Romo and gave up two unearned runs on no hits and two walks while striking out one.\nRomo walked Ian Kinsler to lead off the Angels’ first, but struck out Mike Trout and Justin Upton before inducing a groundout from Andrelton Simmons to end the inning.\nField’s solo homer to center field in the third put Tampa Bay up 1-0.\nLos Angeles took the lead with two runs in the fourth. Valbuena’s groundout scored Simmons, and Maldonado drove a sacrifice fly to center to give the Angels a 2-1 edge.\nCozart’s sacrifice flies to right in the fifth and to center in the seventh put Los Angeles up by three. Span’s RBI groundout in the eighth brought the Rays within two.\nMaldonado’s ninth-inning blast gave the Angels some insurance.\nBlake Parker struck out one in a scoreless ninth for his second save.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-21T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:36:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
