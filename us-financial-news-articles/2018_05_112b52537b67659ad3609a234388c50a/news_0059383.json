Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs fell between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent.\n“The kick-off to a shortened trading week is looking ugly as Italy’s political woes weigh heavily on the global markets,” noted Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\n“A crisis of confidence for the euro seems almost inevitable, which is fortifying the greenback and sending bond yields lower as the safety trade overrules.”\nAt 7:32 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 174 points, or 0.7 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 20 points, or 0.74 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 41.75 points, or 0.6 percent.\nAt these levels, the S&P 500 is set to open below its 100-day moving average, a key technical level.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday meetings were being held to set up a summit with North Korea and confirmed that a top North Korean official was en route to New York. The move is the latest indication that an on-again-off-again summit with Trump may go ahead.\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Federal Reserve will find it difficult to raise interest rates beyond the settings of its Japanese and European counterparts, which are still pursuing accommodative policy.\nU.S. interest rates may have already hit the “neutral” level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity and that the Fed had enough tools and policy options to respond if the U.S. economy falls into a recession, Bullard said while at a seminar in Tokyo.\nData for May consumer confidence index, due at 10:00 a.m., is likely to show a reading of 128.0.
