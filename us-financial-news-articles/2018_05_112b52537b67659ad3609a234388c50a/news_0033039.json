(Nasdaq:CDTI) (“CDTi” or “the Company”), a leader in advanced catalyst materials technology, reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMatthew Beale, CDTi’s CEO, stated, “In the first quarter of 2018, we achieved 35% gross margin, more than double that obtained in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, we reduced our operating expenses by 45% and created the path to profitability as our advanced materials business gains traction. These achievements were enabled by the successful execution of our 2017 business realignment strategy.\n“We expect to make tangible progress in both vehicle applications and fundamental catalyst design projects with OEMs and other partners during the balance of 2018. In addition, this year we expect to complete partnerships that will provide for local production of our materials in China and India. We believe that continued progress with catalyst coaters in India and China will lead to direct relationships with OEMs as they become confident of the adoption of our novel technology in the market.\n“We also realigned our Board of Directors with the nomination of two seasoned executives who will bring significant business acumen in international markets, including China and India, to support the execution of our long-term growth strategy.”\nFinancial Highlights: First Quarter 2018 compared to First Quarter 2017\nTotal revenue was $4.9 million, compared to $8.2 million. Coated catalyst revenue was $2.7 million, compared to $4.7 million. The first quarter 2018 is the last quarter in which CDTi will generate revenue from shipments to Honda. Emissions control systems revenue was $1.8 million, compared to $3.3 million. Technology and advanced materials revenue was $0.4 million, compared to $0.2 million. Gross margin was 35%, compared to 17%, primarily due to product mix which reflected the sale of the company’s 2017 DuraFit product line and final shipments to Honda. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $2.2 million, compared to $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to decreases in sales and support staff resulting from the sale of the company’s DuraFit product line and the completion of its Honda production. Net loss was $0.3 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.1 million, or $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Cash at March 31, 2018, was $2.1 million, compared to $2.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nCompany Outlook\nThe company currently expects 2018 revenue of approximately $12 million. With the implementation of local production capabilities in China and India the company believes that a growing pipeline of customers will begin to generate material revenue beginning in 2018 and accelerating into 2019.\nIn addition to materials applications generating revenue in 2018, the company expects that its materials technology will be selected by at least one global OEM for inclusion in next generation exhaust systems and that CDTi will have established at least one partnership for deployment of its Spinel™ technology in fuel cell and advanced battery applications during the year.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCDTi will host a conference call and live webcast beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today, May 14 th , to discuss its financial results and its business outlook.
