He did not disclose specific details.\nParamount is also pursuing contracts with governments in Africa to modernise and extend the life of Soviet-built equipment such as helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.\nAfrica was a big market for Soviet weapons and technology during the Cold War era.\n“We’re seeing a fair amount of interest,” Ichikowitz said.\nParamount has contracts with four or five governments in Africa to modernise Soviet-era equipment, he said, adding: “It’s substantial and has the potential to grow even more.” (Reporting by Alexander Cornwell Editing by David Goodman)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-01T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T06:09:41.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
