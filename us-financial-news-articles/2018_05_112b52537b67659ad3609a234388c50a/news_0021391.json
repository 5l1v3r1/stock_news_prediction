Consumer data is a valuable commodity, and that is one reason Google, Facebook and others let you use their platforms at no cost.\nAn Australian app maker called Unlockd thinks it has a better idea: The consumer should get a cut of this mobile-data business, in the form of rewards or other incentives. Other newcomers and smaller firms are taking a similar tack. Should this approach take off, some see it becoming a viable alternative to the ad model driving big platforms like Alphabet Inc.’s Google.\nUnlockd says that is why Google has been trying to kill it.\nThe startup, which has about 330,000 users world-wide, has sued Google in the U.K. with what amounts to an antitrust argument. It asserts that when Google threatened to remove Unlockd from the Google Play store starting late last year—a step that if taken would effectively kick the app off the Android platform—the tech giant was trying to leverage its market dominance to choke off Unlockd’s growth.\nOn Wednesday, a U.K. judge granted Unlockd an interim injunction to prevent Google from removing the app from the Google Play store, at least for its U.K. business. The Australian company said it was “confident” it will prevail at trial. Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nGoogle is all but impossible to avoid—it's also a huge collector of personal data. WSJ's David Pierce left the bubble and found many comparable apps and services. Google, the startup argues, is using that dominance to squash a potential competitor that seeks to develop a rival business model, one that better rewards consumers for allowing access to their data.\nThe case highlights a growing interest in how tech giants are managing—and extracting great wealth—from consumer data, a flashpoint last month when Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg gave testimony in Congress .\nGoogle declined to state exactly why it sought to boot Unlockd, but said it explained its concerns to the startup and outlined how the company could fix problems with its business. “Despite having agreed at the outset to comply with our product policies, they remain in infringement today,” the Alphabet unit said in a statement.\nAccording to Unlockd’s complaint, Google’s objections are tied at least in part to its policies designed to discourage apps from requiring or incentivizing users to click on an individual ad. Unlockd says Google has been enforcing its policies unfairly to limit competition and that its tactics forced the startup to postpone plans to take the company public and raise capital.\nOfficials at Unlockd are seeking an injunction and potentially damages. The company, which launched in 2014, has as one of its significant investors Lachlan Murdoch, executive co-chairman of News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal.\nIt is difficult to handicap Unlockd’s chances, given that Google has offered few details beyond its statement. But Google, and other data-marketing rivals like Twitter Inc. and Facebook, believe consumers are already duly compensated through access to hugely powerful services, in the form of free videos, social-media platforms, search functions and others.\nThe idea of paying online users as part of the online advertising process has been getting some traction in Silicon Valley and some academic circles. Some decry consumer-data exploitation with the same terms used in the labor-rights movement of years past.\n“It may be time for ‘data workers of the world [to] unite’ into a ‘data labor movement,’ ” law professors Eric Posner and Glen Weyl write in a forthcoming book titled “Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society.”\nUnlockd makes an app for wireless companies and others to brand, a product generally known as a “white label app.” Whatever the app’s branding—it has recently been marketed as Boost Dealz in the U.S.—the service is the same: users are given rewards in exchange for receiving advertisements when they unlock their smartphones. The rewards include smartphone data credits, access to entertainment content and loyalty points for prizes.\nThe Unlockd model is in effect to pay users for their online attention, an approach also taken by other online startups, including Slidejoy, Cashslide and Buzzvil. Some also have provided rewards for users who view ads. These companies didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n“Getting points to buy things and especially free time for mobile use is a powerful reward,” said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer group that promotes responsible interactive marketing practices.\nWhatever its merits, the case underscores a growing focus on whether tech industry incumbents abuse their size when pursuing business objectives. Unlockd’s complaint has yet to be made public and Mr. Chester emphasizes that he doesn’t know all the case details, but he said it appears that Google “may be using its marketplace muscle to squeeze out the competition in the mobile ad marketplace.”\nMore on Google\nHow to Keep Google From Owning Your Online Life Google Wants You to Get Off Your Phone Once In a While Heard on the Street: Google Tries to Ease Its Tech Bottleneck Write to John D.
