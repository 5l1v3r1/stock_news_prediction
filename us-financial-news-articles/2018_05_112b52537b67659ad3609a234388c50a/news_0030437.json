REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Airport operator Fraport ( FRAG.DE ) said a database system used by airlines to deploy staff went down from around 0100 to 1130 GMT on Wednesday.\n“The problem is now solved,” the spokesman said.\nIn total 70 flights of a planned 1,560 were canceled, including 23 cancellations at Frankfurt’s main airline, Lufthansa.\nLufthansa said it had to reduce the number of arrivals at the airport which meant passengers also missed connecting flights and flights were delayed as a result.\nThe affected system contains information on aircraft positions, which is used to send ground staff to planes.\n“All this had to be carried out manually during the failure,” Lufthansa said, adding that it had to ask flight crews to use radios or telephones instead.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan and Ilona Wissenbach; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:49:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
