It said the settlement had ended the matter “without any finding of fault.”\nInchcape’s previous chief executive resigned in 2015, and it has since hired new management not implicated in the overbilling, according to attorneys involved in the case.\nThe lawsuit was brought under whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by three former senior employees of Inchcape, said Janet Goldstein, one of their attorneys. The former Inchcape employees included a retired Navy Reserve intelligence officer and a former FBI special agent.\nThe lawsuit said the whistleblowers resigned after bringing the allegations of overbilling to the attention of the company’s chief executive, only to be rebuffed in their effort to stop the practice. They contacted the FBI in 2009 and helped to gather evidence, their attorneys said.\nUnder provisions of the False Claims Act that allow private citizens to share in funds recovered, the three whistleblowers will receive about $4.4 million, the Justice Department said.\nThe Navy suspended Inchcape from contracting with the U.S. government in 2013, affecting contracts worth $243 million, a Navy official said at the time. The company said it had resumed work with the Navy in 2014 under a deal ensuring proper controls were in place.\nThe action against Inchcape coincided with a Navy scandal over its dealings with another maritime services firm - Glenn Defense Marine Asia, run by Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian businessman who pleaded guilty in 2015 to bribery and defrauding the Navy.\nMore than 30 other people have been convicted or are facing charges in that case. Six admirals have been disciplined or admonished by the Navy.\nReporting by David Alexander; Editing by Leslie Adler and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:08:01.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
