(NASDAQ: ACHC) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Revenue increased 9.3% for the quarter to $742.2 million from $679.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to Acadia stockholders was $50.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $35.0 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Results for the first quarter of 2018 include a decrease in the provision for income taxes of $10.5 million primarily related to a change in the tax treatment of foreign earnings received in 2017 as more information became available about the transition tax rules of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). In addition, results for the quarter include a benefit of $0.03 per diluted share from a reduction in the tax rate to 16% from the anticipated 21%. This change is primarily attributable to the accounting treatment allowing the Company to recognize the future benefit of the disallowed interest expense under the Tax Act in 2018. The Company will continue to assess the impact of the Tax Act on its business and consolidated financial statements. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to Acadia stockholders per diluted share (“adjusted EPS”) was $0.52 for the first quarter of 2018, a 13.0% increase from $0.46 for the first quarter of 2017, which excludes the impact of the tax benefit of $10.5 million and debt extinguishment costs of $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 and transaction-related expenses of $4.8 million and $4.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. A reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial results in this release appears beginning on page 8.\n“We produced a good start to 2018 with our first quarter financial and operating results,” said Joey Jacobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acadia. “Our U.S. same facility revenue was in the range we anticipated, and our U.K. operations produced a rebound in same facility revenue for the quarter, both of which led to improved same facility margin. This growth was supported by 57 beds added to existing facilities during the first quarter. We also opened a new 64-bed facility, bringing total beds added for the quarter to 121. We continue to plan the addition of more than 800 beds to existing and new facilities during 2018.”\nThe Company’s total same facility revenue increased 5.6% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017, including a 2.0% increase in patient days and a 3.5% increase in revenue per patient day. Total same facility EBITDA margin rose 30 basis points to 24.2%. U.S. same facility revenue rose 6.1%, on a 2.0% increase in patient days and a 4.0% increase in revenue per patient day. U.S. same facility EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points to 26.3%. U.K. same facility revenue grew 4.6% for the first quarter of 2018 from the first quarter last year, including a 1.9% increase in patient days and a 2.6% increase in revenue per patient day. U.K. same facility EBITDA margin rose 30 basis points to 20.3%.\nAcadia’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $145.7 million, up 6.9% from $136.4 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAcadia today revised its financial guidance for 2018, primarily due to additional information becoming available about the Tax Act, as follows:\nRevenue for 2018 in a range of $3.04 billion to $3.08 billion; Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 in a range of $637 million to $644 million; Adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2018 in a range of $2.58 to $2.62; and An exchange rate of $1.35 per British Pound Sterling and a tax rate of approximately 16%.\nThe Company’s guidance does not include the impact of any future acquisitions or transaction-related expenses.\nEBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for equity-based compensation expense, transaction-related expenses and debt extinguishment costs. Adjusted income is defined as net income adjusted for transaction-related expenses, tax reform impact, debt extinguishment costs and income tax effect of adjustments to income.\nAcadia will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter financial results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 2, 2018. A live webcast of the conference call will be available at www.acadiahealthcare.com in the “Investors” section of the website. The webcast of the conference call will be available through May 15, 2018.\nRisk Factors\nThis news release contains .

Footnotes We have included certain financial measures in this press release, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income, which are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined under the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. We define EBITDA as net income adjusted for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, net interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for equity-based compensation expense, transaction-related expenses and debt extinguishment costs. We define Adjusted income as net income adjusted for transaction-related expenses, tax reform impact, debt extinguishment costs and income tax effect of adjustments to income. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income are supplemental measures of our performance and are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income are not measures of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. Our measurements of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income in this press release because we believe that such information is used by certain investors as measures of a company’s historical performance. We believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers of equity securities, many of which present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income when reporting their results. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share, where provided, to expected results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of transaction-related expenses and the tax effect of such expenses. (a) Represents the equity-based compensation expense of Acadia. (b) Represents transaction-related expenses incurred by Acadia related to acquisitions and integration efforts. (c) Represents debt extinguishment costs recorded in connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs. (d) Represents tax benefit related to a change in the Company’s provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (e) Represents the income tax effect of adjustments to income based on tax rates of 15.9% and 24.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006755/en/\nAcadia Healthcare Company, Inc.\nGretchen Hommrich, 615-861-6000\nDirector, Investor Relations\nSource: Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006755/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.acadiahealthcare.com%2F&esheet=51799173&newsitemid=20180501006755&lan=en-US&anchor=www.acadiahealthcare.com&index=1&md5=4550f8341935c33c869f631d66093d1d"], "published": "2018-05-02T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T02:46:16.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
