The company currently has four 0.7-bcfd liquefaction trains in service at Sabine Pass, one under construction and another, train 6, in development.\nReporting By Scott DiSavino; editing by Phil Berlowitz and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:01:10.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
