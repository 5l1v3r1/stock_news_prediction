Gross profit increased over 100% to $488,063 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, from $234,692 the same period a year ago. Gross margin grew from an average of 42% for all of 2017 to 49% for the first quarter 2018, driven by a favorable sales mix and higher service revenues. EBITDAX was $81,872 for the first quarter, (a non-GAAP measure; see reconciliation chart below). Net income was $19,743 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as higher sales and higher gross margins generated improved results, compared to a net loss of $388,664 reported in Q4 2017. The company is aggressively moving forward with its announced acquisition strategy.\nHOUSTON, May 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SMG Industries, Inc. (formerly SMG Indium Resources Ltd.) (OTCQB:SMGI) an oilfield services company headquartered in Houston, Texas announced their financial results today for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAs stated in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed May 10, 2018 with Commission, revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $998,178, an increase of $441,673, or 79%, from $556,505 for the comparable three months ended March 31, 2017, and sequentially up 50% from the previous fourth quarter 2017. These revenues included product sales of our degreasers, detergents and surfactants, service revenues from drilling rig wash crews, mechanical repair services, equipment and parts sales and rental equipment revenues. Each of these revenue streams increased for the first quarter 2018 when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by increased customer activity from increased numbers of active drilling rigs operating in our market.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, gross margins increased to 49% of sales, or $488,063, compared to $234,692, or 42% of revenues for the comparable 2017 period. The improvement in gross margins is primarily the result of operational efficiencies from higher sales volumes, a more favorable sales mix driven by higher margin, rig wash service revenues and improved supply chain economies.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $421,842, an increase of $333,623, from $88,219 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2018 was primarily due to higher costs associated with being a public reporting company including accounting and legal fees, higher wages from added managerial and service crew personnel in West Texas and increased insurance expense. Additionally, amortization of deferred financing costs was $24,505 during the first quarter 2018. No public reporting costs or related professional fees were present in the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we realized a net income of $19,743, or $0.00 per basic and diluted earnings per share. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 we realized a net income of $136,794 or $0.10 per basic and $0.09 diluted earnings per share. The net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 resulted from higher revenues generating higher gross margin and operating leverage partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses associated with becoming a publicly-traded entity and wage increases from West Texas expansion present during the first quarter 2018 not present in the first quarter 2017. The basic weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding was 9,387,325 and 1,408,276 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAs of May 10, 2018, the Company had 10,255,190 shares outstanding, no preferred shares, no warrants, or convertible securities and approximately 500,000 options outstanding which held an average exercise price of $0.47 per share.\nMatthew Flemming, Chief Executive Officer of SMGI stated, “The investments made in 2017 have shown results during the first quarter 2018. Our West Texas’ Permian Basin expansion and the move to a new larger facility in Odessa, Texas have contributed to our growth. Our first quarter revenues grew almost 50% sequentially from the previous quarter in 2017 in large part from the Permian Basin customer activity. Gross margins also improved from last year’s 42% to 49% for the first quarter 2018 benefiting from increased revenue and a favorable sales mix.” Mr. Flemming added, “We continue to actively pursue plans for acquisitions with an accretive profile and prospects for future growth with our team.”\nMr. Stephen Christian, President of MG Cleaners LLC and EVP of SMG stated, “Miracle Blue™ and other proprietary degreasers, surfactants and detergents sales were up in the first quarter 2018 as geographic distribution expanded in West Texas and New Mexico. However, we are most pleased with our service crews’ expansion utilized by customers for drilling rig wash and onsite service repairs which drove a more favorable margin mix. We anticipate other growth and expansion plans in the second quarter of 2018 in South Texas targeting Eagle Ford Shale activity.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Tables\nSMG INDUSTRIES INC.
