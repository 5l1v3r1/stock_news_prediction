A State Department official declined to comment on the details but said any changes would take effect June 11.\nThe new measures target students studying robotics, aviation and high-tech fields, according to the Associated Press, which first reported the story .\nThe orders are consistent with Mr. Trump’s national security strategy , which focuses heavily on trade practices and restricting access to American technology and identifies China and Russia as threats to U.S. power. A 67-page strategy document, unveiled in December, listed tighter visa procedures for suspected intelligence agents, including students.\nThe administration also is confronting China on trade. Officials said this week that by mid-June they would unveil a final list of $50 billion in imports from China that would be subject to tariffs unsettling negotiations between the two sides to reach a deal on trade.\nThe State Department official said most student applicants receive a visa that lasts the maximum five years. That, the official said, “is unchanged,” declining to comment on the business visas or specific types of student visas.\nIn China, a growing number of students who have been accepted at U.S. universities have already started reporting that visa applications have been delayed amid lengthier processing times.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, commenting on the new guidance on Wednesday, said that both China and the U.S. needed to make more efforts to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, which she called “very important” in a range of sectors.\n“Visa facilitation is something that is reciprocal,” she said. “We believe that it serves the interests of both sides.”\nChinese professionals and students said stricter measures were unlikely to put off applicants for now. Gloria Chyou, the Beijing-based co-founder of InitialView, which helps Chinese students submit video interviews as part of their applications, said her team hasn’t seen a drop in applicants.\nStudents now seeking to study in the U.S. have been preparing for years and already heavily invested. In the longer run, however, stricter controls may put off middling students and reduce the appeal of America’s top universities.\n“Before, U.S. was the gold standard, that’s where everyone wants to go,” Ms. Chyou said. “But in the past six months especially, people are like, what about Canada? What about Australia?”\nOne student at Beijing’s prestigious Peking University who has been accepted at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore to begin a Ph.D. in computer science this fall said he wasn’t fazed by the news.\n“It’s really inconvenient, but I’ll still go,” he said. Even if in the future, he had to reapply for a visa every year to study in the U.S., he’d still be willing, saying that for his particular area of interest—artificial intelligence—other countries weren’t as attractive.\n“But then again, Canada also has some good schools that I might think about,” he said. He declined to give his name, saying that he’d applied for his U.S. visa earlier this month and had not yet been approved.\n—Michael R.
