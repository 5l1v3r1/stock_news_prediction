It further validates our efforts to deliver safe and effective products for peripheral arterial interventions,” said XableCath President and Chief Executive Officer, Lisa Dunlea.\nThe company’s Medical Director, Steve Lauterbach, MD, commented, “We are delighted with this new FDA clearance. Interventionalists can now choose the XableCath that is best suited for their patients’ anatomy.
