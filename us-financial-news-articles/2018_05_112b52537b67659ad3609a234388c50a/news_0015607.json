Those contract awards have been the subject of protests by unsuccessful bidders at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and performance under the contract has been stayed pending the protest process. This past Thursday, May 3, 2018, the Department of Justice, on the Department of Education’s behalf, notified the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that the Department of Education has decided to cancel this procurement and, as a result, will terminate for convenience the contracts awarded to Performant and the second awardee. The notice states that the Department of Education has decided to cancel the current procurement as part of its plan to make substantial changes in the collection and administrative resolution of defaulted Federal student loans, which the Department of Education concluded would eliminate the need for this procurement.\n“We disagree with the Department of Justice’s decision, particularly given that the Department of Education held over $120 billion in defaulted student loans as of September 30, 2017. Moreover, between 2015 and 2017 over $62 billion in student loans defaulted, which coincides with the wind down of the old unrestricted contract,” stated Lisa Im, Performant’s Chief Executive Officer. “However, we will continue to stay close to this situation because default rates are going to necessitate that actions be taken before long. As a reminder, our previously stated comments regarding 2018 guidance and the snapshot of our view of Performant in 2021, which reflects a business with over $200 million of revenues and 20% EBITDA margins, excluded any potential impact of an award from the Department of Education.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nStudent lending revenues in the first quarter were $19.1 million, a decrease of 22.0% from revenues of $24.5 million in the prior year period. Guaranty Agency clients, U.S. Department of Education subcontracts and the U.S. Department of Education accounted for revenues of $17.9 million, $1.2 million and $0.0 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $22.9 million, $0.4 million and $1.2 million in the prior year period. Student loan placement volume (defined below) during the quarter totaled $0.9 billion, compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year period.\nHealthcare revenues in the first quarter were $31.3 million, up from $1.6 million in the prior year period. Medicare audit recovery revenues were $29.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of $29.0 million from the prior year period, primarily due to $27.8 million in revenues from release of liabilities on our balance sheet related to the 2009 CMS Region A contract, which terminated on January 31, 2018. The Company began work on the MSP CRC programs in February 2018, so the quarterly revenue from that contract of $0.9 million is really the result of about five weeks of activity. Commercial healthcare clients contributed revenues of $2.2 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 37.5% from the prior year period.\nOther revenues in the first quarter were $6.6 million, down from $6.9 million in the prior year period. There is a delay in the U.S. Department of Treasury contract start up, which is causing a delay of revenue from Q1 (and likely Q2) to the back half of the year. Adjusted for this contract start up delay, other revenue is up $1.7 million, or 25% versus prior year period.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $8.5 million, or $0.16 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared to net loss of $3.0 million or $(0.06) per share on a fully diluted basis in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $(3.4) million as compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.3 million, resulting in $(0.08) per share on a fully diluted basis. This compares to adjusted net loss of $1.9 million or $(0.04) per fully diluted share in the prior year period. The adjusted amounts in the most recent quarter do not reflect the $18.8 million net benefit from the release of liabilities, net of related expenses, resulting from the termination of the 2009 CMS Region A contract.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately $10.5 million.\nBusiness Outlook\n“We are gaining momentum through the first quarter and are pleased to have started our MSP CRC operations in earnest. In addition to the MSP CRC, we have a handful of other contracts that require investment before we see meaningful revenues. We believe we will continue to invest through the first half of the year, with the expectation of revenue momentum building into Q3 and Q4. While we are disappointed with the Department of Education’s short term decision to cancel the current procurement, we believe the dramatic increase in defaults from 2015 to 2017 will need to be addressed in some way by the Department. We will stay close to this situation, however, want to reiterate that we anticipate strong growth in other parts of our business. We reiterate our guidance for 2018 with revenues between $123 and $150 million, and adjusted EBITDA between $2 and $6 million,” stated Im.\nTerms used in this Press Release\nStudent Loan Placement Volume refers to the dollar volume of defaulted student loans first placed with us during the specified period by public and private clients for recovery. Placement Volume allows us to measure and track trends in the amount of inventory our clients in the student lending market are placing with us during any period. The revenue associated with the recovery of a portion of these loans may be recognized in subsequent accounting periods, which assists management in estimating future revenues and in allocating resources necessary to address current Placement Volumes.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter results today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.

These measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and accordingly reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss) to net income/(loss) determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results” table at the end of this press release. We have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss) in this press release because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss) provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss) has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items, specifically interest, tax and depreciation and amortization expenses, equity-based compensation expense and certain other non-operating expenses, that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding revenue expectations under our MSP CRC and United States Treasury contracts and our outlook for revenues and adjusted EBITDA in 2018. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections that are subject to change and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, that the contracts with our large clients may be changed or terminated unilaterally and on short notice, that our contracts with two of our largest customers, Great Lakes Higher Education and the U.S. Department of Education, have been terminated, that while our protest of Department of Education contract award decision was upheld, there is no assurance that we will receive a new contract award from the Department of Education in the future, that continuing limitations on the scope of our audit activity under our RAC contracts have significantly reduced our revenue opportunities with this client, that the amount of commissions we are required to return to CMS due to successful appeals by providers could exceed our estimated appeals reserve, that we have significant indebtedness and may not be able to avoid a breach of the covenants and other provisions of our credit agreement which would cause us to be in default, that the Company faces significant competition in all of its markets, that the U.S. federal government accounts for a significant portion of the Company's revenues, that future legislative and regulatory changes may have significant effects on the Company's business, that failure of the Company's or third parties' operating systems and technology infrastructure could disrupt the operation of the Company's business and the threat of breach of the Company's security measures or failure or unauthorized access to confidential data that the Company possesses. More information on potential factors that could affect the Company's financial condition and operating results is included from time to time in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and subsequently filed reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
