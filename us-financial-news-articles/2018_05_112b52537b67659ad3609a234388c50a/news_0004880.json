We’re starting to see and what the market is starting to realize is a combination of perhaps the peak in momentum from earnings and economic perspective, combined with late-cycle rate-rising environment.”\nAt 12:43 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 266.30 points, or 1.10 percent, at 23,896.85, the S&P 500 was down 14.11 points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,633.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 4.18 points, or 0.06 percent, at 7,062.08\nArcher Daniels Midland, one of the largest exporters of U.S. sorghum to China, said it would take a $30 million hit to its trading profit in the second quarter due to the U.S.-China trade dispute.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with a 1.3 percent drop in the industrial sector the biggest.\nThe energy sector fell 1.2 percent on the back of a more than 1 percent drop in crude oil prices as the dollar remained near a four-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve meet.\nPfizer fell 4.3 percent, the most on the Dow, after posting its biggest miss on quarterly revenue in a year, on disappointing sales of some blockbuster drugs.\nThe technology sector was the lone gainer, up 0.3 percent as Apple jumped 1.5 percent ahead of its quarterly report after the bell.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.16-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.67-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and 27 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 66 new lows.
