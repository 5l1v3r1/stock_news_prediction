Lack of feed supplies may cause millions of birds and hogs to die.\nGas stations ran out of fuel across the country, while consumers hit grocery stores in a panic in several areas, emptying shelves. Public transport and trash collection was reduced or halted across the country.\nTo win over truckers, who began the blockades on Monday to protest high fuel prices, the government also promised to extend for 30 days a 10 percent diesel price cut announced by state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA.\nShares of Petrobras, as the company is known, rose more than 2 percent in early trading after plunging 19 percent in the prior two days, as news of government subsidies softened the blow of political interference in the firm's fuel pricing.\nAuto production in Brazil, which contributes about a quarter of industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday in the latest blow to a fragile economic recovery following the worst downturn in decades.\n($1 = 3.65 reais) (Reporting by Eduardo Simões Additional reporting by Gram Slattery, Jose Roberto Gomes, Ana Mano and Brad Brooks in Sao Paulo Editing by Brad Haynes and Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T16:42:05.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
