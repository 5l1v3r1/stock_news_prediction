The acquisition of the Interests is part of a larger transaction through which Kimbell has agreed to acquire certain subsidiaries of both Haymaker Resources, LP (owned by KKR and Haymaker management) and Haymaker Minerals and Royalties LLC (owned by Haymaker management and other investors). The total combined transaction value is $404 million, to be financed with a mix of cash and KRP units.\nThe consideration for the Interests includes $126 million in cash and 6 million common units of Kimbell valued at approximately $116 million. Following the closing of the transaction, the 6 million units will represent approximately 22% of the common units of Kimbell. In addition, Kimbell announced its plans to change its tax status from a pass-through partnership to that of a taxable entity following the closing of the acquisition. Kimbell expects that the conversion to a taxable entity will enable it to target a significantly larger investor base, increase its liquidity and support its continued growth and consolidation strategy. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nDavid Rockecharlie , Member and Head of Energy Real Assets for KKR, commented, “We are pleased with the outcome in this partnership for our Energy Income and Growth Fund investors and with our continued ownership of these attractive mineral interests as an equity owner in KRP going forward.”\nKKR, through its Energy Real Assets investment strategy, has invested in and signed pending transactions to acquire over $3.4 billion in upstream oil and gas asset positions since the beginning of 2015, primarily funded with equity from the Energy Income and Growth Fund I.
