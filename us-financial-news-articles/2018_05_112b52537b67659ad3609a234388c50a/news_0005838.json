It narrowly failed to block an $8 billion merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, which it argued was unfair.\nElliott held about 7 percent shares in Samsung C&T at the time.\nYonhap added South Korean prosecutors had notified the fund’s officials of a plan to interview them, but cited a prosecution official as saying it might be difficult to question them as they are outside South Korea.\nThe Seoul prosecutors’ office did not answer calls from Reuters outside regular business hours.\nElliott has begun a legal dispute with the South Korean government over the 2015 tie-up of two Samsung affiliates, a South Korean government official said on Tuesday.\nThe U.S. fund said it was seeking to negotiate with South Korea regarding compensation for its damages from the merger.\nThe deal later became the centre of a corruption scandal that led to the arrests of former president Park Geun-hye and the heir to the Samsung empire, Jay Y. Lee last year.
