(NYSE: CLNC) (“Colony NorthStar Credit” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Colony NorthStar Credit was formed on January 31, 2018, through the combination of a select commercial real estate debt and credit real estate portfolio of Colony NorthStar, Inc. (“Colony NorthStar Investment Entities”) with substantially all of the assets and liabilities of NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“NorthStar I”), and all of the assets and liabilities of NorthStar Real Estate Income II, Inc. (“NorthStar II”). Except where stated, the financial information presented in this press release represents only the pre-merger financial information of the Colony NorthStar Investment Entities, as the accounting acquirer, on a stand-alone basis from January 1, 2018 through January 31, 2018 and the results of operations of Colony NorthStar Credit following January 31, 2018. As a result, the reported first quarter financial results are not representative of a full quarter of operating earnings since they do not include financial results of NorthStar I and NorthStar II from January 1, 2018 through January 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights and Subsequent Events\nCompleted previously announced merger to create Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate, Inc., a leading commercial real estate credit REIT Completed listing on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “CLNC” on February 1, 2018 First quarter 2018 GAAP net loss of $4.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and core earnings of $44.4 million, or $0.44 per diluted share Declared and paid a monthly dividend of $0.145 per share of class A and class B-3 common stock for February and March. The dividend represents an annualized dividend of $1.74 per share of common stock, equating to a 9.1% annualized dividend yield based on the $19.12 closing price on May 7, 2018 Secured $400 million corporate revolving credit facility Deployed $228 million of capital during the first quarter of 2018 Subsequent to quarter end, allocated approximately $300 million of total capital through closed deals or deals in advanced stages of execution Subsequent to quarter end, increased existing master repurchase facility capacity by $500 million from $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion. As of May 7, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.2 billion of excess borrowing capacity on its master repurchase facilities Subsequent to quarter end, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of class A and class B-3 common stock for April and May As of May 7, 2018, total corporate liquidity of approximately $620 million through cash-on-hand of $220 million and availability under the corporate revolving credit facility of $400 million\nKevin P. Traenkle, Chief Executive Officer of Colony NorthStar Credit commented, “We are off and running as Colony NorthStar Credit Real Estate, Inc., and could not be more excited about our future. With the merger of balance sheet assets from Colony NorthStar and two credit-focused non-traded REITs, and our successful listing on the NYSE now behind us, we are completely focused on maximizing value for our shareholder base.”\nMr. Traenkle added, “We have immediate scale and diversification and expect to leverage our global Colony NorthStar platform to accretively grow our business. We are excited by our opportunities to increase return on equity through the deployment of our substantial liquidity, the optimization of our under-levered balance sheet and the recycling of non-core assets into higher-yielding targeted asset classes. We are just scratching the surface on the Colony NorthStar Credit growth opportunity and look forward to an exciting future.”\nCommon Stock and Operating Partnership Units\nAs of May 7, 2018, the Company had approximately 127.9 million shares of class A and class B-3 common stock outstanding and the Company’s operating partnership had approximately 3.1 million operating partnership units (“OP units”) outstanding held by members other than the Company or its subsidiaries.\nDividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of class A and class B-3 common stock (the “common stock”) (i) for the monthly period ended February 28, 2018, which was paid on March 16, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 8, 2018, and (ii) for the monthly period ended March 31, 2018, which was paid on April 10, 2018, to stockholders of record on March 29, 2018.\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a monthly cash dividend of $0.145 per share of common stock (i) for the monthly period ended April 30, 2018, which will be paid on May 10, 2018, to stockholders of record on April 30, 2018, and (ii) for the monthly period ended May 31, 2018, which will be paid on June 11, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions\nCore Earnings\nWe present Core Earnings, which is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure of our performance. We believe that Core Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This supplemental financial measure helps us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and U.S. GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current portfolio and operations. We also use Core Earnings to determine the incentive fees we pay to our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see the Note 11, “Related Party Arrangements” to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-Q to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In addition, the Company believes that its investors also use Core Earnings or a comparable supplemental performance measure to evaluate and compare the performance of the Company and its peers, and as such, the Company believes that the disclosure of Core Earnings is useful to its investors.\nWe define Core Earnings as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders (or, without duplication, the owners of the common equity of our direct subsidiaries, such as our operating partnership) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the expenses incurred in connection with our formation, (iii) the incentive fee, (iv) acquisition costs from successful acquisitions, (v) depreciation and amortization, (vi) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the current quarter, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, (vii) one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and (viii) certain material non-cash income or expense items that in the judgment of management should not be included in Core Earnings. For clauses (vii) and (viii), such exclusions shall only be applied after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and after approval by a majority of our independent directors.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net income or an indication of our cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, our methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar non-GAAP supplemental financial measures, and accordingly, our reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to the Core Earnings reported by other companies.\nThe Company calculates core earnings per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, based on a weighted-average number of common shares and OP units (held by members other than the Company or its subsidiaries). For Core Earnings per share, the Company assumes the 44.4 million shares of Class B-3 common stock and the 3.1 million OP units (held by members other than the Company or its subsidiaries) were outstanding from January 1, 2018 through January 31, 2018 to reflect the standalone pre-merger financial information of the accounting acquirer. Following January 31, 2018, the Company assumes approximately 131.0 million of shares of class A common stock, class B-3 common stock and OP units (held by members other than the Company or its subsidiaries) were outstanding. This results in a weighted average share count for the period of approximately 101.7 million shares.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call to discuss the financial results on May 9, 2018 at 7:00 a.m. PT / 10:00 a.m. ET.

Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” or “potential” or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Among others, the following uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: operating costs and business disruption may be greater than expected; the Company's operating results may differ materially from the pro forma information presented in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017; the fair value of the Company's investments may be subject to uncertainties; the Company's use of leverage could hinder its ability to make distributions and may significantly impact its liquidity position; given the Company's dependence on its external manager, an affiliate of Colony NorthStar, any adverse changes in the financial health or otherwise of its manager or Colony NorthStar could hinder the Company's operating performance and return on stockholder's investment; the ability to realize substantial efficiencies as well as anticipated strategic and financial benefits; and the impact of legislative, regulatory and competitive changes. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.
