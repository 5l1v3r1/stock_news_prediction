There remained a stark gender contrast in the proportion of self-made billionaires and those with inherited wealth, although the gap has narrowed slightly over the past decade. More than half of all female billionaires in 2017 had accrued their wealth primarily through multigenerational inheritance, compared with 8% of male billionaires. And, among the female billionaire population there’s been a steady rise in the share whose net worth can be attributed both to inheritance and to self-made wealth creation, implying a greater degree of risk-taking entrepreneurialism, the census says. (veronica.dagher@wsj.com; @VeronicaDagher)\nAs the Great Depression left deep scars on those who suffered through it, the more recent Great Recession has long been expected to have long-lasting effects. New research from the St. Louis Fed says those born in the 1980s are ground zero for negative impacts from the financial crisis. It says the median family headed by someone born in the 1980s had lost 34% of the income they should have had absent the downturn. “The typical 1980s family lost ground between 2010 and 2016, falling even further behind the typical wealth life cycle. This represents a missed opportunity because asset appreciation is unlikely to be as rapid in the near future as it was during the recent period,” the bank says.
