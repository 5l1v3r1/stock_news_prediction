The carrier, a benchmark for Asiaâ€™s premium airlines, made S$893 million ($665.62 million) in the year ended March, up from S$360 million a year ago and 28 percent higher than the S$697 million average forecast from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe airline, like Hong Kong-based rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, has undertaken a three-year transformation programme designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers.
