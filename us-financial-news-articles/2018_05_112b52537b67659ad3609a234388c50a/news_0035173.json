The proposed consideration represents a value of $28.24 per common share of Cheniere Partners Holdings based on the closing price of Cheniere’s shares as of May 16, 2018. The proposed transaction is expected to be a tax-free exchange to Cheniere Partners Holdings’ shareholders.\nCheniere owns approximately 91.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cheniere Partners Holdings.\nThe proposed transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and approval of such definitive agreement and transactions contemplated thereunder by the board of directors of Cheniere, the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings, and a conflicts committee established by the board of directors of Cheniere Partners Holdings, and the consummation of the proposed transaction would be subject to customary closing conditions.
