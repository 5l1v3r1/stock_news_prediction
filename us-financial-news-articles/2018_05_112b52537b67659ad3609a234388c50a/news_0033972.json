I'm content to have two big positions that continue to do well. I think they're great companies,\" Cuban said.\nCuban may be reticent to invest in Apple, but he admires its business. He cited growth in the service business, watch business, applications and market cap as indicators of its prowess. But he also said he hadn't seen an opportunity to invest and doesn't want to risk it.\n\"[Invest] when there's blood in the streets,\" Cuban said.\n\"I would rather have a lot of cash on hand for that time when things go bad,\" Cuban added.
