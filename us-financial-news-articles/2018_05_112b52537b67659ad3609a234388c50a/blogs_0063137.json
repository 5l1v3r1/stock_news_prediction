(He's reportedly also coughing up $12 million for renovations .)\nNow, a 48,000-square-foot residence located on the edge of McLean's Great Falls Park in the D.C. suburb of McLean, Virginia, just went on sale for $62.95 million, dwarfing Bezos's buy and making this mansion the most expensive property ever to hit the market in the Washington D.C. area, according to the Washington Post . Homeview Living area at The Falls\nPreviously owned by the late James Kimsey, co-founder of AOL, the 3.2-acre estate is dubbed \"The Falls,\" since it is the only house on the Potomac River with direct views of the rapid falls.
