The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of the year, it said.\nThis cash contribution will be used to pay down FanDuel’s existing debt of $76 million and fund working capital of the combined business.\nFanDuel has 7 million registered customers across 40 states and over 40 percent of the daily format of the U.S. fantasy sports market, which has exploded online in recent years and enabled participants to spend money on contests more frequently.\nHowever fantasy sports companies have faced scrutiny from officials who questioned whether paid daily games amounted to gambling. FanDuel’s proposed merger with rival Drafting’s fell foul of regulators last year.\nIt was valued at more than $1 billion before the crackdown began.\nPaddy Power Betfair, whose shares rose sharply last week when it disclosed it was in talks with FanDuel, said the U.S. firm had revenues of $124 million last year and that the combined business’s earnings would currently be operating at broadly breakeven, before investment in sports betting.\n“We are excited to bring these two great businesses together,” FanDuel Chief Executive Matt King said.
