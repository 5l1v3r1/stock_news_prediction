Here are his reasons why.\n• Political parties reached a dramatic impasse in Italy as a platform was put forth that threatens order in the European Union and depressed the euro . Meanwhile, the yield on the Italian 2-year note shot up above the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury for the first time since late 2014 as investors fled Italian bonds.\n• European financial stocks fell sharply Tuesday, triggering a massive so-called short squeeze in U.S. Treasurys. Yields fell across the board in the U.S. as investors piled into the safe haven and perhaps covered existing short positions.\n• In the next week or so, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is likely to come out and attempt to calm the markets; a substantial relief rally will likely emerge as a result.\n• Still, the risk of credit spread contagion in the U.S. exists, and equity investors should remain aware of the continued impact on U.S. markets. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 on Tuesday both saw their largest single-day declines since April 24.\nBottom line: After a massive move in global markets to start the week, a relief rally will likely lie ahead, according to McDonald.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
