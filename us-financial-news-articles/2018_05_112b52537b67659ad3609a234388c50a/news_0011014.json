(NASDAQ: ERII) (\"Energy Recovery\" or the \"Company\"), the leader in pressure energy technology for industrial fluid flows, today announced its ended on March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Summary:\nTotal revenue of $13.8 million Product gross margin of 70% Total gross margin (1) of 76% Net loss of $0.7 million, or ($0.01) per share Adjusted net income (1) of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share\nPresident and CEO Chris Gannon remarked, \"Q1 was a solid quarter for our company. Despite softness at the top line as a result of a decrease in Oil & Gas revenue associated with our IsoBoost ® shipment, we demonstrated growth in our core Water business and we were able to generate record results in both product and total gross margin (1) . Furthermore, with the elimination of non-recurring CEO transition expenses, we generated positive Adjusted Net Income (1) of $0.3 million.\"\nMr. Gannon added, \"Our core Water business remains robust. Through the dedicated efforts of our Water team, we achieved year-over-year growth in not only the top line, but also growth in product gross margins of 370 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2017. We expect the strength of our Water business to continue throughout the balance of 2018 and into 2019.\"\nMr. Gannon continued, \"We are keenly focused on our near-term strategy of: 1) the commercialization of VorTeq™, 2) the continued growth and reinvestment in our Water business, and 3) the further development of MTeq™. We believe our focus on these key objectives will maximize our ability to deliver value to our Shareholders.\"\nMr. Gannon concluded, \"Our Engineering and Operations teams continue to make substantial progress on the development of both the VorTeq and MTeq technologies. We are focused on driving the VorTeq to commercialization as well as achieving success in the upcoming milestone test. We will provide an update during our conference call on May 3 rd 2018.\"\nRevenues\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated total revenue of $13.8 million. Total revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased by $0.7 million, or (5%), from $14.5 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Of the $0.7 million decrease in total revenue, $1.0 million was attributable to lower Oil & Gas segment revenue, offset by a $0.3 million increase in the Water segment revenue.\nThe Water segment generated total product revenue of $11.0 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $10.7 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.3 million, or 3%. This increase was due to higher original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") and aftermarket (\"AM\") shipments offset by lower mega-project (\"MPD\") shipments.\nThe Oil & Gas segment generated total revenue of $2.8 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $3.8 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.0 million or (27%). This decrease was due to lower cost-to-total cost (previously known as percentage of completion (\"PoC\")) revenue recognition associated with the sale of multiple IsoBoost systems, offset by an increase in license and development revenue. The increase in license and development revenue was primarily due to higher costs incurred according to input measures, based on changes required due to the adoption of the new revenues standard in Q1.\nGross Margin\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, product gross margin was 70.0%. Product gross margin increased by 770 basis points from 62.3% in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This increase was largely driven by favorable price and product mix. Including license and development revenue, total gross margin (1) was 76.0% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Total gross margin (1) increased by 780 basis points from 68.2% in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Water segment generated product gross margin of 70.8% for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Water segment product gross margin increased by 370 basis points, compared to 67.1% in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This increase was largely driven by favorable price and manufacturing efficiencies.\nThe Oil & Gas segment generated product gross margin of (760.0%) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 28.8% in the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This decrease was attributable to higher project costs and revenue adjustments. Including license and development revenue, the Oil & Gas segment total gross margin (1) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 96.9%.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, operating expenses were $11.8 million, an increase of $2.3 million from $9.5 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in Oil & Gas segment and corporate expenses.\nThe Water segment operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $2.2 million, $0.1 million lower than the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Oil & Gas segment operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $4.7 million, $1.4 million higher than the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This increase was driven by the Company's continued investment in research and development activities.\nThe Corporate operating expenses for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $5.0 million, $1.0 million higher than the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. This increase was chiefly driven by non-recurring expenses related to equity award modifications and recruiting fees associated with the Company's CEO transition.\nBottom Line Summary\nTo summarize the Company's financial performance, on a quarterly basis, the Company reported a net loss of $0.7 million, or ($0.01) per diluted share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\n(1)\n\"Total gross margin\" and \"Adjusted net income\" are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the discussion under headings \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nConference Call to Discuss First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nLIVE CONFERENCE CALL:\nThursday, May 3, 2018, 3:00 PM PDT / 6:00 PM EDT\nListen-only, US / Canada Toll-free: +1 877-709-8150\nListen-only, Local / International Toll: +1 201-689-8354\nAccess code: 13679038\nCONFERENCE CALL REPLAY:\nExpiration: Sunday, June 3, 2018\nUS / Canada Toll-free: +1 877-660-6853\nLocal / International Toll: +1 201-612-7415\nAccess code: 13679038\nInvestors may also access the live call or the replay over the internet at ir.energyrecovery.com .
