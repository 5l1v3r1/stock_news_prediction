The board of Rise includes rock star Bono, London-based Sudanes tycoon Mo Ibrahim and the founder of eBay, Pierre Omidyar.\nTPG said the deal was the largest of its kind in African financial technology firms.\nCellulant, which was founded in Nigeria and Kenya in 2004, offers digital payments platforms and mobile banking services aimed at those who do not have a bank account.\n“With two thirds of Africans unable to access a bank account, we believe that building a connected payments infrastructure is the foundation of solving real challenges and accelerating Africa’s growth and development,” said Ken Njoroge, Cellulant co-founder and chief executive.\nNjoroge said the new investment would enable the company to expand into new markets and to also invest in its existing operations. Cellulant will also introduce consumer-focused products, it said, without adding details.\nDigital financial services are a growing area for other firms on the continent, including Kenyan telecoms operator Safaricom, which pioneered transferring money via mobile phones with its M-Pesa platform in 2007.\nApplications created by U.S. firms now offer any Kenyan with a smartphone access to small amounts of credit.
