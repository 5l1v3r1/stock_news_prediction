It was a surprise to me - I didn’t know that this was even a possibility,” Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC shortly after the White House announced the decision.\n“It will have implications from a certainty-uncertainty perspective,” Bostic added. “There is just a lot that the business leaders that I talk to don’t know about where policy is going to be and where it is going to land. And I think this has the potential to add to that, in that these geo-political risks really do have implications for how business will take place.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:31:26.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
