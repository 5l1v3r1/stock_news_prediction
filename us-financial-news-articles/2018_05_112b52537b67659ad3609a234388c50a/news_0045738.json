In his new role, he will report directly to Mike Janssen, BCD Travel’s global chief operating officer and president of the Americas region.\n“For many years, Jorge has been focused on helping businesses achieve more with their travel programs, especially in North America. He’s established our strong presence in the region while building an incredibly strong portfolio of clients in the tech, pharmaceutical, retail and auto sectors, among others,” Janssen said. “We’re very excited to deploy his expertise and energy in an expanded role that includes oversight of our global sales efforts across all regions of the world.”\nCruz previously led sales and retention activity as senior vice president in the Americas region and managed employees and client programs from California to New York. Under his leadership, BCD strengthened alignment between regional and national teams and increased BCD’s focus on helping companies leverage travel intelligence. During his 18 years serving in senior management at BCD Travel, he has overseen operations and account management, business development, budgeting and profitability.\n“Industry consolidations, new communication technology and aggressive supplier marketing threaten to erode price transparency and drive up travel costs. My goal is to make sure that the substantial investment companies put towards travel produces the largest possible return,” Cruz said. “Whether it’s using hotel choice to strategically win over travelers, influencing spending decisions using mobile communication or adjusting sourcing based on data and analytics, we have a compelling story to share with businesses.”\nAbout BCD Travel\nBCD Travel helps companies make the most of what they spend on travel.
