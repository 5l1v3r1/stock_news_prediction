Human Development Index. Boke’s other major Bauxite miner is Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (CBG), 49 percent owned by the Guinean state and the remainder by Alcoa, Rio Tinto Alcan and Dadco.\nReporting by Saliou Samb Writing by Tim Cocks Editing by Edmund Blair\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
