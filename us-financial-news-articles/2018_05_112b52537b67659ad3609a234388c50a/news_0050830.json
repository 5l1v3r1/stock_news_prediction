The financials sector gained 0.9 percent on hopes that a bill aimed at easing rules, put in place after the financial crisis, could be passed into law as soon as this week, helping banks.\nThe energy sector advanced 0.6 percent as oil prices rose on supply concerns.\nAmong stocks, Micron jumped 6.7 percent after the compay announced a $10 billion share buyback program.\nSteel stocks gained, led by a 3.5 percent jump in AK Steel and U.S. Steel, after the United States said it would impose steep import duties on steel products that originated in China but were shipped from Vietnam to evade anti-dumping and anti-subsidy orders.\nKohl’s tumbled 6.9 percent, weighing on other retailers, after warning of slower growth in the second half of the year. Macy’s fell 3.8 percent.\nToll Brothers sank 7.5 percent after posting disappointing quarterly profit and margins, while its comments on costs hit other homebuilders. The PHLX housing index fell 1 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.52-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.
