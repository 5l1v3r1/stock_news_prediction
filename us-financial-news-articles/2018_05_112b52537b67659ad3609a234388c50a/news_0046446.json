As we went to press state television had not announced its results. But it’s safe to say that the winners were whoever Castro’s Cuba—which runs Venezuela—decided they would be.\nLast week Reuters reported that Venezuelan state-owned oil company PdVSA has purchased almost $440 million of crude in foreign markets this year and delivered it to Cuba on favorable credit terms. “Often at a loss, according to internal company documents,” the news outlet reported.\nA loss, that is, for dystopian Venezuela, where every day the population plumbs new depths of privation. Could there be better evidence that the country has been colonized by Cuba?\nMost Venezuelans gave up long ago on “elections” as the way to restore their rights. They have tried other means, going to the streets peacefully and in big numbers. Some have even taken up arms. But they are outgunned and, perhaps as important, out-surveilled by Cuban intelligence. Midlevel military dissent is no secret, but the top brass has so far quashed rebellion.\nCuban-coached repression has done its job. There were more than 12,180 political arrests between January 2014 and early April this year, according to the Venezuelan human-rights group Foro Penal. Jails and detention centers are unsafe and unsanitary and offer little or no food. Torture is common; legal representation is not. Prisoners can linger for years with no trial.\nAs the country has grown poorer and three million have fled, the regime’s power has increased. Early this month Havana’s man in Caracas predicted an Election Day landslide. “The revolution is going to record the biggest victory in its entire electoral history,” Nicolás Maduro said. He had no reason to think that it would be otherwise, even if, at best, he has the support of only about one-third of the electorate.\nMany Venezuelans pledged not to be part of an electoral process in which important opposition parties were banned and the government made it impossible for some of the nation’s most popular leaders to run. These included the former mayor of Caracas’s Chacao district, Leopoldo López, who is under house arrest; former Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, who is in exile; and a former mayor of San Cristóbal in Táchira State, Daniel Ceballos, who is rotting in a Caracas prison. Former congressman Freddy Guevara avoided arrest last summer by taking refuge in the Chilean Embassy in Caracas, where he remains.\nThe voter rolls are corrupted, there is no free press, and the national electoral council is a tool of the regime. Electronic voting machines generate fear that the vote is not secret. That possibility is scary since the government controls the food supply. Participating under these circumstances could only legitimize a sham.\nNot all who reject the Maduro machine were expected to stay home. Venezuela’s most vulnerable feel the economic hardship more than other socioeconomic groups. They don’t have the resources to flee or family abroad to support them. They depend on government rations, and many carry ruling-party identity cards as a way of getting preferred access to food. They knew they were watched. Abstention was risky; some even held out hope that the opposition could win.\nThe dictatorship expected a combination of intimidation and desperation to deliver what it wanted: enough participation to call it a contest.\nMr. Maduro’s main rival was Henri Falcón, a former chavista who broke with the regime in 2012. His candidacy created the impression of a legitimate race, generating suspicion about his motives among many Maduro opponents. But he promised to free all political prisoners and to dollarize the economy.\nIn a fair fight, Mr. Maduro would have been trounced. Oil production is less than half what it was before chavismo was born in 1999. This has produced a sharp drop in the hard currency needed to pay for imports—not only for consumption but for production. For example, farmers can’t get fertilizer, tractor parts or seeds. Domestic food supplies have fallen precipitously.\nThe meltdown goes well beyond malnutrition. Venezuela is now in economic anarchy, with the most ruthless rising to the top and grabbing whatever they can at any cost to the nation.\nOne of their ventures is stealing copper electrical cables, leaving many parts of Caracas and big cities like Maracaibo in the dark. Private trucks delivering water from a creek had been filling in for the broken-down Caracas water system in some neighborhoods. Now the regime brands those entrepreneurs “speculators” and has outlawed their operations. Expect the armed forces to take over the business. Colombian guerrillas roam the countryside with impunity while chavista militias rule the barrios.\nWho won Sunday? It doesn’t matter. The regime has pledged never to hand over power, and Mr. Maduro said during the campaign that he would “carry out armed struggle” if faced with defeat. Lucky for him, Havana’s grip on the country means it is unlikely to come to that.\nWrite to O’Grady@wsj.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/presos-politicos/165-ciudadanos-fueron-arrestados-arbitrariamente-durante-primer-trimestre_230603?mod=article_inline"], "published": "2018-05-20T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T22:59:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
