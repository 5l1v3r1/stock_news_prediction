Its newly discovered fields include the mammoth Zohr field discovered by Italy’s Eni in 2015.\nEgypt is targeting about $10 billion in foreign investment in the oil and gas sector in the 2018/19 fiscal year that begins in July, Molla said last month, matching the figure expected for the current year.
