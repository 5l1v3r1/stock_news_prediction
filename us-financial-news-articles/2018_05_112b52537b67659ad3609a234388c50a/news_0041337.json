The statement called on residents in the area to help gather details.\nRepresentatives of the company in Nigeria were not immediately available for comment.\nIt was not immediately clear whether it was the company’s country representative or the plant manager who died in the attack.\nDuring the unrest, some vehicles belonging to the firm were torched by protesters.\nCompany heads have been in discussions with the region’s authorities to boost employment opportunities.\nThe plant - Ethiopia’s largest cement producer - was inaugurated in May 2015.\nThe country remains under a state of emergency imposed in February, a day after prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned. Former army officer Abiy Ahmed has since replaced him.\nSince taking over amid the unrest that threatened the ruling coalition’s tight grip, Abiy has vowed “a new political beginning” including more democratic rights.\nThousands have been released since January, including journalists and dissidents who have been jailed for a variety of charges including terrorism.
