Trump called off the meeting last week in an unexpected letter that mixed friendly-sounding sentiments with bellicose language that hinted at possible nuclear warfare between the two nations.\nThe U.S. president blamed recent jabs by North Korea's government for his decision to cancel the gathering, but he also left the door open to talks.\nAlmost immediately, however, stakeholders – South Korea, most prominently – began an effort to salvage the summit, which was scheduled for June 12 in Singapore.\nThere are strong signals that the summit is back on track. South Korean President Moon Jae-in , meanwhile, appears to be jockeying for a seat at the table . Moon and Kim held a surprise meeting to address the potential summit with Trump.\nThe U.S. already has imposed sanctions on North Korea, although the communist dictatorship still has some means to get money from countries that have resisted the American measures. Russia has helped facilitate transactions with North Korea, the Journal said, citing U.S. and United Nations officials.\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nRead the full Wall Street Journal report here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:22:39.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
