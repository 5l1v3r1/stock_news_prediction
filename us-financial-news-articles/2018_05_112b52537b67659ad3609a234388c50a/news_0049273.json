Cargill declined to comment.\nMoacir Smaniotto, who farms 20,000 hectares (49,420 acres) in Mato Grosso, said he currently has only received 30 percent of the subsidies after taking part in the support programs.\nAnother grower, Dirceu Ogliari, said his payments were due between February and March, but he had not received payment as of last Friday. Ogliari said he sold 110,000 60-kilogram corn bags through the government programs in 2017.\nLast year, the PEP corn subsidy program ran almost weekly reverse auctions in which trading firms bid the lowest subsidy they would accept to ship corn purchased at a minimum government-set price. The separate PEPRO program allowed farmers to receive compensation for selling their corn below the government’s minimum price.
