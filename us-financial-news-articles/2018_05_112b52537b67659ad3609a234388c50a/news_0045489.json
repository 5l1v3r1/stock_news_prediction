Secondly, Karnataka elections is weighing on the markets as the outlook of the 2019 election is looking dicey,” Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities, said.\n“Political situation till 2019 could continue to be very volatile. The clarity around a party getting majority in the 2019 election is getting a little diluted,” he added.\nFinancial stocks such as HDFC Bank Ltd, which fell 1.1 percent, were among the biggest drags on the NSE index.\nMetals stocks took a hit for a fourth session, with the Nifty metal index down as much as 1.4 percent to its lowest since April 5. Tata Steel Ltd was down 1.3 percent, while Vedanta Ltd dropped 2.1 percent.\nAmong the decliners, Amara Raja Batteries Ltd posted its biggest intraday percentage loss since Nov. 15, 2016 on missing analysts expectations for March-quarter results.\nMeanwhile, shares in UltraTech Cement Ltd rose after its merger deal with Century Textiles and Industries .
