It is wise to repair the roof while the sun is shining; but when dark clouds already gather on the horizon the task becomes urgent,” Buti said.\nThe leaders are to decide in June on the path to introduce a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) and provide a backstop for a euro zone bank resolution fund in case it were to run out of money during a major banking crisis.\nThey are also expected to decide on turning the euro zone bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund with wider powers, including sovereign debt restructuring and regular monitoring of economies.\nThe Commission forecast that euro zone inflation, which the European Central Bank wants to keep below, but close to 2 percent, would accelerate to 1.6 percent in 2019 from 1.5 percent expected this year.\nEuro zone aggregated government deficit is to shrink further to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2019 from 0.7 percent seen this year and debt is to fall to 84.1 percent of GDP next year from 86.5 percent expected this year.
