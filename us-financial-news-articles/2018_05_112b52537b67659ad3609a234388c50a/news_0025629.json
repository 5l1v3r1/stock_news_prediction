All financial numbers are in U.S. dollars.\nSummary of 2018 First Quarter and Subsequent Business Highlights\nRevenues of $5.5 million, down 5%, compared to the year ago period Net income of $141,000, down 48%, compared to the year ago period Cash provided by operating activities of $256,000, compared to $316,000 in the year ago period Commenced shipment of its highly anticipated and award-winning 3.5 neck brace Commenced shipment of its award-winning DBX 2.0 helmet for bicycle use 2019 product launches and ordering patterns at international sales conferences encouraging\nLeatt CEO, Sean Macdonald said, \"Leatt continues to broaden its brand recognition and expand its global distribution channels, positioning the company for a strong 2018 and incremental growth as we continue to develop and introduce additional products to the market. In the 2018 first quarter, we added three new company-employed sales representatives in the United States, which helped drive 15% year-over-year growth in this important market. Outside the United States we saw weaker sales year-over-year partially due to the strong record stocking sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 that affected our sales to distributors this quarter. However, we are encouraged by sales growth in key areas where we have new distributors that have embraced the Leatt brand. Although our revenues may continue to fluctuate as we develop new product categories and fine tune our sales timelines, we believe that this strengthened distribution network will pay dividends as we continue to innovate and introduce new products and categories, including the award-winning 3.5 neck brace, which shipped to our customers during the 2018 first quarter, and the GPX 4.5 Helmet, both of which were winners of the Powersports Nifty 50 awards. In addition, media reaction to our new DBX 2.0 Helmet has been positive and we expect that our stable of exceptional products will help drive growth in the second-half of 2018.\"\n\"We generated cash from operations and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet,\" added Mr. Macdonald. \"I remain excited about the opportunities before Leatt and believe we are well-positioned for success.\"\n\"Leatt continues to lead the industry in terms of innovation and a focus on bio-medical and technology driven research to make extreme sports safer,\" added Founder and Chairman, Dr. Christopher Leatt. \"Our group of global athlete ambassadors are actively showcasing and promoting the technology, safety, and style of our new and existing product categories to consumers around the world.\"\nFinancial Summary\nTotal consolidated revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 decreased to $5.5 million, down 5%, compared to $5.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by an 18% decrease in Neck brace sales and a 17% decrease in Body armor sales, which were partially offset by a 51% increase in sales of Other products, parts and accessories and a 47% increase in Helmet sales, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Although the company shipped its highly anticipated and award-winning 3.5 neck brace and continued to experience increased sales of its knee brace line, neck brace sales declined compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to substantial customer inventory restocking following a period of foreign currency exchange rate pressures, which occurred during the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, gross profit was $2.8 million, or 50% of revenues, compared to $2.9 million, or 50% of revenues, for the first quarter of 2017. The company continues to generate improved gross profit margins from its helmet products, which accounted for 16% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and 10% of total consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 income from operations was $191,000 compared to $421,000 for the same period last year.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $141,000, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, compared to $272,000, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues and a 3% increase in operating expenses.\nLeatt continued to meet its working capital needs from cash on hand and internally generated cash flow from operations. At March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 million, a current ratio of 2.4:1 and there was no long-term debt.\nBusiness Outlook\nMr. Macdonald said, \"We are confident in the long-term prospects for our business and the marketability and demand for our award-winning exceptional protective gear. We reaffirm our expectations for growth for the year, with much of the growth occurring in the second-half of the year, and moving forward, as we benefit from the introduction of new product categories and the improved strength of our distribution channels around the world. In addition, we remain committed to our goal of building a global consumer brand and adding one new category per season.\"\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10 a.m. ET on Thursday, May 10, 2018, to discuss the 2018 first quarter results.\nParticipants should dial in to the call ten minutes before the scheduled time, using the following numbers: 1-877-407-9716 (U.S.A) or +1-201-493-6779 (international) to access the call.\nAudio Webcast\nThere will also be a simultaneous live webcast through the Company's website, www.leatt-corp.com .
