The body of her driver, also an Afghan national, was retrieved in March.\n“We condemn the shameful abduction and what appears to be the deliberate murder of one of our colleagues,” said Ingrid Hayden, the secretary-general’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan and acting head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).\nKidnapping, mainly for ransom targeting Afghans, has become a chronic problem in Kabul and other cities, although several foreigners have also been abducted in recent years.
