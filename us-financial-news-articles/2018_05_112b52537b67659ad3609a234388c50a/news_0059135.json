REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo ANZ Bank New Zealand said the deal to sell OnePath Life NZ would add about 5 basis points to the level 1 CET ratio of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ( ANZ.AX ).\nThe deal would generate a gain on sale of around NZ$50 million, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe transaction marks ANZ’s second disposal this month, after it sold a majority stake in a Cambodian joint venture to Japan’s J Trust ( 8508.T ).\nThis follows a trend among major Australian banks to offload non-core businesses to trim their capital requirements and simplify business structure. National Australia Bank ( NAB.AX ) said earlier this month it was looking to exit part of its wealth management arm by 2019.\nANZ New Zealand said the deal included a 20-year strategic alliance for Cigna to provide insurance to ANZ Bank customers. It added that current policy holders would continue with existing coverage.\nReporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-30T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T03:26:16.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
