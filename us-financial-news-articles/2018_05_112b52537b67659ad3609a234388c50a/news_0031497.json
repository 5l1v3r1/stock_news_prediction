(Nasdaq: FIXX), a genetic medicines company, announced today financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and highlighted recent accomplishments.\n\"Completing our initial public offering this quarter was a significant milestone for Homology and reflects the progress our team has made toward our mission,\" said Arthur Tzianabos, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Homology Medicines. \"We believe the support of new and existing shareholders, as well as our strategic collaborator, Novartis, will enable us to continue to advance our novel gene therapy and gene editing technology platform and pipeline. We are focused on completing IND-enabling studies for our lead gene therapy program in PKU, an inherited metabolic disease, with the goal of entering the clinic and reporting initial data from the study in 2019. In addition, our process development and manufacturing capabilities have progressed with high quality, reproducible and scalable processes as we build our internal GMP manufacturing facility, which is expected to be completed this year.\"\nDr. Tzianabos added, \"For our development programs, we plan to demonstrate the unique features of our dual gene therapy and gene editing platform by employing a gene therapy approach to address the unmet needs of adult patients with PKU, while advancing our novel, non-nuclease-based gene editing technology to develop a potential cure for pediatric patients. To further leverage the potential of our proprietary platform to help patients, we are moving forward with a pipeline of therapeutic candidates targeting other genetic diseases, including hemoglobinopathies, central nervous system disorders and ophthalmic conditions.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Accomplishments\nStrengthened balance sheet by completing an initial public offering (IPO) in April, with gross proceeds to Homology of $165,600,000 before underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. Homology issued 10,350,000 shares of common stock, inclusive of the underwriters' overallotment option, at an offering price of $16.00 per share. Announced upcoming presentations on Homology's gene editing and gene therapy platform at the 21st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ASGCT). Presentations will include new data on: 1) HMI-102, Homology's gene therapy development candidate for phenylketonuria (PKU) that is in IND-enabling studies; 2) results from a study of the Company's nuclease-free homologous recombination-based gene editing technology in a preclinical model of PKU; and 3) the biodistribution of Homology's novel vectors in the photoreceptor cell layers of the retina following a single local injection. Published data in the journal Human Gene Therapy Clinical Development demonstrating low prevalence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in humans to Homology's proprietary adeno-associated virus vectors isolated from human hematopoietic stem cells (AAVHSCs), indicating the vast majority of subjects may be suitable for treatment with AAVHSC-based therapeutics. Appointed two independent, experienced biotechnology and gene therapy leaders to Homology's Board of Directors: Mary Thistle, Chief of Staff of the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute; and Matthew R. Patterson, Chief Executive Officer of Audentes Therapeutics.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCollaboration revenues were $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 in connection with a strategic collaboration with Novartis. Total collaboration revenues will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of the performance of services under the collaboration agreement.\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $11.8 million, compared to $4.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and consisted of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2017. This increase of $5.2 million was due to a rise in direct research expenses including contract manufacturing costs. Additional personnel costs and expenses were related to advancing the Company's technology platform and manufacturing capabilities for both gene therapy and gene editing by investing in process development and building a manufacturing facility.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase of $1.9 million was primarily due to additional personnel and facility costs, which include direct depreciation costs, rent expense and other operating costs.\nNet loss was $10.5 million or $4.21 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million, or $2.79 per share for the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Homology had approximately $116.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding the net proceeds of $151.0 million from the Company's IPO. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, including the net proceeds from the IPO, are expected to fund operating and capital expenditures for at least the next two years. Following the closing of the IPO, there were approximately 37.4 million shares of common stock outstanding, including shares of preferred stock that converted into common stock.\nUpcoming Events\nBank of America Merrill Lynch Healthcare Conference: May 15, 2018 in Las Vegas 21st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy: May 16-19, 2018 in Chicago XVIIth International Parvovirus Workshop: June 10-14, 2018 in Miami 2018 National PKU Alliance Conference: July 5-8, 2018 in Atlanta\nAbout Homology Medicines, Inc.\nHomology Medicines, Inc. is a genetic medicines company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients suffering from rare genetic diseases with significant unmet medical needs by curing the underlying cause of the disease.
