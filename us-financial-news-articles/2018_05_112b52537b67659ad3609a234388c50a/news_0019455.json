This led to an acceleration of our U.S. Exchange same-store unit growth and drove momentum in our Dispensers, Refill and Exchange business segments. These results and our team’s executional focus around our purpose of inspiring healthier lives thru better water and our core strategies give us the confidence to raise our net sales outlook for the remainder of 2018.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet sales increased to $73.7 million from $60.7 million for the prior year quarter, with growth in all three segments. Dispensers segment net sales increased 82.6% to $13.9 million from $7.6 million for the prior year quarter, due primarily to the timing of shipments and record sell-thru of 185,000 units for the first quarter of 2018. Refill net sales increased 14.1% to $41.5 million from $36.4 million for the prior year quarter. The Refill net sales increase was primarily due to the Glacier and Primo Refill contract integration, an increase in unit volume, and price increases at certain outdoor coin-operated locations, which were implemented near the end of the first quarter. Exchange net sales increased 9.0% to $18.3 million from $16.7 million for the prior year quarter, driven by an acceleration in U.S. same-store unit growth to 9.5%.\nGross margin was 27.5% compared to 29.5% for the prior year quarter, primarily due to changes in sales mix as the Dispensers segment net sales made up a higher portion of overall sales for the first quarter of 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $9.2 million, or 12.5% as a percentage of net sales, compared to $10.5 million, or 17.4% as a percentage of net sales, for the prior year quarter. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the reduction in employee-related expenses, driven by efficiency gains related to the Glacier integration, and a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by the planned increase in marketing expenses.\nU.S. GAAP net income was $1.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $11.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 26.6% to $12.4 million, or 16.8% of net sales from $9.8 million, or 16.1% of net sales for the prior year quarter, driven by the increase in net sales and SG&A leverage as described above.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the second quarter of 2018, we expect net sales of $70.5 million to $73.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $14.7 million to $15.2 million.\nWe are raising our net sales guidance for 2018 to a range of $303.0 million to $307.0 million, compared to our previous range of $298.0 million to $302.0 million. We are reiterating our guidance for adjusted EBITDA of $61.0 million to $63.0 million, as we expect to invest the contribution from the incremental sales growth into existing and new marketing initiatives.\nWe do not provide guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA, net income, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between our forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and net income metrics without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates, which include interest expense, non-recurring and acquisition related costs. These items, among others, are not within our control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results.\nConference Call and Webcast\nWe will host a conference call to discuss these matters at 4:30 p.m. ET today, May 8, 2018. Participants from the company will be Matt Sheehan, President and Chief Executive Officer and David Mills, Chief Financial Officer.

These statements include the Company’s financial guidance and statements regarding our belief that we have a robust runway for future growth in net sales and profitability, particularly as we begin to accelerate our brand marketing activation initiatives in 2018. These statements can otherwise be identified by the use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"feel,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"project,\" “seek,” \"should,\" \"would,” “will,” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Owing to the uncertainties inherent in forward-looking statements, actual results could differ materially from those stated herein. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the loss of major retail customers of the Company or the reduction in volume or change in timing of purchases by major retail customers; the consolidation of retail customers and disruption of the retail business model; lower than anticipated consumer and retailer acceptance of and demand for the Company's products and services; difficulties realizing the anticipated benefits and synergies from the Glacier Water acquisition and managing our expanded operations following the acquisition; highly competitive environment in which we operate and the entry of a competitor with greater resources into the marketplace; competition and other business conditions in the water and water dispenser industries in general; adverse changes in the Company's relationships with its independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers in its Exchange business; the loss of key Company personnel; risks associated with the Company’s potential expansion into international markets, and the risk that the current U.S. presidential administration may implement changes to international trade relations, particularly with China, that could be harmful to our business and operations; the Company’s experiencing product liability, product recall or higher than anticipated rates of sales returns associated with product quality or safety issues; dependence on key management information systems; the Company's inability to efficiently expand operations and capacity to meet growth; the Company's inability to develop, introduce and produce new product offerings within the anticipated timeframe or at all; general economic conditions; the possible adverse effects that decreased discretionary consumer spending may have on the Company’s business; changes in the regulatory framework governing the Company's business; significant liabilities or costs associated with litigation or other legal proceedings; the possibility that our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States may be limited; the restrictions imposed upon our business as a result the restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreements; the Company’s inability to comply with its covenants in its credit facility; the possibility that we may fail to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations; the negative effects that global capital and credit market issues may have on our liquidity; the costs of borrowing on our operations as well as other risks described more fully in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 7, 2018 and its subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements reflect management's analysis as of the date of this press release. The Company does not undertake to revise these statements to reflect subsequent developments, other than in its regular, quarterly earnings releases or as otherwise required by applicable securities laws.\nUse of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its financial statements, the Company provides investors with information related to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income from continuing operations, which are not financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income (loss) from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; income tax (benefit) expense; non-cash change in fair value of warrant liability; non-cash, stock-based compensation expense; non-recurring and acquisition-related costs; and loss on disposal and impairment of property and equipment and other. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) less income tax (benefit) expense; change in fair value of warrant liability; non-cash, stock-based compensation expense; non-recurring and acquisition-related costs; and loss (gain) on disposal and impairment of property and equipment. The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Management uses these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are also presented to the Company’s Board of Directors and adjusted EBITDA is used in its credit agreements.\nNon-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-U.S. GAAP measures exclude significant expenses that are required by U.S. GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations.\nFINANCIAL TABLES TO FOLLOW\nPrimo Water Corporation Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited;
