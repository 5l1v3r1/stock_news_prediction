The year-over-year decrease is due to an increase in depreciation expense at Waikele Center attributed to the redevelopment of the Kmart space.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the company generated funds from operations (“FFO”) for common stockholders of $32.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to $28.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nFFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net loss is attached to this press release.\nLeasing\nThe portfolio leased status as of the end of the indicated quarter was as follows:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Total Portfolio Retail 96.6 % 96.8 % 96.9 % Office 94.6 % 88.4 % 89.3 % Multifamily (2) 92.7 % 91.8 % 93.4 % Mixed-Use: Retail 96.9 % 96.9 % 94.1 % Hotel 94.3 % 92.5 % 91.5 % Same-Store Portfolio Retail (1) 97.8 % 98.0 % 98.2 % Office 94.6 % 92.7 % 93.6 % Multifamily (2)(3) 92.7 % 92.1 % 93.4 % Mixed-Use: Retail 96.9 % 96.9 % 94.1 % Hotel 94.3 % 92.5 % 91.5 % (1) Same-store retail leased percentages includes the Forever 21 building at Del Monte Center which we acquired on September 1, 2017 after previously owning the underlying land.

FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nFFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net (loss) income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP.\nCash Net Operating Income\nThe company uses cash net operating income (\"NOI\") internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties. The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2) the cost of funds of the property owner, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net (loss) income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net (loss) income as computed in accordance with GAAP.\nCash NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the company's cash NOI may not be comparable to the cash NOIs of other REITs.\nAbout American Assets Trust, Inc.\nAmerican Assets Trust, Inc.
