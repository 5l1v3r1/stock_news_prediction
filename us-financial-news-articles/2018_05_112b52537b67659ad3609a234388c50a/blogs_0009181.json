Tuesday is the Labour Day holiday across Latin America, and markets in Argentina are closed Monday as well. Many traders in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were off on Monday, and those in the office said liquidity was low. \"A lot of players are just bridging the weekend with the holiday,\" said one manager at a brokerage in Rio. Alexandre Soares, a trader at Sao Paulo-based BGC Liquidez, said trading volume in Brazil on Monday should come in at around 5 billion reais ($1.43 billion), less than half the average. In that context, Latin American markets were buoyed by a solid early session on Wall Street, which benefited from a string of mergers and strong earnings. Marathon Petroleum said it would buy rival Andeavor for more than $23 billion, while Sprint Corp T-Mobile US Inc said they would merge. In Brazil, the country's largest electronics retailer Via Varejo SA, was among the biggest gainers, rising 1.7 percent as traders bought back in following a series of sessions in the red amid lukewarm results last week. Planemaker Embraer SA weighed on the country's benchmark Bovespa index, falling 3 percent after posting a loss on Friday amid weak deliveries. The equities market in copper-dependent Chile was the best performing on Monday as prices for the red metal edged up on expectations of higher demand from top consumer China. A report showed a resilient Chinese economy despite a monthly decline in manufacturing activity. By early afternoon, Chile's benchmark IPSA index climbed 0.6 percent, while Mexico's IPC gained 0.3 percent. The Bovespa was down 0.2 percent after spending most of the morning modestly in the black. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index was up 0.2 percent.\nKey Latin American stock indexes and currencies at 1519 GMT:\nStock indexes daily % YTD % Latest change change MSCI Emerging Markets 1165.42 0.79 -0.19 MSCI LatAm 2997.19 -0.48 6.49 Brazil Bovespa 86278.75 -0.19 12.93 Mexico IPC 48471.04 0.39 -1.79 Chile IPSA 5721.87 0.55 2.83 Chile IGPA 28744.61 0.57 2.73 Argentina MerVal 30006.35 1.76 -0.20 Colombia IGBC 12451.77 0.24 9.51 Venezuela IBC 22632.15 1.13 1691.74 Currencies daily % YTD % change change\nLatest\nBrazil real 3.4857 -0.70 -4.95 Mexico peso 18.7655 -0.77 4.97 Chile peso 611.8 -0.78 0.47 Colombia peso 2802.22 0.07 6.42 Peru sol 3.244 -0.25 -0.22 Argentina peso 20.5350 0.07 -9.42\n(interbank)\nArgentina peso 20.83 -0.72 -7.68\n(parallel)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T06:56:02.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
