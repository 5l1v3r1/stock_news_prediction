(Nasdaq:MNRO), a leading provider of automotive undercar repair and tire services, today announced that it has acquired Johnson City, Tennessee-based Free Service Tire Company.\nThe asset acquisition includes Free Service Tire’s 12 retail and commercial stores, four wholesale distribution centers and one retread facility, adding to Monro’s more than 130 existing retail, commercial and wholesale locations in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia.

We have been approached by many companies over the years, but it wasn’t until Monro came along that we found the right fit for our customers, our employees and our company. Monro has a tradition and business model much like ours, and I am confident that Free Service Tire’s tradition of outstanding customer service will continue under Monro’s ownership.”\nThe transaction closed on May 13, 2018, and is expected to add approximately $47 million in annualized sales, representing a sales mix of 15% service and 85% tires.\nAbout Monro, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Rochester, New York, Monro is a chain of 1,166 company-operated stores, 98 franchised locations, nine wholesale locations and three retread facilities providing automotive undercar repair and tire sales and services.
