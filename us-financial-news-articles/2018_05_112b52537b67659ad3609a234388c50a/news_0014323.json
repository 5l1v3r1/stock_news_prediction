Interest was slight from Swiss investors, especially retail, another source said.\n($1 = 0.9983 Swiss francs)\n($1 = 0.8363 euros) (Writing by Michael Shields; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T16:05:32.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
