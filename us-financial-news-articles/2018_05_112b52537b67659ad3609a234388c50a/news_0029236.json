REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin Mahathir said his coalition will have the support of 135 members of Malaysia’s 222-seat parliament, after Wednesday’s general election, and is entitled to form a government.\n“There is an urgency here, we need to form the government now, today,” Mahathir told reporters.\nMahathir’s bloc defeated the long-ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition in the Wednesday polls. The BN has ruled since Malaysia’s independence from Britain, nearly 60 years ago.\nReporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T10:24:21.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
