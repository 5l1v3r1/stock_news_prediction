(\"Foam Fabricators\"); Consummated the add-on acquisition of Rimports Inc. (\"Rimports\") by CODI's subsidiary Sterno Products, LLC (\"Sterno Products\"); Completed an offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series B Preferred Shares; Paid a first quarter 2018 cash distribution of $0.36 per share on CODI's common shares in April 2018, bringing cumulative distributions paid to $16.4352 per common share since CODI's IPO in May of 2006; Paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.453125 per share on the Company's 7.250% Series A Preferred Shares in April 2018; Subsequent to the end of the quarter, signed a credit agreement for a revolving credit facility totaling $600 million and a term loan facility in the amount of $500 million; and completed a private offering of $400 million of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due 2026.\n\"During the first quarter, we grew revenues, generated solid cash flow and provided sizeable distributions, while taking important steps to accelerate the growth and future prospects of our leading middle market businesses,\" said Elias Sabo, CEO of Compass Diversified Holdings. \"With the accretive platform acquisition of Foam Fabricators, a leading designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions, we have further strengthened our niche industrial businesses and enhanced our ability to achieve stable and growing cash flows.\"\nMr. Sabo, continued, \"We also continued to reinvest in our leading subsidiaries and capitalize on accretive add-on opportunities. In addition to our investments in a number of our branded consumer businesses in the quarter, we are pleased to have completed the accretive add-on acquisition of Rimports for Sterno Products, further strengthening the Company's leading product offerings. During the quarter, we also took steps to enhance our financial flexibility and diversify our capital structure under favorable terms, without diluting shareholders and without increasing our total debt outstanding. With approximately $500 million in liquidity, we remain well positioned to continue to execute our proven investment strategy, taking advantage of compelling and accretive acquisition opportunities for the benefit of shareholders.\"\nOperating Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, CODI generated Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $6.6 million, as compared to Cash Used in Operating Activities of $1.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. CODI reported Cash Flow (see Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) of $14.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $14.9 million for the prior year's comparable quarter. CODI's weighted average number of shares outstanding for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017 were 59.9 million.\nCash Flow for 2018 reflects year-over-year earnings growth in the Company's Advanced Circuits, Arnold Magnetics, Clean Earth, Sterno Products and Liberty Safe businesses, offset by declines at the Company's ErgoBaby, Manitoba Harvest and 5.11 businesses.\nCODI's Cash Flow is calculated after taking into account all interest expense, cash taxes paid, preferred share distributions and maintenance capital expenditures, and includes the operating results of each of our businesses for the periods during which CODI owned them. However, Cash Flow excludes the gains from monetizing interests in CODI's subsidiaries, which have totaled over $770 million since going public in 2006.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.6 million, as compared to net loss of $21.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The quarter ended March 31, 2017 included an $8.9 million impairment charge.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, CODI had approximately $46.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $559 million outstanding on its prior term loan facility and $391 million in outstanding borrowings under its prior revolving credit facility.\nIn April 2018, the Company signed a credit agreement for a revolving credit facility totaling $600 million and a term loan facility in the amount of $500 million. Under the terms of the credit agreement, CODI extended its maturities of its revolver and term loan to 2023 and 2025, respectively. In April 2018, the Company also completed a private offering of $400 million of 8.000% senior unsecured notes due 2026. The Company estimates it has approximately $500 million in net borrowing availability under its new revolver as of the closing date.\nIn March 2018, the Company completed an offering of 4,000,000 shares of 7.875% Series B Preferred Shares with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. CODI raised $96.7 million of net proceeds from the offering, which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of its prior revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Distributions\nOn April 5, 2018, CODI's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") declared a first quarter distribution of $0.36 per share on the Company's common shares (the \"Common Shares\"). The cash distribution was paid on April 26, 2018 to all holders of record of Common Shares as of April 19, 2018. Since its IPO in May of 2006, CODI has paid a cumulative distribution of $16.4352 per common share.\nThe Board also declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.453125 per share on the Company's 7.250% Series A Preferred Shares (the \"Preferred Shares\"). The distribution on the Preferred Shares covered the period from and including January 30, 2018, up to, but excluding, April 30, 2018. The distribution for such period was paid on April 30, 2018 to all holders of record of Preferred Shares as of April 15, 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss the latest corporate developments and financial results.

A number of CODI's businesses have seasonal earnings patterns. Accordingly, the Company believes that the most appropriate measure of its performance is over a trailing or expected 12-month period. We have reconciled CAD, or Cash Flow, to Net Income and Cash Flow from Operating Activities on the attached schedules. We consider Net Income and Cash Flow from Operating Activities to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to CAD, or Cash Flow.\nAbout Compass Diversified Holdings (\"CODI\")\nCODI owns and manages a diverse family of established North American middle market businesses.
