REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\nSeventy men, women and children were allowed into the crowded port of entry border crossing early Thursday morning, according to Alex Mensing, a caravan organizer with advocacy group Pueblos Sin Fronteras.\nAnother 62 migrants were still waiting for a chance to begin the asylum process, he said.\nOn Monday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions beefed up legal resources on the border, including more prosecutors and judges, to handle the groups of people from the caravan.

REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\nThroughout the caravan’s 2,000-mile (3,220-km) odyssey from southern Mexico, its mostly Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan members kept hoping they would ultimately get the chance to make their case for asylum in the United States,\nAll the while, they have known their pleas might be rejected.
