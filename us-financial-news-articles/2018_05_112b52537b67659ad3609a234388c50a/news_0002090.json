A goalkeeping howler from Sven Ulreich then allowed Benzema to tap in Madrid’s second just after the break.\nJames Rodriguez, on loan from Madrid, equalised for Bayern in the 63rd to set up a gripping finale but Real held on despite waves of pressure to become the first team since Juventus in 1998 to reach the final for three years in succession.\nThey will meet Liverpool or AS Roma in the final in Kiev on May 26, where they will bid to become the first side since Bayern in 1976 to win the competition for three straight years.

We knew how to suffer together,” Real captain Sergio Ramos told reporters. “They had more possession but overall we were better. This team deserves to be in Kiev.”\nReal rode their luck to win the first leg in Munich 2-1 after Bayern had missed a slew of chances and Zinedine Zidane’s side made the most of their few opportunities.
