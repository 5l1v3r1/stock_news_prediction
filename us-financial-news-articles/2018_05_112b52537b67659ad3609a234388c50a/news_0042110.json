About $600 million has been raised by way of fraudulent ICOs, according to the SEC. On Wednesday, the commission set up a website to teach investors what a fake ICO looks like .\n\"The SEC did adopt a responsible approach by taking their time to see what's happening with the industry,\" Neu-Ner said. \"But now we know crypto is real. We know this thing, that blockchain and crypto, isn't going away anytime soon. And now they've got to come to the party and give us some kind of regulation so we know where we stand.\" WATCH: What is an ICO? show chapters", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbcafrica.com/tag/ran-neu-ner/"], "published": "2018-05-18T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T04:42:59.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
