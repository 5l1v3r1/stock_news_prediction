REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo/File Photo The investment, BP Ventures said, is part of a push to tap into the growth in electric vehicle technologies and infrastructure.\n“Ultra-fast charging is at the heart of BP’s electrification strategy,” said Tufan Erginbilgic, chief executive at BP downstream. “We are committed to be the fuel provider of choice – no matter what car our customers drive.”\nStoreDot, which raised $60 million from Daimler in September, developed a super-fast charger for cellphones before expanding into automotives. The company says its lithium ion-based battery technology can fully charge an electric vehicle in five minutes.\nStoreDot is aiming to bring its mobile phone batteries to market as early as 2019.\nReporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:21:21.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
