Adyen has also been expanding into in-store “point of sales” payment processing.\n“This offering provides us with the freedom to keep building the company, while offering our shareholders a path to liquidity,” said chief executive and co-founder Pieter van der Does in the statement.\nCurrent Adyen backers include early and still largest investor Index Ventures, along with Iconiq Capital, the Silicon Valley fund that is an investment vehicle for the founders of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.\nIconiq bought a stake of undisclosed size in 2015 in a deal that valued the whole of Adyen at $2.3 billion. Other investors include General Atlantic, Temasek and Felicis Ventures.\nIn 2017, Adyen made adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 99 million euros, with net revenue up 38 percent to 218 million euros.\nIt processed 108 billion euros worth of transactions, up 63 percent from 2016.\nChief Commercial Officer Roelant Prince said at a press briefing last month that merchants’ need to keep up with a bewildering array of mobile payment software would ensure the company continued to grow quickly.\nHe said the company thrived in complex situations where merchants need to handle multiple forms of payments, combine in-store and online payments, and accept many currencies.
