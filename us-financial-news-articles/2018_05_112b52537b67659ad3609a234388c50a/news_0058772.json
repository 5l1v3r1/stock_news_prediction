Its one-month Lebac securities have the same rate.\n“Leftover cash does not generate income,” Galperin said. With the Mercado Fondo product, “all the balance left in digital wallets will immediately generate an income similar to that of the Lebacs.” (Reporting by Eliana Raszewski, Writing by Caroline Stauffer, Editing by Rosalba O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:45:17.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
