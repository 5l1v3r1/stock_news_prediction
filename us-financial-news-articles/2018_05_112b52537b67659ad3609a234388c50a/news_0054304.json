It was commissioned in 2003 and is due for completion by 2020.\nThe European Commission, the EU’s executive, has started to exclude Britain and its companies from sensitive future work on Galileo ahead of the country’s exit from the bloc in a year’s time.\nThe Brexit ministry declined to comment.\n$1 = 0.7483 pounds Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, editing by Estelle Shirbon\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:22:31.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
