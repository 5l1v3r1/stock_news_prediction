While we are pleased with the progress of our launch to date, we know that long-term success of XHANCE depends on successfully meeting the challenges ahead. Our team is focused on increasing the breadth and depth of prescribers, retaining patients beyond their initial trial phase, increasing the number of patients with \"low-hassle\" access to XHANCE, and on initiating a clinical program in the fourth quarter of 2018 in pursuit of an additional indication for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.”\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights\nCommercialization of XHANCE TM (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray 93mcg\nBrand Awareness\nThe Company believes that a high level of product awareness will facilitate adoption. Therefore, multiple product awareness initiatives were undertaken in the months following product approval with multi-channel efforts directed at the ENT and allergy specialty audience. Based on our recent market research, aided brand awareness amongst ENT and allergy physicians is 87 percent, which achieves the Company's objective of 85 percent awareness during the launch phase.\nPayer Coverage\nRecognizing that insurance coverage is important to product acceptance and uptake, the Company has engaged with key pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health plans estimated to represent over 80 percent of U.S. adult commercial lives. Based on currently available third-party data and our internal analyses, the Company believes approximately 74 percent of commercial lives are in a plan in which XHANCE is covered in a Tier 3 formulary position and approximately 61 percent of commercial lives are in a plan that covers XHANCE in a Tier 3 formulary position that is either unrestricted or requires a single step edit. Coverage includes commercial lives represented by two of the three largest PBMs in the U.S. Where permissible, the Company has implemented co-pay assistance and other patient affordability programs to further support patient access.\nSales Force\nThe Company has engaged approximately 80 sales personnel (through a contract sales organization) who have been trained on XHANCE and have begun interactions with targeted ENT and allergy specialists. These territory managers are deployed primarily in regions where commercial market access is expected to meet or exceed the Company’s launch target of 65 percent. The Company anticipates its launch efforts will benefit from active transitions between previously deployed clinical nurse educators and new territory managers. The Company is prepared to flexibly expand the number of territory managers based on market access and experience in the marketplace.\nXHANCE Xperience\nIn March 2018, Optinose introduced an innovative launch program, the XHANCE Xperience program, offering physicians and their patients an opportunity to gain initial experience with XHANCE. Physicians can enroll eligible patients in this program, and patients will receive up to two XHANCE prescriptions at no cost to them ($0 co-pay) while physicians will receive feedback on early patient responses to treatment. The Company believes this program will accelerate the ability of physicians to acquire positive patient treatment experiences and therefore improve demand for XHANCE during the early phases of product launch. The program launched on March 5, 2018, and as of May 4, 2018 more than 1,300 unique physicians have prescribed XHANCE and approximately 5,200 units have been dispensed to patients.\nAdditional Highlights\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue\nThe Company generated $0.9 million in net revenue through the sales of XHANCE in the three-month period ended March 31, 2018. A large majority of the revenue corresponded with the stocking of the retail distribution channel, with a portion of the revenue related to XHANCE sales through the Xperience program.\nOperating expenses and net loss\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, research and development expenses were $1.7 million and selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $28.0 million. Net loss for the period was $30.6 million, or $0.81 per share.\nCash\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $209.8 million as of March 31, 2018.\nCorporate Guidance\nResearch and development\nIn order to support a meeting planned for the next few months, Optinose has submitted questions and key elements of a draft protocol for a planned clinical trial program to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This program is planned in pursuit of the additional indication for XHANCE for \"treatment of chronic sinusitis.\" Pending FDA feedback, the Company expects to initiate the clinical program in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nThe Company believes that total operating expenses (selling, general & administrative expenses and research & development expenses) for 2018 will be in the range of $119 - $125 million.\nFinancial\nThe Company believes its current cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund its operations and debt service obligations through the end of 2019.\nCompany to Host Conference Call\nMembers of the Company’s leadership team will host a conference call and presentation to discuss financial results and corporate updates beginning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time today.\nTo participate on the conference call, please dial (866) 916-4761 from the U.S. or +1 (409) 216-6496 from outside the U.S. In addition, following the completion of the call, a telephone replay will be accessible until May 21, 2018 by dialing (855) 859-2056 from the U.S. or +1 (404) 537-3406 from outside the U.S. and entering conference ID # 6968158.
