StoreDot claims the batteries are eco-friendly and can allow an electric vehicle to travel for more than 300 miles after a full charge. StoreDot StoreDot claims its battery charging technology can charge an electric car in five minutes.\nStoreDot develops so-called \"flash batteries,\" lithium-ion batteries that it says can charge electric vehicles in a matter of minutes. The batteries are powered by organic compounds and nanomaterials.\nStoreDot is developing similar technology to charge mobile phones in five minutes. The firm wants to commercialize that product by 2019.\nBP's venture arm invested $5 million in FreeWire , a start-up that makes mobile electric car charging stations, at the start of the year.
