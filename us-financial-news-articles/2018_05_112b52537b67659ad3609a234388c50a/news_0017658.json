The index lost 0.37 percent last week, its second straight weekly fall.\n“It was a very slow market as investors are still scared and they are worried .... they don’t see that the economy has picked up and they feel its still uncertain for equity investments though there are signs of improvement in the economy,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings.\nShares of Sri Lanka Plc ended 3.1 percent lower while Ceylon Cold Stores Plc fell 1.2 percent and Lanka ORIX Leasing Plc ended 1.9 percent weaker.\nConglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc ended 0.6 percent down and Sri Lanka Telecom Plc closed 1.1 percent weaker.\nAnalysts said depreciation of the rupee also weighed on the sentiment as it is likely to dent the profits of some listed firms that rely heavily on imports.\nThe Sri Lankan rupee hit a fresh low on Wednesday on importer demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said, but recovered after the central bank intervened in the market.\nFitch Ratings has said that recent political developments in Sri Lanka have created some uncertainty over reform momentum and fiscal consolidation, and prolonged upheaval could undermine investor confidence ahead of large external debt maturities in 2019-22.\nTurnover stood at 601.6 million rupees ($3.82 million), less than this year’s daily average of 1.03 billion rupees.\nForeign investors bought a net 100.9 million rupees worth of equities on Tuesday, but the market has seen a net foreign outflow to 487 million rupees worth of equities so far this year.
