Mr. Ondaatje’s latest novel, “Warlight” (Knopf, 290 pages, $26.95) , is a thoroughly fogbound book about childhood and espionage in postwar Britain that feels its way forward with little sense of direction, creating intrigue and allure from the “mysterious cloak”—to borrow again from Monet—that covers and conceals its story.\nThat story begins by looking back to 1945, when 14-year-old Nathaniel Williams and his older sister, Rachel, learn that their parents are moving from London to Singapore for a year. The children are left under the supervision of a lodger in their house, an enigma they have nicknamed the Moth for his shy, fluttery movements. But not long after the departures, Rachel finds, hidden in the basement, the trunk that her mother packed and pretended to take overseas. She has not gone to Asia at all, they discover (though apparently their father, a traumatized veteran, has), but all that the Moth will tell them of her disappearance is that she “is away. Doing something important.”\n“We grew up protected by the arms of strangers,” Nathaniel, the book’s narrator, recalls. Along with the Moth, a gruff former boxer known as the Darter becomes a fixture in the house, eventually apprenticing Nathaniel in the illegal trades he’s cornered since the end of the war. Some of the most strange and memorable passages in “Warlight” take place at night on a barge in remote tributaries of the Thames, where the Darter and Nathaniel are smuggling greyhounds as part of a dog-racing racket.\nIt’s almost like a game of make-believe, this upbringing, with its “omissions and silences,” its peculiar band of guardians and its murky dangers. In the second half of “Warlight” Mr. Ondaatje extends the dreamlike sensation to the national stage, returning Nathaniel and Rachel’s mother to the story in an abrupt and bloody dramatic twist. From there the novel tentatively illuminates her work as a “secretive” for British Intelligence, traveling through Eastern Europe to prosecute the “unauthorized and still violent war” continued after the armistice, the records of which the government was keen to destroy. The novel, which begins as an act of “rewitnessing,” now becomes a work of imaginative reconstruction, as Nathaniel tries to piece together his mother’s past based on partial accounts and shards of discovered facts.\nHe can only get so far. Thinking about his mother’s war work, he remarks that it was all carried out invisibly, “the real motives camouflaged, the way childhood is.” Mr. Ondaatje has stepped into John le Carré’s world of spies and criminals but he has left his resolutions tantalizingly incomplete. His novel views history as a child would, in ignorance but also in innocence and wonder at the scope of its unknowns.\nIf Mr. Ondaatje is a sensitive withholder, Sergio de la Pava is the opposite, an unrestrained inserter. In the tradition of maximalists like Thomas Pynchon and William Gaddis, there is no aside he will let go unspoken, no tangent he will leave unexplored, no harangue he will leave unvented. His incredible debut, “A Naked Singularity” (2008), was self-published before being picked up by the University of Chicago Press, which meant that it was spared the usual editorial domestication process. It’s about a New York lawyer—in his day job, Mr. de la Pava is a public defender—driven insane by the cruelties and imbecilities of the criminal justice system, and surrounding that story is a glorious mess of excurses on such obsessions as boxing, quantum physics and empanadas.\nMr. de la Pava’s new book, “Lost Empress” (Pantheon, 627 pages, $29.95) , is another overstuffed portmanteau—half farce, half serious social novel, half compendium of meditations on everything from Joni Mitchell’s early albums to the superiority of football’s 4-3 defensive alignment. That’s three halves, but as with “A Naked Singularity,” “Lost Empress” feels bigger than a single book. It gives you your money’s worth.\nThe “entertainment” portion, as Mr. de la Pava labels it, centers on Nina Gill, the commissioner of the Indoor Football League and owner of one of its illustrious teams, New Jersey’s Paterson Pork, who is quixotically determined to break the NFL’s monopoly on American football by poaching its star players and organizing preposterous publicity stunts. Woven into these chapters are sketches of people interconnected by a fatal traffic accident in Paterson: a 911 dispatcher, an EMT, a doctor, the bereft son of the deceased and his relatives and neighbors, all of whom form a delicate network of chance tragedy and reverberating consequences.\nThe figure who eventually ties these parallel threads together is Nuno DeAngeles, an inmate on Rikers Island awaiting trial for a crime that at first remains undisclosed but is notorious enough to make him a marked man to the jail’s guards. Nuno reads Robert Musil, composes his own baroquely verbose trial motions (“As an initial matter, your affiant accepts that life is just another word for violent contest”) and may belong to a shadowy syndicate called the Absence. He’s the sort of character at which Mr. de la Pava uniquely excels, someone whose madness looks, from a different angle, much like genius and whose crusading moral fervor manifests itself in criminal activity.\n“Lost Empress” can feel loose and arbitrary, and it takes a while for its many moving parts to start humming. But once this monster of a book gathers momentum, it carries the reader into a teeming, complex world guided by a logic that’s never far removed from lunacy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T18:59:15.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
