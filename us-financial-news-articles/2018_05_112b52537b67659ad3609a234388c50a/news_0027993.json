U.S. equity vehicles received $4.8 billion.\nBut that was partly offset by the $1.6 billion outflow from emerging equities, the most since August 2017, as the dollar’s rise to four-month highs and expectations of more increases to U.S. interest rates caused money to leave the developing world.\nEmerging stocks have fallen almost 10 percent since the end of January, while sovereign dollar bonds’ average yield premium over Treasuries has risen by 70 basis points. .\n“EM cracks,” BAML analysts wrote. “Three percent U.S. Treasury yields, $70 per barrel oil and a rising U.S. dollar (equates to) tighter global financial conditions and deleveraging in high beta, high leverage, low liquidity assets.”\nEmerging bonds, a favoured trade before the dollar started rising in mid-April, shed $2.1 billion for their third straight week of losses - the longest negative streak since December 2016.\nEuropean stocks registered outflows of $2 billion for their ninth straight week of losses while Japanese stocks shed $400 million.\nHowever, BAML described the week as a “tentative risk-on”, noting overall inflows to equities alongside $1.2 billion of outflows from bond funds. World shares on Friday were on track to end with a weekly gain of nearly 2 percent after two weeks in the red.\nThe technology sector, meanwhile, continued to bask in the after-glow of strong first-quarter earnings for global giants such as Amazon, Facebook, Taiwan Semiconductor and Alibaba. Tech stocks took in $1.3 billion in the past week, the highest proportional share of equity inflows, the data showed.
