REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Expectations of faster-than-expected rate rises in the U.S., as well as a rapid covering of positions by investors short on the dollar, has sent the greenback to its strongest level since mid-January.\nBut the Fed left its benchmark overnight lending rate in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent as had been widely expected on Wednesday.\nAnalysts interpreted its comments on inflation as a signal the Fed may allow prices rises beyond its target, a stance that would limit the need for the central bank to embark on a more aggressive path of monetary tightening in response to recent rises in inflation.\nOn Thursday the dollar index, measured against a basket of currencies, was flat .DXY was the euro rose 0.3 percent EUR= to $1.1983, off the low of $1.1938 it fell to on Wednesday.\n“In the end it was not a major surprise for the market that the Fed left the key rate unchanged at the meeting without a press conference but made positive comments on the outlook and further rate hikes,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\n“The market will have to get used to the fact that in order to prevent an economic overheating interest rates in the U.S. will continue to rise,” they said, predicting that rate differentials between countries would have an increased bearing on currencies and could cement euro/dollar at around $1.20.\nWith the Fed’s meeting out of the way, focus is shifting to U.S. jobs data due on Friday for further indications of the strength of the economy and inflation pressures.\nFILE PHOTO: Light is cast on a U.S. one-hundred dollar bill next to a Japanese 10,000 yen note in this picture illustration shot February 28, 2013.
