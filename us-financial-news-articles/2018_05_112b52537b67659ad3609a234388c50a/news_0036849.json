The Western-backed alliance accuses the Houthis of using the port to smuggle Iranian-made weapons, accusations denied by the group and Tehran.\nThe renewed push towards Hodeidah is taking place amid increased tensions between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, which are locked in a proxy war in Yemen that has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced three million and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation.\nCivilians from Zabid, al-Jarahi, Hays and al-Khoukhah, around 100-150 km (90 miles) south of Hodeidah city, told the rights group that they and many others fled to the southern port city of Aden, where the Yemeni government has a presence.\nThe majority of the displaced said they could only fund the trip by selling their belongings, according to Amnesty.\nOne woman had a miscarriage upon arriving in Aden after what she described as a terrifying and exhausting journey, the group said, adding that the normally six-hour drive now takes three days due to checkpoints, landmines and other hazards.
