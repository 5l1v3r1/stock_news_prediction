The dollar was recently up 1.1% against the Norwegian krone and gained 1.5% against the Swedish krona. It rose 1.1% against the Polish zloty, while also notching gains against the Hungarian forint and Czech koruna.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently up 0.2% to 87.54.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T05:32:35.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
