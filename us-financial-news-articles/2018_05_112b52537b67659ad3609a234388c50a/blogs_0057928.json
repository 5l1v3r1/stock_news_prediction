Temer said the government would pay the difference between the price set by state oil company Petrobras and the reduced cost.\nTemer also said he was crafting measures to reduce some tolls and establish minimum freight rates, key demands by truckers whose shutdown has brought much of the country to a halt. Congress this week was also expected to debate various measures aimed at ending the shutdown.\nWhether the changes will be enough to get truckers back to work remains to be seen. An announced \"agreement\" between the government and transportation unions last week was ignored by thousands of truckers, who continued striking.\nWhile Temer spoke late Sunday, in Rio and Sao Paulo the banging of pots could be heard, a form of mass booing of unpopular politicians in Brazil.\nOver the last week, thousands of schools have cancelled classes, many flights have been grounded and gas stations have emptied, bringing much commerce to a halt.\nThrough it all, Temer's administration has struggled to confront the stoppage, exposing a yawning gap between politicians in the capital of Brasilia and thousands of truckers who are key to keeping Brazil running, in part because the commodity-rich nation has no significant rail or canal system to move goods.\nOn Friday, Temer said he would have the army and police use force if necessary to remove thousands of truckers who parked along highways and roads nationwide. That prompted more hackles than fear from truckers. Soldiers made no moves against truckers, though they did serve as convoys for some fuel shipments.\nOn Sunday, Gen. Eduardo Villas Boas, head of the Army, even tweeted that negotiation was the best way to avoid conflict.\nThe price of diesel has risen sharply in recent months as world oil prices have gone up and the real has devalued against the U.S. dollar.\nThe shutdown comes at a time when Brazil is struggling to recover from a deep recession and many people are furious at much of the political class because of a massive corruption scandal that involved inflated construction contracts and billions of dollars in kickbacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:36:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
