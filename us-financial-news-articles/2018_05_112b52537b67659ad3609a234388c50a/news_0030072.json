The boat had been heading to the Greek island of Lesbos, it said.\nMore than a million people entered the EU in 2015, mostly fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and Africa, marking the biggest influx of refugees and migrants into Europe since World War Two.\nSince then the main eastern Mediterranean route between Turkey and Greece has been largely shut by a deal between the EU and Ankara.\nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by David Dolan and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:08:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
