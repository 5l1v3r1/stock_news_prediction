In 2017, it exported around 700,000 tonnes of urea to markets in West African as well as North and South America.\nIndorama Fertilizer’s increased output will target the export market but also seek to boost domestic supply to drive down prices.\nNigerian farmers still use much less fertilizer than their global and African peers due to high costs, leading to low crop yields that forced the West African nation to spend around $6 billion on food imports annually.\nThe AfDB financed the building of a Indorama Fertilizer plant via a previous loan in 2013. It went online in 2016.
