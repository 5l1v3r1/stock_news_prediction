There is no guarantee the funds’ investment objectives will be achieved. These ETFs seek to generally track the investment results of indexes; however the funds may underperform, outperform or be more volatile than the referenced indexes. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fund's portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security may decline because of concerns about the issuer's ability or willingness to make such payments. For the NUSA fund, this ETF is concentrated in the financial sector . Performance of companies in the financial sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, government regulations, economic conditions, changes in interest rates and decreased liquidity in credit markets. For the NUBD fund, the strategy selects securities for inclusion based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria which may cause the fund to forgo some market opportunities available to funds that don’t use these criteria. These and other risk considerations are described in detail in the funds' prospectuses.\nBefore investing, carefully consider fund investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.
