(NYSE: GCI) (\"Gannett\" or \"company\" or \"we\" or \"our\") today reported first quarter 2018 financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018. Our first quarter 2018 comprised 90 days, one less day (Sunday) than our first quarter 2017.\n\"We are pleased with the momentum we saw this quarter in digital advertising revenues, which reached 43.6% of total advertising revenues in the quarter,\" said Robert J. Dickey, president and chief executive officer. \"Overall, first quarter results were ahead of our expectations driven by solid growth in digital advertising revenues, especially within the digital marketing services category.\"\n\"We also experienced lower than expected costs in the quarter primarily driven by favorable savings in compensation and benefits,\" said Ali Engel, senior vice president and chief financial officer. \"This quarter's strong results are a testament to our continued focus on efficiencies to drive steady cash flow, while also investing for our future. Finally, we were pleased to complete a $200 million convertible debt financing in early April that provides us continued flexibility to execute on our strategic transformation.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Consolidated Results\nOperating revenues were $723.0 million, compared to $773.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates benefited revenues by $7.5 million. Same store, day adjusted (1) operating revenues declined 7.2%, an improvement compared to the 8.8% decline in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement was due to stronger digital advertising revenue and our strategic subscriber pricing initiatives. Total digital revenues increased 9% to $255.5 million, or approximately 35% of total revenue. GAAP net losses were $0.4 million, including $14.4 million of after-tax restructuring, asset impairment charges and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA (2) totaled $55.1 million compared to $69.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Publishing Segment\nPublishing segment operating revenues were $638.7 million compared to $694.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a same store, day adjusted basis, segment revenues declined 8.6%. Same store, day adjusted print advertising revenues declined 17.2% year-over-year, an improvement from the 18.5% decline in the fourth quarter of 2017. The improvement reflects the benefit from an earlier Easter and a revenue lift associated with the redesign of our obituary sections. Digital advertising revenues increased 7.3% to $101.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. On a same store, day adjusted basis, digital advertising revenues increased 5.5%, a strong improvement from the 0.7% gain in the fourth quarter. Digital marketing services advertising revenues of $17.1 million rose 44.3%, on a same store, day adjusted basis, driven by higher client counts and higher average revenue per client. Digital media advertising revenues of $64.4 million rose 6.2%, on a same store, day adjusted basis, due to strong growth in both on- and off-platform revenues. Digital classified advertising revenues of $20.0 million fell 16.2%, on a same store, day adjusted basis, largely reflecting expected declines in the challenged employment category. Same store, day adjusted circulation revenues fell 5.1% from the prior year quarter, an improvement from the 6.7% decline in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflecting our full access subscriber pricing initiatives, offset by expected declines in single copy. Digital-only subscriber volumes grew 51.0% year-over-year and now total approximately 382,000. Publishing segment Adjusted EBITDA was $77.8 million compared to $91.7 million in the prior year quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 ReachLocal Segment\nOperating revenues were $96.5 million, up 24.4% year-over-year. The increase was attributable to the migration of Gannett clients onto the ReachLocal platform, the addition of SweetIQ, and organic growth in North America and Latin America. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.2 million, nearly doubling from the year ago level and representing a 6.4% margin as compared to 4.1% in the first quarter of 2017. Improved profitability in the quarter was driven by solid growth in average revenue per client due to more successful cross-selling and the migration of Gannett clients onto the ReachLocal platform.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Cash Flow\nNet cash flow from operating activities was approximately $65.2 million compared to $31.4 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $13.5 million, primarily for product development, technology investments, and maintenance projects. The company paid dividends of $18.1 million; there were no share repurchases. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had a cash balance of $145.9 million and $305.0 million drawn on its revolver, or net debt of $159.1 million. At the beginning of May, the company's revolver balance had been reduced to $40.0 million with proceeds from its $201.3 million convertible note offering and cash on hand.\nOutlook\nFor 2018, the company reiterates the following:\nConsolidated revenues of $2.93-3.03 billion. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA outlook of $330-340 million. Capital expenditures of $65-75 million. Depreciation and amortization of $140-150 million, excluding accelerated depreciation related to facility consolidations. The non-operating cost associated with our pension plans, recorded in other non-operating items, is currently estimated to be a credit of $5-10 million as compared to an expense of $21 million in 2017. An effective tax rate of 25-27%.\n1 The company defines same store, day adjusted revenue as same store revenue assuming 2017 first quarter results only had 90 days. 2 The company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before income taxes, interest expense, equity income, other non-operating items, restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, asset impairment charges, depreciation, amortization and other items. Because of the variability of these and other items as well as the impact of future events on these items, management is unable to reconcile without unreasonable effort the company's forecasted range of adjusted EBITDA for the full year to a comparable GAAP range. * * * *\nConference Call Information\nThe company will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss its first quarter results.

These non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures and should be read together with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\nThe company defines its non-GAAP measures as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that the company believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of our business. The company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before (1) income taxes, (2) interest expense, (3) equity income, (4) other non-operating items, (5) restructuring costs, (6) acquisition-related expenses (including certain integration expenses), (7) asset impairment charges, (8) other items (including certain business transformation costs, litigation expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawals, and gains or losses on certain investments), (9) depreciation, and (10) amortization. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that the company uses for calculating adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\"). Adjusted net income is defined as net income before the adjustments we apply in calculating adjusted EPS, as described below. We believe presenting adjusted net income is useful to enable investors to understand how we calculate adjusted EPS, which provides a useful view of the overall operation of the company's business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income. Adjusted diluted EPS is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that the company believes offers a useful view of the overall operation of our business. The company defines adjusted EPS as EPS before tax-effected (1) restructuring costs, (2) asset impairment charges, (3) acquisition-related expenses (including certain integration expenses), (4) non-operating (gains) losses, and (5) other items (including certain business transformation expenses, litigation expenses, multi-employer pension withdrawals and gains or losses on certain investments). The tax impact on these non-GAAP tax deductible adjustments is based on the estimated statutory tax rates for the United Kingdom of 19.0% and the United States of 25.5%. In addition, tax is adjusted for the impact of non-deductible acquisition costs, a tax benefit related to a worthless stock and debt deduction, tax expense associated with new tax rates in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and revaluation of a deferred tax asset associated with a deferred intercompany transaction. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is diluted EPS. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that adjusts our reported GAAP results for items that we believe are critical to the ongoing success of our business. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities as reported on the statement of cash flows less capital expenditures, which results in a figure representing free cash flow available for use in operations, additional investments, debt obligations, and returns to shareholders. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net cash from operating activities.\nThe company uses non-GAAP financial measures for purposes of evaluating its performance and liquidity. Therefore, the company believes that each of the non-GAAP measures presented provides useful information to investors by allowing them to view our businesses through the eyes of our management and Board of Directors, facilitating comparison of results across historical periods, and providing a focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of our business. Many of our peer group companies present similar non-GAAP measures to better facilitate industry comparisons.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADJUSTED EBITDA\nGannett Co., Inc. and Subsidiaries\nUnaudited, in thousands\nTable No. 5 Three months ended March 31, 2018 Publishing ReachLocal Corporate and\nOther\nConsolidated\nTotal\nNet loss (GAAP basis) $ (377 ) Benefit for income taxes (129 ) Interest expense 4,478 Other non-operating items, net (4,311 ) Operating income (loss) (GAAP basis) $ 39,165 $ (2,926 ) $ (36,578 ) $ (339 ) Depreciation and amortization 26,289 8,513 5,450 40,252 Restructuring costs 8,277 539 483 9,299 Asset impairment charges 3,756 — — 3,756 Acquisition-related items — 16 908 924 Other items 271 67 838 1,176 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP basis) $ 77,758 $ 6,209 $ (28,899 ) $ 55,068 Three months ended March 26, 2017 Publishing ReachLocal Corporate and\nOther\nConsolidated\nTotal\nNet loss (GAAP basis) $ (2,079 ) Benefit for income taxes (5,030 ) Interest expense 4,255 Other non-operating items, net 3,887 Operating income (loss) (GAAP basis) $ 43,519 $ (4,772 ) $ (37,714 ) $ 1,033 Depreciation and amortization 33,425 7,875 5,517 46,817 Restructuring costs 11,121 — 1,430 12,551 Asset impairment charges 3,778 — — 3,778 Acquisition-related items (333 ) 43 1,313 1,023 Other items 154 — 4,325 4,479 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP basis) $ 91,664 $ 3,146 $ (25,129 ) $ 69,681 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS\nGannett Co., Inc. and Subsidiaries\nUnaudited, in thousands (except per share amounts)\nTable No. 6 Three months ended March 31,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nRestructuring costs (including accelerated depreciation) $ 14,460 $ 22,332 Asset impairment charges 3,756 3,778 Acquisition-related items 924 1,023 Non-operating losses 134 158 Other items 714 1,504 Pretax impact 19,988 28,795 Income tax impact of above items (4,926 ) (11,038 ) Impact of items affecting comparability on net income $ 15,062 $ 17,757 Net loss (GAAP basis) $ (377 ) $ (2,079 ) Impact of items affecting comparability on net income (loss) 15,062 17,757 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP basis) $ 14,685 $ 15,678 Loss per share - diluted (GAAP basis) $ (0.00 ) $ (0.02 ) Impact of items affecting comparability on net income (loss) 0.13 0.16 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted (non-GAAP basis) $ 0.13 $ 0.14 Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding (GAAP basis) 112,756 113,495 Diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding (non-GAAP basis) 115,851 115,273 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION FREE CASH FLOW\nGannett Co., Inc. and Subsidiaries\nUnaudited, in thousands\nTable No. 7 Three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNet cash flow from operating activities (GAAP basis) $ 65,153 Capital expenditures (13,548 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP basis) $ 51,605\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005298/en/\nGannett Co., Inc.\nFor investor inquiries:\nStacy Cunningham, 703-854-3168\nVP, Financial Planning & Investor Relations\ninvestors@gannett.com\nor\nThe Blueshirt Group\nBrinlea Johnson\ninvestors@gannett.com\nor\nFor media inquiries:\nAmber Allman, 703-854-5358\nVice President, Corporate Events & Communications\naallman@gannett.com\nSource: Gannett Co., Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.gannett.com%2F&esheet=51801723&newsitemid=20180507005298&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.gannett.com%2F&index=1&md5=b7ad8e106785a40c92dac09d416b9abe", "http://investors.gannett.com/", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507005298/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gannett.com&esheet=51801723&newsitemid=20180507005298&lan=en-US&anchor=www.gannett.com&index=2&md5=398979e2c4a25503c5917111b6b6cfe7"], "published": "2018-05-07T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T17:57:38.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
