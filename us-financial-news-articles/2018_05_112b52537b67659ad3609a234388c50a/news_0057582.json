A spokeswoman for Veolia said the Guangdong project would focus solely on dismantling Chinese vessels in accordance with Chinese rules.\n“Industrial water treatment is developing quickly, so we have strong growth there, but the most booming activity today is hazardous waste treatment,” Frerot continued.\nThe company already has nine hazardous waste treatment plants in China, with a total capacity of 560,000 tonnes, according to Zhou Xiaohua, senior vice president, China, with another four under construction.\nFurther down the line, Veolia aims to expand into plastic recycling in China, moving into nuclear waste treatment “one day”, Frerot said.\n($1 = 0.8535 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T09:13:48.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
