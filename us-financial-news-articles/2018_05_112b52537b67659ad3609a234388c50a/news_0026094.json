He said he had filed taxes for 2016 and had received an extension for 2017.\n“My only explanation is that I failed to sufficiently prioritize my personal affairs,” he said in a statement.\nMayor Catherine Pugh said she had “full confidence” in De Sousa. “He is working to resolve this matter and has assured me that he will do so as quickly as possible,” she said in a statement.\nIf convicted, De Sousa faces up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine for each count.\nDe Sousa, a 30-year veteran of the Baltimore force, was promoted to commissioner after Pugh fired his predecessor, Kevin Davis, because of stubbornly high levels of violent crime.\nDe Sousa took over a department marred last year by the arrests on racketeering charges of officers in a gun crimes unit accused of shaking down city residents for thousands of dollars.\nBaltimore police are operating under a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department that came after investigators found officers regularly violated African-Americans’ civil rights, including through strip searches and excessive force.\nThe decree stemmed from rioting in 2015 triggered by the death of a black man, Freddie Gray, after his arrest by police.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:40:04.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
