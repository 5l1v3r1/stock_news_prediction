The average U.S. equity ETF inflow this year is just over $3 billion per week, down from $6.7 billion per week throughout 2017, based on the ICI data.\n“The last few months we’ve seen a slowdown in the ETF growth. But let’s be clear, I think year-to-date we’re over $50 billion in net inflows, so it is still at a very fast pace,” BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) Chief Executive Larry Fink said at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting on Wednesday. BlackRock manages the largest ETF lineup, both by assets and number of funds.\nFink added that some investors are using the funds to access bonds and regions beyond the United States.\nEquity mutual funds recorded withdrawals of $2.8 billion during the week, according to the ICI.\nIncluding both mutual funds and ETFs, total stock fund sales were $8.4 billion, while bond funds took in $5.2 billion, the trade group said.\nThe following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars): Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Dan Grebler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:42:29.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
