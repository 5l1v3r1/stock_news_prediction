Auticon’s shares rose in value recently after it expanded into other countries.\n“Clear dissatisfaction in the way the economy is going and emerging data around changing ecosystems have woken people up. People are seeing they can’t carry on like they are,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe amount of money going into impact investing is rising by about 18 percent a year, according to the Global Impact Investing Network, whose 2017 survey found the market was worth at least $114 billion.\nHowever Damian Payiatiakis, head of impact investing at Barclays, said the industry was still in its infancy.\n“The industry has progressed from the stage of visionary innovators and is now entering one of early adopters, but the majority of investors aren’t yet aware of or being offered this opportunity,” he said.
