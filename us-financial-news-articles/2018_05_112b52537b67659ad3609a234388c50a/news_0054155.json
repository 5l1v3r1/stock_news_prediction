Chris Stewart, said. “They literally thought a billion dollars was the value of a 14-year-old being raped in public.”\nCheston’s mother, Renatta Cheston-Thorton, filed the civil lawsuit in 2015 on behalf of her daughter. She accused the security company of negligence in their training and performance, as well as failure to keep a 14-year-old safe.\nThe guard, identified as Brandon Lamar Zachary, began serving a 20-year sentence for statutory rape in 2016, according to online prison records.\nVerdicts in the millions, or even hundreds of millions, are not uncommon, Jeff Dion, director of the National Crime Victim Bar Association, said in an email to The Associated Press. But he believes this historic verdict was clearly meant to “ send a message .”\nWhile it’s likely the security company will appeal the verdict and a judge will likely lower the awarded amount, the settlement is a symbolic win for sexual assault victims everywhere, even if it is just temporary.\n“My verdict basically shows if you stick with it and do what you need to do to get your justice, there’ll be a brighter end,” Cheston, now 20, told The New York Times .
