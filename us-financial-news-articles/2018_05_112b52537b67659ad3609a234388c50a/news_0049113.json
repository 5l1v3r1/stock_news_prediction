REUTERS/Thaier Al-Sudani The attack took place in the predominantly Shi’ite Shula district, in northwest Baghdad.\nAccording to a statement from Iraq’s National Security media center, the attacker detonated an explosive vest after he was besieged by security forces at the entrance to the Saqlawiyah park, resulting in the death and injury of “a number of civilians.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, though it bore the hallmarks of Islamic State.\nIraq declared victory over the hardline Sunni militant group in December 2017. Although the group has largely been defeated, it continues to carry out sporadic attacks and operate limited cells in the country, particularly in the north, around Iraq’s second city Mosul.\nIslamic State has claimed previous attacks against security forces and in public places in mainly Shi’ite dominated areas. Earlier this month, the group claimed a deadly gun attack in Tarmiya, an area 25 km (15 miles) north of Baghdad.\nReporting by Raya Jalabi in Baghdad and Hesham Hajali in Cairo; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:29:13.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
