Asbury has acquired Toyota of Union City and Jim Ellis Automotive has acquired Cobb County Kia.\nAAA's Owner and Operator Scott Smith stated, \"We have been very proud to represent Kia and Toyota in the Kennesaw and Union City communities. These transactions have allowed me to refinance and fund my acquisition of the remaining Atlanta locations from my long-time partner and good friend Kenny (\"Page\"). Haig Partners was able show us the value of approaching multiple targeted buyers to generate the value required to make this dream come true.\" Kenny Page says, \"Haig Partners found us great partners that will provide our employees with new opportunities and will represent the local markets well. Both Scott and I believe the team at Haig Partners was highly instrumental in managing the negotiation process and bringing the transactions to a conclusion. I am very happy for Scott in his new endeavor and look back on our years as partners with great fondness.\" Page Automotive Group and Automotive Associates of Atlanta will maintain ownership of dealerships in Florida, Maryland and Georgia.\n\"We are excited to bring Toyota of Union City into our Nalley platform in metro Atlanta.

We would like to congratulate Jim Ellis and Asbury for acquiring dealerships in the robust Atlanta market,\" said Nate Klebacha.
