Baird & Co in Sarasota, Florida.\n“Even from an overbought situation, the markets were a touch vulnerable and perhaps these rate rises was enough to trigger that.”\nShares of retailers including J. C. Penney, Target and Macy’s rose between 1.6 percent to 3.9 percent.\nHowever, losses were broad based with ten of the 11 major S&P sectors in the red. The S&P financial was the only sector posting a slight gain of 0.1 percent.\nHome Depot Inc slipped 1.7 percent after the No.1 U.S. home improvement chain missed Wall Street forecasts for sales at established stores.\nSmaller rival Lowe’s was down 0.6 percent.\nAt 11:09 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 198.21 points, or 0.80 percent, at 24,701.20, the S&P 500 was down 19.73 points, or 0.72 percent, at 2,710.40 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 71.11 points, or 0.96 percent, at 7,340.20.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.02-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.18-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 3 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 49 new highs and 34 new lows.\nReporting by Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Arun Koyyur\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
