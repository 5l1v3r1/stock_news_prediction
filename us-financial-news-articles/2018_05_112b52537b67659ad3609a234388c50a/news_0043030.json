(Nasdaq:PS), an enterprise software company committed to closing the global technology skills gap, visited the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square today in celebration of its initial public offering (IPO) on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\nPluralsight, Inc. (Nasdaq: PS), an enterprise software company committed to closing the global technology skills gap, visits the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square in celebration of its initial public offering (IPO).\nPluralsight, Inc. (Nasdaq: PS), an enterprise software company committed to closing the global technology skills gap, visits the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square in celebration of its initial public offering (IPO).\nWith technology changing faster than the world’s ability to adapt and acquire new skills, many companies find themselves held back from their full potential because current technology skills training programs rely on traditional in-person, instructor-led training, or ILT, models. Pluralsight works to disrupt these in-person ILT models by offering a cloud-based technology learning platform that provides a broad range of tools, including skill assessments, a curated library of courses, learning paths, and business analytics. The platform uses a proprietary machine-learning driven skill assessment algorithm and recommendation engine to deliver valuable technological skills, taught by subject-matter experts. By democratizing technology skills through its platform, Pluralsight aims not only to expand its future customer base but also to create a more tech-empowered, equitable economy.\n“All companies, across all industries, are now technology companies, and Pluralsight is the supply chain to deliver the right skills to bring their innovations to market and fulfill their core objectives,” said Aaron Skonnard, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Technology is moving faster than our ability to learn it, and the skills a developer learns today will be obsolete in 2020. Pluralsight combines the knowledge of world-renowned technology experts with our powerful platform to empower companies to invest in their developers and close these skills gaps. With customers in over 150 countries, we are excited to announce our listing on Nasdaq and take the important next step in our journey to democratize technology skills around the globe.”\n“The technological skills gap is one of the biggest obstacles facing the global economy today, and Pluralsight’s innovative approach, combined with its rapid growth, are proving that closing the gap is not only possible, but also profitable,” said Nelson Griggs, President, Nasdaq Stock Exchange. “As it continues to create a more efficient economy, we look forward to supporting Pluralsight in pursuing its mission.”\nThe information contained above is provided for informational and educational purposes only, and nothing contained herein should be construed as investment advice, either on behalf of a particular security or an overall investment strategy.
