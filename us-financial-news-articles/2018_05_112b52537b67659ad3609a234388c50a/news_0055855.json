(Nasdaq:DTEA) today reminded the company’s shareholders of the importance of voting ahead of the upcoming Annual General Meeting . The Board of Directors of DAVIDsTEA recommends that shareholders, no matter how many shares they own, vote their YELLOW Proxy or Voting Instruction Form today to protect the value of their investment and prevent dissident shareholder Herschel Segal, through his holding company Rainy Day Investments Ltd. (RDI), from taking control of the company.\nWith the election date fast approaching, DAVIDsTEA shareholders are urged to consider the following:\nHerschel Segal only left the DAVIDsTEA board in March 2018 and was a key contributor to many of the company’s recent challenges. Mr. Segal is attempting to distance himself from his significant role with DAVIDsTEA and the significant management and board turnover during his time, and lay blame solely with the current board and management.\nDAVIDsTEA’s newly established management team is executing on a clear plan to improve the company’s performance. The team has only been in place for 12 months and is already seeing positive momentum. DAVIDsTEA’s nominees will support management and create value for all shareholders.\nWith this proxy contest, Mr. Segal is attempting to gain control of the board and the company without paying for it. DAVIDsTEA has repeatedly offered Mr. Segal a compromise that would have provided him with fair, proportionate representation on the board, but these attempts were all rejected.\nThe company’s ongoing strategic review is focused on strengthening DAVIDsTEA, not selling it. This review is intended to ensure no stone is left unturned in creating value at DAVIDsTEA.\nDAVIDsTEA’s nominees have the support of other major shareholders, including three of our significant long-term shareholders Porchlight Equity Management, LLC (12.8%), TDM Asset Management PTY LTD. (12.2%), and Edgepoint Wealth Management, Inc. (11.5%). They want to see DAVIDsTEA succeed and have stated publicly their strong belief that Mr. Segal is the wrong person to take charge of the company.\nDAVIDsTEA has put forth a renewed board that has the right mix of skills, experience, perspective and independence to oversee the management of DAVIDsTEA and reflect the interest of ALL shareholders.\nTime is short. Vote YELLOW today to support DAVIDsTEA’s director nominees .\nShareholders are encouraged to visit the DAVIDsTEA’s website to read the Management Information Circular and presentation for a complete understanding of the company’s go-forward strategy and the relevant experience of the DAVIDsTEA nominees. The Circular, presentation and instructions on how to vote are publicly available on DAVIDsTEA’s website at http://2018meeting.davidstea.com and on SEDAR ( www.sedar.com ).\nVote by Tuesday, June 12 at 5 p.m. (Eastern Time)\nVote today in support of the DAVIDsTEA nominees by voting using only the YELLOW Proxy or Voting Instruction Form well in advance of the proxy deadline. Disregard any Blue proxy or voting instruction form that you may receive from Rainy Day Investments Ltd.\nFor questions or voting assistance, please contact Laurel Hill Advisory Group at 1-877-452-7184 toll free (416-304-0211 collect) or by email at assistance@laurelhill.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes .
