It did not elaborate.\nLocal media citing unofficial sources said the bids were filed by Chinese household appliance makers Haier, Hefei Meiling and Hinsense Electric. The companies were not immediately available for comment.\nGorenje, which is one of the largest Slovenian exporters and has market capitalisation of some 154 million euros ($182.35 million), said last year it was seeking a strategic partner to increase cost efficiency and strengthen the brand.\nIn March it reported that its 2017 profit dropped by 84 percent due to strong competition and high production costs.\nShares of Gorenje rose by 1.27 percent to 6.38 euros on Tuesday, before the news was released, while the blue-chip SBI index eased 0.13 percent.
