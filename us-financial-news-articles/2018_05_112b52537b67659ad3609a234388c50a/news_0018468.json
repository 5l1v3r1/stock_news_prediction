Adjusted net income increased $2.2 million, or 15 percent, from the previous quarter. Our performance continues to benefit from our steady investment in new containers and the favorable market conditions,” stated Philip K. Brewer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Textainer Group Holdings Limited.\n“Although the first quarter is traditionally our industry’s weakest quarter, fundamentals remained strong. New container prices and lease yields are stable at attractive levels. Utilization is high and turn-ins of on-lease containers have been lower than expected during this time of the year. The quantity of used containers being sold is low due to the limited available sales inventory caused by high utilization, and used container prices remained high.\n“To take advantage of these attractive market conditions, we are continuing our planned investment in new containers. We have ordered or taken delivery of $428 million of new containers this year. The majority of these containers are already on lease or committed to be picked up by the end of June. The average rental rate for these new containers is significantly above the average rental rate of our existing fleet,” continued Mr. Brewer. “We are heading into the traditional peak season with great momentum and are well positioned to accommodate the growth and needs of our customers.”\nKey Financial Information (in thousands except for per share and TEU amounts):\nQ1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 Lease rental income $ 120,222 $ 116,297 $ 107,617 Total revenues $ 133,238 $ 129,316 $ 116,687 Income from operations $ 48,656 $ 45,310 $ 20,039 Net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders $ 18,718 $ 17,211 $ (6,974 ) Net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders per diluted common share\n$ 0.33 $ 0.30 $ (0.12 ) Adjusted net income (loss) (1) $ 17,008 $ 14,792 $ (9,067 ) Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share (1) $ 0.30 $ 0.26 $ (0.16 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 105,253 $ 100,613 $ 82,112 Average fleet utilization 97.8 % 97.4 % 95.0 % Total fleet size at end of period (TEU) 3,329,110 3,279,892 3,054,198 Owned percentage of total fleet at end of period 80.0 % 78.8 % 81.3 % (1) “Adjusted net income (loss)” and “adjusted EBITDA” are Non-GAAP Measures that are reconciled to GAAP measures in section “Reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures” below. “Adjusted net income (loss)” is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders before charges to write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and bond discounts, unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net and the related impact of reconciling items on income tax expense (benefit) and net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interests (“NCI”). “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders before interest income and expense, the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and bond discounts, realized (gains) losses on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net, unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net, income tax expense (benefit), net income (loss) attributable to the NCI, depreciation expense, container impairment, amortization expense and the related impact of reconciling items on net income (loss) attributable to the NCI. “Reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures” provides certain qualifications and limitations on the use of Non-GAAP Measures.\nFirst-Quarter Results\nLease rental income increased $12.6 million and $3.9 million, compared to the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, primarily due to higher utilization and increases in the average rental rates and the average fleet size. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 was in spite of two fewer billing days in the first quarter of 2018.\nDirect container expense decreased $6.0 million and $1.1 million, compared to the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, mostly due to lower storage costs resulting from higher average utilization and lower repositioning expense in 2018.\nDepreciation expense decreased $4.3 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in future residual values used to compute depreciation expense on each of our three primary dry container types effective July 1, 2017. Depreciation expense increased $0.9 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, in line with fleet growth.\nContainer impairment decreased $3.0 million and $0.8 million, compared to the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, mostly due to a decrease in the write down of containers held for sale to their estimated fair value as resale prices improved.\nInterest expense increased by $2.7 million and $2.5 million, compared to the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, mostly due to higher borrowing costs resulting from higher interest rates, a higher average debt balance, and a higher ratio of fixed rate debt. Partially offsetting this increase, realized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net, increased by $2.3 million and $0.9 million compared to the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively, due to higher rates.\nOutlook\n“We remain very optimistic as we look towards the summer months. In the build up to Lunar New Year, we leased out more than 100,000 TEU of new equipment. We were pleasantly surprised to see a continuation of bookings and limited container returns post Lunar New Year. Lease outs this year have been at attractive cash-on-cash yields with average maturities approaching 7 years,” commented Mr. Brewer. “We expect lease-out demand to increase further in the coming weeks.\n“The IMF is projecting world GDP growth of 3.9%. Idle container ship capacity currently stands at a very low level and leading ports around the world continue to report strong throughput volume. The cash-on-cash returns on recent lease-out deals have improved compared to a few weeks ago. Manufacturing prices are expected to remain stable or strengthen in the coming weeks. With stable or increasing new container prices and limited sales inventory, resale prices should hold at the current high levels. We remain among the top buyers of new containers this year and are ideally positioned to take advantage of the increase in demand as we move into the traditional peak season. This quarter marked a good start to the year. We expect to see further growth and continued improvement in our financial performance,” concluded Mr. Brewer.\nInvestors’ Conference Call and Webcast\nTextainer will hold a conference call and a Webcast at 11:00 am EDT on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 to discuss Textainer’s first quarter 2018 results.

Forward-looking statements include statements that are not statements of historical facts and include, without limitation, statements regarding: (i) expecting lease-out demand to increase in the coming weeks; (ii) expecting manufacturing prices to remain stable or strengthen; (iii) expecting resale prices to hold at current high levels; (iv) being position to take advantage of the increased demand; and (v) expecting further growth and improvement in financial performance. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following items that could materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future prospects: any deceleration or reversal of the current domestic and global economic conditions; lease rates may decrease and lessees may default, which could decrease revenue and increase storage, repositioning, collection and recovery expenses; the demand for leased containers depends on many political and economic factors and is tied to international trade and if demand decreases due to increased barriers to trade or political or economic factors, or for other reasons, it reduces demand for intermodal container leasing; as we increase the number of containers in our owned fleet, we increase our capital at risk and may need to incur more debt, which could result in financial instability; Textainer faces extensive competition in the container leasing industry which tends to depress returns; the international nature of the container shipping industry exposes Textainer to numerous risks; gains and losses associated with the disposition of used equipment may fluctuate; our indebtedness reduces our financial flexibility and could impede our ability to operate; and other risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in Textainer’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For a discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties, see Item 3 “Key Information— Risk Factors” in Textainer’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2018.\nTextainer’s views, estimates, plans and outlook as described within this document may change subsequent to the release of this press release.

Non-GAAP Measures are presented solely as supplemental disclosures. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA may be a useful performance measure that is widely used within our industry and adjusted net income (loss) may be a useful performance measure because Textainer intends to hold its interest rate swaps, collars and caps until maturity and over the life of an interest rate swap, collar or cap the unrealized gains will net to zero. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies and, accordingly, may not be an appropriate measure for comparison.\nManagement also believes that adjusted net income and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share are useful in evaluating our operating performance because unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net is a noncash, non-operating item. We believe Non-GAAP Measures provide useful information on our earnings from ongoing operations. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information on our ability to service our long-term debt and other fixed obligations and on our ability to fund our expected growth with internally generated funds. Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider either of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results or cash flows as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nThey do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Although depreciation expense and container impairment is a noncash charge, the assets being depreciated may be replaced in the future, and neither adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) or adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share reflects any cash requirements for such replacements; They are not adjusted for all noncash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows; and Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands) (Unaudited) Reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss): Net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders $ 18,718 $ (6,974 ) Adjustments: Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net (2,263 ) (2,294 ) Impact of reconciling items on income tax expense 22 38 Impact of reconciling items on net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests\n531 163 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 17,008 $ (9,067 ) Reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share: Net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders per diluted common share $ 0.33 $ (0.12 ) Adjustments: Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net (0.04 ) (0.04 ) Impact of reconciling items on income tax expense — — Impact of reconciling items on net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests\n0.01 — Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share $ 0.30 $ (0.16 ) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands) (Unaudited) Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA: Net income (loss) attributable to Textainer Group Holdings Limited common shareholders $ 18,718 $ (6,974 ) Adjustments: Interest income (303 ) (128 ) Interest expense 31,619 28,913 Realized (gains) losses on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net (1,184 ) 1,162 Unrealized gains on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net (2,263 ) (2,294 ) Income tax expense 560 447 Net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests 1,511 (1,101 ) Depreciation expense 56,334 60,608 Container impairment 832 3,811 Amortization expense 1,822 948 Impact of reconciling items on net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests\n(2,393 ) (3,280 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,253 $ 82,112 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 65,098 $ 46,695 Adjustments: Bad debt (recovery) expense, net 607 (252 ) Amortization of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and accretion of bond discount\n(2,213 ) (4,639 ) Gain on sale of containers, net 6,627 4,048 Share-based compensation expense (1,504 ) (1,597 ) Interest income (303 ) (128 ) Interest expense 31,619 28,913 Realized (gains) losses on interest rate swaps, collars and caps, net (1,184 ) 1,162 Income tax expense 560 447 Changes in operating assets and liabilities 8,339 10,743 Impact of reconciling items on net income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interests\n(2,393 ) (3,280 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,253 $ 82,112\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508005468/en/\nTextainer Group Holdings Limited\nHilliard C.
