About 45 percent of all moves each year occur between Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. The No. 1 Destination City will be announced on May 25 via Twitter @uhaul and on myuhaulstory.com . Columbus, Ohio, was named the No. 10 Destination City on Monday.\nGo to myuhaulstory.com now to view Destination Cities 11-50. Raleigh makes the list at No. 32, while Durham chimes in at No. 44.

Destination Cities reflect the volume and regularity of do-it-yourself movers coming into a community. They do not account for departing one-way U-Haul trucks, and thus do not necessarily signify growth like U-Haul Growth Cities and Growth States rankings.\nU-Haul released its top 25 U.S. Growth Cities and its complete Growth States rankings for 2017 in January.\nU-Haul is the authority on migration trends thanks to its expansive network that blankets all 50 states and 10 Canadian provinces.
