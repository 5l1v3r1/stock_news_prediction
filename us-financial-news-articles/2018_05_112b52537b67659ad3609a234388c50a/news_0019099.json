STRINGER/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Good morning. Foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies have six months to leave Iran, according to U.S. government guidance released alongside President Donald Trump’s decision Tuesday to exit the nuclear agreement.\nThe Iran agreement lifted some U.S. and international sanctions in exchange for Tehran freezing its nuclear program but Mr, Trump called it “defective at its core” during his remarks Tuesday. International watchdogs, European allies and others have said Iran was complying with its end of the deal.\nWhen announcing his decision Mr. Trump said he would impose “the highest level of economic sanctions” against Iran, adding the U.S. would target any nation that helps Iran pursue nuclear weapons. The sanctions will take effect over certain 90- and 180-day periods, depending on the specific type of prohibited transaction, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\nA provision watched closely by sanctions observers was General License H, which allowed foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies, under certain conditions, to enter into business with Iran. That license expires Nov. 4, according to the guidance issued Tuesday.\nTreasury will consider a company’s efforts to exit their operations when considering potential enforcement actions concerning business with Iran after the Nov. 4 deadline, the guidance said.\nCompanies and banks engaged in Iran will begin assessing their sanctions exposure and at a minimum determine what they need to do to wind down operations, said Andrew Keller, partner at law firm Hogan Lovells LLP. “The aftershocks of today’s announcement will hit businesses around the world,” he said.\nAs a result of the announcement U.S. sanctions on Iran revert to their pre-agreement state, said Douglas Jacobson, a partner at the international trade-focused firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC. European Union reaction to the decision is important, he said. “EU companies will be faced with the choice of complying with EU law or U.S. law,” said Mr. Jacobson.\nMr. Trump will face immediate diplomatic challenges in his quest to isolate Iran, said Peter Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security. For example, it will be difficult to get countries, such as China to resume reducing their oil purchases, or to get Iranian banks back off of Swift, the international financial messaging network, he said. “There is not a lot of ambiguity in Trump’s announcement,” he said.\nOne attorney welcomed the clear timeline for the sanctions on Iran, saying he’d thought there’d be some initial confusion about how the measures would come back into place. “There is some benefit to that kind of clarity” from the U.S. government, said Jason Waite, a partner in the international trade practice at the firm Alston & Bird.\nCOMPLIANCE\nNew York names special prosecutor for ex-official .
