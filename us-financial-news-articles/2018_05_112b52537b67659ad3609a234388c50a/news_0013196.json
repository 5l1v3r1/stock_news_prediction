(NYSE: CBB) (the “Company”) announced that it has received unanimous approval from the Hawaiʻi Public Utilities Commission (“PUC” or the “Commission”) with respect to its pending acquisition of Honolulu-based Hawaiian Telcom (NASDAQ: HCOM), the leading integrated communications provider serving Hawaiʻi and the state’s fiber-centric technology leader. In approving the merger, the Commission concludes that net benefits will result from the transaction.\n“We greatly appreciate the support of the Hawaiʻi PUC and are pleased that the Commission has acknowledged that our combination with Hawaiian Telcom is expected to bring benefits to Hawaiʻi consumers as we continue to invest in next-generation fiber,” said Leigh Fox, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cincinnati Bell. “This marks a key milestone as we work to create a stronger communications and technology company that builds upon the complementary strengths of Cincinnati Bell and Hawaiian Telcom, allowing us to deliver more competitive products and services to customers.”\nThe combination, previously announced on July 10, 2017, will accelerate Cincinnati Bell’s overarching strategy to create a diversified and balanced revenue mix by expanding the Company’s high-speed, high-bandwidth fiber optic network while building a complementary IT solutions and cloud services business. By leveraging Hawaiian Telcom’s local knowledge and continuing to invest in its deep fiber infrastructure, the combined company will be well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for strategic fiber offerings.\nHawaiʻi PUC approval satisfies one of the conditions for the closing of the transaction. The pending acquisition has already cleared the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act review period, and has been overwhelmingly approved by Hawaiian Telcom shareholders. In addition, the Hawaiʻi Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs’ Cable Television Division has conditionally approved the transfer of control of Hawaiian Telcom’s cable franchise to Cincinnati Bell.\nWith approval from the Hawaiʻi PUC, the transaction is expected to close following completion of the Federal Communications Commission’s review and other remaining customary closing conditions.\nAbout Cincinnati Bell\nWith headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati Bell Inc.
