It cited Advanced Skin Brightening Formula, Sunsafe Rx, Solaricare and Sunergetic.\nThe agency said those products don't meet the FDA's standards for safety and effectiveness and could even put consumers at risk by giving them a false sense of security that a dietary supplement could prevent sunburn, reduce aging or protect from the risks of skin cancer.\n\"When the FDA sees companies taking advantage of people's desire to protect themselves from the harmful effects of the sun â€” we'll step in,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \"There's no pill or capsule that can replace your sunscreen.\"\nThe FDA isn't authorized to review dietary supplements before they reach the market, but it can pull them if they're found to be unsafe or the claims are false or misleading. In the letters sent Tuesday, the agency has instructed the companies to scrub the violations from product websites and labeling.\nAs for consumers, the agency continues to recommend sunscreen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T19:16:06.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
