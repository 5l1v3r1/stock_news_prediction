The benchmark fell 0.2 percent on Thursday and is poised to end the week lower.\nThe healthcare sector rose to an all-time high, helped by CSL Ltd, which soared as much as 5.6 percent to a record-high A$185.53.\nThe rally came after the biotherapeutics company said it expected full-year after-tax profit to be in range of about $1.68 billion to $1.71 billion, higher than an earlier forecast of $1.55 billion to $1.60 billion, underpinned by a severe influenza season in northern hemisphere.\nIt was CSL’s second earnings upgrade this year.\nMiners BHP and Rio Tinto fell over 1 percent each, dragging the benchmark lower.\nChina’s iron ore and other steelmaking raw materials slipped for a second session on Thursday, while analysts said they expect softer demand in the coming months as the country shifts its focus from heavy industries to services.\nIn the financial sector, lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group was higher while other three of the ‘Big Four’ fell between 0.7 percent to 0.9 percent.\nChief market strategist at CMC Markets, Michael McCarthy, said that investors were trimming positions heading into the weekend.\nAcross the Tasman, New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.25 percent, or 21.53 points, to 8,624.91.\nRyman Healthcare drove gains on the index, rising as much as 3 percent, after reporting a 14 percent jump in its full-year profit.\nGoodman Property Trust supported gains in the real estate sector, up as much as 2.5 percent to an over 10-year high. The property investor will sell its majority-held VXV office portfolio to a number of Blackstone funds for NZ$635 million ($437.32 million), the property trust’s manager said.\nFor more individual stocks activity click on ($1 = 1.4520 New Zealand dollars) (Reporting by Sumeet Gaikwad in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Shanima A Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T06:04:57.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
