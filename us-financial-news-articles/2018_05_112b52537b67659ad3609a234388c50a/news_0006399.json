REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/Illustration/Files “These devices may pose an unacceptable risk to the department’s personnel, and mission,” Eastburn said.\nThe action followed a series of U.S. moves aimed at stopping or reducing access by Huawei and ZTE to the U.S. economy amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans.\nRepresentative of Huawei and ZTE could not be reached immediately for comment, though both have denied allegations that their products are used to spy.\nThe Pentagon noted in its comments to Reuters that in February 2018, the Director of National Intelligence, the heads of the FBI, CIA, and National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and National Glossarial Intelligence Agency testified before the U.S. Senate that Huawei products pose a potential security risk to users.\nReporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T18:44:47.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
