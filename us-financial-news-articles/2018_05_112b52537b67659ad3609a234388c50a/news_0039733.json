Its investigation claimed that Tanzania had received only 5.2 percent of revenues from global tanzanite trade over the past decade.\nIn April, Magufuli inaugurated a wall with security cameras and checkpoints around tanzanite mining concessions in northern Tanzania to control illegal mining and trading activities in the area.\n“Forty percent of Tanzanite produced here was being lost, our minerals used to create jobs for other people in other countries,” he said at the time.\nLast year, he directed the central bank to buy the precious stone to boost reserves.\nReporting by Omar Mohammed; Editing by Elias Biryabarema and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T12:19:50.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
