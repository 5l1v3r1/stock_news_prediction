The restaurants have mostly resumed operations and executives expect to restart advertising this month.\nPizza Hut also missed expectations for same-restaurant sales, which were up 1 percent worldwide, after strength in the United States offset a decline in China.\nOverall revenue at Yum fell 3 percent to $1.37 billion but topped estimates of $1.09 billion, thanks to stronger sales at Taco Bell, where $1 Nacho Fries debuted as its best-selling new product in history.\nNet income jumped to $433 million from $280 million last year, reflecting gains from the sale of company-owned restaurants to franchisees.\nExcluding one-time items, Yum earned 90 cents per share, ahead of expectations of 68 cents.
