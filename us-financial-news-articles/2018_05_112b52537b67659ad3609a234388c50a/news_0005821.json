Lowrie tied the score in the eighth with a two-run homer off Juan Nicasio.\nIt was a rare letdown for the Mariners bullpen, as Nicasio entered the game with a major-league-best 11 holds and Diaz had a major-league-high 12 saves.\nWith one out in the eighth, Matt Joyce hit a ground-rule double to right-center field. Lowrie then homered to the same spot on a 2-0 pitch to tie it, his eighth homer of the season.\nThe Mariners loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the inning but failed to score as Blake Treinen (2-1) struck out Nelson Cruz and Mitch Haniger.\nAfter Canha’s go-ahead blast, Seattle loaded the bases again in the ninth off Treinen, as Dee Gordon’s apparent game-ending groundout was reversed on a replay review. However, Jean Segura grounded out to third to end the game.\nPaxton pitched seven scoreless innings, striking out a career-high 16 batters. He allowed five hits and walked one. The left-hander eclipsed his previous best of 10 strikeouts, which he set Sept. 24, 2013, against Kansas City and had accomplished four times since, including twice earlier this season.\nPaxton struck out the side in the first and seventh innings. He struck out two batters in every other inning.\nThe Mariners opened the scoring in the third inning against left-hander Brett Anderson, who was making his first start for the A’s since 2013 and his first this season.\nRyon Healy, acquired from Oakland in an offseason trade, led off with a home run to left-center field on a 2-1 pitch. It was Healy’s fourth homer of the season — and his fourth in the past four games.\nIchiro Suzuki then walked on four pitches and advanced to second on a groundout by Gordon. Suzuki scored on Segura’s sharp single to left field.\nThe left-handed Anderson allowed only two runs on five hits in 6 1/3 innings, walking one and striking out four.\n—Field Level Media\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T16:48:38.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
