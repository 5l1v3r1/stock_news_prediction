St. Louis fell to 4-8 in its past 12.\nMusgrove (1-0) had been on the disabled list because of a right shoulder strain dating to spring training.

Fortunately for the Nationals, their offense came through with two-run homers by Michael A. Taylor and Matt Adams. Bryce Harper hit a two-run double in Washington’s game-winning seventh-inning rally.\nMarlins starter Jose Urena earned a no-decision but continued his misery. After going 14-7 in a breakout 2017 season, Urena (0-7) leads the majors in losses, and the Marlins are 0-11 when he starts.

The Rockies rallied from three runs down early to take the lead in the sixth.

Slideshow (13 Images)\nHess (2-1) allowed four hits with three strikeouts and three walks. He escaped a few jams, the worst coming in the fifth when Mallex Smith walked and moved to third with no outs thanks to a balk and Schoop’s error while trying to catch a pickoff throw. However, Hess retired the next three batters on groundouts and did not allow a run.\nThe Rays, experimenting with a new strategy the past week, started right-handed relief pitcher Sergio Romo for the third time in seven days with the expectation that he would last no more than an inning or two as Baltimore has several right-handed power hitters up top. But Romo couldn’t finish the first inning, giving up a run on two hits. Romo also is going to start Sunday, with reliever Ryne Stanek set to start on Saturday.\nRangers 8, Royals 4\nNomar Mazara homered and drove in three runs as host Texas knocked off Kansas City.\nThe Rangers evened the four-game series at Globe Life Park at a game apiece.

Kemp had three hits to go along with his three RBIs, raising his batting average to .338.\nJose Pirela had three hits for the Padres, who went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position while falling to 11-11 in the month of May.\nDiamondbacks 7, Athletics 1\nNick Ahmed hit Sean Manaea’s seventh pitch of the game for a home run and later contributed an RBI single to a three-run fourth inning, sending Arizona on its way to victory over Oakland in the opener of a three-game interleague series in Oakland, Calif.\nLeft-hander Patrick Corbin (5-1) allowed two or fewer runs for the fourth time in five starts this month, limiting the A’s to four hits and one run in seven innings and helping the Diamondbacks snap a seven-game losing streak.\nMark Canha homered for Oakland’s only run.
