The attack took place in East Orchard Mesa, a small community about 250 miles (400 km) west of Denver.\nThe child, whose name was not released, was in fair condition early on Monday at a local hospital, NBC affiliate KKCO said.\nWildlife agents set up traps and deployed tracking hounds in an effort to locate the bear, said Mike Porras, a spokesman for the state parks agency’s northwest region office.\nHe said agents were monitoring the traps overnight when they observed a bear approaching a home about a half-mile (0.8 km) from where the attack on the girl occurred. They shot it before it entered a trap.\n“Based on the description of the bear and that it returned to the same general area, we believe it is the same animal,” Porras said by telephone.\nColorado has a “robust” population of about 18,000 black bears, he said, noting that unprovoked attacks by black bears on humans are rare.\nThe bear’s carcass will be shipped to the agency’s laboratory for a necropsy to determine if DNA testing can confirm it was the animal that attacked the girl and to assess its overall health, Porras said.\nReporting by Keith Coffman in Denver, additional reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Scott Malone and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-14T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T15:05:45.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
