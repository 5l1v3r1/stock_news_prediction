Here are his reasons why:\n— The $340 level marks consolidation at the end part of a \"beautiful uptrend\" that has been in place. Not only that, but the stock has risen to close to that $340 a few times, only to fall back and retest again.\n— Gordon noted that call option open interest has exploded in the stock.\n— As a result, Gordon wants to buy the June monthly 340-strike call and sell the June monthly 350-strike call for a total of $3.04, or $304 per options spread.\n— If Netflix closes below $340 on June 15 expiration, Gordon would lose the $304 he paid for the trade. But if Netflix were to close above $350, then Gordon could make up to $696.\nThe trade: Gordon is suggesting buying the June monthly 340/350 call spread for $3.04, or $304 per options spread.\nBottom line: Gordon believes that $340 is a support level from which Netflix can rally to new highs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:38:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
