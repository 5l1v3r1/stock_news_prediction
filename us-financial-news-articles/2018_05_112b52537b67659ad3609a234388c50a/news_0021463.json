As a result of this increase, GAAP and non-GAAP net income, earnings per diluted share and EBITDA decreased by $0.9 million, $0.11 per diluted share, and $1.3 million, respectively, for the quarter.\nThe increase to forgivable loan amortization has no effect on previously announced quarterly revenue of $99.5 million and quarter-end cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million. Attached to this release are financial schedules for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 that reflect the change to forgivable loan amortization as discussed above.\nIn addition, the increase to forgivable loan amortization has no effect on the announced differences between financial metrics and their constant currency counterparts. Finally, the increase does not change CRA’s guidance for fiscal 2018. To reiterate, on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2017, CRA reaffirms its previous guidance of revenue in the range of $380 million to $392 million and non-GAAP EBITDA margin in the range of 8.8% to 9.8%.\nCRA does not provide reconciliations of its annual non-GAAP EBITDA margin guidance to GAAP net income margin because CRA is unable to estimate with reasonable certainty the revaluation of contingent consideration liabilities, unusual gains or charges, foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting effect of these items, and of equity awards, on CRA’s taxes without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material effect on CRA’s results computed in accordance with GAAP.\nCRA’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which is being filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will reflect this adjustment.\nAbout Charles River Associates (CRA)\nCharles River Associates® is a global consulting firm specializing in economic, financial, and management consulting services .

CRA believes that the non-GAAP financial measures described below are important to management and investors because these measures are more indicative of CRA’s ongoing operating results and financial condition.\nThe adjustments made to the financial measures identified as “non-GAAP” are as follows: for all periods presented, CRA has excluded the results of its GNU subsidiary, which sold substantially all of its assets in April 2016, and for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, CRA has also excluded certain charges relating principally to non-cash charges resulting from valuation changes in contingent consideration and to net costs of a lease recapture. This release also presents the non-GAAP financial metric EBITDA. In addition to supplementing its understanding and evaluation of CRA’s performance, these non-GAAP measures are used by CRA in its budgeting process, and the non-GAAP adjustments described above are made to the performance criteria for some of CRA’s performance-based compensation.\nAll of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the GAAP financial information presented in this release. EBITDA and the other historical financial measures identified as “non-GAAP” are reconciled to their GAAP comparable measures in the financial tables appended to the end of this press release. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by CRA may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT\nStatements in this press release concerning our future business, operating results and financial condition, including those concerning guidance on future revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA margin, are “forward-looking” statements as defined in Section 21 of the Exchange Act. These statements are based upon our current expectations and various underlying assumptions. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for these statements and assumptions, and these statements are expressed in good faith, these statements are subject to a number of additional factors and uncertainties. Our actual revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA margin in fiscal 2018 on a constant currency basis relative to fiscal 2017 could differ materially from the guidance presented herein due to many important factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the demand for our services may decline as a result of changes in general and industry specific economic conditions; the timing of engagements for our services; the effects of competitive services and pricing; our ability to attract and retain key employee or non-employee experts; the inability to integrate and utilize existing consultants and personnel; the decline or reduction in project work or activity; global economic conditions including less stable political and economic environments; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; unanticipated expenses and liabilities; risks inherent in international operations; changes in tax law or accounting standards, rules, and regulations; our ability to collect on forgivable loans should any become due; and professional and other legal liability or settlements. Additional risks and uncertainties are discussed in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the heading “Risk Factors.” The inclusion of such forward-looking information should not be regarded as our representation that the future events, plans, or expectations contemplated will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, and we do not intend to do so.\nCRA INTERNATIONAL, INC.
