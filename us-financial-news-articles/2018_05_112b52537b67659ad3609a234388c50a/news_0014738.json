GAAP operating income grew 8 percent to $230 million, compared to $212 million a year ago. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $1.23, compared to $1.24 a year ago. Fiscal Year 2018 GAAP EPS was impacted by a $22 million ($0.13 per share) one-time net tax expense following the reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate and other reforms. Non-GAAP operating income grew 14 percent to $287 million, compared to $252 million a year ago. Non-GAAP EPS grew 13 percent to $1.60, compared to $1.41 a year ago. Cash flow from operations grew 20 percent to $346 million – the highest in eight years.\nFor Q4 Fiscal Year 2018:\nSales grew to $592 million, up 16 percent in US dollars and 9 percent in constant currency, compared to the prior year. GAAP operating income grew to $39 million, and non-GAAP operating income grew to a better-than-expected $55 million. Cash flow from operations reached $90 million.\n“Over the past five years we’ve built a business with sustainable growth. We have a resilient and expanding portfolio. We are building five scalable capabilities led by design and engineering,” said Bracken Darrell, Logitech president and chief executive officer. “Fiscal Year 2018 delivered broad-based, double-digit growth led by Gaming and Video Collaboration. Now, as we look to the next five years, we will go on the offense to accelerate the creation of an amazing company.”\nVincent Pilette, Logitech chief financial officer, said, “We’ve delivered a great fiscal year with record sales, and better-than-expected profitability and cash flow from operations. We go into Fiscal Year 2019 with strong momentum, our financial fundamentals in place, and an eye toward shaping the portfolio and reallocating resources to continuously transform.”\nOutlook\nLogitech confirmed its Fiscal Year 2019 outlook of high single-digit sales growth in constant currency and $310 to $320 million in non-GAAP operating income.\nManagement Update\nOn May 2, 2018, L. Joseph Sullivan, the Company’s senior vice president, worldwide operations, announced his retirement and, effective immediately, resigned from the Company’s Group Management Team. The Company accepted this resignation. Mr. Sullivan’s retirement from Logitech will be effective as of February 2, 2019, the end of his contractual notice period.\nPrepared Remarks Available Online\nLogitech has made its prepared written remarks for the financial results teleconference available online on the Logitech corporate website at http://ir.logitech.com .\nFinancial Results Teleconference and Webcast\nLogitech will hold a financial results teleconference to discuss the results for Q4 and the full Fiscal Year 2018 on Thursday, May 3, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time and 2:30 p.m. Central European Summer Time. A live webcast of the call will be available on the Logitech corporate website at http://ir.logitech.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Constant Currency\nTo facilitate comparisons to Logitech’s historical results, Logitech has included non-GAAP adjusted measures, which exclude share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, purchase accounting effect on inventory, acquisition-related costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition, restructuring charges (credits), gain (loss) on investments in privately held companies, investigation and related expenses, non-GAAP income tax adjustment, and other items detailed under “Supplemental Financial Information” after the tables below. Logitech also presents percentage sales growth in constant currency to show performance unaffected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating prior period sales in each local currency at the current period’s average exchange rate for that currency and comparing that to current period sales. Logitech believes this information, used together with the GAAP financial information, will help investors to evaluate its current period performance and trends in its business. With respect to the Company’s outlook for non-GAAP operating income, most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate\nwith a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to the GAAP amounts has been provided for Fiscal Year 2019.\nAbout Logitech\nLogitech designs products that have an everyday place in people's lives, connecting them to the digital experiences they care about.
