REUTERS/Mark Kauzlarich\nWhat the company describes as an “AR map” is viewed as crucial to advanced augmented reality apps. But how to efficiently collect and process data for it has been a vexing problem that Alphabet Inc’s Google, Apple Inc and dozens of startups also have been trying to solve.\nNiantic’s previously unreported effort relies on its users’ smartphone cameras.\n“We want players to build out the game board they want to play on,” CEO John Hanke, a mapping veteran who worked on Google Earth and Google Street View, told Reuters last week.\nGoogle incubated and invested in Niantic.\nThe technology industry has closely monitored the startup’s strategy since Pokemon Go took augmented reality mainstream by enabling users to collect virtual creatures on their smartphones. The game has been downloaded more than 800 million times, according to Niantic.\nCamera apps today can digitally render a Pokemon or a new swing set at a playground. But with an AR map as bedrock, an app could raze the entire playground in the augmented reality, enable someone to anchor new virtual structures and allow other users to view the same layout.\nAR maps would enrich the “new kind of social activity” Niantic has fostered, Hanke said.\nMapping will start with public spaces such as parks and plazas, he said, declining to specify when. Nor did he disclose how AR maps would fit into Niantic’s games, which also include the upcoming “Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.”\nBut based on existing features, players would turn on their cameras to visualize characters among their surroundings. Software would generate a map by automatically identifying contours and objects in the scene as a user plays.\nThey then could compete on a revamped game board shared with nearby players, maintaining a cycle of switched-on cameras and fresh data while helping Niantic overcome the chicken-or-egg dilemma that has slowed map makers lacking a commercial application.\nEarlier this year, Niantic acquired startup Escher Reality to advance its effort.\nIt appears to be more than a side project. Hanke said Niantic would allow third-party developers to use its AR map, which industry executives estimate could become part of a multibillion-dollar global business.\nSome rival startups are focused on extracting data from laser scans, while others are emphasizing indoor mapping.\nGoogle Maps said Tuesday it would launch an augmented reality feature later this year in some cities that compares live images from a phone to its Street View imagery database to provide directions when GPS is insufficient.\n“It’s early days but we’re excited about the potential for these types of world-scale AR experiences,” Google spokeswoman Mara Harris said.\nPrivacy and data rights may present hurdles, said Brendan Wallace, managing partner at investment group Fifth Wall Ventures, which connects landlords and tech firms.\nPokemon Go has spurred ongoing litigation that it contributed to public nuisance. Businesses are reluctant to cede potentially valuable virtual space and are scared about big companies misusing collected data, Wallace said.
