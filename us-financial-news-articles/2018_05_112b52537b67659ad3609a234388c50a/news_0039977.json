Najib denies any wrongdoing.\nAmar Singh, the director of police commercial crime investigations, told Reuters that five places linked to Najib were being searched, including the family home in an upmarket Kuala Lumpur district.\nSingh gave no other details, but the Star newspaper said searches were also conducted at the prime minister’s office, the official residence and two places linked to Najib’s family in a luxury Kuala Lumpur condominium.\nThe search at the family home was continuing at 0200 GMT, nearly 12 hours after a dozen armed policemen first entered the premises. The police started the search after Najib returned home from prayers at a mosque to mark the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n“The search is supposed to be under the money laundering act ... they found nothing incriminating,” Najib’s lawyer Harpal Singh Grewal told reporters who were camped outside the house.\nHe said police took away some personal possessions including a couple of handbags. “Nothing serious. About two, three boxes” of them, Grewal said.\nWhen asked whether Najib would be arrested, he said: “There is no indication that they (the police) will do it.”\nHe said Najib and his family were cooperative with police. “They (the police) also acted professionally,” he said.\nNajib’s long-ruling political coalition was defeated in a May 9 general election and just days later, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad barred Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, from leaving the country. Najib was once Mahathir’s protégé.\nMahathir, 92, has said there is sufficient evidence to investigate the scandal at 1MDB.\nMahathir has replaced the country’s attorney-general and officials at the anti-graft agency, in what appears to be a purge of people seen as close to the former premier.\nOn Wednesday, jailed reformist Anwar Ibrahim was granted a full pardon and freed, underlining the dramatic political changes in the Southeast Asian country in the last seven days.\nAnwar teamed up with Mahathir, his ally-turned-foe-turned-ally, to oust Najib. The relationship between the two remains volatile, however, and will likely determine what course Malaysia will chart in the coming months.
