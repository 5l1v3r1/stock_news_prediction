The planned stake size was not disclosed.\nBidders in the new round should submit their offers by June 14, with a minimum investment of 15 billion rupees by way of preferential allotment. They were given 10 days to conduct financial and legal due diligence.\nThe bids should also provide a plan for funding Fortis’s acquisition of RHT Health Trust’s Indian assets, agreed in November, and options to private equity investors to exit Fortis’s unit SRL Ltd.\nSpokespersons for IHH, Hero-Burman and Manipal all declined to comment.\nStandard Chartered Bank and Arpwood Capital are acting as financial advisors to Fortis, while Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and Vaish Associates are legal advisors.
