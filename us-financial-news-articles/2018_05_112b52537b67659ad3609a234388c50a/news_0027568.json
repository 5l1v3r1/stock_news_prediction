The Celtics are in the East finals in consecutive years for the first time since 1986-87 and 1987-88. The Cavs, who advanced this week by sweeping the Toronto Raptors, eliminated the Celtics in a five-game series last May.\n“I feel like we more together (than last year),” Rozier said. “Obviously guys been going down all year, and it’s like you never know who’s going to go down. But we found a way, we pulled together. I’m not saying if we’re better or not, but we definitely going back to the Eastern Conference finals, so that’s a blessing.”\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens, referring to the team’s success without injures stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, “Things haven’t always gone our way, but they’re talented. They’re tough. They fit Boston.”\nGame 1 of Eastern Conference finals is Sunday in Boston.\nPhiladelphia’s Joel Embiid missed a potential game-tying layup with 12.5 seconds left before the 76ers turned the ball over. Boston’s Terry Rozier made two free throws with 9.8 seconds on the clock to make it 113-109, but a JJ Redick 3-pointer with 3.8 ticks left had the 76ers back within a point.\nMarcus Smart made one of two free throws with 2.4 seconds left, and Philadelphia turned it over on the inbounds play to seal it.\nEmbiid finished with 27 points and 12 rebounds, Dario Saric had a playoff-career-high 27 points and 10 boards and Ben Simmons totaled 18 points with eight rebounds and six assists for the 76ers.\nPhiladelphia, which snapped a five-year playoff drought this season, was denied its first trip to the conference finals since going to the NBA Finals in the 2000-01 season.\nSixers forward Robert Covington said, “Felt like we had more games in us. We had a couple unfortunate bounces of the ball during the game. The momentum was on our side, but they made big plays. Just down the stretch, we felt like we had more basketball to play.”\nNo team in NBA history has overcome an 0-3 series deficit.\nTwo Aron Baynes free throws with 6:04 left in the third quarter gave Boston its biggest lead at 12 points, but Philadelphia answered with a 19-8, quarter-ending run to pull within 83-82 entering the final period.\nCovington’s 3-pointer with 9:49 remaining gave the 76ers a 90-88 lead, their first since being up 48-47 with 3:47 left in the first half.\nBoston scored six straight to go up 100-94 on Rozier’s finger roll with 5:27 left.\nSaric’s trey at 3:30 had the 76ers back in front 103-102, and the Philadelphia lead swelled to four with a minute and a half left.\nRozier said of Boston being down by four late, “It was tough, but that’s been our season. We overcame so much and we pulled out a lot of games like that. And we know what time it was, we never got tight, and we just pulled it off.”\nSmart’s put-back of a Tatum miss tied the game at 109 with exactly one minute left.\nBoston led 61-52 at halftime.\nSimmons’ driving layup with 1:45 to play in the first half brought the 76ers within 53-52 heading into the final minute. However, Baynes’ 3-pointer with 56 seconds to play sparked an 8-0 Boston run to end the half.\n“I was saying it from the jump that this was Game 7,” Jaylen Brown said. “We treated it as such. We didn’t want to go back to Philly. We didn’t want to keep building their momentum. It was good to get a closeout game here on our home floor.”\nSixers coach Brett Brown called it a hard-fought series, adding, “If we’re going to do anything of significance, we’re always going to have to go through the Boston Celtics. I respect, very much, this organization. I think (Celtics general manager) Danny (Ainge) and Brad are fantastic. You’re always looking over your shoulder and watching how they’ve decided to grow their program.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:46:35.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
