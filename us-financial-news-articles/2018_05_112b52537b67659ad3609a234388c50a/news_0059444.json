The most recent study found that so-called Super Lice comprise 98 percent of head lice in most states.\nFortunately for families in Mercer County, Lice Clinics of America® – Hamilton ( www.liceclinicsjersey.com ) is on the scene, providing screening, diagnosis, and treatment for people infested with head lice using the AirAllé® device. It’s an FDA-cleared medical device clinically proven to kill live lice and 99 percent of lice eggs, including lice that are resistant to traditional lice products.\nThe AirAllé device doesn’t use any chemicals at all. Instead, it applies perfectly controlled warm air to the hair and scalp to dehydrate lice and eggs on the spot.\n“It’s sad to see so many parents come in having spent so much time and money on products that no longer work,” said clinic manager Lori Schleinkofer. “People are so relieved to come in with head lice and leave lice-free.”\nMost treatments using the AirAllé take about an hour, and the treatment is guaranteed to be effective. The AirAllé has successfully treated close to 400,000 cases of head lice worldwide.\nLori and her team are eager to spread the word about this new solution for head lice that makes treatment so much easier. Most recently she attended the New Jersey State School Nurses Association conference where interest in the clinic’s services was high.\n“It’s exciting to have a medically-proven solution that is fast, safe, and effective,” Lori said. “We can confidently tell people that their nightmare is over.”\nThe Hamilton clinic is located at 941 White Horse Ave, Suite 13, Hamilton Township, NJ 08610 and is open seven days per week by appointment.\nWith more than 300 clinics in 34 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences TM , Inc., which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nLori Schleinkofer Lice Clinics of America 609-422-5423 info@liceclinicsspringgrove.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ru6pAJ6criKOeuvd9TaMZLFb-b6NZLk1Ld2uyxbFW_Dr2THAhqKMnucM_tAeKZMCrzsq4cD-FYKj8JYEflQy4qbbKUJtCjm-ZTwEXcLYBaY=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cdb773b8-0ed9-4294-915c-5c6aabc35f38/en"], "published": "2018-05-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:26:09.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
