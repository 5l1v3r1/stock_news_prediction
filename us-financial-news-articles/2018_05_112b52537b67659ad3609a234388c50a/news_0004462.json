(NYSE:WEX), a leading provider of corporate payment solutions, today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenue of 2018 increased 22% to $354.8 million from $291.4 million of 2017. Of the $63 million increase in the quarter, only $9.0 million was the result of higher fuel prices.\nNet income attributable to shareholders on a GAAP basis increased by $19.2 million to $48.6 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared with $29.4 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, of 2017. The Company's adjusted net income attributable to shareholders, which is a non-GAAP measure, was $78.7 million of 2018, or $1.81 per diluted share, up 47% per diluted share from $52.9 million or $1.23 per diluted share for the same period last year. See Exhibit 1 for a full explanation and reconciliation of adjusted net income attributable to shareholders and adjusted net income attributable to shareholders per diluted share to the comparable GAAP measures.\n“I am pleased to report a strong start to the year, highlighted by top and bottom line results above our guidance range with strong contributions from each of our business segments,” said Melissa Smith, WEX’s president and chief executive officer. “We remain focused on our sustained ability to bring compelling new features and products to market, which is allowing us to continue to sign new customers, retain and grow our current base, and ultimately drive profitable growth.”\nSmith continued, “In the first quarter, we built on our performance from last year, with our employees across the world focused on bringing future based solutions across many business-to-business markets through the use of technology, adding a number of impressive wins, and capitalizing on our organic growth opportunities. We look forward to carrying this momentum through 2018.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Performance Metrics\nAverage number of vehicles serviced was approximately 11.5 million, an increase of 8% from the first quarter of 2017. Total fuel transactions processed increased 6% from the first quarter of 2017 to 131.8 million. Payment processing transactions increased 7% to 109.8 million. U.S. retail fuel price increased 16% to $2.78 per gallon from $2.40 per gallon of 2017. Travel and Corporate Solutions purchase volume grew 20% to $7.9 billion, from $6.6 billion of 2017. Health and Employee Benefit Solutions average number of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) accounts in the U.S. grew 26% to 10.8 million from 8.6 million of 2017.\nFinancial Guidance and Assumptions\nThe Company provides revenue guidance on a GAAP basis and earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis, due to the uncertainty and an indeterminate amount of certain elements that are included in reported GAAP earnings.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company expects revenue in the range of $1.435 billion to $1.475 billion and adjusted net income in the range of $337 million to $355 million, or $7.75 to $8.15 per diluted share. For the second quarter of 2018, WEX expects revenue in the range of $357 million to $367 million and adjusted net income in the range of $85 million to $90 million, or $1.96 to $2.06 per diluted share.\n“Our first quarter performance reflects our sustained ability to drive growth. We are confident with our current position and will strive to identify additional opportunities for growth throughout the year, and drive scale through solid execution,\" said Roberto Simon, WEX's chief financial officer.\nSecond quarter 2018 guidance is based on an assumed average U.S. retail fuel price of $2.90 per gallon. Full year 2018 guidance is based on an assumed average U.S. retail fuel price of $2.80 per gallon. The fuel prices referenced above are based on the applicable NYMEX futures price. Our guidance assumes approximately 43.5 million shares outstanding for the second quarter and full year 2018.\nThe Company's guidance also assumes that second quarter 2018 fleet credit loss will range from 10 to 15 basis points and full year will range from 11 to 16 basis points.\nThe Company's adjusted net income guidance, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses and related derivatives, acquisition related intangible amortization, other acquisition and divestiture related items, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other costs, debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization, similar adjustments attributable to our non-controlling interest and certain tax related items. We are unable to reconcile our adjusted net income guidance to the comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because of the difficulty in predicting the amounts to be adjusted, including but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rates, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and acquisition and divestiture related items, which may have a significant impact on our financial results.\nAdditional Information\nAs previously disclosed, beginning of 2018, the Company has modified the presentation of certain line items in its unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Under the new presentation, the Company will segregate costs of services from other operating expenses and has reclassified its operating expenses into functional categories in order to provide additional detail into the underlying drivers of changes in operating expenses and align its presentation with industry practice. There are no changes to the presentation of revenues, non-operating expenses or other statement of income captions. Additionally, the revised presentation does not result in a change to previously reported revenues, operating income, income before income taxes or net income. Amounts from the prior period have been recast to reflect the new presentation.\nManagement uses the non-GAAP measures presented within this news release to evaluate the Company's performance on a comparable basis. Management believes that investors may find these measures useful for the same purposes, but cautions that they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, disclosure in accordance with GAAP.\nTo provide investors with additional insight into its operational performance, WEX has included in this news release in Exhibit 2, a table illustrating the impact of foreign currency translations and fuel prices for each of our reportable segments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and in Exhibit 3, a table of selected non-financial metrics for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and four preceding quarters. The Company is also providing selected segment revenue information for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 in Exhibit 4.\nConference Call Details\nIn conjunction with this announcement, WEX will host a conference call today, May 3, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. (ET).

The Company considers this measure integral because it excludes the above-specified items that the Company's management excludes in evaluating the Company's performance. Specifically, in addition to evaluating the Company's performance on a GAAP basis, management evaluates the Company's performance on a basis that excludes the above items because:\nExclusion of the non-cash, mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements, helps management identify and assess trends in the Company's underlying business that might otherwise be obscured due to quarterly non-cash earnings fluctuations associated with these derivative contracts. Net foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the remeasurement to functional currency of cash, receivable and payable balances, certain intercompany notes denominated in foreign currencies and any gain or loss on foreign currency hedges relating to these items. The exclusion of these items helps management compare changes in operating results between periods that might otherwise be obscured due to currency fluctuations. The Company considers certain acquisition-related costs, including certain financing costs, investment banking fees, warranty and indemnity insurance, certain integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles, as well as gains and losses from divestitures, to be unpredictable, dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired or divested business or the Company. In prior periods not reflected above, the Company has adjusted for goodwill impairments, acquisition-related asset impairments and gains and losses on divestitures. In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs. The Company believes that excluding acquisition-related costs and gains or losses of divestitures facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the Company's historical operating results and to other companies in our industry. Stock-based compensation is different from other forms of compensation as it is a non-cash expense. For example, a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost. In contrast, the expense associated with an equity-based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee, and the cost to the Company is based on a stock-based compensation valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time. Restructuring and other costs are related to employee termination benefits from certain identified initiatives to further streamline the business, improve the Company's efficiency, create synergies and to globalize the Company's operations, all with an objective to improve scale and increase profitability going forward. We exclude these items when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense, nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business. Debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization are unrelated to the continuing operations of the Company. Debt restructuring costs are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense, nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business. In addition, since debt issuance cost amortization is dependent upon the financing method which can vary widely company to company, we believe that excluding these costs helps to facilitate comparison to historical results as well as to other companies within our industry. The adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest have no significant impact on the ongoing operations of the business. The tax related items are the difference between the Company’s U.S. GAAP tax provision and a pro forma tax provision based upon the Company’s adjusted net income before taxes as well as the impact from certain discrete tax items. The methodology utilized for calculating the Company’s adjusted net income tax provision is the same methodology utilized in calculating the Company’s U.S. GAAP tax provision.\nFor the same reasons, WEX believes that adjusted net income may also be useful to investors as one means of evaluating the Company's performance. However, because adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure, it should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income as used by WEX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nThe table below shows the impact of certain macro factors on reported revenue:\nExhibit 2 Segment Revenue Results\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nTravel and Corporate\nHealth and Employee\nFleet Solutions Solutions\nBenefit Solutions\nTotal WEX Inc.
