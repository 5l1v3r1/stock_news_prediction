Hoelzen, who previously served as the school’s director of operations, has also assumed the role of publisher for the school’s monthly real estate publication, the Arizona Journal of Real Estate & Business.\nAfter graduating from Arizona State University, Hoelzen spent more than a decade in television and radio, serving in production, marketing and business development roles. His first involvement in real estate and lending education came in 2006, and he joined the Arizona Academy of Real Estate as president and part owner in 2010. The school then merged with ASREB in February 2017, and Hoelzen was named director of operations. In this role, he was instrumental in building a team of experienced, forward-thinking professionals from the ground up, helping the school continue to meet the increasing demand for well-trained, real-estate professionals.\n“It’s an honor to be chosen as president for ASREB, and I look forward to ways that I can encourage our teams to strengthen our community involvement and continue the out-of-the-box thinking that has established our school as an industry leader for more than 40 years,” said Hoelzen. “My time in adult education has been extremely rewarding, and I’m excited to continue building relationships, which will help to establish protections for our industry and keep us in the forefront as we progress into the future.”\nFounded in 1969, the Arizona School of Real Estate & Business is one of the largest schools of its kind, with five campuses across the state. The school offers license and non-license education for real estate, mortgage, appraisal, contracting and insurance, and it was recently recognized as a 2018 top 10 “Specialized Education” organization in the state by Ranking Arizona: The Best of Arizona Business.\n“We are committed to providing the highest quality professional education and know the opportunities for growth in our industry are endless,” said Linda Hondros, president of the Hondros Family of Companies. “Under Nate’s leadership, we will take the industry under our wing and set the bar very high.”\nHoelzen also credits the school’s Arizona Journal of Real Estate & Business publication as a great resource for learning and brainstorming new topics of interest and potential course offerings for today’s professionals. The one-of-a-kind monthly publication has been in circulation for more than 30 years and is distributed to more than 100,000 print and digital readers around the country.\nTo learn more about the Arizona School of Real Estate & Business, visit http://www.asreb.com/ .\nAbout Hondros Education Group\nHondros Education Group consists of leading real estate education companies that focus on classroom and online delivery as well as exam prep and textbooks.
