But Malaysian assets traded offshore took a beating. The ringgit’s one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 1.2 percent after the opposition victory.\nThe offshore ringgit’s fall and a rise in the cost of insuring Malaysia’s debt showed how nervous investors were about the stunning election defeat of a coalition ruling the country for six decades.\n“Some campaign promises, if implemented without any other adjustments, would be credit negative for Malaysia’s sovereign,” Moody’s said, citing the proposed abolishment of the goods and services tax and the reintroduction of fuel subsidies. {nL3N1SG7LP]\nCapital Economics said that the economy “has cooled in recent quarters, and political uncertainty following yesterday’s shock election result has increased the downside risks to growth.” MODERATE INFLATION\nIn its statement on Thursday’s policy decision, BNM made no mention of the election. Officials did not meet reporters.\n“At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid lower inflation,” the central bank’s statement said.\nBNM said headline inflation is expected to remain moderate over the year. Headline inflation slowed in the first quarter, with the annual rate declining to 1.3 percent in March - its slowest in nearly two years.\nAt its meeting in January, when inflation was higher, the central bank raised its rate 25 basis points to “normalise” policy.\nThe January hike was BNM’s first since July 2014, and the first change since July 2016, when there was a 25 basis point cut.\nMalaysia reported 2017 full-year growth of 5.9 percent. Growth of between 5.0 and 5.5 percent is forecast for this year.\nThe central bank said it expects a stronger ringgit exchange rate this year will mitigate import costs.\n“However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain,” BNM said.
