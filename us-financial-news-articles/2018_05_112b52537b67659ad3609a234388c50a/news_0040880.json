Two Argentine citizens and an unspecified number of Mexicans were among the dead, the Argentine and Mexican governments said.\nCuban investigators were working around the clock at the site of the crash, an agricultural area some 20 km (12 miles) south of Havana, sifting through the burned wreckage for evidence, Cuban officials said.\n“This is a very unexpected death, she didn’t deserve it, my grandmother was a strong person,” said Cuban 18-year old student Katherine Lucia Martinez, bursting into tears and clinging to her father.\nHer 60-year old grandmother was among the dead, and she was waiting with other relatives of the deceased at a Havana hotel for an update from the authorities.\nPresident Miguel Diaz-Canel on Saturday visited the morgue where the victims are being identified. The crash is the first big test of his presidency after taking over office from Raul Castro just last month.\nOn Friday he also visited the site of the crash.\nCuban specialists have recovered one of the plane’s black boxes in “good conditions,” the transport minister Adel Yzquierdo told Cuban state TV on Saturday.\nSome locals said they saw the plane on fire before it hit the ground.\n“The plane was on fire, it flipped and then nosedived,” said Marino Perez Alvaredo, a farmer.\nThe Mexican transport department said on its website, “During take-off (the plane) apparently suffered a problem and dived to the ground.”\nThe Boeing 737-201 aircraft was built in 1979 and leased by Cuban airline Cubana from a small Mexican company called Damojh, according to the Mexican government.\nDamojh in Mexico said it did not immediately have any more information. Cubana declined to comment.\nMexico said it would send a team of investigators from its Directorate General of Civil Aeronautics on Saturday. Most aircraft accidents take months to investigate.\nThe crash was the worst since a Soviet-made Ilyushin-62M passenger plane crashed near Havana in 1989 killing all 126 people on board.
