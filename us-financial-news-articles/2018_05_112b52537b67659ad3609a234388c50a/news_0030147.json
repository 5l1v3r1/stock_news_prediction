Myanmar police spokesman Myo Thu Soe declined to comment.\nA growing anti-war youth movement, which in recent months has spread to various parts of the country, has exposed frustration with Suu Kyi’s struggle to fulfil her promise to end decades of war by autonomy-seeking ethnic minority guerrillas in lawless border lands.\nMore than 6,000 people have fled their homes since an army offensive against the Kachin Independence Army, an ethnic rebel group, and rescue workers say hundreds of villagers are stuck in danger zones.\nFighting has also intensified in other ethnic minority areas.\nOne of the protesters who was detained and later released was Khin Sandar Tun, 29, a Muslim from the Kaman ethnic group in the violence-torn Rakhine State and one of Myanmar’s most well-known peace and interfaith activists.\n“Five of them grabbed my arm and threw me into the truck even though I told them I would come along. I can’t move my arm up, and I’m still in pain,” said Khin Sandar Tun who was released on Sunday, told Reuters by telephone.\nThe embassies of Sweden and Denmark have called on the government to amend the protest legislation which was made more restrictive in March.
