However, two consecutive double faults as she had three set points in the opening set’s tiebreak threw her off balance.\nMladenovic, who recently beat former French Open finalist Sam Stosur, never recovered and allowed world number 107 Petkovic to claim only her third victory on the main tour this year — also her fifth in as many encounters between the two.\nMladenovic started confidently on the Suzanne Lenglen court, where last year she beat then defending champion Garbine Muguruza to reach the last eight, opening up a 2-0 lead.\nBut Petkovic broke back and forced a tiebreak, in which the Frenchwoman, seeded 29th, went 6-3 ahead.\nThe mercury rose in the stadium with the crowd chanting ‘Kiki, Kiki!’ to support a player who set their hearts on fire last year.\nMladenovic, however, collapsed, serving two consecutive double faults on set points and eventually losing the tiebreak 12-10 as she netted a forehand.\nPetkovic suffered late jitters as she served a double fault on match point, but on her fourth attempt, Mladenovic returned long.\nPetkovic next faces Sweden’s Johanna Larsson or American Bethanie Mattek-Sands.
