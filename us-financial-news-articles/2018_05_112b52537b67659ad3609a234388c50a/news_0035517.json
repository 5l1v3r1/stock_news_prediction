It increased its share of the fast recovering Irish mortgage market to 14 percent.\nIt targeted 13-17 percent by the end of 2018 when it re-listed on the stock exchange three years ago.\n“The decision to reduce Project Glas is sensible as it enables the sale process to progress at a time of ongoing strong investor appetite for Irish non-performing assets,” analysts at Davy Stockbrokers wrote in a note.\n“Alternative options are under consideration for the remainder of the original portfolio, which, in our opinion, may result in a more benign outcome than an outright sale.” Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T10:57:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
