Domestic sales rose 1.7 percent.\nCommenting on the outlook, TIM referred to targets set out in its 2018-2020 industrial plan unveiled in March.\nAdjusted net debt stood at 25.54 billion euros by the end of March, in line with expectations.\nIn a separate statement, TIM said Vivendi was no longer a party exercising control and coordination over the company.\nThe French group’s control and coordination started after Vivendi appointed two-thirds of the phone group’s board last year and named its own CEO as TIM’s executive chairman. Vivendi lost control of the board after a shareholder vote on May 4.\n$1 = 0.8475 euros Reporting by Agnieszka Flak\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:44:32.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
