REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha The drama came after the scandal-plagued former premier, whose ruling coalition was ousted in a general election this week, said in a Twitter message earlier on Saturday that he planned to take a short break with his family.\nTwo sources told Reuters on Friday that new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad planned to reopen investigations into a massive graft scandal that had plagued Najib since 2015.\nThe crowd at the airport tried to block cars entering the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport near the Malaysian capital, but were held back by guards.\nRiot police officers stand guard outside an entrance to Subang airport near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, May 12, 2018.

Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with 1MDB.\nWriting by Raju Gopalakrishnan; Editing by John Chalmers\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T08:03:55.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
