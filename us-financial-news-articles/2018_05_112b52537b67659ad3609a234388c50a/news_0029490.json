And so you give it everything on an out-lap and you still don’t have your tyres in the (performance) window.\n“This year they’re just too hard. That’s why everyone struggles. I don’t understand why they worked in Australia and haven’t worked ever since and today we have them working.” (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T14:49:05.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
