Trump himself is known to watch and tweet his reactions to early morning American programs.\nAsked if Israel is prepared to go to war against Iran over the issue, Netanyahu told CNN: “Nobody’s seeking that kind of development. Iran is the one that’s changing the rules in the region.”\nIran, which has always said its nuclear program was for strictly peaceful means, dismissed Netanyahu’s presentation on Monday as propaganda.\nTrump faces a May 12 deadline to decide whether to pull the United States out of the 2015 agreement, which offered Tehran relief from international sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.\n“I trust his judgment,” Netanyahu told Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” program, a show Trump has frequently praised. “He’ll do the right thing.”\nNetanyahu said the nuclear deal would need “a major overhaul,” but that Trump would have to make that decision.\nThe prime minister also echoed Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal.”\n“This regime had a secret nuclear weapons program and they’re trying under a very bad deal to get a nuclear arsenal. They shouldn’t get it,” he told Fox, adding: “It really needs a new deal.”\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T14:38:00.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
