Now 29 years old and based in Washington D.C., he started 734 Coffee in 2015, using the profits to pay for the education of displaced children like him.\nThe coffee comes from Gambella in Ethiopia where more than 400,000 South Sudanese refugees live in camps, the U.N. says. Gambella’s geographical coordinates - 7˚N 34˚E - give the coffee its name.\nReath has gone from selling 10 bags a month to about 4,000 bags currently and is hoping the business advice will help him create new markets for his coffee and raise awareness.\n“There are people who want to do good for refugees but they don’t know what to do,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“Maybe if they see all these projects, it will shed light on this issue.”\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing Katy Migiro.
