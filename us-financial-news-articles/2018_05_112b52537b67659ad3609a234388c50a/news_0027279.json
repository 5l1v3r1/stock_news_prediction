Aiello was convicted of one count of conspiracy, while Gerardi was acquitted. The jury said it was deadlocked on the charges against Kelly.\nProsecutors said that Kelly bribed Percoco by giving his wife a mostly no-show job that paid $90,000 a year for three years in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to win favorable treatment from state officials for two power plant projects.\nThey said Aiello and Gerardi paid bribes through shell companies to get favorable treatment for development of a parking lot.\nAiello and Gerardi are expected to face a second trial later this year on charges that they took part in bid-rigging involving a billion-dollar development project in Buffalo, New York. Alain Kaloyeros, former president of the State University of New York’s Polytechnic Institute, also faces charges at that trial.\nKelly’s plea came just minutes after former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was found guilty of corruption charges following a trial before Caproni.\nThe cases against Percoco and Silver were among a series of high-profile corruption prosecutions launched by former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.\nFormer state Senate leader Dean Skelos, a Republican, was also convicted of corruption charges, but like Silver, he had his verdict overturned on appeal. Prosecutors have said they plan to try him again.\n(Corrects headline and paragraphs 1 and 3 to state that Kelly pleaded guilty to lying to his company, not to bribery.)\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-12T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T01:02:21.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
