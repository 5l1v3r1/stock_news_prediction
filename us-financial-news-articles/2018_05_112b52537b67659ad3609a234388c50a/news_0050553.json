In a regulatory filing Miller had accused the company of “governance shenanigans” as it appeared unclear how many directors would be elected at Wednesday’s meeting.\nThe company’s stock price, which had tumbled some 30 percent over the last 52 weeks, climbed 5.5 percent to $2.87 in mid-morning trading. Over the last five years, the stock price has fallen from roughly $30 a share.\nOther large investors including Royce & Associates, Renaissance Technologies, and the Vanguard Group.
