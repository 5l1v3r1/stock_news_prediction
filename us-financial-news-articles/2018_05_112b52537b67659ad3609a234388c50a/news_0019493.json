Senior CFP Board Ambassador Jill Schlesinger, CFP®, said now is the time for consumers to prepare for a market that doesn't always go up.\nWhile hard to predict exactly when any recession will occur, it is best advised to manage finances with awareness that both a recession and a bear market are unavoidable. Schlesinger shares what you can do now to be better prepared when the market shifts:\nRevisit/Create Your Financial Plan : As flight attendants remind us, \"items may have shifted during flight.\" The same goes for your finances – hopefully for the better, but regardless, right after tax season is a good time to update the game plan. Maintain a Healthy Emergency Reserve Fund : For those still working, maintain six to 12 months of expenses (12 to 24 months for retirees) in a safe, liquid account. Pay Down Debt : There's nothing like a recession and bear market to expose the dangers of carrying too much debt. Maintain a Diversified Portfolio : Don't forget to rebalance by trading up assets to maintain your desired level of asset allocation.\nRead Schlesinger's full blog post here with more details.\nFor additional guidance, a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional can help you develop/update a financial plan, share best practices for building an emergency fund and paying down debt, and assist in creating and managing a diversified investment portfolio.\nABOUT CFP BOARD\nThe mission of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. is to benefit the public by granting the CFP® certification and upholding it as the recognized standard of excellence for competent and ethical personal financial planning.
