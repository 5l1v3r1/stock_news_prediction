She is based at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square.\nHer health care coverage at CNBC has focused on how policies out of Washington, ranging from the implementation of Obamacare to the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the law, have impacted businesses that provide health coverage for Americans. These days, the story is all about how the health care industry is trying to change with the times, using technology like IBM Watson to improve cancer care and Amazon's Alexa to help seniors stay healthier and pursuing new mergers to respond to growing pressure from consumers, big employers and the government to reign in sky-high costs.\nAt CNBC's Healthy Returns conference this year, Coombs hosted a panel on innovation with the CEO of Cigna who told her that health care companies now need to help us with more than just one thing -- they need to offer more value while helping us get healthier.\nBefore joining CNBC, Coombs was a reporter and anchor for the online business network, Yahoo Finance Vision and served as a freelance reporter for the former CNNfn financial network. Prior, she served as a reporter for ABC News One and a substitute anchor for World News Now and World News This Morning , and held reporting and anchoring positions at WABC-TV in New York, WPLG-TV in Miami and WFSB-TV in Hartford, Connecticut.\nCoombs is a graduate of Yale University and was awarded the Leo Beranek Reporter Training Fellowship at WCVB-TV in Boston. Born in Havana, Cuba, she speaks fluent Spanish.\nFollow Bertha Coombs on Twitter @ berthacoombs and LinkedIn berthacoombs .
