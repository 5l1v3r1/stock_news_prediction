That was the last time I got angry, I pulled out my trusty blade and stuck it in the table and said: 'You've got to get rid of this man.'\"\nNow, it's the U.S. that has the problem, Richards suggested. \"Now America has to get rid of him. Don't say I didn't warn you,\" he added.\nshow chapters Rock ‘n’ roll legend selling NYC penthouse for $11 million 10:45 AM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 | 01:13 Richards has previously voiced his opinion on Trump, before he was elected, telling Rolling Stone magazine in 2015 : \"Can you imagine President Trump? The worst nightmare. But we can't say that. Because it could happen.\"\nTrump used the Stones' track \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" during his 2016 election campaign, which frontman Mick Jagger said Tuesday was a strange choice.\n\"He used it on everything. He used it on every rally through the election campaign. I wasn't the DJ obviously, but if I was Donald's DJ… it's a funny song for your play-out song. When he finished the speech, he played this out, this sort of doomy ballad about drugs in Chelsea,\" he told the BBC.\n\"It's kind of weird if you think about it, but he couldn't be persuaded to use something else, it was an odd thing, very odd.\"\nJagger, who was speaking ahead of the U.K. leg of the band's \"No Filter\" tour, also raised concerns about Brexit.\n\"I'm not really happy about the status quo,\" he said. \"In the U.K., I think we're going through a particularly difficult moment and it's very hard to understand all the difficulties we're having with Brexit and everything… The current government seems to be having a very hard time to navigate through it.\"\n\"I know it's a complex problem, but everyone would like to see a fast resolution and a united front and some leadership that's united rather than split,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:43:53.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
