Photo: AHMED DEEB FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AZAZ, Syria—Rabea al-Khateeb planned to sell his rifle when he arrived here, believing his days as a rebel fighter were over after he left Damascus’s war-torn suburbs with his eight-months-pregnant wife.\nBut after weeks of fruitlessly looking for work, Mr. Khateeb joined another armed group. He doesn’t know its name, or whom he might end up fighting, but the job pays about $40 a month.\nMr. Khateeb is among tens of thousands of Syrians who have fled the Assad regime’s advances in Homs, Damascus and elsewhere in recent months, only to find economic desperation in one of Syria’s last opposition strongholds . The extreme financial hardship in the rebel-held northwest highlights a challenge in ending the violence afflicting the country, as aid groups struggle to deliver sustainable help and young men with few prospects join armed factions for a salary.\nOver the course of Syria’s seven-year war, more than 1.5 million people have been displaced to the region—a swath that now stretches through parts of northern Aleppo province and much of Idlib province along the Turkish border. The numbers have picked up in recent months as Mr. Assad captures other pockets of rebel control through brutal siege and bombardment tactics with the backing of Russia and Iran.\nFew of the new arrivals here have found work in the cities or tent encampments popping up across this agricultural region known for its olive groves. In and around the town of Azaz alone, about 30 miles north of the city of Aleppo, there are an estimated 30,000 families living in tent camps, some run by aid groups or local authorities, some of them informal. Many people are unable to leave because of lack of work, said Waleed Alito, a local manager of the charity Ihsan.\nRabea al-Khateeb, 24, a former Free Syrian Army fighter from the Damascus suburbs, fled to Azaz to build a new life.

At times the air attacks have targeted busy markets, maximizing the death toll and striking at the region’s already shaky economic situation.\nThe area is controlled by a wide mix of rebel factions, some of whom receive backing from outside powers such as Turkey, Gulf Arab states and even the U.S. Others are self-funded through checkpoints and taxing commerce. Occasional battles between the factions further undermine stability.\nThe region’s main business, farming, has suffered as fields have also become targets for airstrikes. Many newcomers are from urban areas, with no experience in farming. While there are plans to develop industrial zones in at least two cities in northern Aleppo province—the largest by Turkey and a much smaller one by local officials and charities—the plans are still in their early stages and depend on reliable water and electricity.\nIn the village of Kafra, east of Azaz, Nuria Haj Khaled, a widowed 43-year-old mother of four, said food aid from the local council had dried up. Her economic hopes are now pinned on a single dairy cow she received from Ihsan, a farm animal that saves her and her children from working for $2 a day in the area’s pistachio and olive fields.\nA member of the Ihsan charity checks dairy cows to be delivered to aid recipients.

A neighbor pointed him in the direction of a local rebel faction, one of several Turkish-backed groups, that was hiring.\n“I didn’t want to join, but I have my first child on the way, what else can I do?” said Mr. Khateeb, who spent years fighting the Assad regime in his hometown in the Ghouta suburb outside Damascus. “I go into a shop to look for work and I find four workers already there and the owner tells me,‘I have four workers, I don’t know what to do with them.’”\nMore people arrive in the region every few weeks, exacerbating overcrowding and economic strain.\nAid groups are trying innovative forms of assistance, like microloans or livestock, but are running into resistance from international donors who prefer more traditional charity like rental assistance or food baskets.\n“Tell them we’re going to dig a well, everyone gives,” said Muhammad Baha, a director with the Turkey-based charity Ataa, which has been operating a microloan program for four years. “But tell them this is development, there is very little response.”\nA Syrian vendor arranges his products in a market in Azaz.

Photo: Ahmed Deeb for The Wall Street Journal This corner of Syria faces additional obstacles because of the scattered presence of armed groups like Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham—formerly linked to al Qaeda and espousing an extreme religious ideology. Vocational centers for men and women have come under close scrutiny by HTS, which is designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and others.\n“They are always asking us, \"What are you training? What’s the curriculum? Is there mixing between men and women?” Mr. Samoudi said.\nIn January, Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham seized 20 trucks of seeds being sent to support local agriculture, according to an aid worker. The armed faction eventually returned the shipments—after posting photos of their capture online— but the charity that sent the seeds is now reconsidering its involvement in that part of Syria, the Syrian aid worker said.\nThe situation in the northwest has been even further complicated recently as Turkish-backed rebel groups launched an offensive to capture predominantly Kurdish areas. More battles could loom as young men like Mr. Khateeb suddenly find themselves fighting a foe other than the Assad regime.\nThe towns and tent camps, with thousands of young, poor men, here provide a fertile ground for armed groups to recruit.\n“All the groups have offices,” said Abdulsalam Hafiz, a rebel fighter from the nearby town of Marea. “And men can just walk in and join.”\nSyrians walk in an Azaz market.
