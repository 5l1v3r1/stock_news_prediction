The more important question is how the U.S. will react after the official results,\" Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, told CNBC in a phone interview Tuesday.\n\"If U.S. refineries are forbidden from buying Venezuelan crude then you'd have to imagine the country is in trouble,\" he added.\nWhen asked whether oil traders should expect to see sanctions imposed against Venezuela after the Latin American country's vote, Vargas replied: \"Knowing Donald Trump , it is more likely than simply just a prospect because he likes playing hardball, he isn't fainthearted and he is not afraid to punish countries.\"\nFar-reaching economic sanctions A move to directly target Venezuela's oil industry would likely constitute a huge sucker punch to Maduro's socialist administration, which is depending almost entirely on crude sales to try and decelerate a deepening economic crisis.\nIn February, then U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said sanctioning Venezuela's oil or prohibiting the crude to be sold in the U.S. was something the White House would continue to mull over.\nREUTERS | Marco Bello President Nicolas Maduro gestures as he registers his candidacy for re-election at the National Electoral Council (CNE) headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela February 27, 2018.
