(NASDAQ: GHDX) today reported financial results and business progress for the 2018.\n\"In the first quarter of 2018, we delivered 13 percent growth in revenue and delivered a non-GAAP profit demonstrating continued operating leverage for the 11 th consecutive quarter of improved profitability,\" said Kim Popovits , chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of Genomic Health. \"We delivered a strong start to the year with multiple revenue drivers, including the implementation of PAMA and AJCC breast cancer staging criteria, and the recent strengthening of NCCN prostate cancer guidelines. With several additional catalysts on the near-term horizon, including ECOG's presentation of TAILORx results at ASCO and the anticipated finalization of the Medicare LCD for the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect test, we expect strong revenue growth in the second half of the year.\"\nPre-606 Adjusted Revenue\nEffective January 1, 2018, the company adopted the new ASC 606 accounting standard for revenue, using the modified retrospective method, which applies the new standard prospectively and does not impact prior years' financial statements.

Multiple private insurers established new coverage for the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test, bringing the total number of U.S. covered lives to more than 71 million. Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom issued a revised Diagnostics Consultation Document (DCD) including the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test for continued use to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative early-stage breast cancer. Secured tender with the UNICANCER hospital group in France for the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test increasing access to approximately 20 percent of the French market. Established new public coverage for the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test in Germany, bringing the total number of German covered lives to more than 17 million. Secured public coverage with the province of Manitoba for the use of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test in early-stage breast cancer patients with node-negative disease, increasing the total number of covered lives in Canada to 35 million. The Oncologist published positive results from a study conducted by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Canada, demonstrating a 37 percent reduction in chemotherapy among breast cancer patients with up to three positive nodes, as well as an increase in physicians' and patients' confidence (49 and 54 percent, respectively) when Oncotype DX was used to make adjuvant treatment decisions. Presented results from three studies at the 11 th European Breast Cancer Conference (EBCC-11) in March. Received acceptance to present two studies utilizing the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score test at the American Urological Association Annual Meeting in May.\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nThe company makes reference in this press release to \"non-GAAP operating income (loss)\" which excludes 2018 expenses resulting from the restructuring charges for the cessation of Oncotype SEQ, including the Oncotype SEQ Liquid Select™ test, and Oncotype SEQ product development and commercialization activities (restructuring charges). Additionally, the company references \"non-GAAP net income (loss)\" which excludes the Q1 2018 restructuring charges as well as fair value adjustments related to its collaborations with Biocartis and Cleveland Diagnostics in the first quarter of 2018 and the gain on sale of marketable equity securities in the first quarter of 2017. The company believes that excluding these items and their related tax effects from its financial results reflects operating results that are more indicative of the company's ongoing operating performance while improving comparability to prior periods, and, as such, may provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the company's past financial performance and prospects for the future. The company also considers the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on its global business as described in the constant currency table accompanying this press release. The company's management uses such non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate and assess its core operations and to make ongoing operating decisions. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income (loss) from operations or net income (loss) information prepared in accordance with GAAP. An explanation and reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this press release.\nConference Call Details\nTo access the live conference call today, May 2, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time via phone, please dial (877) 303-7208 from the United States and Canada, or +1 (224) 357-2389 internationally.
