The memo is below:\nTo ensure that Tesla is well prepared for the future, we have been undertaking a thorough reorganization of our company. As part of the reorg, we are flattening the management structure to improve communication, combining functions where sensible and trimming activities that are not vital to the success of our mission.\nTo be clear, we will continue to hire rapidly in critical hourly and salaried positions to support the Model 3 production ramp and future product development.\nMusk talked about a reorganization during the company’s first quarter earnings call that took a bizarre turn after the CEO stopped taking questions from analysts and instead turned to a YouTube blogger who was on the call to represent retail investors. Musk said that a reorganization would help the company achieve profitability.\nBut at the time, it appeared Musk was directing his reorganizational efforts on contractors.\n“The number of sort of third-party contracting companies that we’re using has really gotten out of control, so we’re going to scrub the barnacles on that front,” Musk said on the call. “It’s pretty crazy. We’ve got barnacles on barnacles. So there’s going to be a lot of barnacle removal.”\nThe memo follows the departure of Tesla executives, including senior vice president of engineering Doug Field, who is taking a break from but is not leaving the company, and Matthew Schwall, who left as director of field performance engineering and joined self-driving car company Waymo.", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143"], "published": "2018-05-14T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T20:19:10.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
