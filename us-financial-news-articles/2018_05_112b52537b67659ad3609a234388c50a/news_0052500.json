(NASDAQCM: MICT) announced today that it has completed the previously announced sale of its wholly owned aerospace and defense subsidiary, Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd., or Enertec, to Coolisys Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of DPW Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: DPW).\n\"With the closing of this transaction and with a stronger balance sheet, MICT will focus, in advancing its potential opportunities in the multi-billion dollar Mobile Resources Management (MRM) space. We have added over $4.7 million in cash and strengthened our balance sheet by removing the entire debt of Enertec, which totaled approximately $4.0 million, bringing overall effective transaction price to $8.7 million for all of Enertec's assets and liabilities.\nWith the sale of Enertec, we expect our gross margins to improve significantly,\" said David Lucatz, Chief Executive Officer of Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc.\n\"We intend to invest our resources into increasing our sales momentum in MRM, which produced 121% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2018, with improving margins and a backlog of $4.7 million. With a fortified balance sheet, we believe that MICT is well positioned for both organic growth and expansion through acquisitions.\"\nMICT received over $4.7 million in cash at the closing (of which 10% will be held in escrow for up to 14 months after the Closing to satisfy certain potential indemnification claims). The final consideration amount was adjusted pursuant to the terms of the agreement with DPW as a result of adjustments relating to certain debts and cash balances of Enertec at closing. Coolisys also assumed approximately $4.0 million of Enertec's debt.\n\"We wish Coolisys success with its acquisition of Enertec, and we believe our former Enertec customers and employees will be well served by Coolisys Technologies and DPW Holdings,\" Lucatz added.\nMicronet Enertec intends to change its name in the near future.\nAbout Micronet Enertec Technologies, Inc.\nMicronet Enertec Technologies, Inc.
