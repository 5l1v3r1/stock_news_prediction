If the results of the general election cannot be implemented, the formation of a new government could be at risk,” they said in a statement that echoed concerns voiced by the electoral commission.\nLast year, a Croat parliamentary bloc proposed restricting people in some electoral districts to voting for their own community’s representatives at all levels of government, a move that Bosniak parties rejected.\nThere are few signs of a workable compromise emerging from a final round of talks between the two sides scheduled for Thursday.\nCroat nationalists say they want to prevent Muslim Bosniaks, the majority group in their joint federation, from facilitating the election of Croats of non-nationalist persuasion.\nBosniak parties fear the proposal could be a prelude to the Croats forging a separatist entity.\nDuring the war, Bosnian Croats and Serbs fought to carve out ethnic statelets and drove out rival communities, mainly Bosnian Muslims, leaving 100,000 people dead and about two million homeless.\nBosniaks and Croats formed a joint federation under the peace deal, which also granted Serbs their own autonomous entity within Bosnia.
