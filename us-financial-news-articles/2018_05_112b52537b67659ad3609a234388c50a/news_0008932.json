He and the three other suspects are prohibited from leaving the country without the court’s permission.\nThe case has generated a lot of attention in Thailand and has been the subject of dark comedy jokes and public demonstrations in Bangkok with demonstrators demanding justice.\nThere have also been calls for Premchai to step down.\nPremchai has rarely commented on the case except to say that he is innocent.\nCritics say Thailand’s judicial system often favors the rich and famous and that those who are well connected often get away with crimes.\nUnderage driver Orachorn Thephasadin na Ayudhya was given a suspended two-year prison sentence in 2012 for causing the deaths of nine people when the car she was driving collided with a passenger van.\nThat case caused outrage among Thais on social media over how a girl with an aristocratic family surname managed to escape jail.\nReporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat and Panu Wongcha-um; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T14:51:01.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
