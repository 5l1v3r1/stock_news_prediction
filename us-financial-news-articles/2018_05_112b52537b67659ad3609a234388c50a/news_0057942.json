I don’t see anything that is going to arrest that anytime soon,” he added.\nThe single currency on Tuesday slipped below $1.16 for the first time since November 2017 to hit a 10-month low of $1.1506 and weakened significantly against the safe-haven Swiss franc and Japanese yen. The euro is set for its biggest monthly drop in more than three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe dollar strengthened across most of the foreign exchange market, not just against the euro, in a flight-to-safety move. But the risk-off trade also benefited the yen, with the dollar dropping about 0.6 percent on Tuesday to a five-week low of 108.41 against the Japanese currency.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was up half a percent on the day at 95.025, hitting a 6-1/2 month high.\nReporting by Kate Duguid, Saikat Chatterjee and Tom Finn; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-05-29T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T03:36:08.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
