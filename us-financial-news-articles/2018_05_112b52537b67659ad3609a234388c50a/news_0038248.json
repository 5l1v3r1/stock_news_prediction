A separate police investigation is under way which could result in criminal charges.\nThe areas under investigation by both the public inquiry and the police include whether safety standards were met in the design, construction, maintenance and refurbishment of the building.\nSome former residents had said before the blaze that they had serious safety concerns about various features of the building, but that their warnings fell on deaf ears.
