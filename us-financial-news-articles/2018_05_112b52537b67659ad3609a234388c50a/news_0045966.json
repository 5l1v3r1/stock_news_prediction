Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is battling brain cancer, wasn’t at the vote. But Mr. McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said in a statement that he believed her involvement in a controversial program of interrogations run by the agency after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks disqualified her.\nOther senators expressed concern about her authorship of a memo that led to the destruction of 92 videotapes of those interrogations.\nDuring her confirmation process, Ms. Haspel renounced the harsh interrogation practices said the U.S. wouldn’t reinstate them while she was director.\nMs. Haspel worked as a case officer in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Africa and Europe. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ms. Haspel became an intelligence-operations officer and rose up the ranks of the agency’s Russia operations.\nOver the course of her career, Ms. Haspel four times served as chief of station—the top CIA official in a country responsible for all the agency’s operations there. In recent years, Ms. Haspel served in several top roles in the division of the CIA responsible for covert operations.\nWrite to Nancy A.
