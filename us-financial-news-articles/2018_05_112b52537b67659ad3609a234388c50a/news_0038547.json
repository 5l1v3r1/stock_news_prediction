Hayes, Jr. stated, “In recent weeks, we have received input from a number of our stockholders who have indicated an interest in purchasing additional shares of our common stock in the open market and have requested exemptions from our tax benefits preservation plan’s ownership limits.” Continued Mr. Hayes, “While we remain committed to preserving our close to $80 million in federal NOLs, we have worked closely with our advisors to structure an exemption process that we believe balances our need to preserve our NOLs with the interest of stockholders in increasing their ownership stake in Alaska Communications.”\nAs Alaska Communications previously disclosed, on January 8, 2018, its Board adopted the tax benefits preservation plan to preserve the federal net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) that Alaska Communications has generated from historical tax losses from being limited by the application of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2017, Alaska Communications had approximately $78.1 million of (pre-tax) federal NOLs, with various expiration dates beginning in 2031 through 2037, which could potentially be utilized in certain circumstances to offset Alaska Communications’ future taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability.\nAlaska Communications’ ability to benefit from its NOLs would be substantially limited by Section 382 if an “ownership change” occurred. A company experiences an “ownership change” for tax purposes if the percentage of stock owned by one or a group of its 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period over the lowest percentage of stock of such corporation owned by such stockholders at any time during that period. To protect Alaska Communications’ NOLs from being limited or permanently lost under Section 382, the tax benefits preservation plan is intended to deter any person or group from acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of Alaska Communications’ outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board and, thereby, reduce the likelihood of an unintended “ownership change.” Each exemption that the Board approves pursuant to the exemption request process being announced today will bring Alaska Communications closer to experiencing an “ownership change” under Section 382. Accordingly, there is no assurance that, ultimately, Alaska Communications does not experience an “ownership change” as a result of one or more exemptions being granted pursuant to the exemption request process.\nThe complete exemption request process will be included as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K that Alaska Communications is filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A copy of the exemption request process can also be obtained by visiting the Alaska Communications investor relations website at www.alsk.com .\nAbout Alaska Communications Systems\nAlaska Communications (NASDAQ: ALSK) is the leading provider of advanced broadband and managed IT services for businesses and consumers in Alaska.
