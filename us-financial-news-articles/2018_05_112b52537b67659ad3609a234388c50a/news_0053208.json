REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\nThe bay, on Phi Phi Leh island in the Andaman Sea, was the main location of the 2000 film starring Leonardo Di Caprio, which revealed to viewers the stunning beauty of Thailand’s turquoise seas and white-powder beaches, spurring many to visit.\nUp to 5,000 visitors go to the beach every day, says Thailand’s tourism agency, traveling by speedboat and ferries to Maya Bay, which is sheltered by 100-meter high cliffs.\nThe closure from June 1 is a bid to salvage the area’s coral reefs, which have been damaged by warmer temperatures and growing numbers of tourists.

I can take tourists to other beaches, like Monkey Beach and Bamboo Island.” Reporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre in BANGKOK and Soe Zeya Tun in PHI PHI ISLAND; Writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:29:17.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
