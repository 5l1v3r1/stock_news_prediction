There’s only Ferrari and Mercedes that he could ever consider, but currently here (Mercedes) that’s unlikely. I don’t think that’s going to happen.\n“I imagine Kimi’s going to want to continue (at Ferrari). Why not? He’s driving really well this year and he doesn’t seem to be ageing so I’m sure he’ll go for a little bit longer.”\nRicciardo won from pole on Sunday with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel second and championship leader Hamilton third.\nRed Bull, who have Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstapppen on a long-term deal, also want the 28-year-old to stay.\n“You could say the day’s maybe made Daniel more expensive, it’s put his value up,” Red Bull principal Christian Horner told reporters.\n“Or you could say it’s put the team in a stronger position in terms of its value and potential to him.”\nHorner hoped Ricciardo, who has now won two races this year and is third in the overall standings, could be signed up “in the next couple of months” but recognised much would depend on what engine Red Bull had.\nThe former champions use Renault units but have been linked to Honda, now with Red Bull-owned Toro Rosso, for 2019.\nWhile Ricciardo would be popular among Ferrari fans, as a driver of Italian extraction with a reputation for thrilling overtakes, the Italian team have Sauber’s 20-year-old Charles Leclerc as a future prospect.\nHamilton said Red Bull looked the best bet for Ricciardo but “it’s important in a team that you are valued at what you are worth”.\n“At the moment, he (Ricciardo) is pretty much the lead driver in that team, so it’s not a bad place to be,” he added.\n“But he should definitely have a contract on his table and his options ready.” (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, Editing by Alison Williams and Ed Osmond)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:20:48.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
