REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\nThe award, to a director who has won prizes at the festival before, defied speculation that the Palme might go to a female director, with three strong contenders in a year when the Hollywood sex scandal was the talk of the town.\nItalian actress Asia Argento, who has accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, said there were abusers in the audience who had yet to be outed.\nArgento said Weinstein raped her during the Cannes festival in 1997 when she was 21. “This festival was his hunting ground,” Argento said in a speech ahead of the prize-giving.\nWeinstein has denied allegations of non-consensual sex. His representative, Juda Engelmayer, was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. Argento’s London-based agent, Steve Kenis, was not immediately available to provide further details.\n“Even tonight, sitting among you, there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women,” Argento told the black-tie ceremony. 71st Cannes Film Festival – Closing ceremony and screening of the film \"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\" out of competition – Cannes, France, May 19, 2018.
