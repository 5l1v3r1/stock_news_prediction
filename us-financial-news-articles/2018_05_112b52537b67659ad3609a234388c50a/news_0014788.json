Traders work at Frankfurt's stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nAt 0738 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.05 percent with a flurry of first-quarter corporate earnings and mergers and acquisitions deals prompting sharp individual price moves.\nShares in Danish hearing aid maker William Demant ( WDH.CO ) were the worst performer, falling over 10 percent after warning that lower demand would weigh on sales.\nGerman postal and logistics group Deutsche Post DHL ( DPWGn.DE ) also disappointed investors by missing first-quarter profit expectations and saw its shares fall 6.7 percent.\nAmong European blue chips, Unilever posted the best performance, up 1.9 percent as it announced the start of a 6 billion euro share buyback scheme.\nIn London, Shire ( SHP.L ) added 2.8 percent after Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ) said it agreed to buy the group for 45.3 billion pounds ($61.50 billion) after it raised the cash element to secure a recommendation.\nSky ( SKYB.L ) was down 1.1 percent after U.S. cable operator Comcast ( CMCSA.O ) formally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain’s pay-TV group.\nSources also told Reuters earlier that Comcast was asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it could make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox agreed to sell to Walt Disney.
