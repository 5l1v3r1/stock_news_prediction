Such a fight could bring two mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models, driving up costs.\n\"The president will hear from the automaker CEOs about the impact of the rulemaking on the auto industry and their efforts to negotiate a 'National Program' with the state of California,\" Lindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:05:53.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
