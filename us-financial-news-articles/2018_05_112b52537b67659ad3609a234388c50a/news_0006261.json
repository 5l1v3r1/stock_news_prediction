Total revenue rose 16.8 percent to $298.2 million.\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of 71 cents per share and revenue of $292.2 million.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T15:32:26.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
