College student loans average $35,000, and renting or buying a home is unaffordable in most metro areas. Throw daycare costs of $10,000 a child into the mix, and families ask themselves: How can they afford a baby?\nChildcare is the third-largest expense in the family budget, behind food and housing, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which calculated last year that middle class families spend $233,610 raising a child to the age of 18.\nDaycare is a crisis and a much bigger problem than college, says Betsey Stevenson, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, who wonders why there is not a massive public outcry for relief.\nBoth presidential candidates raised the issue in the last campaign, and Congress then doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.\nBut there has been no daycare legislation. Rather than organizing politically, it appears that 20- and 30-somethings are voting with their reproductive systems.\nThe only age group with a rising fertility rate in 2017 was women 40 to 44 years old, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. In addition, 20 percent of parents in a Care.com survey said they would have fewer children than they wanted because of childcare costs.\nLisa Anderson, 30, is among the stressed-out mothers. She commutes daily from a rural home to work at her government consulting job in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota, devoting a quarter of her family income to her 10-month-old sons daycare.\nShe worries how she and her husband will afford a second child. Daycare for one baby costs close to $10,000; with two, it would total half of the couples take-home income.\nWith about $1,000 in monthly student loan payments, Im starting to regret what I spent on graduate school, Anderson said. But she and others in her generation cannot undo past decisions, they can only control when and if they'll have children.\nBIG COSTS\nFor working parents, daycare costs are rising at almost twice the nations inflation rate since the recession.\nGovernment guidelines suggest a ratio of 10 percent of income for childcare. But the median family with children under six earned $68,808 in 2016, about $20,000 short of making the median $8,320 annual daycare cost affordable, according to a Brookings Institute analysis of Census data.\nInfant care at $10,400 is harsher, and the quality daycare preferred by people with incomes over $150,000 costs $11,652, according to Brookings analyst Grover Whitehurst. In expensive areas of the country, that goes up to $18,000 per child.\nNannies are even more costly averaging about $28,905 a year nationally, according to Care.com. As a result, only about 4 percent of families use them, according to Census data.\nMost parents have limited options for cutting costs other than drawing on help from family, sharing caregivers, compromising quality and having fewer children.\nSome states offer subsidies, but most go to low-income people. Families get a little tax relief if they claim the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit at tax time or use a flexible spending account at work to stash money away for childcare on a pre-tax basis.\nFinancial planners calm parents by telling them they can catch up with retirement and college saving after their children enter school.\nBut Rachel Brewer, a San Diego mother of three children between seven and nine, questions that. Kids were the cheapest when babies. I spent $5 for a can of formula. Now, I sweat bullets every time I take the kids to the dentist, she said.
