Mandatory Credit: Terrence Lee-USA TODAY Sports By January, the French-Canadian with slick hands had earned a six-year, $30-million contract extension.\nMarchessault, 27, finished the season with 27 goals and 75 points. On Monday, he fired two goals in a 3-1 Vegas win over the Winnipeg Jets in the Manitoba capital. The NHL Western Conference Final is tied 1-1.\n“That’s the story of our club,” Marchessault said after the game. “Everybody just seized their opportunity here. We’re just a bunch of hockey players that wanted to find a home.\nMay 14, 2018; Winnipeg, Manitoba, CAN; Vegas Golden Knights center Jonathan Marchessault (81) skates with the puck past Winnipeg Jets left wing Kyle Connor (81) to score a goal during the first period in game two of the Western Conference Final of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs at Bell MTS Centre.

Mandatory Credit: Terrence Lee-USA TODAY Sports While Marchessault and goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were the stars on Monday for Vegas, the Golden Knights’ success was rooted in a relentless forecheck in the late first and third periods that caused the Jets to turn over the puck.\nIt was the across-the-board feistier effort by Vegas that Marchessault, who stands just 5’9, called for after losing the series opener on Saturday 4-2.\n“‘March’ was real good tonight, he scored two big goals, but I thought all our team did their jobs tonight,” said Vegas Coach Gerard Gallant.\nMarchessault was a surprise to be available in an expansion draft of players to stock Vegas in its inaugural season. He scored 30 goals last season with his old team, the Florida Panthers, by far a career best.\nThe Golden Knights became the first team to make the NHL playoffs in their first season, but have also won two rounds, over Los Angeles and San Jose.\n“Every time we need a big game, we show up. Tonight we showed up,” Marchessault said. “I think we showed the hockey world that we earned the right to be here.”\nGame 3 against Winnipeg moves to Las Vegas on Wednesday. The winner of the best-of-seven series plays the winner of the series between the Washington Capitals and Tampa Bay Lightning. Washington leads that series 2-0.\nReporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Peter Rutherford\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
