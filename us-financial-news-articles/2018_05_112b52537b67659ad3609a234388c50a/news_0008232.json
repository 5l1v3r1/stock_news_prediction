(\"ILG\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ILG) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company with Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (\"Marriott\") (NYSE: VAC) in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $4.7 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders will be entitled to receive $14.75 in cash and 0.165 of a Marriott share for each ILG share they own, representing consideration of $34.88 based on Marriott's April 30 opening price.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether ILG's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $38.00 per ILG share, or $3.12 more than the per-share consideration.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether ILG shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own ILG shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/ilg-inc/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-ilg-inc-acquisition-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-ilg-shareholders-300640611.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-ilg-inc-acquisition-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-ilg-shareholders-300640611.html", "http://www.weisslawllp.com/ilg-inc/"], "published": "2018-05-02T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T04:07:33.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
