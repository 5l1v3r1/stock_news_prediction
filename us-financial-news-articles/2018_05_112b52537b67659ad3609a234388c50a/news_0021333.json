(NASDAQ:OPGN) today reported financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and provided a summary of recent business highlights. Total revenue for 2018 was $0.85 million, up 10% from the $0.77 million reported in 2017. The net loss for 2018 was $3.0 million, a 39% decrease compared with the net loss of $5.0 million for 2017.\n“During the quarter our development efforts advanced for our Acuitas® AMR Gene Panel u5.47 for Research Use Only (RUO) test for infection control purposes and pharmaceutical surveillance studies,” said Evan Jones, Chairman and CEO of OpGen. “The test detects 5 pathogens and 47 gene targets that convey resistance to nine classes of antibiotics directly from urine and bacterial isolates. We were pleased to introduce the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 (RUO) during the quarter, and the clinical verification studies begun during the quarter are encouraging. Following discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in recent weeks, we are finalizing the clinical trial protocols for our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 in vitro diagnostic (IVD) 510(k) submissions. We continue to anticipate initial filings during the fourth quarter of 2018.\n“At last month’s European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, we presented the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel (RUO) analytical verification results for detecting multidrug-resistant pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes and the use of test results to predict antibiotic resistance using the bioinformatics capabilities of the Acuitas Lighthouse® Software,” he added. “Results were used with the Acuitas Lighthouse Software to predict phenotypic resistance for 35 isolates from the CDC & FDA Antibiotic Resistance Isolate Bank. The gene panel accurately semi-quantitated the organisms and resistance genes in our test with agreement to conventional microbiology ranging between 88% and 100%. Importantly, we were also able to reduce the time to result to two hours from sample, down from three hours previously and versus current standards that require up to two days.”\nMr. Jones continued, “During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston on a clinical verification study for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 test and Acuitas Lighthouse Software. We continue to pursue additional collaborations with prestigious health centers to evaluate potential diagnostic and antibiotic decision-making improvements that could be possible using rapid molecular testing and bioinformatics.\n“In April, we announced successful completion of a prospective clinical trial evaluating the impact of using rapid diagnostic testing for identification and treatment of bacteremia and fungemia in hospital intensive care units in Colombia. The study showed significant improvement in survival and reductions in antibiotic usage for patients receiving the OpGen rapid diagnostic test. Results will be presented at the American Society for Microbiology ASM Microbe 2018 meeting this June.”\n2018 First Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue : Total revenue for 2018 was $0.85 million, compared with $0.77 million for 2017.

Regained compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements for both minimum stockholders’ equity and minimum bid price. Continued to achieve stated operating expense reduction during the quarter, with a 33% reduction compared with 2017.\n“We made solid progress with our research and development, operations, and financial activities during the quarter. We are encouraged by the progress to date with our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for complicated urinary tract infections and we anticipate continuing progress towards accomplishment of our strategic objectives during 2018,” concluded Mr. Jones.\n2018 Outlook\nOpGen expects to advance the following business objectives during the remainder of 2018 as it transitions to the commercial phase of its molecular informatics business:\nDerive revenues from the sale of the RUO Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 to large hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations. Complete third-party clinical verification studies and FDA clinical trials to support clearance for in vitro diagnostic use of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel u5.47 test and the Acuitas Lighthouse Software.
