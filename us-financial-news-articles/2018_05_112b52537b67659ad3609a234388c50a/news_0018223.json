The DPT or so-called “Google tax” will tax multinationals on income they have sought to shift offshore at a penalty rate of 40 percent - well above the current 30 percent company tax rate.\nEarlier this year, it pledged changes to the tax treatment of stapled structures, which had allowed some foreign investors to pay tax of 15 percent or less, in contrast to the 30 percent corporate tax rate.\nIt also promised to amend thin capitalization rules to prevent foreign investors from using multiple layers of flow-through entities, like trusts and partnerships, to convert their trading income into favorably taxed interest income.\nThe changes to stapled structures come into force from July 1 this year, with the tightening of thin cap rules scheduled for the same date next year.\nReporting By JaneWardell jane.wardell@thomsonreuters.com; +61 2 93218165; Reuters Messaging: jane.wardell.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.netTwitter: @TheJaneWardell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T12:29:07.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
