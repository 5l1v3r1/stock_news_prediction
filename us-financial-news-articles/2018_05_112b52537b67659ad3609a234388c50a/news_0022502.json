Some have blamed the move for driving up Ontarians’ electricity bills, which has hurt Wynne in opinion polls.\nWynne has also raised the minimum wage, implemented a free prescription drug plan for those aged 24 and under, and has promised free childcare for preschoolers in 2020.\nBorn in Toronto, Wynne studied linguistics and education, and was elected as a public school trustee in Toronto in 2000 before entering provincial politics in 2003. Wynne is both the first female premier and first openly gay premier the province has had.\nDOUG FORD, PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY OF ONTARIO Businessman and former Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford was elected leader of the provincial Progressive Conservatives in March after the former party head resigned following accusations of sexual misconduct.\nFord, 53, is the older brother of the late Rob Ford, Toronto’s former mayor who admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in office. Ford unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2014 when Rob withdrew after he was diagnosed with cancer.\nFord, who has been compared to U.S. President Donald Trump, is known for speaking off the cuff and has campaigned on the slogan, “For the people.”\nAmong Ford’s campaign promises, he has vowed to lower the province’s corporate tax rate and eliminate the carbon cap-and-trade system.\nANDREA HORWATH, ONTARIO NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY Horwath has been the leader of the left-of-center New Democrats since 2009 and is the first woman to head the provincial party. Horwath served three terms as a city councillor in her hometown of Hamilton, southwest of Toronto, before being elected to the Ontario legislature in 2004.\nHorwath, 55, has campaigned on plans to create a province-wide drug and dental coverage plan, return Hydro One to public ownership and increase the corporate tax rate for large companies.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T17:51:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
