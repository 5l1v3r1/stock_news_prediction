Chinese authorities have often used Shenzhen, a special economic zone bordering Hong Kong, as a test-bed for financial reforms.\nReporting By China Finance Team; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T10:16:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
