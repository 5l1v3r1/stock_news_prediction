Loan impairment charges fell 29 percent to 106 million euros.\nNet interest income - the difference between interest charged on loans and interest paid on deposits - rose almost 4 percent to around 345 million euros.\nIts key solvency ratio rose to 11.8 percent at the end of the first quarter from 11.2 percent a year earlier.
