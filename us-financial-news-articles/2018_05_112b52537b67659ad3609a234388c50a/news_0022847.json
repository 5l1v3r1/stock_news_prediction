In February it said it would participate in 12 wells, of which it would operate seven.\nThe Norway-focused independent oil company produced 158,600 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd) in the first quarter, up from 145,300 boepd a year ago, mainly due to a higher stake in Valhall field, it said on April 17.
