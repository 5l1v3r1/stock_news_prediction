The UK dismissed the report.\nThe dollar rose 0.2 percent 110.575 yen, its highest since January.\nThe Australian dollar added 0.2 percent to $0.7529 after gaining 0.6 percent overnight, buoyed by a rise in prices of commodities such as copper. Other commodity-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar also advanced.\nVolatile emerging market currencies did not fare as well. Rising Treasury yields have enhanced the dollar’s appeal and raised global borrowing costs.\nEmerging markets with current account deficits face the risk of fund outflows and their currencies declining further, analysts say.\nBrazil’s real dropped to a two-year low against the dollar overnight while the Indonesian rupiah retreated to its weakest since October 2015 on Wednesday.\nThe Turkish lira and Argentina’s peso have been at the heart of the storm. Both traded down again but below record lows hit earlier in the week.
