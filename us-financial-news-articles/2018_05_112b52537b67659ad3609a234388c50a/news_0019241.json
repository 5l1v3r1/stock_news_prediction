(Nasdaq:XENE), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and provided a corporate update.\nDr. Simon Pimstone, Xenon’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “Xenon is approaching an exciting and pivotal juncture within our clinical epilepsy programs. We are presenting interim Phase 1 data from our ongoing XEN1101 clinical trial at the 14th EILAT Conference in Madrid, Spain on May 15, 2018. Our presentation will include a preliminary pharmacodynamic read-out from the completed Phase 1a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study. We are also providing an update on our XEN901 epilepsy program in a second podium presentation.”\nDr. Pimstone added, “We have now locked the XEN1101 clinical database in order to analyze preliminary Phase 1 results from 42 healthy volunteers. We are looking forward to presenting these interim XEN1101 data; not only will we have a better understanding of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of XEN1101, but positive TMS findings could provide early validation of target engagement and activity on cortical excitability and help guide our planning for the next stages of clinical development. These interim data will also allow for a comparison between XEN1101 and a first generation potassium channel opener, ezogabine, which was approved for the adjunctive treatment of adult focal seizures. Looking forward, we expect to be able to present the complete XEN1101 Phase 1 data, including results from the Phase 1b randomized TMS study in the second half of the year, and, anticipate initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial in adult patients with focal seizures by year end.”\nDr. Pimstone continued, “Additionally, we remain on track to present the complete XEN901 Phase 1 data in the second half of this year and initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial thereafter. These significant milestones underscore the substantial amount of progress we have made within our proprietary and highly differentiated epilepsy programs and contribute to our excitement around the near-term catalysts still to come this year.”\nAchievements and Anticipated Milestones\nXEN1101 is a Kv7 potassium channel opener being developed by Xenon for the treatment of epilepsy including: treatment-resistant adult and pediatric focal seizures; rare, pediatric forms of epilepsy, such as EIEE7, an early infantile epileptic encephalopathy associated with mutations in the KCNQ2 gene that cause loss-of-function in the Kv7.2 potassium channel; and potentially other neurological disorders.\nThe XEN1101 Phase 1 clinical trial currently underway is evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of both single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of XEN1101 in healthy subjects, and includes a pharmacodynamic read-out from a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study that is designed to assess XEN1101’s ability and potency to modulate cortical excitability, an important CNS effect observed with anti-epileptic drugs. Xenon has completed a Phase 1a pilot TMS study in 8 healthy subjects and has now begun a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over Phase 1b TMS study, which is expected to include approximately 15 healthy subjects.\nXenon is presenting interim Phase 1 results – including preliminary pharmacokinetic, tolerability and safety data from 42 subjects, along with a read-out from the 8 subject Phase 1a pilot TMS study – at the 14th EILAT Conference on New Antiepileptic Drugs and Devices to be held in Madrid, Spain on May 15, 2018. The release of the complete Phase 1 results, including the Phase 1b TMS data from approximately 15 subjects, is anticipated in the second half of 2018. Xenon anticipates initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating XEN1101 as a treatment for adult focal seizures by year end. Xenon also intends to explore a parallel plan to advance XEN1101 into rare, pediatric forms of epilepsy as soon as feasible thereafter.\nXEN901 is a potent, highly selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor being developed by Xenon for the treatment of epilepsy including treatment resistant adult and pediatric focal seizures, as well as rare, pediatric forms of epilepsy, such as EIEE13, an early infantile epileptic encephalopathy due to gain-of-function mutations in the SCN8A gene that encodes the Nav1.6 sodium channel.\nThe XEN901 Phase 1 clinical trial currently underway is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate XEN901’s safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in both SAD and MAD cohorts of approximately 64 healthy subjects in total. An update on the XEN901 clinical program, along with supporting pre-clinical data, will be presented at the EILAT Conference on May 15, 2018. Upon completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, a read-out of results is anticipated in the second half of 2018, followed by a Phase 2 trial evaluating XEN901 as a treatment for adult focal seizures. Xenon also intends to pursue a parallel plan to advance XEN901 into rare, pediatric forms of epilepsy as soon as feasible thereafter.\nXenon has identified an additional clinical stage, ion channel program, XEN007 (active ingredient flunarizine), to expand its existing neurology-focused product pipeline. XEN007 is a CNS-acting calcium channel inhibitor that directly modulates Cav2.1, which is a critical calcium channel implicated in the pathophysiology of familial hemiplegic migraine (HM), a rare and debilitating neurological disorder. Xenon’s clinical development plans include a proposed strategy to develop XEN007 as the first treatment specifically approved for HM anywhere in the world. Xenon has received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for XEN007 for the treatment of HM. In addition, Xenon has entered into key agreements in order to access regulatory files and manufacturing support to potentially enable the accelerated clinical development of XEN007 directly into a Phase 2 clinical trial. Xenon is currently examining various development strategies for XEN007 with key opinion leaders and leading clinicians, as well as exploring options for potential partnerships for this program.\nXenon has an ongoing collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, which is focused on developing novel inhibitors of Nav1.7 for the treatment of pain. Genentech has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for GDC-0310, which is an oral, selective Nav1.7 small-molecule inhibitor developed for the potential treatment of pain. Guidance around the future clinical development of GDC-0310 will be updated once ongoing pre-clinical studies are completed and the final results are analyzed by Genentech.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2018 were $35.1 million, compared to $43.7 million as of December 31, 2017. There were 14,171,301 common shares and 2,868,000 Series 1 Preferred Shares, which Series 1 Preferred Shares are convertible into common shares on a one-for-one basis at the option of the holder, subject to certain limitations, outstanding as of March 31, 2018. Based on current assumptions, which include fully supporting the planned clinical development of XEN1101 and XEN901, Xenon anticipates having sufficient cash to fund operations into mid-2019, excluding any revenue generated from existing partnerships or potential new partnering arrangements.\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $5.6 million, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $0.3 million was primarily attributable to decreased spending on XEN801, a product candidate that is no longer being developed, and a decrease in pre-clinical, discovery and other internal program expenses. This decrease was partially offset by increased spending on XEN1101, which was acquired in April 2017, XEN901 and pre-clinical and discovery expenses supporting our Nav1.6 program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $2.2 million and did not change significantly as compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2017.\nOther income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $4.1 million, compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a one-time gain of $4.4 million on the termination of the collaboration agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals International GmbH, along with Teva Canada Limited (collectively, “Teva”) resulting from the cancellation of 1,000,000 common shares of Xenon that were owned by Teva, partially offset by a change in unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of Canadian denominated balances to U.S. dollars.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $3.8 million, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2017, due primarily to the increase in other income.\nXenon also announced today that it has entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, under which Xenon may sell its common shares, from time-to-time, for up to $30.0 million in aggregate sales proceeds in \"at the market\" transactions.\nConference Call Information\nXenon will host a conference call and live audio webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results and to provide a business update.
