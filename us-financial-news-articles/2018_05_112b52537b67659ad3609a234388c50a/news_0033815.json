REUTERS/Stringer\nTrump said on Sunday that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to help ZTE Corp revive jobs after the company ran afoul of U.S. economic sanctions on Iran by selling telecom equipment made with U.S. components.\nHis decision angered lawmakers from both parties, who said it looked like he was backing down ahead of high-stakes trade talks this week in Washington between the United States and China.\n“One of the few areas where the president and I agreed, and I was vocally supportive, was his approach towards China. But even here he is backing off, and his policy is now designed to achieve one goal: make China great again,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio cited concerns about Beijing using telecom companies like ZTE, China’s second-largest maker of telecommunications equipment, for espionage.

The company shut its main business operations last week. FILE PHOTO: A ZTE smart phone is pictured in this illustration taken April 17, 2018.

The White House said later that Trump expected Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to make an independent decision.\nRoss is slated to make public remarks on Monday at an event with journalists at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT).\nZTE, whose shares remain suspended, has not commented on Trump’s statement.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang on Monday said China “greatly appreciates the positive U.S. position on the ZTE issue” and that Chinese Vice Premier Liu would visit Washington from Tuesday to Saturday.\nSources briefed on the matter said Beijing had demanded the ZTE issue be resolved as a prerequisite for broader trade negotiations.\nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden questioned the timing of Trump’s remark. “Unilateral concessions before an upcoming trade negotiation. This may be the art of the deal for China but it’s a big loser for American workers, companies, and national security,” he said.
