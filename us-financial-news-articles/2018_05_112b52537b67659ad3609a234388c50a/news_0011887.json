Pyongyang and North Korean state media haven’t directly Quote: d Mr. Kim as making a commitment to denuclearize.\nRelated Coverage Denuclearization: Can Trump and Kim Find a Common Definition? North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and South Korean Leader to Pursue Peace Deal, Denuclearization (April 27) North Korea’s willingness to discuss denuclearization is a focal concern for Washington in its talks with Pyongyang over a planned summit between Mr. Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump. The absence of such a pledge by Mr. Kim in official North Korean accounts of his summits with South Korean and Chinese leaders has raised doubts about his commitment among some officials and analysts.\nPyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency has published the joint declaration signed last week by Messrs. Kim and Moon stating that their governments shared the goal of “realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.” KCNA also reported that the two Korean leaders discussed the “denuclearization of the peninsula” during their summit.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Wang told Mr. Kim that Beijing supports the two Koreas’ joint plan to formally end hostilities, as well as North Korea’s efforts to safeguard its own security while advancing the denuclearization process, according to the Chinese statement.\nMr. Kim told Mr. Wang that Pyongyang “is willing—through restoring dialogue and building mutual trust—to explore eliminating the origins of threats to peace on the peninsula,” the Chinese statement said.\nMr. Wang’s two-day trip to Pyongyang, which ended Thursday, was the second such visit by a senior Chinese official since Mr. Kim traveled to Beijing to meet Mr. Xi, easing tensions between the neighbors and allies.\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un both say they want denuclearization, but they may have different definitions of the word.
