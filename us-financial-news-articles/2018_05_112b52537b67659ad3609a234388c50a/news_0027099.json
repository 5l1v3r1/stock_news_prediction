The energy and environment ministry say the project would not pose a significant threat to the environment.\nThe new law envisages construction of the terminal on the island of Krk in two stages, the first involving a floating terminal followed by a land-based facility.\n“It is in Croatia’s interest to ensure fast implementation of this project,” the state secretary in the energy ministry, Mile Horvat, told a cabinet session. “The law, among other things, regulates property issues and concession fees to municipal authorities for using maritime domains.”\nCroatia is currently running a tender for delivery of a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) for the planned terminal. An FSRU is a special type of ship where LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into the grid.\nLNG Croatia, the company behind the project, is also preparing a second round of bidding for use of the terminal’s capacity, which was initially planned at 2.6 billion cubic meters of gas a year. The final capacity of the floating terminal will depend on demand.\nU.S. government officials have also expressed strong support for the LNG terminal and have said that U.S. energy companies are keen to be major suppliers for it.\n($1 = 0.8417 euros)\nReporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T12:32:01.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
