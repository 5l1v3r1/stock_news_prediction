They reiterated their buy rating on the stock.\nICG said it had already raised 2.6 billion euros for its latest European fund and chief executive Benoit Durteste told Reuters the fund would reach its 4 billion euro target “in the near future”.\nICG is also looking to expand investment into new markets, Durteste said.\n“We always keep an eye on new geographies, we are looking at a number, that includes Latin America,” he said, adding that there were no imminent additions.\nThe growth in pre-tax profit helped underpin an 11 percent increase in the total dividend for the year.\nIntermediate Capital's shares rose 2.8 percent to 11.96 pounds at 0710 GMT, making it one of the top performers in the FTSE mid-cap index .FTMC .
