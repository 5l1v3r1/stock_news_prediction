We want to return to our house and keep continuing the same path.”\nForced into a late reshuffle by injuries to Sam Cane and Lachlan Boshier before kickoff, the Chiefs were kept try-less until rookie loose forward Jesse Parete crossed after the final hooter.\nOn a tough night for the hosts, they were down to 13 men early in the second half after lock Michael Allardice and Liam Messam were yellow-carded in quick succession.\nWith Messam switched to the openside flank and Brodie Retallick drafted in late in the reserves, they struggled for cohesion and a handling error cost them the match’s first try.
