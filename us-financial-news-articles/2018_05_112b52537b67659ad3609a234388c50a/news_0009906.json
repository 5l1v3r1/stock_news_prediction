REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Euro zone inflation slowed to 1.2 percent year-on-year in April, down from 1.3 percent in March, and core inflation fell even more, raising questions about the European Central Bank’s plan for withdrawing its monetary stimulus.\nThe dollar has erased all its 2018 losses in the past fortnight. It surged on expectations the United States would raise rates faster than had been forecast the rapid unwinding of positions by investors short the dollar.\nBut the dollar’s rally came to a halt overnight after the Federal Reserve in its policy meeting did little to alter market expectations for further rate rises this year.\nComments from the Fed were “possibly disappointing for dollar bulls”, but the main reason for the euro’s resilience on Thursday was profit-taking after the dollar’s rapid move higher, said Jane Foley, currencies strategist at Rabobank.\nFoley said buyers of euros remained at risk of weaker euro zone economic data.\n“We are no longer seeing data. The market is still a bit too long euros and remains vulnerable,” she said.\nThe euro slipped slightly after the inflation numbers but recovered and rose 0.3 percent to $1.9986. It also firmed against sterling and the yen.\nRATE DIFFERENTIALS The Fed left its benchmark overnight lending rate in a target range of between 1.50 percent and 1.75 percent as expected on Wednesday.\nAnalysts interpreted its comments on inflation as a signal it may allow prices rises beyond its target, a stance that would limit the need for it to embark on a more aggressive path of tightening.\nThe dollar index slipped 0.1 percent.\n“The market will have to get used to the fact that in order to prevent an economic overheating interest rates in the U.S. will continue to rise,” Commerzbank analysts said, predicting that rate differentials between countries would have a greater bearing on currencies and could cement euro/dollar around $1.20.\nThe dollar has been buoyed in recent weeks by the strong U.S. economic outlook and rising Treasury yields. U.S. jobs data on Friday should give further indications of the strength of the economy and inflationary pressures.\nElsewhere, Norway’s central bank kept rates on hold on Thursday and reiterated that a rise was likely after the summer. Analysts said that the consistency in the Norges bank’s position was more hawkish than other central banks.\nThe crown rose 0.6 percent versus the euro to 9.6470, more than 1 percent versus the dollar and 0.1 percent versus the Swedish crown.\nCommodity-linked currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollars recovered some recent lost ground.\nThe loonie rose half a percent to C$1.2823.\nThe Aussie increased 0.6 percent to $0.7539 cents after data showed a jump in the country’s trade surplus for March. The currency had dropped to $0.7473 this week, its lowest since mid-2017.\nEditing by Raissa Kasolowsky, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-03T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T14:50:36.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
