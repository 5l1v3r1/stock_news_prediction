At the time, ATON held a roughly one-third stake in Murray & Roberts.\nThe first offer was rejected by Murray & Roberts’ board and its second biggest shareholder, the Public Investment Corporation, as “opportunistic” and poor value for shareholders.\nThe new bid comes a week after Murray & Roberts said it had started talks on an all-share merger with local rival Aveng Ltd ( AEGJ.J ).\nReporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng, Editing by Adrian Croft and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T12:55:37.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
