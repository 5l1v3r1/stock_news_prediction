They were both 27.\nAs well as forcing the resignations of veteran prime minister Robert Fico, his interior minister and Slovakia’s police chief, the case also exacerbated worries about media freedom in ex-communist eastern Europe.\nNo one has been charged with the murder, which a prosecutor has said was probably a contract killing.\nThe Kuciak family’s lawyer, Daniel Lipsic, a former Slovak interior minister, said the two bodies had been moved without being examined by a forensic surgeon at the crime scene and this led to an incorrect initial pronouncement of the time of death.\n“I don’t understand why more experienced investigators from the National Crime Agency (NAKA) were not called immediately, and arrived at the crime scene hours after the district police,” Lipsic told Reuters in a telephone interview late on Thursday.\n“Some evidence was not secured immediately but was only discovered in photographs from the crime scene,” said Lipsic, who served as interior minister in 2010-2012.\n“This is a serious dereliction of duty. We don’t know how much evidence may have been destroyed,” he added.\nPictures from the crime scene published by the Slovak media also show that NAKA’s anti-corruption section chief, Robert Krajmer, who does not directly investigate murders, was also present.\nThe police first denied Krajmer was at the crime scene and later issued a corrected statement saying he had “carried out tasks related to the investigation”.\nAsked about Lipsic’s criticism, the police said only prosecutors could comment on the case.\nThe special prosecutor’s office said “some failures were detected during initial actions at the crime scene”.\nKuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud cases involving businessmen with Slovak political ties. He had also looked into suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
