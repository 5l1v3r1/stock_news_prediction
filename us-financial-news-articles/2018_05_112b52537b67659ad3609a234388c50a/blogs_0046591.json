They had positioned themselves as champions of private business, though with limited practical effect.\nThe currency market reacted negatively to the appointments in the minutes after the lineup was unveiled.\nThe rouble pared gains and weakened to 62.19 versus the dollar from levels of 62.08 seen before the announcement.\nPutin secured a new six-year term in office after more than 70 percent of voters backed him in a March 18 presidential election. He is now in his second consecutive term, and his fourth term overall.\nPutin was sworn in for the new term in early May, and signaled he would keep faith with a policy direction that, among other things, has brought Russia into conflict with the West.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:36:43.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
