If you want to get married, you should not explain to your partner, ‘If you marry me, you will not be free to divorce,’” Macron said.\n“I’m not so sure it is the best way to have a lady or a man who loves. So I’m for being free to get married and free to divorce.”\nOpponents of the tax say it dissuades foreigners from starting businesses in the country while encouraging French citizens to start businesses elsewhere.
