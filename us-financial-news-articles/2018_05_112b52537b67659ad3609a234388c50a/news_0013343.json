(NASDAQ:VCTR) (“Victory Capital” or the “Company”) today reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“In a quarter that marked a return to volatility for the equity markets, I am pleased to report that Victory Capital delivered very solid results, said David Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Investment Franchises and Solutions Platform continued to deliver compelling long-term investment performance, gross flows for the quarter remained robust at $3.7 billion, and operating margins were strong.\n“We continue to achieve strong momentum in our Solutions Platform, including our VictoryShares ETFs. AUM in our ETFs grew to $2.7 billion, an increase of nearly 19% quarter over quarter, and we expect client demand for rules-based strategic beta strategies to continue to grow throughout 2018.\n“Total AUM was $60.9 billion as of March 31, 2018, an 8% increase from March 31, 2017. AUM declined from $61.8 billion at December 31, 2017, due to market depreciation and net outflows of $633 million for the quarter. Given the elevated level of client rebalancing activity we experienced and the lumpiness of our business quarter to quarter with respect to flows, the outflows were not outside our expectations. These results follow a net-flow-positive Q4 2017, highlighting the importance of looking at flows on an annual basis versus quarter to quarter.\n“Looking ahead, we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders through the disciplined execution of our corporate vision, which combines strategic acquisitions with organic growth. We believe our next generation, integrated multi-boutique business model is attractive to investment firms looking for a strategic partner, and we have an active pipeline of potential M&A opportunities. Additionally, we continue to focus on growing organically by leveraging the capabilities of our Franchises and Solutions Platform. Our “won-but-not-funded” pipeline is healthy as are our overall sales prospects. As in the past, serving the needs of our clients remains our top priority.”\n1 Adjusted measures are non-GAAP financial measures.

Reconciliation of each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to net income have been provided in the non-GAAP reconciliation tables in this press release. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures is included below under the heading \"Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\". AUM, Flows and Investment Performance\nVictory Capital’s AUM declined by $0.9 billion to $60.9 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $61.8 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to market depreciation of $0.3 billion and net outflows of $0.6 billion. Gross flows for the first quarter were $3.7 billion.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Victory Capital offered 72 investment strategies through its nine autonomous Investment Franchises and Solutions Platform. The table below presents outperformance against benchmarks by AUM and strategies as of March 31, 2018.\nTrailing Trailing Trailing Trailing 1-Year 3-Years 5-Years 10-Years Percentage of AUM Outperforming Benchmark 87 % 71 % 83 % 79 % Percentage of Strategies Outperforming Benchmark 75 % 70 % 76 % 72 % First Quarter of 2018 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2017\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, GAAP net income declined 6% to $10.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $11.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. GAAP operating margin was 26.0% for the quarter compared to 25.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income with tax benefit increased 14% to $26.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share comprised of $0.35 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.05 per diluted share in tax benefit, compared to $23.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share comprised of $0.30 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.09 per diluted share in tax benefit, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were $39.8 million and 37.9%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRevenue was $105.0 million, a slight decline from $105.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating expenses declined to $77.7 million, compared to $78.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to operating efficiencies, partially offset by costs associated with the debt refinancing.\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Compared to First Quarter of 2017\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, GAAP net income was $10.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $4.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP operating margin increased to 26.0% for the quarter from 19.4% for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted Net Income with tax benefit increased 47% to $26.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share comprised of $0.35 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.05 per diluted share in tax benefit in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $17.9 million, or $0.30 per diluted share comprised of $0.22 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.08 per diluted share in tax benefit, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were $39.8 million and 37.9%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $33.6 million and 33.4%, respectively, for the first quarter a year ago. Net income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA increased due to higher revenue coupled with operational efficiencies, the successful integration of RS Investments and, specific to net income and Adjusted Net Income, a reduction in the tax rate and decreased interest expense during the quarter as a result of refinancing activities which were partially offset by one-time write-offs of debt issuance and debt discount costs.\nRevenue increased $4.3 million to $105.0 million, compared to $100.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, due to higher average AUM, partially offset by a decrease in the realized fee rate due to asset mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $77.7 million, compared to $81.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to operational efficiencies and the successful integration of RS Investments.\nBalance Sheet / Capital Management\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017. During the quarter, the Company concurrently executed a $166.5 million IPO and $360.0 million debt refinancing which provided the Company with a 7-year term loan facility and established a 5-year revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $50.0 million. The Company used the net IPO proceeds of $156.5 million, which included the net proceeds from the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, and $20.2 million of cash on hand to pay debt down from $499.7 million at year end to $323.0 million at March 31, 2018, a 35% reduction during the quarter.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, the Company paid down an additional $18.0 million of debt, bringing its term loan balance to $305.0 million at May 8, 2018. The Company also increased its revolving credit facility to $100.0 million.\nConference Call, Webcast and Slide Presentation\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today, May 8, 2018, to discuss its financial results.

Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nVictory Capital uses non-GAAP financial measures referred to as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to measure the operating profitability of the business. These measures eliminate the impact of one‑time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the business. The Company has included these non‑GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjustments made to GAAP net income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA are:\nAdding back GAAP income tax; Adding back interest paid on debt and other financing costs net of interest income; Adding back depreciation on property and equipment; Adding back other business taxes; Adding back GAAP amortization of acquisition‑related intangibles; Adding back the expense associated with stock‑based compensation associated with equity issued from pools that were created in connection with the management‑led buyout with Crestview GP from KeyCorp, the Munder Acquisition and the RS Acquisition and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO; Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions and the IPO, including expenses associated with third‑party advisors, proxy solicitations of mutual fund shareholders for transaction consents, vendor contract early termination costs, impairment of receivables recorded in connection with an acquisition and severance, retention and transaction incentive compensation; Adding back debt issuance costs; Adding back pre‑IPO governance expenses paid to the Company’s private equity partners that terminated as of the completion of the IPO; and Adjusting for earnings/losses on equity method investments.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjustments made to GAAP net income to calculate Adjusted Net Income are:\nAdding back other business taxes; Adding back GAAP amortization of acquisition‑related intangibles; Adding back the expense associated with stock‑based compensation associated with equity issued from pools that were created in connection with the management‑led buyout with Crestview GP from KeyCorp, the Munder Acquisition and the RS Acquisition and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO; Adding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions and the IPO, including expenses associated with third‑party advisors, proxy solicitations of mutual fund shareholders for transaction consents, vendor contract early termination costs, impairment of receivables recorded in connection with an acquisition and severance, retention and transaction incentive compensation; Adding back debt issuance costs; Adding back pre‑IPO governance expenses paid to the Company’s private equity partners that terminated as of the completion of the IPO; Subtracting an estimate of income tax expense on the adjustments; and Subtracting the impact of remeasuring the U.S. net deferred taxes under the Tax Act.\nTax Benefit of Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles\nDue to Victory Capital’s acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide it with additional significant supplemental economic benefit. The tax benefit of goodwill and intangibles represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangibles and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which the Company received a step‑up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15‑year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step‑up in tax basis.\nSource:Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SUg3d6rcflAwXCZnxh4zhdq4shtVYQ4EqRwvDKtvx19V5dMaMYhGtNtLRqzyZHZGr9RDFeiNZy2zB4aMwZdvCLki-1jxbHo-4aXaENDpBYg=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fNfwdfhUrz-g1d24tLxUSMmHUgn2MXdF_WeuRPTkdWlfpYu63V4cKbHNhYY6CdE3DAy4sxEP9wkdEF-R948ZWdEfgblyOww0UYm4WpbpqlU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mRxkS0jC1lJWoGT2aNolJ0l-ExT3sqgQ5xhgVMq4OwaybRAlX6vEKyp3nafQDa7RmJ_RjTXP2o82OOZZbM1ZBw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/187857e5-6239-48e0-aed8-ebcbbae65672", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4fdMnPx0XSq5a1I7biAz5nzTcm52sXlq2BhCrzxQHImvP0Tis7724JVPBDvCaSqVQq6OqsKBcw7hNbEOEKe0hQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mRxkS0jC1lJWoGT2aNolJ9ZSd6ArdbgK-fwwtS5jNanG00VkrFN7DJ1naKoBj4zohp9jxk6UIyZ89wjkENfYwg=="], "published": "2018-05-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T17:00:32.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
