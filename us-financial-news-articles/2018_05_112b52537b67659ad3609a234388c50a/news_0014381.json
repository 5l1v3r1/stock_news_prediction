We are already in the process of taking the established product to new markets.\n“Matches being played in Singapore, Hong Kong, Fiji and Samoa are examples of this.”We are especially mindful at present that we have just come out of a process that has seen a contraction of Super Rugby. The introduction of new teams or any form of expansion would need to meet a defined set of criteria that have been established.” Reporting by Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Ian Ransom", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T05:42:50.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
