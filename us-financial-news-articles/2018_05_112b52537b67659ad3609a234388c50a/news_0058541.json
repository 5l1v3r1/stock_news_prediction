Now a vast, soggy system, it has been dumping warm waters gathered over the Gulf of Mexico in bursts of rain across the South.\nForecasters said that rain could still kill people caught in flash floods in the coming hours or days in Alabama and large areas of Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas.\nIn North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed instantly on Monday while covering the weather, when a tree became uprooted from rain-soaked ground and toppled onto their SUV, authorities said.\n“Two journalists working to keep the public informed about this storm have tragically lost their lives, and we mourn with their families, friends and colleagues,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement.\nStrong winds and waves kicked up by the storm were expected to rapidly diminish through Tuesday along the coasts of Alabama and Florida.\nBetween 4 and 8 inches of rain could soak the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, and western Georgia before the storm moves on. Isolated deluges of 12 inches also are possible in spots as the system heads toward the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and later this week into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region.\nAlberto rolled up big waves and tides along the northern Gulf Coast as it moved ashore. Lifeguards posted red flags along the white sands of Pensacola Beach, where swimming and wading were banned and holiday plans were disrupted.\nSafety was the priority, but having to cancel was a “heartbreaker,” said Tom Rice, a 29-year-old Army veteran who had helped with planning for a ceremony at Beal Memorial Cemetery in Fort Walton Beach.\nSome stragglers defied rain to pay tribute at the cemetery’s Veterans Tribute Tower. Rice said American flags had been placed Saturday on the graves of all 1,700 veterans buried in the cemetery.\n“We got the flags out,” Rice said. “That’s what’s important.”\n—Copyright 2018 the Associated Press.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T17:50:00.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
