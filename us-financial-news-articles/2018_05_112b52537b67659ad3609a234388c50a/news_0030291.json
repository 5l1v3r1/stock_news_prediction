An ETF is the best instrument for this,” Lemand told Reuters.\nForeign investors have bought a net $2.7 billion of Saudi stocks so far this year, making Riyadh one of the hottest markets outside the developed world, and fund managers believe tens of billions of dollars may enter in the next two years.\nIn March, index compiler FTSE Russell decided to add Saudi Arabia to its emerging market index starting in March 2019, and MSCI will decide whether to take the same action next month.\nADS Investment’s ETF will track a new Saudi equities index developed with FTSE Russell. The index has been designed to minimise volatility and prevent excessive exposure to any particular stock or sector, FTSE Russell said in a statement.\nLemand said the design would help the fund cope with the upcoming listing in Riyadh of oil giant Saudi Aramco , which is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars in the world’s largest initial public offer of shares.\nMany investors are concerned that because of Aramco’s huge size, its listing could balance the market too heavily towards the oil sector, making the Saudi bourse essentially a bet on volatile oil prices. The new index will impose a cap on Aramco’s weighting, Lemand said.\nThe ETF will buy Saudi stocks through a qualified foreign institution licensed to invest directly in the Riyadh bourse. Lemand did not name the institution. He said initial capital for the fund had been allocated and it would start a marketing campaign in coming weeks, but declined to predict the size of the fund.
