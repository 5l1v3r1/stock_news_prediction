REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Police had warned on Monday of possible clashes with far-left anarchist groups, known as Black Blocs, after a call on social media to make Tuesday a “Revolutionary Day”.\nAuthorities said some 1,200 hooded and masked protesters dressed in black had turned up on the sidelines of the annual planned demonstration by labour unions.\nThe protesters smashed the windows of several businesses, including a Renault garage and a McDonalds restaurant on a road near the Austerlitz station in eastern Paris and they set fire to a construction vehicle.\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb condemned the violence and said everything was being done to arrest the culprits.\nThe protesters chanted anti-fascist slogans, waved Soviet flags and anti-government banners and threw firecrackers. Some started to erect barricades.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, elected last May on a promise to shake up France’s economy and spur jobs growth, is locked in a battle with the trade unions over his plans to liberalise labour regulations.\nRailway staff have begun three months of nationwide rolling strikes in a dispute over the government’s planned overhaul of state-run railway SNCF.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Reporting by Lucien Libert and John Irish; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-01T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T17:58:33.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
