He might really like where his team stands if Andre Iguodala returns from a two-game absence to play Saturday.\nMay 14, 2018; Houston, TX, USA; Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala (9) drives against Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul (3) during the fourth quarter in game one of the Western conference finals of the 2018 NBA Playoffs at Toyota Center. Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports The Warriors need a win at home to stave off elimination and force a Memorial Day Game 7 matchup at Houston after they lost for the second consecutive game Thursday with Iguodala sidelined due to a knee contusion.\nKerr said Friday that Iguodala keeps improving incrementally. Now he and the Warriors are just waiting on the team’s head performance therapist Chelsea Lane to clear Iguodala.\n“Chelsea just needs to tell me that he can play,” Kerr said. “That’s it. Other than that, he’s either healthy enough to play or he’s not.”\nKerr cautioned that the Warriors are not counting on Iguodala. He wants to avoid the mental letdown of not having the player he often refers to as the team’s top defender and decision maker. The could be particularly true after Kerr said following Game 5 that the Warriors will be in great position for the final two games if they can simply “calm down.”\n“It would be great,” Kerr said. “He’s a great player. He’s one of our keys and we’ve missed him the last two games. But we can’t count on it. Injuries happen and we’ve just got to play with whoever is out there. So we’re hoping he’s back, we’ll see what happens.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:29:00.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
