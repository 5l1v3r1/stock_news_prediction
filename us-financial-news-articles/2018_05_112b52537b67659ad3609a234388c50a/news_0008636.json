To help the readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with Adjusted EBITDA.\nA non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA is not measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. In addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement are based on Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement.\nWe define \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash items, and certain items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\nThirteen Weeks Ended\nApril 1,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet income\n$\n2,466\n$\n1,302\nInterest expense, net\n871\n559\nIncome tax expense\n699\n833\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,296\n1,371\nShare-based compensation\n67\n78\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n5,399\n$\n4,143\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bg-staffing-inc-announces-record-q1-2018-financial-results-300639257.html\nSOURCE BG Staffing, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.bgstaffing.com/", "http://bgstaffing.investorroom.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bg-staffing-inc-announces-record-q1-2018-financial-results-300639257.html", "http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129254"], "published": "2018-05-01T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-01T01:36:16.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
