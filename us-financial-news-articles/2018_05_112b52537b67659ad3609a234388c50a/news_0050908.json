San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York said his team abstained from the league vote on the policy, The New York Times reported, and New York Jets Chairman Christopher Johnson told Newsday he would pay any fines.\n“If somebody (on the Jets) takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players,” Johnson said.\nFILE PHOTO: Washington Redskins tight end Niles Paul (84) and linebacker Ryan Anderson (52) and Washington Redskins linebacker Chris Carter (55) kneel with teammates during the playing of the national anthem before the game between the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders at FedEx Field in Landover, MD, U.S., September 24, 2017. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo The kneeling controversy rattled a $14 billion industry and its mostly conservative team owners, and the new policy attempts to resolve a distraction for them, said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising.\n“For advertisers, football’s still a great buy ... Ratings have dipped a little bit ... (but it is) still one of the strongest live events you can buy in television,” Dorfman said.\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the protests in 2016, and when he was shunned by all 32 teams in the league, going unsigned for the entire 2017 season, players and commentators questioned whether he was being blackballed by the owners. He has filed a grievance against the league, saying the owners colluded to keep him from being signed.\nThe anthem protests started to fizzle late in the recent season when the NFL said it would donate $89 million over seven years to social justice causes.\nThe NFL last year rejected Trump’s calls to punish players who protest, but said the league’s players should stand.\nGoodell, in Wednesday’s statement, defended the patriotism of NFL players, as did the NFLPA.\nThe new policy says players must “show respect” as they stand, but not does not silence them completely.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “There are still plenty of ways to use our voice and platform,” 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman told USA Today, questioning whether they might be allowed to raise a fist.\nReporting by Daniel Trotta; additional reporting by Andrew Both and Rory Carroll; editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:58:07.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
