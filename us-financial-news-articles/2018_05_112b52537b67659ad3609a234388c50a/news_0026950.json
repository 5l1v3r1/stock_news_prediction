My task is to work, to do my job in the best possible way, and to work very hard with this team, with these players for the fans. Other people will judge our position.”\nFifth-placed Chelsea must beat Newcastle and hope Liverpool lose to Brighton and Hove Albion to secure Champions League football, but Conte said failing to finish in the top four was always a risk given the competition in England.\n“Don’t forget two years ago, Chelsea ended the season 10th and not in the FA Cup final, not in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and they were eliminated in the last 16 against PSG in the Champions League. It can happen,” he added.\n“But last season after a 10th place we won the league. It was difficult. We worked very hard, but we won it... Now, probably, you can finish fifth and start with a bit of an advantage compared to when you finish 10th.”\nConte’s future is under a cloud given the team’s failure to defend their title. British media have also reported that he has a strained relationship with members of the club’s hierarchy. The Italian, however, said he paid no attention to speculation.\n“I always said to you, my only thought is to do my job in the best possible way. To work very hard with my players,” he added.\n“This is my only worry. Since the start of the first game, I think... the time I start listening to the speculation about me, this is the moment I start to be worried.” Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T18:07:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
