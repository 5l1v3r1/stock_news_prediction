Phase 1 is a 60-acre mixed-use site at Nicholasville Road and Ashgrove Road, and is now being developed by Cincinnati-based Inverness Homes, a division of Hills Properties. Phase 1 will contain a 312-unit class A apartment community as well as 98 single-family homes, with site work scheduled to commence by June 1.\nAccording to Jeff Stidham, managing director in Greystone Real Estate Advisors’ Lexington, Kentucky office, “We are particularly pleased to have attracted a development company with the stature and reputation of Inverness Homes. Inverness has built over 4,000 homes in Dayton, Cincinnati, and Louisville.”\nJeff Stidham is also representing the sale of Phase 2 of Ashgrove Commons, which encompasses the remaining 70-acres of Ashgrove Commons. Phase 2 is located at Nicholasville Road and Bethel Harvest Way, directly across from Phase 1. The site is also approved for mixed-use development and has over 1500 feet of highway frontage on Nicholasville Road, providing excellent visibility to over 50,000 cars per day. A new traffic light serving the Ashgrove Commons development is projected to be operational prior to the end of 2018.\nMr. Stidham added, “The southern Lexington, northern Jessamine county corridor is the 2 nd fastest growing market in Kentucky. Annual population growth exceeded 2% from years 2000 – 2015, which presents an excellent investment opportunity.”\nFor more information on Phase 2, contact Jeff Stidham, Kentucky-licensed broker (43154) at 859-335-6333 or jeff.stidham@greyco.com .\nAbout Greystone Real Estate Advisors\nGreystone Real Estate Advisors provides services in sales, acquisitions, and a full spectrum of advisory services including debt, equity, acquisition, and investment sales to multifamily owners and investors of affordable and market-rate housing.
