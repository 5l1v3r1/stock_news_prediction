Gulen denies involvement.\nTurkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the putsch attempt, the U.N. human rights office said in March. Of that number, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during trial.\nTurkeyâ€™s Western allies have criticized the crackdown.\nCritics of President Tayyip Erdogan accuse him of using the failed putsch to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.\nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Dominic Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:33:05.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
