The S&P 500 added 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq was barely changed.\nIn Asia, investors will also be eyeing Malaysia’s financial markets, which open after a two-day holiday following the stunning victory of Mahathir Mohamad in the country’s general elections last week.\n“We will watch the market and take necessary action whichever way the market goes,” Mahathir said on Saturday, after offshore investors expressed concern that his populist promises could undermine economic prospects.\nThe Malaysian ringgit fell to a four-month low of 3.982 per dollar in early trades. The stock market opens at 0100 GMT.\nOIL AND IRAN Last week, the Bank of England held rates steady and New Zealand’s central bank said the official cash rate will remain at historic lows of 1.75 percent for “some time.”\nThat leaves Fed as the only major central bank in the world committed to rate increases although recent data showing moderate inflation reading has cast doubt over the pace of any hikes.\nThe dollar was a tad softer at 92.48 against a basket of major currencies and set for its fourth straight day of losses.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, it ticked down to 109.33 per dollar, remaining largely in a holding pattern since late last month.\nThe euro inched 0.1 percent up to $1.1953 following two consecutive sessions of gains as Italy’s anti-establishment parties looked likely to form the next government.\nWhile tensions in the Korean peninsula have eased, U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran have stoked anxiety in the Middle East.\nIran pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, and the latest development has sent oil prices near multi-year highs.\nOn Monday, U.S. crude was flat at $70.7 a barrel and Brent was off 3 cents at $77.08.\nThe United States threatened on Sunday to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran, as the remaining participants in the Iran nuclear accord stiffened their resolve to keep that agreement operational.\nSpot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,320.06 an ounce, after eking out a small weekly gain last week.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:22:05.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
