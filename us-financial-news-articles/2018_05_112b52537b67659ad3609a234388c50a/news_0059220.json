It will also need three-quarters backing from Shire investors.\nMany investors have been lukewarm on the deal, fearing it will overstretch Takeda’s finances, with shares at the drugmaker trading down more than 25 percent since it first said it was considering bidding for Shire.\nThe proposal was received on April 27, a Takeda spokesman said, before the terms of the Shire deal were announced on May 8.
