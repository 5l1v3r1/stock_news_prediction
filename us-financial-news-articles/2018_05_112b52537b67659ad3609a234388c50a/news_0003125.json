The two sides are expected to discuss an array of U.S. complaints about China’s trade practices, from accusations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development.\nSince last week, Beijing has dispatched quarantine experts to major ports including Shanghai and Shenzhen to make more thorough on-site checks for disease and rot, a source based in Shanghai with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n“China has resumed the practice of inspecting every batch of U.S. fresh fruit,” the source said, adding that inspectors had previously checked only around 30 percent of shipments. China had dialed back the checks in November 2017.\nSince Monday, all U.S.-originated fruit shipments have been subject to up to seven days of quarantine check on arrival in Shenzhen, said an industry source based at the port in China’s south.\nPreviously, Chinese custom officers had let shipments through while they conducted sample checks.\nSeveral containers of oranges imported by the source’s company from the United States have been intercepted this week, the Shenzhen industry source added.\nChina’s customs office could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours.\nSeveral batches of U.S apples have failed quarantine inspections and will be returned to the United States, the Shanghai source with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nWashington-based Chelan Fresh sales manager Bryan Peebles said he had heard of some shipment holdups, but that his export business, which includes apples and cherries, was not affected in recent weeks.\n“There has been news of detaining of fruits – citrus and a little bit of apples,” he said, adding that exporters will get a better handle on any heightened scrutiny when the year’s first California cherry exports arrive in China this week.\nThe United States sold $18 million of fresh apples to China in 2017 out of $872 million in total exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe more thorough inspections came as the cherry season on the U.S. West Coast kicked off. Shipments from Washington state typically begin in June.\nChina is the third-largest export market for fresh cherries from the United States. U.S. exporters shipped $119 million of fresh cherries to China, just under a third of total shipments worth $605 million in 2017.\nFruits have previously been a casualty of bilateral trade spats. Several years ago, China banned some imports of Philippine fruit as bilateral ties deteriorated over a maritime territorial dispute in the South China Sea.\nOne Chinese online retailer that imports and sells U.S. cherries has suspended plans to promote U.S. fruits, a source at the company said.
