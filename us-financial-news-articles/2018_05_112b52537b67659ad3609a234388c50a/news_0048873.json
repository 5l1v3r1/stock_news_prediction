Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron shake hands as they leave after a news conference in St. Petersburg, Russia May 24, 2018. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor\nMacron said the idea was to coordinate efforts carried out by the Astana process that comprises Russia, Turkey and Iran and the “small group”, which was initiated by France, and comprises Britain, Germany, Jordan, the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n“We need to be talking about the situation after the war. The key is to build a stable Syria,” Macron said at a news conference alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nMacron said the two agreed that focus should be on a new constitution and setting up inclusive elections that would include all Syrians, including refugees.

Putin made no mention of the initiative.\nFrance, together with the United States and Britain conducted a missile attack against the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons programme in mid April in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week earlier.\nRussian and Iranian military help over the past three years has allowed Assad to crush the rebel threat to topple him.
