Trump is expected to push for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\nThe demilitarized zone, or DMZ, between North and South Korea and Singapore are among the top choices being considered for the summit. Trump this week expressed a preference for the DMZ but also said Singapore was possible.\nThe Peace House at the DMZ was the venue for a meeting last month between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nTrump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, was to discuss the summit with his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, at the White House on Friday, officials said.\nTrump, a former reality TV star who likes to build suspense about upcoming presidential news, did not give a date or location for the talks and White House officials did not immediately provide further clarity.

I think you’re going to see very good things,” Trump told reporters.

But he also said he would eventually like to bring them home.
