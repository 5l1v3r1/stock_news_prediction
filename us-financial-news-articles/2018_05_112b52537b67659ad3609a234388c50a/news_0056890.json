It followed by a day a meeting in Caracas between Maduro and U.S. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nVenezuelan authorities arrested Holt in June 2016 while he was in Venezuela for his wedding, and he has been held without trial at the Helicoide, the headquarters of the intelligence agency Sebin, where inmates revolted earlier this month.\nHis family says he was framed on the weapons charges and the United States accused Caracas of using him as a bargaining chip in sanctions talks.\nThe United States accuses Maduro’s government of stifling democracy, repressing the opposition and massive corruption. Maduro says Washington is conspiring to topple him and seize the OPEC member’s large oil reserves.\nHe blames a U.S. “economic war” for Venezuela’s fiscal woes, including hyper-inflation and food and medicine shortages that have triggered mass emigration.\nEva Golinger, a New York-based immigration lawyer once dubbed the “sweetheart” of Venezuela’s socialist revolution by former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, said on Twitter that Maduro freed Holt as a gesture to gain legitimacy and win the lifting of U.S. sanctions.\n“Surely Venezuela gets something in return,” wrote Golinger, who has become a Maduro critic. “Stay tuned.”\nReporting by Jonathan Landay and Angus Berwick; Additional reporting by Corina Pons in Caracas, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Rosalba O'Brien and Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T17:24:42.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
