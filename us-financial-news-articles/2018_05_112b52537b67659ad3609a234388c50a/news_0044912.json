Brazil's central bank on Friday evening said it would triple the currency swap contracts - equivalent to operations to sell dollars in futures markets - offered daily to 15,000, after the real fell to its lowest level in more than two years. On Monday, the bank sold the 15,000 swaps and another set of 4,225 swaps. By midday, the real had risen 0.83 percent to around 3.71 to the dollar, up from the Friday low of around 3.74 to the greenback. Traders said the real might have risen more had it not been for market caution ahead of the scheduled release on Tuesday of the Brazilian central bank minutes. \"The anticipation of the central bank minutes ... is making the market a little cautious,\" said Paulo Petrassi, a partner at Florianopolis, Brazil-based Leme Investimentos. Argentina's volatile peso currency also gained on Monday, rising 0.95 percent against the dollar amid optimism over ongoing efforts by the government to obtain a financing line from the International Monetary Fund. Consultancy Delphos Investimentos wrote in a note that there also appeared to be positive bias in the market regarding the possibility that index-provider MSCI might include the country in its emerging markets index, though the nation's Merval equities index fell on Monday amid profit-taking. Last week, MSCI said Argentina's recent market turmoil would make more difficult a decision on elevating it from its current \"frontier\" market status. The decision is due next month. Around the region, Latin America's equities markets were mixed, with Mexico's IPC index posting the only significant move, rising 0.6 percent as traders hunted for opportunities after the index hit its lowest point in 16 months on Friday.
