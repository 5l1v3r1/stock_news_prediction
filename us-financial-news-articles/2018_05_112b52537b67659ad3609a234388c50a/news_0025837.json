It is now positive on the year, up 0.3 percent from its starting level on Jan. 1.\nEuropean shares largely took their cues from Asian and U.S. peers and rose, but the gains were tempered as British phone company BT reported disappointing results and the pan European STOXX 600 Index was only marginally higher.\nBritain's FTSE 100 Index was still up on the day ahead of a Bank of England policy meeting at which rates are expected to be kept on hold, a sea change from expectations a few weeks ago, when a hike seemed nailed on.\nOverall, the U.S. Federal Reserve remains the only major central bank that appears to be on course for rate hikes, with New Zealand's Reserve Bank saying it will keeping the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 1.75 percent \"for some time to come.\"\nThe New Zealand dollar retreated to a five-month low of $0.6915.\nPOLITICAL RUCTIONS\nItalian government debt sold off sharply in early trades, with 10-year yields hitting a seven-week high as Italy's 5-Star Movement and the far-right League moved closer to the formation of a government of anti-establishment parties.\nA crucial obstacle was removed late on Wednesday when former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, the League's main ally, gave his green light to the talks, accepting a demand from 5-Star that his Forza Italia party take no part in the next government.\nNor is this the only electoral concern on investor minds today; in Malaysia, an alliance of opposition parties spearheaded by Mahathir Mohamad won the general election, putting the 92-year old strongman on course for a return to the prime minister's office he occupied for 22 years.\nOver the past day the Malaysian ringgit has slid nearly 3 percent in the one-month non-deliverable forward market and the cost of insuring the country's debt against default has risen.\nEarlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.6 percent, while Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent. South Korea's KOSPI rose 0.5 percent and Shanghai SSEC was 0.2 percent higher.\nBrent crude futures were up 0.8 percent to $77.66 a barrel, the highest since November 2014 and building on gains of about 3 percent on Wednesday.
