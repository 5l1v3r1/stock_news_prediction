It’d be a great gesture if they’d agree to do so.”\nHe said he was hoping to finalize the agenda for talks between Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T02:04:16.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
