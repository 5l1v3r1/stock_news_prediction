The first quarter was a net loss attributable to Fluor of $18 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $61 million, or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago. Results for the quarter include an after-tax charge of approximately $96 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for forecast revisions on a gas-fired power project. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $52 million, compared to $133 million a year ago. First quarter revenue of $4.8 billion was flat compared to a year ago.\nNew awards for the quarter were $2.5 billion, including $1.3 billion in Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, $721 million in Energy & Chemicals, $433 million in Diversified Services and $43 million in Government. Consolidated ending backlog of $29.1 billion compares to $41.6 billion a year ago.\n“Results for the quarter did not meet our expectations as a result of continued challenges on a gas-fired power project,” said David Seaton, Fluor chairman and chief executive officer. “Going forward, our primary focus will be on markets where we see opportunities to fully deploy our integrated solutions model to deliver the capital efficiency that our clients demand. This includes our recent announcement on the LNG Canada project, which is one of many opportunities we see in the second half of 2018.”\nCorporate G&A expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $57 million, compared with $45 million a year ago. Expenses for the quarter include $12 million related to foreign currency exchange losses. Fluor’s cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the first quarter was $1.8 billion, down from $2.1 billion last quarter primarily due to increased working capital needs to support project execution activities for the power restoration project in Puerto Rico. During the quarter, the company utilized $136 million in cash from operating activities, and paid out $30 million in dividends.\nOutlook\nThe company is revising its 2018 guidance for EPS to a range of $2.10 to $2.50 per diluted share, from the previous range of $3.10 to $3.50 per diluted share, due in large part to forecast revisions on a gas-fired power project.\nBusiness Segments\nFluor’s Energy & Chemicals segment reported segment profit of $106 million, compared to $84 million in the first quarter of 2017. Results for the quarter reflect an increase in project execution activities for a large upstream project. First quarter 2018 revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $2.1 billion a year ago. New awards for the segment totaled $721 million, and ending backlog was $14.1 billion compared to $19.1 billion a year ago.\nThe Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment reported a segment loss of $144 million, compared to a segment loss of $3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Results for the quarter include a pre-tax charge of approximately $125 million for forecast revisions on a gas-fired power project. Revenue for the segment declined to $910 million from $1.4 billion a year ago due to reduced volume of project execution activities in power. New awards in the first quarter were $1.3 billion including a mine expansion project in Peru. Ending backlog for the segment was $10.3 billion, down from $15.8 billion a year ago.\nThe Government segment reported segment profit of $72 million, compared to $29 million a year ago. Revenue for the segment increased 73 percent to $1.3 billion from $765 million a year ago. Results for the first quarter reflect the execution and substantial completion of task order awards for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to restore power in Puerto Rico. New awards totaled $43 million for the quarter, and ending backlog was $2.4 billion, down from $3.7 billion a year ago.\nThe Diversified Services segment reported a segment profit of $19 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $23 million a year ago. Revenue for the quarter was $643 million compared to $569 million in the first quarter of 2017. Results for the quarter reflect revenue growth from Stork operations in Latin America and North America. New awards totaled $433 million for the quarter, and ending backlog was $2.3 billion, down from $2.9 billion a year ago.\nFirst Quarter Conference Call\nFluor will host a conference call at 5:30 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday, May 3, which will be webcast live on the Internet and can be accessed by logging onto http://investor.fluor.com . A supplemental slide presentation will be available shortly before the call begins. The webcast and presentation will be archived for 30 days following the call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nThis press release contains a discussion of consolidated segment profit that would be deemed a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC rules. Segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non-operating income and expense items. The company believes that consolidated segment profit provides a meaningful perspective on its business results as it is the aggregation of individual segment profit measures that the company utilizes to evaluate and manage its business performance. A reconciliation of this measure to earnings (loss) before taxes is included in the press release tables.\nAbout Fluor Corporation\nFluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) is a global engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction and maintenance company that designs, builds and maintains capital-efficient facilities for its clients on six continents.
