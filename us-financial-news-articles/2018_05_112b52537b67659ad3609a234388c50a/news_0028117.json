We are looking at the final format and still nothing has been decided. We will make the decision at our board meeting at the end of May.”\nPique, who is set to be named in Spain’s squad for next month’s World Cup in Russia, was photographed watching countryman Rafael Nadal’s quarter-final defeat by Dominic Thiem on Friday at the Madrid Open alongside Real Madrid players Lucas Vazquez and Marco Asensio.\nThe new Davis Cup event represents a huge revamp for a competition which has been in existence since 1900 but has suffered in recent years with top players not competing.\nITF President David Haggerty has said the new format will be “a game-changer for tennis” but the proposed event, which would bring an end to traditional home and away ties, has been criticized by Belgian tennis chief Gijs Kooken, who said it risked “killing the soul” of the competition.
