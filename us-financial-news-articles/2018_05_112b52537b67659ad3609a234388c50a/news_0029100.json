The two countries have mutual strategic interests in several countries. Photo: Druzhinin Alexei/TASS/ZUMA Press MOSCOW—The Kremlin’s military alliance with Tehran in Syria is showing cracks after fierce Israeli strikes against Iranian forces, testing the limits of the relationship.\nThe Israeli attack —its biggest ever in Syria—came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat at Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual military parade last week in Moscow. Russia’s response to the strikes has been muted, and the two leaders likely agreed on acceptable targets, said Fyodor Lukyanov, the head of a Kremlin advisory body.\nThe rising hostilities with Israel lay bare tensions in the alliance between Moscow and Tehran that turned the tide of the Syrian conflict in favor of President Bashar al-Assad. The strategy helped assert Russia once again as a global power and Iran to expand its Middle Eastern influence.\nNow, as Mr. Assad regains control of much of the country, Russia and Iran have shown how much their interests diverge in Syria. In particular, Russian analysts said, Moscow has grown concerned over Iran’s attempt to use Syria as a beachhead to threaten Israel and boost its power over Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinian Territories.\nAn image from a video distributed by the Israeli Defense Forces purportedly shows a Syrian missile launcher targeted by an Israeli airstrike at an undisclosed location in Syria last week.

Russia is keen to work more closely with Iran’s oil sector and wants to boost its presence in Iraq, where Iranian influence is also strong, analysts said.\nIn Syria, their partnership was designed to prevent Mr. Assad falling the way of other leaders during the Arab Spring. Even before Russia’s military intervention, Iranian delegations covertly traveled to Moscow to hash out a strategy marrying Iran’s ground presence and Russia air power. Iran even secretly opened at least one of its Syrian air bases, Hamadan, for Russian use in the bombing campaign, said an official close to the defense ministry.\n“Iran has been happy to have a partner like Russia which had their back during the sanctions regime,” said Dina Esfandiary, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Middle East Program. “But Iran knows it’s a pragmatic relationship and not an ally that will stick with them through thick and thin.”\nThe Kremlin said the Russia-Iran relationship can’t be measured through the lens of the Israel strikes. “They have an independent dimension,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov of relations with Iran.\nFrom left, Russian acting Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Vladimir Putin taking part in a ceremony last week marking the 73rd anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. Photo: yuri kadobnov/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Analysts said the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal and appearance to move lock step with Israel has raised the stakes and forced Iran into a corner.\nAn official at Iran’s United Nations mission didn’t respond to a request for comment. Iranian officials have in the past stressed their increasing closeness to Moscow as the countries work together in Syria.\nBut Russia sees the increasing presence of Iran near Israel’s border as a problem and has tried to use its limited sway over Iran to satisfy Israeli demands. Russia’s military, in turn, warned Iran that it won’t provide air cover for government troops or Iran’s proxies that appear in southwestern Syria.\nMoscow has even tried to open up informal diplomatic channels between the two countries, Mr. Kozhanov said. He added that Moscow recently sent Russian citizens with strong ties to Israel to Tehran, in effect carrying messages from Israel.\nA spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu declined to comment.\nSyria's government, which provided this image, says it shows senior Iranian officers in the northern province of Aleppo, Syria, last year. Photo: /Associated Press Mr. Netanyahu has tried to forge a personal relationship with Mr. Putin, visiting Moscow several times and trying to convey the threats Israel sees in Iran’s presence across the border.\nThose threats came to a head earlier last week with what Israel said were Iranian mortars fired at the northern Israeli border from Syria. Israel said it struck back targeting Iranian positions in Syria, causing significant damage. That followed other recent Israeli attacks on Iranian military interests in Syria.\nIran last week condemned the Israeli attack on Syria, semiofficial media reported, citing Bahram Ghasemi, the spokesman for the country’s foreign ministry. He didn’t address the allegation of an Iranian attack on Israel first or the damage Israel said it inflicted on Iranian assets in Syria.\nBut examples of tension abound between Russia and Iran.\nIran and Moscow are splitting over the spoils of war. Rights to help the Syrian government develop a phosphate mine near Palmyra were recently awarded to Russia, according to the Syria Report, a Beirut-based publication that tracks Syrian economic news, months after an Iranian company thought it had clinched the deal.\nLast year, Iranian-backed soldiers ignored targets agreed to by Moscow and Tehran, and called in Russian airstrikes against their own preferred targets, enraging Russia’s central command and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, a person close to the ministry said.\nPosters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Aleppo, Syria, earlier this year. Photo: Hassan Ammar/Associated Press Mr. Assad has manipulated the divisions. “Damascus is really good at playing Russia off of Tehran and saying well maybe we’ll rely more on Iran,” said a European diplomat who works on the Syria crisis.\nRussia has gained an advantage over Iran in talks with Syria’s opposition, who say Moscow’s presence is a way to burnish its international reputation.\n“They have real conflict of interests, because their plans are different,” said Yahya Al-Aridi, a spokesman for the main political body representing Syria’s opposition in peace talks.\nWithout a broader strategy at hand, Mr. Putin is employing a familiar tactic of waiting and watching. For now Moscow hopes the two sides can exchange fire without hurting Russian interests there or causing an all-out regional conflict.\n“As far as Mr. Putin is concerned, Israel and Iran can continue fighting as long as they keep their operations within certain limits,” Mr. Lukyanov said.\n—Asa Fitch in Dubai and Felicia Schwartz in Tel Aviv contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com and Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T14:27:43.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
