Daniel L. Menichella, currently Chief Business Officer and Chief Executive Officer of CureVac AG and CEO of CureVac’s U.S. subsidiary, will be appointed as Chief Executive Officer of CureVac AG effective on June 20, 2018.\nIngmar Hoerr commented: “I am honored that CureVac’s majority investor, dievini Hopp Biotech holding GmbH & Co. KG of SAP Founder Dietmar Hopp, and our Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Dr. Friedrich von Bohlen, have been supportive of my plans to make this important transition. The company is positioned for success as it accelerates development of its clinical pipeline of exciting new treatments based on mRNA technology. In my new role, I will look ahead to future applications of mRNA, as well as the company’s long-term strategy and vision. In Dan Menichella, we have an ideal CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board who is at home on both continents, has a strong network in the U.S., and knows the company very well. I am delighted that he has accepted this new challenge, and look forward to continuing our excellent collaboration.”\nDan Menichella added: “I am excited to have been selected as CureVac’s CEO by the Board of Directors. Ingmar had a very clear vision and strategy when founding CureVac 18 years ago. He has since established a leading mRNA platform and experienced team without which this technology would not exist today. I am focused on taking the company through its next stage, advancing the current clinical programs and adding additional pipeline assets into the clinic in the coming year and beyond. We will build on our German roots while tapping resources in the U.S. and globally to support us in developing the first mRNA medicines.”\n“CureVac is a leader in mRNA technology and therapeutics,” said Friedrich von Bohlen. “This is very much so because of Ingmar’s vision and leadership. We are convinced that the new constellation in the Executive and Non-Executive Boards of the company will enable a faster, value driving progress and growth of CureVac.”\nCureVac will continue to expand its financial and scientific presence in the U.S. through its office in Boston, MA, with Tübingen remaining the global headquarters of the company’s R&D and manufacturing operations.\nDaniel L. Menichella joined CureVac in early 2017. As a member of the Executive Board, he served as head of the U.S. subsidiary as well as global business development, alliance management and commercial development.
