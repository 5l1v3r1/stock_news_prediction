That growth figure is only surpassed by the 9.9 percent increase projected for the Asia Pacific region.\nMalhotra also weighed in on competition for clients in the region, as well as a greater focus on regulation, amid greater focus on regulations.\n\"I think that's pretty much industry-specific. All the global banks are present in Dubai and are investing and growing in the region. Having said that, I think we have grown much faster than our competitors,\" he said.\n\"Of course, regulatory expectations are much higher today and everybody is investing in that regard as well,\" Malhotra said. Less than half of the roughly 30 employees joining Bank of Singapore's Dubai branch last year were bankers as it focused on growing its support staff, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T10:24:03.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
