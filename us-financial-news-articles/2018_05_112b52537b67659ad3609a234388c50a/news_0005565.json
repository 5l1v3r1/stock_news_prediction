The merger of Archrock and Archrock Partners simplifies our structure, accelerates deleveraging and improves our cost of capital,” continued Childers. “With the merger behind us, we are focused on leveraging our strong operating platform and financial position to profitably expand the business. Demand for compression services remains robust, creating opportunities for us to put existing fleet units back into operation as well as to invest in new larger horsepower units that provide attractive returns to our company and investors. As a result, we plan to invest $230-$250 million of growth capital this year.”\n“We are excited about the expected increase of U.S. natural gas production and its implications for Archrock,” continued Childers. “Natural gas production is the primary growth driver of our contract compression business. The Energy Information Administration forecasts 7.5 bcf/d of growth in U.S. natural gas production in 2018, with additional growth into the next decade. We are well positioned to capitalize on this growth, win profitable business, grow our operating fleet and increase our cash flow and our earnings,” concluded Childers.\nNet loss attributable to Archrock stockholders of 2018 was $3.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share.
