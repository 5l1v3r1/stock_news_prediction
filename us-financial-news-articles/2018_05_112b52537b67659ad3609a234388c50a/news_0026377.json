Slideshow (4 Images)\n“We came second, I am not totally happy that is not my nature. But since the moment we felt it was impossible to finish first we had the target to finish second and it is done today.\n“I am not critical of the performance at all. In the 80th minute we know that a point was enough so we start thinking about that and we let the game go.”\nWest Ham manager David Moyes was happy to draw with his former club.\n“A good point for us,” he said. “Our boys showed a great attitude after getting safe at the weekend.\n“We have conceded a lot of goals this season so a clean sheet is great. We have done the job we came to do - we are not relegated.” Reporting by Ed Osmond; Editing by Kevin Liffey", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:43:56.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
