Pomeroy, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon. \"Following a fourth quarter of record loan originations, we remain focused in 2018 on rebuilding our investment pipeline of quality opportunities and managing our portfolio.\"\nMr. Pomeroy continued, \"With the majority of our portfolio comprised of more recent vintage transactions, we believe we are positioned to generate a predictable income stream. In addition, with the recent renewal of our credit facility, we are also positioned to selectively capitalize on compelling venture lending opportunities and to continue to create opportunities for long-term shareholder value.\"\nOperating Results\nTotal investment income was $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $7.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The year-over-year increase in total investment income is primarily due to higher interest income on investments resulting from the larger average size of the loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in accelerated end-of-term payments related to prepayments.\nThe Company's dollar-weighted annualized portfolio yield on debt investments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was 14.4% and 15.5%, respectively.\nThe Company calculates the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield on average debt investments is higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect expenses or any sales load paid by investors.\nTotal expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $4.0 million, as compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense increased year-over-year primarily due to an increase in average borrowings. Base management fee increased year-over-year primarily due to an increase in the average size of the investment portfolio. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, incentive fee expense was $0.5 million, as compared to $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the incentive fee cap and deferral mechanism under the Investment Management Agreement, which resulted in $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of reduced expense and additional net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNet investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $3.2 million, or $0.28 per share, as compared to $3.4 million, or $0.29 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the net realized loss on investments was $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share, as compared to net realized loss on investments of $10.8 million, or $0.94 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the net unrealized depreciation on investments was $0.5 million, or $0.04 per share, as compared to net unrealized appreciation on investments of $11.1 million, or $0.97 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nPortfolio Summary and Investment Activity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's debt portfolio consisted of 32 secured loans with an aggregate fair value of $193.0 million. In addition, the Company's total warrant, equity and other investments in 80 portfolio companies had an aggregate fair value of $18.9 million as of March 31, 2018. Total portfolio investment activity as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was as follows:\n($ in thousands)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded March 31,\n2018\n2017\nBeginning portfolio\n$ 222,099\n$ 194,003\nNew debt investments\n11,041\n25,916\nLess refinanced debt investments\n(2,479)\n—\nNet new debt investments\n8,562\n25,916\nPrincipal payments received on investments\n(8,799)\n(11,891)\nEarly pay-offs\n(6,741)\n(27,209)\nAccretion of debt investment fees\n510\n505\nNew debt investment fees\n(1,195)\n(270)\nNew equity\n791\n—\nProceeds from sale of investments\n(2,715)\n(1,226)\nNet realized loss on investments\n(149)\n(10,845)\nNet unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments\n(458)\n11,131\nEnding portfolio\n$ 211,905\n$ 180,114\nNet Asset Value\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company's net assets were $134.3 million, or $11.65 per share, as compared to $139.4 million, or $12.11 per share, as of March 31, 2017, and $135.1 million, or $11.72 per share, as of December 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $2.6 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net increase in net assets of $3.7 million, or $0.32 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nPortfolio Asset Quality\nThe following table shows the classification of Horizon's loan portfolio at fair value by internal credit rating as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\n($ in thousands)\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nNumber of\nInvestments\nDebt\nInvestments\nat Fair Value\nPercentage\nof Debt\nInvestments\nNumber of\nInvestments\nDebt\nInvestments\nat Fair Value\nPercentage\nof Debt\nInvestments\nCredit Rating\n4\n4\n$ 21,119\n10.9%\n4\n$ 18,701\n9.2%\n3\n23\n150,452\n78.0\n25\n176,560\n86.6\n2\n5\n21,399\n11.1\n3\n5,632\n2.8\n1\n—\n—\n—\n1\n2,900\n1.4\nTotal\n32\n$ 192,970\n100.0%\n33\n$ 203,793\n100.0%\nAs of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Horizon's loan portfolio had a weighted average credit rating of 3.0, with 4 being the highest credit quality rating and 3 being the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated for a 2-rated loan, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents a deteriorating credit quality and high degree of risk of loss of principal. As of March 31, 2018, there were no debt investments with an internal credit rating of 1. As of December 31, 2017, there was one debt investment with an internal credit rating of 1, with a cost of $3.0 million and a fair value of $2.9 million.\nLiquidity Events\nHorizon experienced liquidity events from three portfolio companies in the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Liquidity events for Horizon may consist of the sale of warrants or equity in portfolio companies, loan prepayments, sale of owned assets or receipt of success fees.\nIn February, Horizon's portfolio company, Digital Signal Corporation (\"DSC\") sold its assets, including intellectual property related to hardware and software development, to StereoVision, Inc. for a combined cash and equity purchase price of $3.5 million, with the proceeds of the sale paid to Horizon to settle its debt investment in DSC.\nIn March, LeTote, Inc. (\"LeTote\") prepaid the outstanding principal balance of $6.7 million on its venture loan, plus interest, end-of-term payment and prepayment fee. Horizon continues to hold warrants in LeTote.\nIn March, with the proceeds of a new loan from Horizon, Lantos Technologies, Inc. (\"Lantos\") prepaid the outstanding principal balance of $2.6 million on its venture loan, plus interest, end-of-term payment and prepayment fee. In addition to the new $4.0 million loan, Horizon continues to hold warrants in Lantos.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $40.1 million in available liquidity, including $16.1 million in cash and $24.0 million in funds available under existing credit facility commitments.\nAt March 31, 2018, there was $58.0 million outstanding principal balance under the $95.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"Key Facility\"). The Key Facility allows for an increase in the total loan commitment up to an aggregate commitment of $150 million. There can be no assurance that any additional lenders will make any commitments under the Key Facility.\nOn April 6, 2018, the Company amended the Key Facility to increase the aggregate commitments to $100.0 million and extend the revolving period to April 6, 2021 and the maturity date to April 6, 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's debt to equity leverage ratio was 71%, and the asset coverage ratio for borrowed amounts was 241%.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn April 27, 2018, the Company's board of directors extended the Company's previously authorized stock repurchase program until the earlier of June 30, 2019 or the repurchase of $5.0 million of the Company's common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company did not make any repurchases of its common stock. From the inception of the stock repurchase program through March 31, 2018, the Company has repurchased 167,465 shares of its common stock at an average price of $11.22 on the open market at a total cost of $1.9 million.\nMonthly Distributions Declared in Second Quarter 2018\nOn April 27, 2018, the Company's board of directors declared monthly distributions of $0.10 per share payable in each of June, July and August 2018. The following table shows these monthly distributions, which total $0.30 per share:\nEx-Dividend Date\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nAmount Per Share\nJune 18, 2018\nJune 19, 2018\nJuly 17, 2018\n$0.10\nJuly 18, 2018\nJuly 19, 2018\nAugust 15, 2018\n$0.10\nAugust 16, 2018\nAugust 17, 2018\nSeptember 14, 2018\n$0.10\nTotal:\n$0.30\nAfter paying distributions of $0.30 per share and earning $0.28 per share for the quarter, the Company's undistributed spillover income as of March 31, 2018 was $0.07 per share. Spillover income includes any ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding tax years that were not distributed during such tax years.\nWhen declaring distributions, the Horizon board of directors reviews estimates of taxable income available for distribution, which may differ from consolidated net income under generally accepted accounting principles due to (i) changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation, (ii) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, and (iii) the amount of spillover income carried over from a given year for distribution in the following year. The final determination of taxable income for each tax year, as well as the tax attributes for distributions in such tax year, will be made after the close of the tax year.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss its latest corporate developments and financial results.
