The Liberty team came together to deliver record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA despite significant operational challenges arising from unusual winter weather and sand logistics issues during the first quarter.\n“We are excited for the remainder of 2018. The frac market remains strong and in partnership with our customers we continue to drive increases in throughput across our entire fleet. The second quarter is off to a great start and we expect results for this period will surpass our Adjusted EBITDA per average active fleet from last year’s third quarter.\n“In the Permian, we are pleased with our deepening customer relationships and the results we are seeing. During the first quarter, we deployed our sixth Permian fleet under a dedicated arrangement. The Permian market remains tight for top tier, high-efficiency frac fleets, and pricing is strong. More importantly, we are seeing meaningful throughput and efficiency gains across our fleets in the basin.”\nFleet Deployment Update\nDuring Liberty deployed fleets 20 and 21 under dedicated arrangements with existing customers.
