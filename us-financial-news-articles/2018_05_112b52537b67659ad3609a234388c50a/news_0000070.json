The move comes at a time when many banks have shied away from the crypto craze over regulatory concerns.\nIndeed, Bogart called the bank's bet on bitcoin bullish and said it is \"definitely a big step\" for the crypto market.\n\"This market is so large you can't ignore it anymore,\" he said. \"Now we're seeing large banks roll out trading desks.\"\nBitcoin , which peaked in mid-December at around $19,500 before falling to around $6,000 earlier this year, could exceed $50,000 this year, Bogart said. The popular cryptocurrency was priced above $9,700 on Friday morning.\nBogart predicted that within five years, \"way more people will be newly buying bitcoin for the first time.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T17:13:45.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
