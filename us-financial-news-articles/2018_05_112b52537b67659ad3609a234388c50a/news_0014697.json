(NYSE American: BTN), a holding company with diverse business activities focused on serving the cinema, retail, financial, advertising and government markets, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet revenues were $15.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $17.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Loss from operations was ($3.1) million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with ($0.6) million in the same period of the prior year. Net loss from continuing operations was ($3.8) million, or ($0.26) per share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared with net income from continuing operations of $0.4 million, or $0.03 per share, in the same period of the prior year.\nKyle Cerminara, Chairman and CEO of Ballantyne Strong, Inc., commented, “We incurred significant start-up costs with the launch of our New York City taxi-top advertising business, which we believe will be a notable contributor to Digital Media revenue in the second half of 2018. We also signed a very significant Digital Signage as a Service (DSaaS) contract that should begin to benefit our Digital Media results in late 2018. Lastly, we announced an agreement with Eclipse Screens under which we expect to benefit from selling screens to the themed entertainment industry over the coming months and years.”\nQ1 2018 Financial Summary\nCinema revenues were $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $12.7 million in the same period of the prior year. The decrease was driven by decreased sales of lamps, projectors and screen support systems, partially offset by increases in sales of audio equipment and projection system installation services.\nDigital Media revenues were $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $5.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This decrease was driven by decreased non-recurring digital signage equipment sales, partially offset by increased recurring digital signage as a service (“DSaaS”) and increased sales of installation services.\nConsolidated gross profit was $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $4.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Gross margin was 18.0% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 24.8% in the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease in gross margin percentage was driven by an increase in fixed costs in the Digital Media segment associated with the operational ramp up of the new Strong Digital Media advertising business. Revenues are expected to gradually increase throughout 2018 and 2019 absorbing a larger portion of those fixed costs until the business generates a positive gross profit in late 2018 or early 2019.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $5.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $5.0 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in audit, tax and legal expenses of $0.4 million, compensation and benefit expense of $0.4 million and amortization expense of $0.1 million.\nBalance Sheet\nBallantyne’s cash and cash equivalents balance at March 31, 2018 was $3.3 million, compared to $4.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily driven by operating losses. Equity method investments had a book value of $17.8 million and a market value of $15.5 million as of March 31, 2018.\nAbout Ballantyne Strong, Inc.
