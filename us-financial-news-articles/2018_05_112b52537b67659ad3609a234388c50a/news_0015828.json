Venezuelan presidential candidate Henri Falcon of the \"Avanzada Progresista\" party embraces the independent candidate Luis Alejandro Ratti, who withdrew his candidacy to support Falcon, during a meeting in Caracas, Venezuela May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\nWith Luis Ratti scoring less than 1 percent in polls, his decision to support Falcon is more of a symbolic boost than likely to make a tangible difference in the socialist-ruled OPEC nation’s May 20 vote.\nCampaigning has been lacklustre. Most Venezuelans are preoccupied with finding food amid a desperate economic crisis, and the mainstream opposition is boycotting the vote on grounds it is rigged in advance to assure Maduro’s re-election.\nFalcon, a 56-year-old former soldier and state governor, has broken with the main opposition coalition, arguing that abstention is tantamount to voting for Maduro.

Donald Trump? Mike Pence?” Maduro asked a crowd in a rally on Tuesday in southern Amazonas state, condemning the U.S. president and vice-president for sanctions on his government.
