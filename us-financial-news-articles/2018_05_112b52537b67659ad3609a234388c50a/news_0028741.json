The content product and global sales division - for which the company is seeking a partner - suffered a drag on revenues as the dollar weakened, however.\nProSieben’s e-commerce division, called Nucom, also saw declines in revenues and profits. This was due to asset disposals over the course of the last year, the company said.\nChief Financial Officer Jan Kemper said that ProSieben’s leverage had declined to 1.5 times core earnings from 1.8 times over the quarter, leaving room for two or three acquisitions in the second half of the year.\nFirst-quarter revenues declined by 3 percent to 881 million euros, in line with expectations, although the company said that, adjusted for consolidation and currency effects, revenues had risen by 1 percent.
