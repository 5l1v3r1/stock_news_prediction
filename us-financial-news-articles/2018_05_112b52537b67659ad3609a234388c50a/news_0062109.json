It’s a strange moment to do so, I know, but an important one too. I had to do this for everyone,” he said.\nThe Frenchman clearly feels that after such a successful period at the Bernabeu the only way forward for the club to continue its success is via a change at the top.\n“This side should carry on winning and needs a change for this. After three years it needs another voice, another method of work, for this I took this decision,” said Zidane.\n“The players need a change. I want to thank them because it’s they who fight on the pitch.

I’ll always be thankful. Today I need to change, for me, for everyone, for this I’ve taken the decision,” Zidane added.

A year later he led Real to their first European Cup and La Liga double in 59 years.\nReal finished three points ahead of Barcelona as they won their first league title since 2012 before crushing Juventus 4-1 in the Champions League final to become the first side to win the competition in its current format in back-to-back seasons.
