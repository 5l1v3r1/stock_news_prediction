(OTCQB:OMTK) today reported results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018 -- reflecting increased sales, a sharply reduced net loss and a solid pipeline of anticipated orders for the balance of the year.\nRevenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 23 percent to $359,530 compared with $291,654 a year earlier. For the same period, the company reported a net loss of $98,090, or $0.00 per share, compared with a net loss of $209,041, or ($0.01) per share, a year ago. The net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 includes a non-cash inventory reserve adjustment of $25,000. The inventory reserve adjustment represents a non-cash charge for slow-moving inventory.\nGross margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which includes the non-cash inventory adjustment referred to above, was $155,038 compared with $139,041 a year ago. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 50 percent compared with 48 percent a year earlier, excluding the previously noted non-cash inventory reserve adjustment.\nResults for the three months ended March 31, 2018 reflect the impact of non-cash expenses, including the value of options and warrants granted in the amount of $21,971, depreciation and amortization of $3,981 and inventory reserve adjustment of $25,000. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, non-cash expenses included options and warrants granted in the amount of $69,533, depreciation and amortization of $6,224 and inventory reserve adjustment of $-0-.\n“The dramatic shift from domestic to international demand for engine conversions continued to gain momentum in the first quarter-- primarily due to increasing oil prices, air pollution regulations and the price disparity between diesel and natural gas in foreign markets, which has been further boosted by higher taxes on diesel fuel. Results for the quarter reflect various stages in development programs, particularly in Europe, India and Asia, and we expect a transformative year for the company as sales begin ramping up in these markets,” said Werner Funk, president and chief executive officer of Omnitek Engineering Corp.\nFunk noted the 200-nation “Paris Agreement on Climate Change” remains an important catalyst for alternative solutions to diesel fuel overseas, with natural gas being particularly appealing -- especially since the fine-particles (PM2.5) and black carbon emissions from diesel engines and potent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are abated when using natural gas.\nAt March 31, 2018, the company’s total current assets were $1,601,431 and total current liabilities were $1,218,429 -- resulting in positive working capital of $383,002 and a current ratio of 1.31 to 1.\nAbout Omnitek Engineering Corp.\nOmnitek Engineering Corp. develops and sells proprietary diesel-to-natural gas conversion systems and complementary products, including new natural gas engines that utilize the company’s technology -- providing global customers with innovative alternative energy and emissions control solutions that are sustainable and affordable.\nSome of the statements contained in this news release discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or financial condition or state other ``forward-looking'' information.
