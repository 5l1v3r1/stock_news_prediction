The source spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nA ‘SHOCK’ REJECTION Shares in the oil and gas producer had risen on the back of the sweetened proposals to A$6.4 per share, giving the company a market value of A$13.4 billion ($10.17 billion) - that was still below the offer price amid uncertainty over whether the deal would go ahead.\nOil prices LCOc1 have risen about 17 percent since Santos received Harbour’s initial $4.98 per share offer in April. [O/R]\nSantos, a recently revived company with a low cost of gas production and stakes in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Asia-Pacific, where demand is soaring, said its own strategy could achieve “superior” value.\n“Santos has had regard to ... the superior value for shareholders that the Santos Board believes could be realized through the execution of Santos’ existing strategy, capitalizing on its strong free cash flows, sustainable low cost operating model and significant growth opportunities,” the company said in the statement.\nRBC Capital markets said the rejection was a surprise, and put the board and executive team under pressure to demonstrate it can deliver value to shareholders.\n“The rejection is a shock to us as we saw the bid price as very much full,” RBC analysts wrote in a note to clients.\n“The onus is now firmly on the board and executive to execute strategy, grow the company and hope that oil, gas and LNG prices do not retreat materially,” they added.\nCiting other drawbacks to the offer, Santos said Harbour’s final bid was highly leveraged on private equity, and that Santos would have to provide fundraising support to Harbour and hedge a large part of its oil-linked production.\nThe deal had also been subject to approval by Australia’s foreign investment regulator.\nReporting by Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Tom Hogue and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:29:08.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
