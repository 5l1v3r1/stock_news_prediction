Governor Jerry Brown is planning a global climate summit this September.\nNine percent of single-family detached homes in the state of 39.5 million people currently have solar panels, according to a 2017 U.S. Department of Energy report the Energy Commission cited.\nThe renewable energy push is expected to cut California’s household emissions, which stood at 12 percent of the state’s total emissions in 2015.\nMost stem from natural gas-generated electricity, a process that emits heat-trapping carbon dioxide.\nConstructing a home in accordance with the new rules will add about $9,500 in immediate costs, according to estimates by the Energy Commission.\nIt will save homeowners about $19,000 in energy and maintenance costs over 30 years, Energy Commission spokeswoman Amber Pasricha Beck told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBuildings that are shaded or have a roof that is too small to accommodate panels will be among those exempt, Pasricha Beck said.\nClean-energy companies hailed the move as a major leap forward for the sector.\n\"With this type of clean energy championship, California continues to establish itself as an environmental and economic leader,\" said Lynn Jurich, chief executive of San Francisco-based residential solar installer Sunrun Inc.
