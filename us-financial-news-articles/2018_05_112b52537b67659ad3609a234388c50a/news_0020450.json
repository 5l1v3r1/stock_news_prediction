Giannola, formerly executive vice president and chief retail officer, is responsible for supporting the bank’s deposit and lending growth as well as overseeing the Bank’s investment division.\n“Vito has been an integral member of our executive leadership team since he joined the bank in 2010. He understands the importance of connecting with our customers,” said Anthony Labozzetta, president and CEO of SB One Bank. “I am confident he will continue to be an asset to the organization in his new role and further help us drive high performing results for the bank.”\nGiannola is a seasoned banking executive with more than 20 years in the profession. He joined the bank eight years ago under president and CEO, Anthony Labozzetta, and alongside CFO, Steven Fusco. Together they executed a shared vision for the bank – to build an organization based on strong customer relationships and service in the community. SB One Bank has experienced sustained organic growth since 2010, realizing a 106.5 percent increase in asset size from $474 million in 2010 to $979 million in 2017. After the recent merger with Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ, SB One Bank’s assets now exceed $1.4 billion.\n“When I started with SB One Bank (formerly Sussex Bank), our goal was to maintain strong organic growth, but it needed to be strategic and it needed to be in line with our vision. We put all of our focus on delivering the best customer experience possible and it’s proven successful,” said Vito Giannola. “Our customers know we understand their goals and they know that we always have their best interest, and that of the communities, in mind. They trust us, and their trust has really made all of the difference. Now, with a recent merger and increased potential for more enhanced products and services, there’s no better time to be a customer of our bank.”\nFor more details on SB One Bank visit: www.SBOne.bank\nAbout SB One Bancorp\nSB One Bancorp (Nasdaq:SBBX), is the holding company for SB One Bank, a full-service, commercial bank that operates regionally with 14 branch locations in New Jersey and New York.
