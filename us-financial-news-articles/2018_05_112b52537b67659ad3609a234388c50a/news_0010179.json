FILE PHOTO: A Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) logo is pictured on a sign in North Miami Beach, Florida, U.S. April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\nWorldwide sales at Yum’s restaurants open for at least a year rose 1 percent in the three months ended March 31, while analysts had expected a 2 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nSame-store sales at KFC and Pizza Hut also missed expectations.\nThe results come as U.S. fast food chains including Yum Brands and McDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ) are competing fiercely for customers’ loyalty with dollar menus, discounts and new breakfast items.\nYum said total revenue fell 3 percent to $1.37 billion (1 billion pounds) but topped estimates of $1.09 billion, thanks to stronger sales at Taco Bell.\nYum’s net income rose to $433 million or $1.27 per share in the first quarter, from $280 million or 77 cents per share a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, Yum earned 90 cents per share.\nYum’s shares fell about 1 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday.
