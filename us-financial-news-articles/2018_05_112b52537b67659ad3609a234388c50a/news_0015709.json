The revised fiscal 2018 forecast calls for earnings of between $1.11 and $1.18 per share, down from $1.64 to $1.75 per share.\nShares of the company were recently down nearly 4 percent in morning training. However, earlier the stock sunk as low as $25.80, a level not seen since Dec. 31, 2012.\nHain previously announced its plans to sell its protein business, which includes brands like Empire Kosher Poultry and Plainville Farms. Industry sources have speculated the sale of the protein business could pave the way for a sale of the bigger company.\nLogical buyers for the protein business include Tyson Foods , Cargill or Smithfield Foods .\nHain, like many of its food peers, said its earnings were compressed this quarter by higher freight and commodity inflation. The organic food company also has seen increased competition from upstart players and has struggled to manage a portfolio comprised of many small brands.\nNet income in the third quarter ended March 31, fell to $12.7 million, or 12 cents a share, from $31.3 million, or 30 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding items, Hain reported adjusted earnings per share of 37 cents, which was far less than analysts predicted.\nIt reported net sales for the quarter of $632.7 million, an 8 percent increase over the same quarter a year ago. Despite the gain, sales were short of expectations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T18:15:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
