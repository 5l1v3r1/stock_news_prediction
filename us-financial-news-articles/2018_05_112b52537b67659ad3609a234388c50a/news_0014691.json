Sagittarius has entered into a letter of intent to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of Irri-Al-Tal, which will constitute Sagittarius' qualifying transaction (see press release dated April 26, 2018).\nBusiness Update\nIrri-Al-Tal has recently completed the first tranche of an oversubscribed private placement (see press release dated April 26, 2018), which is the first time Irri-Al-Tal has sought external financing and the plan is to use the funds raise to, among other things, aggressively accelerate revenue growth. Since its founding in 2004, Irri-Al-Tal's mission was to focus on small and medium-sized farmers in the emerging markets, where installing professional irrigation system can have profound impact on yields and efficiency. These farmers have historically been overlooked by the larger industry players and over the years Irri-Al-Tal has developed a specialized approach to cater to their business needs and constraints. Irri-Al-Tal's main revenue streams are derived from the following business units:\nProjects Unit – focused on design, manufacturing and installation of turnkey irrigation systems;\nComponent and Equipment Sales – focused on selling irrigation equipment assembled in house and hardware components produced by third party manufacturers;\nProject Financing – a new business unit being developed by Irri-Al-Tal in order to provide secured financing to its project customers who require additional funds to complete the projects. Being close to the project helps Irri-Al-Tal to mitigate potential credit risk by getting adequate security coverage. This line is expected to be rolled-out after completing an additional capital raise.\nProprietary Technology Licensing – Irri-Al-Tal has been developing a technology solution that can provide actionable insights delivered to farmers in real time and provide an ability to remotely access and control key elements of the irrigation system. Irri-Al-Tal intends to finish developing this technology after completing an additional capital raise and including it with all project offerings to its customers.\nThus far in 2018, Irri-Al-Tal has been focused on executing eleven projects spread across eight countries and after deploying funds from the recent private placement expects to be on track with its original revenue expectations for 2018. The key projects of focus include:\nChina – turn-key Irrigation project related to a produce farm focused meeting China’s rapidly growing demand for organic fruits and vegetables.\nPeru – designing and installing an irrigation system for use in an open-field blueberry farm.\nGuatemala – actively engaged in two irrigation projects including a greenfield vegetable farm and an infrastructure restoration project.\nNigeria – implementing an aquaculture project focused on catfish production;\nEthiopia – actively engaged in three projects including a irrigation of a vegetable farm, a mango farm and a vineyard; and\nPeru – large scale irrigation system for a avocado farm.\nIrri-Al-Tal has also successfully secured a project in the rapidly growing legal cannabis space and is currently working to implement Irri-Al-Tal's irrigation systems in the cannabis cultivation project located in northern Israel which is being developed jointly with one of Canada's largest ACMPR licensed producers. Lastly, Irri-Al-Tal is experiencing strong growth in its Global Component and Equipment Sales business unit with shipments accelerating to clients in Canada, the U.S., Australia, Greece, Costa Rica and Portugal.\nAbout Irri-al-Tal\nIrri-al-Tal is an Israeli Irrigation and agriculture technology company and a global provider of smart Irrigation and water systems solutions for agricultural producers. Irri-Al-Tal was established in 2004 and employs 15 people worldwide.

A vast segment of the market that is comprised of smaller scale projects in developing nations have remained under the radar of the large irrigation technology companies.
