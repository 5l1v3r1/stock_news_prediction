As of March 31, 2018, approximately $96 million remained under the company’s May 17, 2017 $250 million authorization.\nThe repurchases will be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The stock repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time by the board of directors. Principal Financial Group, Inc. had approximately 286.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of April 25, 2018, per the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“This authorization supports our continued balanced approach to capital deployment to create long-term value for our shareholders - through common stock dividends, share repurchases, and strategic acquisitions,” said Dan Houston, chairman, president and CEO of Principal ® . “As we previously announced on our 2018 outlook call, we anticipate deploying $900 million to $1.3 billion of capital in 2018. This action reflects our continued confidence in the underlying strength of our diversified and integrated business model.”\nForward looking and cautionary statements\nCertain statements made by the company which are not historical facts may be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements as to non-GAAP operating earnings, net income attributable to PFG, net cash flows, realized and unrealized gains and losses, capital and liquidity positions, sales and earnings trends, and management’s beliefs, expectations, goals and opinions.
