For 2018, we remain focused on growing our portfolio of core ground lease assets while also targeting the new development initiatives that we have discussed,” said Tim Brazy, Chief Executive Officer of the Partnership’s general partner.\nQuarterly Distributions\nOn April 19, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Partnership’s general partner declared a cash distribution of $0.3675 per common unit, or $1.47 per common unit on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

We used the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $47.5 million to repay indebtedness.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Partnership’s outlook for acquisition volume is $250 million to $300 million in assets. This includes the right to purchase $200 million to $250 million in assets that the Partnership’s sponsor has expressed its intent to offer us, and approximately $50 million in new infrastructure deployments. These acquisitions and deployments, combined with organic portfolio growth, are expected to drive distribution growth of 10% over the fourth quarter 2017 distribution of $0.3675 per common unit by the fourth quarter 2018 (distribution to be paid in February 2019).\nConference Call Information\nThe Partnership will hold a conference call on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial and operating results.

We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest expense, current cash income tax expense, distributions to preferred unitholders, distributions to noncontrolling interest holders, and maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances. We believe that to understand our performance further, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should be compared with our reported net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), as presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded limited partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Each of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow has important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. You should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. As a result, because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please see the “Reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow” table below.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward-looking information. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “could,” “may,” “should,” “would,” “will” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the Partnership’s control and are difficult to predict. These statements are often based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including examination of historical operating trends made by the management of the Partnership. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, the Partnership cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements in this press release include our expected distribution growth for 2018 and expected acquisition opportunities from our sponsor. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in the Partnership’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), including the Partnership’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on February 15, 2018. These risks could cause the Partnership’s actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nCONTACT: Marcelo Choi Vice President, Investor Relations (213)

For example, if we have an easement on a single rooftop, on which three different tenants can lease space from us, this would be counted as three “tenant sites,” and all three tenant sites would be at a single infrastructure location with the same address.\n(2) Assumes the exercise of all remaining renewal options of tenant leases. Assuming no exercise of renewal options, the average remaining lease terms for our wireless communication, outdoor advertising, renewable power generation and aggregate portfolios as of March 31, 2018 were 3.9, 8.8, 18.3 and 5.6 years, respectively.\n(3) Represents the number of leased tenant sites divided by the number of available tenant sites.\n(4) Occupancy and average monthly effective rent per tenant site are shown only on an aggregate portfolio basis by industry.\n(5) Represents total monthly revenue excluding the impact of amortization of above and below market lease intangibles divided by the number of leased tenant sites.\n(6) Represents GAAP rental revenue recognized under existing tenant leases for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Excludes interest income on receivables.\n(7) Fee simple ownership and perpetual easements are shown as having a term of 99 years for purposes of calculating the average remaining term.\n(8) Reflects “springing lease agreements” whereby the cancellation or nonrenewal of a tenant lease entitles us to enter into a new ground lease with the property owner (up to the full property interest term) and a replacement tenant lease. The remaining lease assignment term is, therefore, equal to or longer than the remaining lease term. Also represents properties for which the “springing lease” feature has been exercised and has been replaced by a lease for the remaining lease term.\n(9) Excluding perpetual ownership rights, the average remaining property interest term on our tenant sites is approximately 66 years.
