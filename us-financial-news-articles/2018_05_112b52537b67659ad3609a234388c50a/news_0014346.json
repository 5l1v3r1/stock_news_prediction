Residents of a second area, Lanipuna Gardens, were barred from returning home on Monday due to deadly volcanic gases.\nLeilani Estates, some 12 miles (19 km) from the volcano, was evacuated due to the risk of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be life threatening at high levels.\n“Please, the residents of Leilani need our help. This is not the time for sightseeing. You can help tremendously by staying out of the area,” the agency said.\nKilauea, which began exploding on Thursday with foundations and rivers of lava flowing into neighborhoods, has opened 10 volcanic vents in the ensuing days, officials said.\nLava was not flowing from any of the vents on Monday, during a break in the eruptions.\nSo far, no deaths or major injuries have been reported, but the civil defense agency said 35 structures had been destroyed, many of them homes.

WXCHASING via REUTERS\nThe Hawaii Star-Advertiser newspaper reported that a Hawaii-based utility, Puna Geothermal Venture, had 60,000 gallons of flammable pentane gas stored in the area that could not be removed until containers were delivered.\nSome area residents returned for pets, medications and to check property on Sunday and Monday. Jeremy Wilson found his home surrounded by fissures hundreds of feet long.\n“My house is right in the middle,” said Wilson, a 36-year-old social worker who turned back when he saw steam coming from cracks in the road.\nThe semi-rural wooded area had become a magnet for newcomers to the Big Island of Hawaii, home to about 200,000 people, who were prepared to risk living near an active volcano for more affordable real estate.\nJessica Gauthier, 47, said she and other local real estate agents had seen vacation renters cancel their reservations, though the volcanic activity is far from tourist centers.\n“There’s no way to know that if you’re sitting in your living room in Ohio and watching the national news,” she said.\nHawaii’s 4,028-square-mile (10,432-square-km) Big Island accounts for less than a fifth of the state’s tourism. State data show that in the first three months of 2018, 16 percent of the $4.81 billion visitors spent in Hawaii came from the Big Island, less than half of the levels seen in Oahu and Maui.
