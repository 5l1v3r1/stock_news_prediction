REUTERS/Mike Blake\nThe company said California was 27 percent of revenue in the quarter and is becoming a larger percentage of deliveries. At the same time, Toll Brothers is facing higher costs even as demand for expensive homes remains strong.\nIn the quarter orders, an indication of future revenue for homebuilders, rose 6.2 percent to 2,666 homes.\nAdjusted gross margins, which was also affected by rising prices for building materials and labor cost pressure, slipped to 22.5 percent from 24.3 percent a year ago. Costs rose 20.5 percent to $1.29 billion.\nThe Pennsylvania-based company said the average price of homes in the reported quarter rose to $847,900 from $832,400 a year earlier, while the number of homes sold rose to 1,886 from 1,638.\nThe company raised its forecast for the number of homes it expects to sell in fiscal 2018 to between 8,000 and 8,500 units, from between 7,800 and 8,600 units.\nToll Brothers also raised the lower end of its full-year average price forecast to $830,000 from $820,000, but kept the higher end unchanged at $860,000.\nThe luxury homebuilder raised the lower end of its full-year revenue range outlook, now expecting between $6.64 billion and $7.31 billion, from a prior estimate of $6.40 billion and $7.40 billion.\nHomebuilders PulteGroup Inc ( PHM.N ) and Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) have also raised their annual home sales forecast, indicating homebuyers’ optimism in an improving economy despite rising mortgage rates.\nNet income fell to $111.8 million, or 72 cents per share, in the quarter ended April 30, from $124.6 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. The company recorded an inventory charge of $13.8 million in the latest second quarter.\nRevenue rose to $1.59 billion from $1.36 billion a year ago.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 76 cents per share and revenue of $1.58 billion.
