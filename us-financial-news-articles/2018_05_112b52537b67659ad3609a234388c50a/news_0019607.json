Here I am winning the 2018 World Championships ... bollock naked,” said Williams.\n“Where has it come from? Unbelievable 12 months. If I never win another tour or my form goes downhill I don’t care. I’ve just done something I thought I’d never ever do.”\nThe three-times world champion looked forward to returning to the Crucible next year and promised to outdo himself if he defended his title.\n“I’m just looking forward to coming back next year, I’m not going to say anything stupid and end up like this but to be honest if I won this next year I’d cartwheel down here naked.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T13:14:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
