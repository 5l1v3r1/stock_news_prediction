It said it did not think they were needed.\nThe Kremlin denied it had performed a U-turn on the missile question or that any decision was linked to Netanyahu’s visit.\nReporting by Denis Pinchuk; editing by John Stonestreet and Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:04:45.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
