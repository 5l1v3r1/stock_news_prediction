The country needs certainties, security and equilibrium.” Related Coverage\nThe breakthrough came after the League and 5-Star agreed to drop economist Paolo Savona as their choice for economy minister. Savona, an 81-year-old economist, had said previously that Italy should have a contingency plan to abandon the euro.\nHe will be substituted by economics professor Giovanni Tria, another little-known figure, party sources said.\nGlobal financial markets have been recovering over the past two days after tumbling on the specter of repeat elections dominated by debate over Italy’s future in the euro zone.\nItaly, with debts totaling 130 percent of its economic output, is the most heavily indebted euro zone nation after Greece and is often described as “too big to fail”.\nThough investors were relieved to avoid repeat elections, which they feared could have become a de facto referendum on the euro, they are now likely to refocus on the big spending plans of the League and 5-Star, which would add to its debts.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\nThe coalition has also said, in a joint policy manifesto signed during their first attempt at a union, that they will push the European Union to review the bloc’s fiscal rules, which Salvini says have “enslaved” Italians.\nThe parties’ new economics minister-designate, Tria, has been critical of the EU’s economic governance, but unlike Savona he has not advocated a contingency plan for exiting the euro.\nIn recent articles, he has called for a change in the EU’s fiscal rules to allow public investments to help growth and, like many mainstream economists, has criticized Germany’s persistently large current account surplus.\n“Maybe finally we have made it, after so many obstacles, attacks, threats and lies,” Salvini said on Facebook shortly after the deal was announced.\nAfter the first coalition attempt failed, President Sergio Mattarella named former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli to form a stop-gap government of experts to lead the country to elections no sooner than September.\nBut Cottarelli failed to present a cabinet and received no support from any of the major parties. On Thursday, he formally gave up his mandate.\nAssuming the new government gets a green light from Mattarella, Salvini will be the interior minister and Di Maio will take a powerful, newly-created joint ministry made up of the labor and industry portfolios, the parties said.
