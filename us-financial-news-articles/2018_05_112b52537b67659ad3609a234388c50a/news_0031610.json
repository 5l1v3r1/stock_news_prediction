Facebook employees work in the design studio at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California March 2, 2012. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\nSaba decided to focus on Facebook ( FB.O ), Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Apple since all of the Silicon Valley companies have a predominately male workforce and publish reams of data on hiring practices.\nThat data is at the core of the latest Breakingviews calculator, which crunches the numbers and finds that it could take nearly a decade or longer to reach gender parity at Facebook, Google and Apple.\n( here )\nUsers can input data on their employers to see how long it would take for women to make up half of a company’s workforce.\nSince 2012, Breakingviews has created more than 40 calculators, looking at such topics as the true cost of Brexit ( here ) and how much bond investors would lose as interest rates rose ( here ). Slideshow (2 Images)\nWorking with U.S. editor John Foley and graphics editor Vincent Flasseur, Saba reached out to the three companies to understand the factors behind a male-dominated workforce.\nSince the companies would not divulge employee turnover, Saba used a baseline assumption of 20 percent, broadly in line with the technology industry. She also looked at current female workforce, female new hires and workforce annual growth.\n“Simplicity makes it sharp,” Saba said.\nThe calculator demonstrated that at Apple and Google it would take 14 and 15 years, respectively, for women to comprise half the workforce. At Facebook, it would take seven years.\n“All three companies have such an incredible impact in the world, yet they have a dearth of women employees,” Saba said. “A company should reflect its customer, at the very least.” Reporting by Lauren Young", "external_links": ["http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/breakingviews/1/432/531/index.html", "http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/15/04/BV-Bonds_in_2020.html"], "published": "2018-05-17T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:36:58.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
