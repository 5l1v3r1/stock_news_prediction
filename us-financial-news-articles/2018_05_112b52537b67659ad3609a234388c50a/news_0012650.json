In Europe, Paris and London are also on the list, Guerra said on Thursday.\n“In the long term we aspire to reach 100 stores... and go beyond 1 billion euros in sales,” Guerra told a news briefing.\nEataly plans to increase revenue to 690-720 million euros in 2020 from 465 million euros last year. It is also targeting adjusted core profits of 60-65 million euros in 2020, from 25 million euros ($30 million) last year.\nThe group opened a food inspired theme park in the northern Italian city of Bologna last November. This includes shops, farm animals and eateries serving regional dishes.
