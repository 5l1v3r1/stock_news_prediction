Gross profit from operations of US$2.3 million (Q1 2017 US$1.3 million) Cash holdings at 31 March 2018 of US$6.7 million (31 December 2017: US$4.09 million). Completion, on 12 April 2018, of a share subscription by Greenstone Resources LP raising US$15 million. Announcement, on 29 March 2018, of a brokered share placing raising gross proceeds of £6.36 million, which is expected to complete on 15 May 2018. Payment, on 16 April 2018, of second US$5 million instalment for the purchase of Chapleau Resource Ltd and the Coringa Gold Project. Estimated cash following completion of brokered share placing of approximately US$23 million.\n2018 Guidance\nManagement expects that gold production for 2018 will exceed that of 2017 and be up to 40,000 ounces.\nOperational Highlights\nFirst quarter production of 9,188 ounces of gold. Mine production totalling 39,669 tonnes at 7.49 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") of gold. 43,145 tonnes processed through the plant for the combined mining operations, with an average grade of 7.04 g/t of gold. 2,353 metres of horizontal mine development completed during the quarter. Palito development and production continues to focus on the four main sectors of Senna, Pipocas, G3 and Mogno, whilst in the Sao Chico orebody, the main ramp has now reached level -3mRL, approximately 260 vertical metres below surface. Production is coming from levels 86mRL, 70mRL and 56mRL. With levels 40mRL, 26mRL and 10mRL all either developed or being developed, ahead of production. By the end of the quarter, surface ore stocks were approximately 10,200 tonnes, (December 2017: 15,000 tonnes) with an average grade of 3.0 g/t of gold, together with approximately 40,000 tonnes of flotation tailings grading approximately 3.0 g/t of gold.\nMike Hodgson, CEO of Serabi commented,\n\"This first quarter of 2018 has been extremely exciting for the Company and represents a step change in its growth and development.\n\"Gold production was in line with both guidance and our internal plans and, after allowing for capital expenditure and mine development costs, the gold production operations generated approximately US$1.7 million after tax in cash flow which has been used to fund the exploration programmes and the working capital requirements of the newly acquired Coringa project.\n\"On 11 May 2018, shareholders of the Company approved the issue of new shares required to complete the placing of shares arranged through our brokers Peel Hunt LLP as announced on 29 March 2018. This share placing is due to be finally completed and funds received on 15 May 2018. Together with the placing of shares with Greenstone Resources which was completed in April the Company will have raised gross proceeds of approximately US$23.5 million.\n\"We are now well funded, the exploration programmes that we have been planning are being implemented, and the permitting and planning of the Coringa project being progressed.\n\"The financial results for the quarter are very satisfying, and even before the cash received form the share issues, cash holdings had grown from US$4.1million at the end of 2017 to US$6.7 million at the end the first quarter, whilst gross profit from operations improved from US$1.26 million for the same quarter in 2017 to US$2.34 million for the first quarter of 2018. Administration costs were slightly higher but the Company has incurred some one-off costs in the period, including costs associated with the acquisition of Coringa, the debt renegotiation with Sprott that was completed in January 2018 and of course some costs associated with the raising of new equity.\n\"Finance costs are significantly higher than the comparative quarter, but in fact many of these are non-cash items, with actual interest charges on loans being US$152,000, with US$348,000 arising from accounting treatment of a derivatives transaction and the future payment obligations for Coringa.\n\"Whilst we have past tax losses, regulations regarding the use of these mean our profits in Brazil remain subject to profits taxes. We benefit however from being in a designated development area and therefore enjoy a lower tax rate than for other parts of the county. This dispensation was recently renewed for a further 10 year period and is something that we will seek to have extended to the Coringa project when the project is in production.\n\"The rest of the year promises to be very interesting and we expect to generate steady positive news flow from a successful exploration campaign from Palito and Sao Chico as well as progress at Coringa. The new funds that have been raised will allow significant acceleration of our organic growth plans and outstanding capital programmes whilst continuing the progress at Coringa, where completing the first stages of the initial permitting remains the immediate objective. We have made the first significant steps to realising our ambition to establish ourselves as a significant gold producer in Brazil with a target of an annualised production rate of 100,000 ounces within the next two years.\"\nSERABI GOLD PLC\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFor the three months ended\n31 March 2018 2017 (expressed in US$) Notes (unaudited) (unaudited) CONTINUING OPERATIONS Revenue 13,826,851 13,173,584 Cost of sales (9,489,101) (9,792,350) Provision for impairment of Inventory - (220,000) Depreciation and amortisation charges (1,992,853) (1,900,704) Gross profit 2,344,897 1,260,530 Administration expenses (1,331,424) (1,241,455) Share-based payments (77,293) (65,620) Gain on sales of assets disposal 51,115 - Operating profit / (loss) 987,295 (46,545) Foreign exchange (loss) / gain (57,090) 46,837 Finance expense (590,373) (33,817) Finance income 34 34 Profit / (loss) before taxation 339,866 (33,491) Income tax expense (329,080) (80,552) Profit / (loss) for the period from continuing operations attributable to the owners of the parent (1) 10,786 (114,043) Other comprehensive income (net of tax) Items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss Exchange differences on translating foreign operations (334,431) 1,467,847 Total comprehensive profit for the period operations attributable to the owners of the parent (323,645) 1,353,804 Profit / (loss) per ordinary share (basic) (1) 3 0.0015c (0.016c) Profit / (loss) per ordinary share (diluted) (1) 3 0.0015c (0.016c) (1) All revenue and expenses arise from continuing operations.\nSERABI GOLD PLC\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAs at As at As at 31 March 31 March 31 December 2018 2017 2017 (expressed in US$) (unaudited) (unaudited) (audited) Non-current assets Deferred exploration costs 25,295,721 10,234,360 23,898,819 Property, plant and equipment 47,736,835 45,862,328 48,980,381 Taxes receivable 1,569,140 - 1,474,062 Deferred taxation 2,772,101 3,313,099 2,939,634 Total non-current assets 77,373,797 59,409,787 77,292,896 Current assets Inventories 6,160,750 6,534,060 6,934,438 Trade and other receivables 1,151,999 2,996,060 1,277,142 Prepayments and accrued income 3,914,034 4,417,677 3,237,412 Cash and cash equivalents 6,695,525 3,407,117 4,093,866 Total current assets 17,922,308 17,354,914 15,542,858 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 5,291,005 4,713,274 5,347,964 Interest bearing liabilities 5,760,390 2,523,787 2,845,712 Acquisition payment outstanding 5,000,000 - 5,000,000 Derivative financial liabilities 754,462 - 709,255 Accruals 591,830 485,765 614,198 Total current liabilities 17,397,687 7,722,826 14,517,129 Net current assets 524,621 9,632,088 1,025,729 Total assets less current liabilities 77,898,418 69,041,875 78,318,625 Non-current liabilities Trade and other payables 2,590,883 2,260,691 2,753,409 Provisions 2,157,944 1,904,989 2,047,131 Acquisition payment outstanding 10,235,707 - 9,997,961 Interest bearing liabilities 2,299,524 77,798 2,749,412 Total non-current liabilities 17,284,058 4,243,478 17,547,913 Net assets 60,614,360 64,798,397 60,770,712 Equity Share capital 5,555,775 5,540,960 5,540,960 Share premium reserve 1,797,407 1,722,222 1,722,222 Option reserve 1,111,040 1,404,272 1,425,024 Other reserves 4,406,657 3,273,143 4,015,369 Translation reserve (31,533,999) (29,140,001) (31,199,568) Retained surplus 79,277,480 81,997,801 79,266,705 Equity shareholders' funds 60,614,360 64,798,397 60,770,712 The interim financial information has not been audited and does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.

General Information\nThe financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Whilst the financial information included in this announcement has been compiled in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") this announcement itself does not contain sufficient financial information to comply with IFRS. A copy of the statutory accounts for 2016 will be filed with the Registrar of Companies following their adoption by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. The full audited financial statements for the years end 31 December 2017 do comply with IFRS.\n2. Basis of Preparation\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are for the three month period ended 31 March 2018. Comparative information has been provided for the unaudited three month period ended 31 March 2017 and, where applicable, the audited twelve month period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosures that would otherwise be required in a complete set of financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 annual report.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" and the accounting policies are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and those envisaged for the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2018.\nThe Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.\nAs of 1 January 2018, lFRS 9 - Financial Instruments, and lFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts, became effective and have been adopted. The effect of implementation has not had a material impact on the financial results of the Group\nAs of the date of authorisation of these financial statements, IFRS 16 - Leases, was in issue but not effective and has not been applied to these financial statements.\nIFRS 16 will require the recognition of an asset and liability with respect to the material operating lease commitments that the group have. Management are currently considering the impact that this will have on the financial statements. The Group does not at this time anticipate voluntary early adoption of IFRS 16.\nThese financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\nGoing concern\nOn 12 April 2018 the Company completed a Subscription Agreement with Greenstone Resources II LP (\"Greenstone\"), whereby Greenstone agreed to subscribe (\"the Subscription\") for 297,759,419 New Ordinary Shares (\"the Subscription Shares\") at a price of 3.6 pence per share (the \"Subscription Price\"). The New Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the Subscription rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares.\nOn 29 March 2018 the Company announced the conditional placing of a further 176,678,445 new ordinary shares (\"Placing Shares\") at a price of 3.6 pence per Placing Share (the \"Placing Price\"), raising gross proceeds of approximately US$9.0 million (£6.36 million) for the Company. The Placing was conditional upon, among other things, the completion of the Greenstone Subscription and approval of the Placing by the Company's shareholders at the General Meeting held on 11 May 2018. The Placing Shares will, upon issue, rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares. Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\") and listed for trading on the TSX. It is currently expected that settlement of all of the Placing Shares and Admission will take place at 8.00 a.m. on 15 May 2018.\nThe Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected needs. The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its on-going operational requirements, to repay its secured loan facilities and to fund planned exploration and development activity on its other gold properties. However additional funding will be required to bring the newly acquired Coringa gold project into production including the final acquisition payment. The secured loan facility is repayable by 30 June 2020 and at 31 March 2018, the amount outstanding under this facility was US$7.21 million (2017: US$4.48 million).\nThe Directors consider that the Group's operations are performing at the levels that they anticipate but the Group remains a small-scale gold producer. Any unplanned interruption or reduction in gold production, unforeseen reductions in the gold price or appreciation of the Brazilian currency, could adversely affect the level of free cash flow that the Group can generate on a monthly basis. Nonetheless with the proceeds to be received from the Subscription, the Directors consider that they will nonetheless be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nOn this basis, the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.\n(ii) Use of estimates and judgements\nThere have been no material revisions to the nature and amount of changes in estimates of amounts reported in the 2017 annual financial statements.\n(iii) Impairment\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered impairment. Prior to carrying out of impairment reviews, the significant cash generating units are assessed to determine whether they should be reviewed under the requirements of IFRS 6 - Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources or IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. Such determination is by reference to the stage of development of the project and the level of reliability and surety of information used in calculating value in use or fair value less costs to sell. Impairment reviews performed under IFRS 6 are carried out on a project by project basis, with each project representing a potential single cash generating unit. An impairment review is undertaken when indicators of impairment arise; typically when one of the following circumstances applies:\n(i) sufficient data exists that render the resource uneconomic and unlikely to be developed\n(ii) title to the asset is compromised\n(iii) budgeted or planned expenditure is not expected in the foreseeable future\n(iv) insufficient discovery of commercially viable resources leading to the discontinuation of activities\nImpairment reviews performed under IAS 36 are carried out when there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired. Such key indicators (though not exhaustive) to the industry include:\n(i) a significant deterioration in the spot price of gold\n(ii) a significant increase in production costs\n(iii) a significant revision to, and reduction in, the life of mine plan\nIf any indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Such impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss for the year.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss for the year.\n3.
