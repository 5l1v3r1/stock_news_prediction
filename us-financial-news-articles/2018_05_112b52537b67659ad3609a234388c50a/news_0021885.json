(NASDAQ:VERU), a urology and oncology biopharmaceutical company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“During the quarter, we presented promising preclinical data on our cancer drug, VERU-111,” said Mitchell Steiner, M.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Veru. “The preclinical data reinforces our belief that VERU-111 has the potential to become an important therapeutic option for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer. We have been invited to present this exciting data later this month at the prestigious American Urological Association’s 2018 Annual Meeting in San Francisco.\nVeru was formed to advance the development of a portfolio of late stage drug products. We remain committed to a strategy that expedites product regulatory approval. Tamsulosin DRS granules final bioequivalence clinical study results and NDA filing are expected in 2018. We are also delighted to report that the US Food and Drug Administration granted a waiver of the drug application fee, approximately $2.4 million, related to our New Drug Application for Tamsulosin DRS granules and Tamsulosin XR capsules. Our other urology drugs, Tadalafil/finasteride combination tablet and Solifenacin DRG granules final bioequivalence clinical results are also anticipated in 2018 with NDA filings in 2019.\n“We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for VERU-944 for the treatment of hot flashes in men on advanced prostate cancer hormone treatment this summer. We are also planning a Phase 1/2 clinical trial later this calendar year for VERU-111, our novel oral anti-tubulin cancer therapy targeting alpha & beta tubulin focusing on men who have metastatic prostate cancer that have failed abiraterone or enzalutamide therapies.\n“Turning to our fiscal 2018 second quarter financial results. Net revenues, which are primarily derived from product sales of FC2 Female Condom ® , increased 7% over the comparable prior year period. During the quarter, we successfully completed a $10 million “synthetic” royalty financing on FC2 product sales. This transaction provided immediate, non-dilutive funds to support our drug development program and operations, as well as provide financial flexibility.”\nFiscal Second Quarter Results: 2018 vs. 2017\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net revenues increased to $2.6 million from $2.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit was $1.2 million, or 47% of net revenues, compared with $1.3 million, or 53% of net revenues, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating expenses were $5.9 million compared with $3.9 million, which includes business acquisition expenses of $108,000. Net loss was $3.8 million, or $0.07 per share, compared with $1.8 million, or $0.06 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nSignificant quarter-to-quarter variations in the Company’s results have historically resulted from the timing and shipment of large orders rather than from any fundamental changes in the business or the underlying demand for female condoms.\nConference Call Event Details\nVeru Inc. will host a conference call on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 8 a.m. Eastern Time to review the company’s performance.
