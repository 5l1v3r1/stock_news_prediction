The company also asked the CVM to investigate the ties between Geração Futuro and Nippon.\nNippon Steel is a major shareholder in competing Brazilian steelmaker Usiminas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA, known as Usiminas.\nRepresentatives for CSN and Geração Futuro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nReporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T15:40:32.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
