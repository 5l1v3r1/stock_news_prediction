The bonds were sold in 2014.\nThe amount of bonds ICL will sell depends on how many bondholders respond to its offer but the company does not intend to increase its net debt.\nICL is offering a premium of about 2.25 points over current yields to entice bondholders to sell, it said.\nIts bonds were up 0.1 percent in price at midsession to yield 2.11 percent.\n“ICL is undertaking the tender offer in order to manage its overall funding level and optimize the maturity profile as part of ICL’s ongoing liability management,” it said.\n“ICL intends to partially replace cash on hand or repay short-term borrowings and its revolving credit facility with the net proceeds from the concurrent offering of new notes.”\nEarlier on Monday, Fitch rated the upcoming offering ‘BBB-‘.
