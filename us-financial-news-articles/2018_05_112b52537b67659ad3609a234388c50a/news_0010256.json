The Fed is gradually tightening credit to control inflation against the backdrop of a tight job market, a resilient economy and a pickup in consumer prices.\nIn a statement, the central bank said it expects \"further gradual increases\" in rates and says recent data show it's edging close to achieving its annual 2 percent target for annual inflation.\n\"Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,\" the Fed said.\nThe reference to \"symmetric\" suggests that Fed officials might be willing to let inflation run slightly above its 2 percent target for some time, given that inflation has run below the target for six years.\nThe Fed's statement noted that the U.S. job market has continued to strengthen along with a steady economy, now into its ninth year of expansion since the Great Recession ended.\n\"Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months and the unemployment rate has stayed low,\" the statement said.\nThe Fed did note that household spending has slowed from its robust pace in the final months of 2017 and held back economic growth in the January-March quarter. But most economists expect a solid rebound, with the economy expanding at a 3 percent annual rate or better, in the current April-June quarter.\nDespite signs that inflation is edging up, few analysts expect any aggressive pickup in rate hikes. Most foresee either two or three additional increases in the Fed's benchmark rate by year's end, coming after an earlier hike in January.\nThe next rate increase is expected in June. Some analysts think the Fed may signal then that it foresees four hikes for 2018, up from the three it predicted in March.\nThe Fed's decision Wednesday, which had been expected, came on an 8-0 vote. It was Jerome Powell's second meeting as chairman since succeeding Janet Yellen earlier this year. Powell in the past has signaled support for the gradual pace of rate hikes that Yellen oversaw.\nAt a news conference after the central bank's previous meeting in March, Powell had said, that. A year ago, the 10-year yield was just 2.3 percent.\nThe Trump appointees who\nUnder Powell's predecessors, Yellen and Ben Bernanke, the board endured criticism from some cut\n Even now, the Fed's benchmark short-term rate, which influences consumer and business loan rates throughout the economy, remains in a low range.\nTwo weeks ago, Trump announced the nomination of Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist and expert on monetary policy, as the Fed's vice chairman. That choice was seen as providing specialized expertise for Powell, who is not an economist.\nThe president also nominated Michelle Bowman, the Kansas state bank commissioner, for a Fed board slot that is normally reserved for a community banker. Earlier, Trump chose Randal Quarles, an investment banker, as vice chairman for bank supervision, and Marvin Goodfriend, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, for another vacant board seat.\nThe president's nominations generally match mainstream views on the Fed's proper role in managing rates. One exception is Goodfriend, who has favored changes pushed by conservatives to limit the Fed's flexibility in rate decisions. Goodfriend's nomination squeaked out of a Senate committee on a 13-12 vote, with all Democrats opposed, indicating he could face difficulty winning confirmation by the full Senate.\nEven if Trump's selections all win approval, he would still have one more vacancy to fill on the seven-member board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T21:13:21.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
