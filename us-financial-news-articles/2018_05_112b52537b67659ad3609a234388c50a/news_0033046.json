It was unclear how much was still on the market.\nCheeses made at other plants of the supplier are not covered by the alert, Chabert said.\nIn another health alert affecting children, France witnessed a massive recall of baby milk late last year after cases of salmonella bacteria were linked to a factory of dairy giant Lactalis.\nThe health ministry said on Monday there had been no new case of E.coli reported over the weekend and that one of the seven children infected was yet to return home.\nHowever, new cases could emerge now that hospitals and doctors had been alerted to the problem, the French agriculture ministry’s deputy head of food, Loic Evain, said.\n“A case of HUS is far more serious than a case of salmonella as seen at Lactalis,” he said.\n“The problem is solved in terms of products, there won’t be any contaminated Reblochon left on the market, but we cannot say that things are over as a public health matter. It is possible that other cases will be revealed.”\nReporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T18:26:06.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
