Petty Officer Neil Roberts fell out of the helicopter and onto the mountaintop before the aircraft crash-landed lower in a valley.\nSlabinski made the decision to lead the remainder of his team up the mountain to rescue Roberts, who had fallen into area dense with enemies. For more than 14 hours, Slabinski and his team defended their position and fought against enemies until the mountaintop was secured and the team could be extracted, the Navy said.\nThe award from Trump on Thursday will make Slabinksi the 12th recipient of the Medal of Honor for bravery displayed in battle in Afghanistan, the Navy said.\nSEAL Team Six is best known for killing Osama bin Laden, a leader of terrorist group al Qaeda, in 2011.", "external_links": ["http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=105491"], "published": "2018-05-24T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:39:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
