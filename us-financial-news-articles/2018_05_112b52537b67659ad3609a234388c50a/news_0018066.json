The Roy Hill loss resulted in a one-time charge of A$5 million. Incitec will stop supplying BHP from November 2019.\nPartly offsetting the pain, the company booked a one-time gain of A$96.5 million due to the cut in the U.S. company tax rate.\nOrica, the world’s top supplier of commercial explosives, said on Monday its first-half underlying profit fell 37 percent, as unplanned plant shutdowns and bad weather crimped production.
