The official also revealed that the kingdom is in talks with other countries should America refuse.\nSaudi Arabia has said it plans to construct 16 nuclear power reactors over the next 20 to 25 years, costing more than $80 billion. It has invited U.S. firms to take part in the program but acceptance from Washington requires a country to sign a peaceful nuclear cooperation pact.\nThat pact is known as a 123 agreement, which separates civil and military nuclear facilities. It also aims to block the steps countries can take to move from nuclear fuel production to potential bomb-making applications.\n\"That negotiation is still going on (and) that also requires congressional approval,\" Jones said, adding he didn't know if such an approval will come. \"We'll see. They're working at it and they've been very quiet about those negotiations. It's very hard to get information out of either the Saudis or the U.S. government exactly where that stands.\"\nRiyadh has previously stated it wants to tap its own uranium resources for \" self-sufficiency in producing nuclear fuel ,\" according to Reuters.\nBut the Saudi pursuit of nuclear energy has made many observers nervous. In March, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS News that, if Iran were to build a nuclear bomb, so would Saudi Arabia.\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced he will withdraw the United States from the nuclear deal that was reached with Iran in 2015. As a result, the U.S. is set to restore far-reaching sanctions on the country .\nThe landmark nuclear agreement had lifted sanctions on Iran. In exchange, it accepted limits on its nuclear program and allowed international inspectors into its facilities.\nâ€” CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:42:15.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
