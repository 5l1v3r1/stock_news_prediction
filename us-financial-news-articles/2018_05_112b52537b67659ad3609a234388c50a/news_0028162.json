Maintenance & content services revenue of $3.1 million decreased 2% from $3.2 million in the same period last year. Professional services revenue of $1.3 million decreased 28% from $1.9 million in the same period last year, resulting primarily from lower new sales orders and sales mix.\nGross margin of 54.4% decreased from 55.1% in the first quarter of 2017, resulting primarily from lower gross margin on products and professional services revenue.\nTotal operating expenses of $6.8 million increased by 6% from $6.4 million in the same period last year, resulting primarily from merger transaction expenses for professional and legal fees incurred during the first quarter of 2018 associated with the merger agreement entered into by the company on April 2, 2018 described below.\nGAAP net loss was $2.9 million, or ($0.26) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or ($0.11) per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, Adj. EBITDA loss of $1.9 million compared to an Adj. EBITDA loss of $560 thousand in the same period last year. 1\nAt March 31, 2018, the company had $2.7 million in borrowings and $1.2 million in unused availability under its revolving line of credit and cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 million.\nDefinitive Merger Agreement\nOn April 2, 2018, RMG entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which SCG Digital, LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Gregory H. Sachs, RMG’s Executive Chairman, will acquire RMG in a transaction valued at approximately $16.8 million, including the assumption of approximately $2.7 million of debt. Under the terms of the merger agreement, RMG stockholders will receive $1.27 in cash for each share of RMG’s common stock they hold. In light of this development, the company will not be providing an outlook for 2018 and will not be holding a conference call to discuss the company’s financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nThe board of directors of RMG, on the recommendation of a special committee of the board comprised entirely of independent directors, has approved the merger agreement and has resolved to recommend that RMG’s stockholders adopt the agreement.\nSubject to receipt of stockholder approval, as well as satisfaction of other closing conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018.\nSubordinated Debt Facility\nIn connection with the merger agreement, RMG and certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into a subordinated loan and security agreement on April 2, 2018, with SCG Digital Financing, LLC as the lender, providing RMG with a $2 million bridge loan. In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by RMG because SCG Digital, LLC fails to consummate the merger when otherwise obligated to do so, SCG Digital Financing, LLC will make an additional loan to RMG of $1 million, on terms governed by the subordinated loan agreement. SCG Digital Financing, LLC is an affiliate of Mr. Sachs and SCG Digital, LLC.\nThe bridge loan matures on the later of April 2, 2019 and, if the additional loan is funded, the first anniversary of the funding of the additional loan. No principal payments are required under either loan prior to maturity and, except in limited circumstances, no principal payments are permitted prior to the first anniversary of the date of the subordinated loan and security agreement. Interest on the bridge loan accrues at a per annum cash interest rate equal to 8.0% above the prime rate plus an additional 2.0% paid-in-kind, and interest on the additional loan will accrue at a per annum paid-in-kind interest rate equal to 5% above the prime rate. If the bridge loan is prepaid prior to the stated maturity date thereof, the borrowers are obligated to pay a prepayment premium equal to the interest the loans would have accrued if they had remained outstanding through maturity. During an event of default, the rate of interest on the loans would increase to 2.5% above the otherwise applicable rate, until such event of default is cured or waived. All accrued and unpaid cash interest is payable quarterly on the last day of each fiscal quarter and PIK interest is added to the principal balance on such date as well.\nUpon the occurrence of certain events, the lender has the right to convert principal and accrued interest outstanding under the bridge loan and the additional loan into shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the company on the terms set forth in the subordinated loan and security agreement.\nThe bridge loan and, if funded, the additional loan, are secured by a second priority lien in all of the assets of the borrowers.\nAmendment to Revolving Line of Credit\nOn April 2, 2018, the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Restated Loan Agreement”) with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Bank”). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the minimum EBITDA covenant in the Restated Loan Agreement was amended and the Bank consented to the incurrence of certain subordinated debt pursuant to a subordinated loan and security agreement by the company and certain of its subsidiaries, among other things.\nAbout RMG\nRMG (NASDAQ: RMGN) goes beyond traditional communications to help businesses increase productivity, efficiency and engagement through digital messaging.

EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. In evaluating its business, RMG considers and uses Adj. EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its operating performance, and believes that many of the company's investors use this non-GAAP measure to monitor the company's performance. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with this GAAP measure. Our definition of Adj. EBITDA is set forth in footnote (1) above, and a reconciliation between Adj. EBITDA and the relevant GAAP measure is set forth in the table at the end of this press release.\nImportant Additional Information will be Filed with the SEC\nIn connection with the proposed merger, RMG will file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE, BECAUSE IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE PARTIES THERETO. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the proxy statement and other documents (when available) filed by RMG at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Web site at http://www.sec.gov . The proxy statement and such other documents (when available) may also be obtained for free from RMG by directing such request to RMG Networks Holding Corporation, 15301 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 500, Addison, TX, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.\nRMG and its directors, executive officers and other members of its management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from its stockholders in connection with the proposed merger. Information concerning the interests of RMG’s participants in the solicitation, which may be different than those of RMG stockholders generally, is set forth in RMG’s proxy statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in the proxy statement relating to the merger when it becomes available. To the extent holdings of such participants in RMG’s securities are not reported, or have changed since the amounts described in the proxy statements, such changes have been or will be reflected on Initial Statements of Beneficial Ownership on Form 3 or Statements of Change in Ownership on Form 4 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
