REUTERS/Ralph D. Freso “After careful consideration, I have decided this is a very difficult but necessary step the franchise must take. As a team, we are constantly trying to grow and improve in order to get to the next level,” Raptors president Masai Ujiri said in a statement. “We celebrate everything Dwane has done for the organization, we thank him, and we wish him nothing but the best in future. He was instrumental in creating the identity and culture of who we are as a team, and we are so proud of that.”\nThe Raptors won a franchise-record 59 games this season to earn the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference, but a sweep by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round had Casey rumored to be on the hot seat. The 61-year-old has led the Raptors to the playoffs each of the past five seasons, though the repeated postseason failures have begun adding up.\nThe Raptors battled past the Washington Wizards in six games in the first round, setting up a matchup with LeBron James’ Cavaliers for the third consecutive postseason. The result was more of the same, as the sweep marked the second consecutive year the Cavs took four straight from the Raptors without losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Toronto won two games in losing to Cleveland in the conference finals in 2016.\nCasey leaves as the winningest coach in franchise history, with the team going 320-238 under his watch.\nCasey was named Coach of the Year by his peers in the National Basketball Coaches Association on Wednesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:18:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
