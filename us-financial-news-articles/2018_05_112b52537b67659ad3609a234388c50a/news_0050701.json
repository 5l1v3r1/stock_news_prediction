I’m still in front so it’s all good,” an exhausted Yates said after the race.\nDumoulin was cautiously optimistic and clearly pleased to have picked his moment so well to get within 28 seconds of Yates in the general classification.\n“I was waiting until the moment and with two kilometers to go I tried to see what was possible,” he said. “Yates responded to my first attack and then Froome attacked and I tried to follow and I suddenly found (Yates) was dropped so it was nice.”\nItalian Domenico Pozzovivo is third in the general standings, with Froome in fourth place, three minutes 22 seconds behind Yates.
