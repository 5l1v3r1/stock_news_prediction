Unite, the U.K.'s largest union, said that the change would cost TGI Fridays' waiters, most of whom are on minimum wage, up to £250 ($286) a month in lost income.\nTGI Fridays denied accusations that it was paying staff unfairly. The company plans to keep its restaurants open during the walkout, according to a TGI Fridays spokesman, who said that it was working with its employees to find a solution.\n\"We believe all our team members should be — and are — treated and paid fairly,\" the spokesman said.\nThe 24-hour strike is underway in the restaurant's Milton Keynes and Covent Garden branches, with locations in Manchester's Trafford Centre and London's Haymarket Piccadilly to go on strike next week.\n'So greedy' \"Our members have sent a very clear message that they will not roll over and be bullied into having their tips taken, without any consultation and with just two days' notice,\" Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said in a press statement.\n\"This isn't about minimum wage servers not wanting to share with their kitchen colleagues. It's about a company whose shareholders have gotten so greedy that they no longer want to pay their hardworking staff anything above the bare minimum.\"\n\"We won't back down, but we are ready to talk,\" Turnbull added.\nTGI Fridays in March was fined for failing to pay its staff the U.K. minimum wage , along with more than 40 other hospitality businesses. Consumer spending on casual dining has waned in recent years, putting companies under pressure to cut costs.\nThe American casual dining chain, which serves \"American classics\" like barbecue wings and burgers as well as a range of alcoholic beverages, operates more than 900 restaurants in some 60 countries. As a franchise operation, franchisees own most of the outlets.", "external_links": ["https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates", "http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/tgi-fridays-is-risking-a-summer-of-disruption-as-first-strikes-start/"], "published": "2018-05-18T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:45:30.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
