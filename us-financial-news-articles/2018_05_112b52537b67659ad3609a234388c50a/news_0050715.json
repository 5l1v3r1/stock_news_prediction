REUTERS/Mohammad Khursheed/File Photo Domestic online comparable sales growth slowed to 12 percent, compared to 22.5 percent growth a year ago.\nBest Buy’s Chief Financial Officer Corie Barry said on a call with investors the company’s online sales during the first quarter of last fiscal year had benefited from product launches such as the Nintendo Switch and the Samsung S8.\n“Based on our data, we believe we continue to gain share online,” she said.Best Buy’s shares, which had opened up in pre-market trade, reversed course and fell over 3 percent. The shares have risen almost 11 percent since the start of the year.\nOverall sales growth was aided by strong consumer demand and better product innovation. Demand for mobile phones, appliances, computing, tablets and smart home products drove comparable sales growth for the retailer.\nSales at established stores rose 7.1 percent in the first quarter ended May 5, handily beating analysts’ average expectation for a 2.9-percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix. The growth benefited from an easier comparison to a relatively soft period a year ago.\nDespite the slowdown in e-commerce sales during this quarter the company’s turnaround has been strong. The Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer has weathered the encroachment of Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) better than most retailers. It posted its best holiday quarter performance last year since 2003.\nIn March, Best Buy’s Chief Executive Hubert Joly told Reuters in an interview the company has completed a five-year turnaround and is ready to compete with Amazon to prove U.S. retail is not a “winner takes all” situation.\nBest Buy has about 15 percent of the U.S. consumer electronics market. Along with Amazon, the two retailers have about 25 percent market share, leaving room to grow, Joly said.\nThe company’s investments in price-matching, faster delivery, improving the search function on its website and better customer service to draw shoppers to its stores and website have weighed on profitability.\nNon-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was down slightly from a year ago; so was the domestic gross profit rate, driven primarily by rate pressure in the mobile phones category and a legal settlement.\nBest Buy’s net income rose to $208 million, or 72 cents per share, in the quarter, from $188 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, earnings were 82 cents per share. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 74 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company’s revenue rose to $9.10 billion, beating estimates of $8.74 billion.\nReporting by Nandita Bose in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:22:48.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
