The apical in/out procedure time for these most recent four TIARA-II implants were 9 minutes, 9 minutes, 10 minutes and 12 minutes, respectively. For the two recent TIARA-I implants, they were 11 minutes and 45 minutes (mainly due to challenging echo imaging quality). To date, a total of 56 patients have been implanted with the Tiara.

Each Series C Warrant may be exercised at an exercise price equal to US$1.46 (subject to adjustment) at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on November 18, 2019 for a Series C unit (a \"Series C Unit\"), with each Series C Unit being comprised of one Common Share, one Series A warrant (a \"Series A Warrant\") and one Series B warrant (a \"Series B Warrant\").\nAt the close of business on April 24, 2018, there were 1,251,641 Series B Warrants outstanding and 2,192,748 Series B Warrants issuable upon exercise of the remaining Series C Warrants outstanding, if those Series C Warrants are exercised, 33,757,592 Series A Warrants outstanding and 2,192,748 Series A Warrants issuable upon exercise of the remaining Series C Warrants outstanding, if those Series C Warrants are exercised, 22,431,507 Series E warrants (the \"Series E Warrants\") outstanding and US$29,525,000 aggregate amount of senior secured convertible notes (the \"Notes\") outstanding.

The Company will also be seeking shareholder approval at the next Annual and Special General Meeting, scheduled for June 4, 2018, to carry out a share consolidation at an appropriate time.
