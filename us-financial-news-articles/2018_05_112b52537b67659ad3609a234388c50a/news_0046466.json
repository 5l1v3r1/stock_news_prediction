In a review of 1,450 digital coin offerings, the Wall Street Journal found that about 19 per cent of these ICOs, which had raised about $1 billion in total, raised red flags that included \"plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.\" The SEC last week launched a bogus ICO called HoweyCoins as part of an effort to educate investors about warning signs to watch for.\nDespite the high risks involved in launching and buying into ICOs, there can be significant payoffs for both founders that want to raise capital, and investors who want to make money.\nOne of the most successful ICOs launched was that of the Ethereum project, which has become the world's second largest cryptocurrency. It sold 60 million ether coins in 2014 to raise capital in the form of 31,000 bitcoin.\nMangrove Capital, an early investor in Skype, performed analysis claiming that if an investor had blindly invested in every visible ICO, including a significant number which failed, the return would have been 13.2 times that of your initial investment .\nMangrove did not disclose the number of ICOs it used in its research.\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating and shutting down ICOs. Last week, the agency launched a bogus ICO called HoweyCoins as part of an effort to educate investors about warning signs to watch for.
