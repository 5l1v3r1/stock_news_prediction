The addition of John Olynick, an experienced public company chief executive and business builder, brings another dimension of business insight and experience to the Company and this Board. Peter Hauser has been supporting our mission to bring our innovative GTL solution to market by assisting with public relations, marketing, sales and finance.

Last, but certainly not least, Ransom Jones rejoining us as CFO will be of invaluable importance as we seek new investment and financial relationships, business and operational partnerships.
