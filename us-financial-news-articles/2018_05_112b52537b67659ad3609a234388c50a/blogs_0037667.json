Some states see sports betting, like lotteries, as a potentially important source of tax revenue.\nThe Supreme Court justices struck down the entire federal law on a 6-3 vote, with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer dissenting.\n\"The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make.

Phil Murphy said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with the Legislature to enact a law authorizing and regulating sports betting in the very near future.\"\nAllowing sports to legalize sports betting is great news for investors in both professional sports teams and the gambling industry, billionaire Mark Cuban told CNBC on \"Squawk Alley.\"\n\"I think everyone who owns a top four professional sports team just basically saw the value of their team double,\" said Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. show chapters 3 Hours Ago | 03:45\nThe ruling takes the U.S. a step closer to legal sports betting in numerous states, possibly even nationwide.

[are] what everyone's going to be paying attention to,\" Waldrep said. \"What they really want is a situation where there's some unpredictability, like a great Australian swimmer going against a great U.S. swimmer. What the betting market needs is competitive events.\"\n\"Tokyo is trying to take advantage of it because there is going to be a massive influx of people,\" Waldrep added.\nMultiple professional sports leagues, as well as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, were challenging the New Jersey law: Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League.\n\"Today's decision by the United States Supreme Court will have profound effects on Major League Baseball,\" MLB said in a statement. \"As each state considers whether to allow sports betting, we will continue to seek the proper protections for our sport, in partnership with other professional sports.\"\nThe ruling's implication for college sports is unclear, according to the NCAA.
