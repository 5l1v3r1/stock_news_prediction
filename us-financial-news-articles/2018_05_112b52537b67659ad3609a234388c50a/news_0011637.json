But he never faced civilian justice because of the country’s abbreviated statute of limitations.\n“This is a miracle. It’s a huge advance. I’m very excited. I wasn’t expecting this,” said Karadima victim James Hamilton.\nHamilton had previously called bishops whom he accused of covering up the abuse “criminals” who deserved to be jailed.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the bill would apply retroactively, or only affect crimes committed following its passage.\nThe bill also follows a high-profile case in which a 20-month-old infant girl was raped and later murdered by a family member in Los Andes, a town outside of Santiago, dominating headlines and increasing pressure for more stringent laws against abuse.\nThe girl’s funeral was also held on Thursday.\nAccording to government figures, more than 22,540 cases of sex crimes take place in Chile, or nearly three per hour.
