(NASDAQ:SND) (the “Company” or “Smart Sand”), a pure-play, low-cost producer of high quality Northern White raw frac sand, today announced results for the first quarter\n“The demand for frac sand, and in particular Northern White, continues to be strong. We sold record quarterly volumes from our Oakdale facility in the first quarter and we anticipate strong demand for our expanded nameplate capacity, which is currently ramping up and is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter,” stated Charles Young, Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to take steps towards becoming a fully integrated ‘mine to the wellhead’ supplier of frac sand. During the first quarter we partnered with Canadian Pacific to offer our customers competitive, efficient rail services, acquired rights to operate a unit train capable transloading terminal in the Bakken, and signed a new long-term take-or-pay contract with a large exploration and production company for delivery of frac sand at our terminal in the Bakken. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Quickthree Solutions, Inc., a manufacturer of portable vertical frac sand storage solutions at the wellsite. This deal is expected to close by the end of May.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenues were $42.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, a slight decrease compared to fourth quarter 2017 revenues of $43.0 million. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to higher production costs and lower freight revenue, offset by higher sales volumes and a higher average price per ton sold. First quarter 2018 revenues increased by 70% compared to first quarter 2017 revenues of $25.1 million. The increase in revenues year over year was primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher freight revenue, resulting from increased shipments to customers to whom we bill freight charges.\nOverall tons sold were approximately 723,000 in the first quarter of 2018, the highest in Company history, compared to approximately 706,400 tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 559,000 tons in the first quarter of 2017, increases of 2% and 29%, respectively.\nNet income was $1.0 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with net income of $10.9 million, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $1.0 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a one-time tax benefit of $8.5 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share, that was booked in the fourth quarter 2017 due to the changes in the U.S. tax laws that were enacted in December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.7 million during the same period last year, an increase of 58% on a year-over-year basis and a decrease of 34% compared to fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $8.9 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher freight revenue, partially offset by higher production costs. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher operating expenses incurred in anticipation of the expansion of our Oakdale facility, which we expect to be completed and operational during the second quarter of 2018, and less costs being capitalized to inventory while our wet plant operations are reduced during winter months.\nCapital Expenditures\nSmart Sand’s capital expenditures totaled $46.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and were largely associated with the expansion at our Oakdale sand processing facility, investment in various enhancement and cost improvement projects and our terminal investment in the Bakken. The Company estimates that full year 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $85 to $95 million, excluding any additional acquisitions, of which $45.7 million relates to capital expenditure carryover from 2017 to complete the expansion of our Oakdale facility to 5.5 million tons of dry nameplate sand processing capacity. This expansion is being commissioned and is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2018. At March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $2.6 million of cash on hand. On April 6, 2018, the Company amended its credit facility to increase the amount available by $15 million to $60 million, of which $45 million is currently available to support liquidity needs in 2018.\nConference Call\nSmart Sand will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors this morning, May 10 th , at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations, (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions, including our initial public offering, (iii) equity compensation; (iv) development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions, (vi) earn-out and contingent consideration obligations and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets;\nthe viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities;\nour ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures;\nour operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods and capital structure; and\nour debt covenant compliance as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants in our credit agreement.\nWe believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 (in thousands) Net (loss) income $ 975 $ 10,886 $ 969 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,160 2,184 1,667 Income tax expense (benefit) 232 (6,165 ) 515 Interest expense 219 174 173 Franchise taxes 220 31 228 EBITDA $ 4,806 $ 7,110 $ 3,552 (Gain) loss on sale of fixed assets (1) - 66 (39 ) Integration and transition costs - - - Equity compensation (2) 490 495 176 Development costs (3) 328 766 - Cash charges related to restructuring and retention (4) 94 40 - Non-cash charges (5) 134 453 20 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,852 $ 8,930 $ 3,709 (1) Includes gains and losses related to the sale and disposal of certain assets in property, plant and equipment. (2) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense. (3) Represents costs related to current development project activities. (4) Represents costs associated with the retention and relocation of employees. (5) Represents accretion of asset retirement obligations. Production Costs\nWe also use production costs, which we define as costs of goods sold, excluding depreciation, depletion, accretion of asset retirement obligations and freight charges to measure our financial performance. Freight charges consist of shipping costs and railcar rental and storage expenses. Shipping costs consist of railway transportation costs to deliver products to customers. A portion of these freight charges are passed through to our customers and are, therefore, included in revenue. Railcar rental and storage expenses are associated with our long-term railcar operating agreements with certain customers. We believe production costs is a meaningful measure to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because it provides a measure of operating performance that is unaffected by historical cost basis and logistics charges that vary by customer. Cost of goods sold is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to production costs. Production costs should not be considered an alternative to cost of goods sold presented in accordance with GAAP. Because production costs may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of production costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of production costs to cost of goods sold:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 (in thousands) Cost of goods sold $ 35,413 $ 32,938 $ 19,662 Depreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations (3,106 ) (2,490 ) (1,579 ) Freight charges (17,158 ) (20,009 ) (9,228 ) Production costs 15,149 10,439 8,855 Production costs per ton $ 20.95 $ 14.79 $ 15.84 Total tons sold 723 706 559 Investor Contacts\nLee Beckelman\nCFO\n(281) 231-2660\nLBeckelman@smartsand.com\nPhil Cerniglia\nInvestor Relations and Budgeting Manager\n(281) 231-2660\nPCerniglia@smartsand.com\nSource:Smart Sand, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oaR5Hkc0VvYp_ddwnW4MSrvBMksKNU7bQWUnMjmUp_yqjHzqY_T3MB7yvGJ1GWw7ulcTczHjBlr2VUGH_MXxVfzY2FzalX2KmyE4VrsXviU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jXdTbyQcwrkcwD5UuuVd6BRhtRWmqcL6SKJIDchs1liEcUvFbgZQofO5JQfwfIJt5RB83mAimRXAAzLE7eMlUyzYwjHnnbWioqoKlE_qYwY=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/15d510ba-40b7-4a5f-b2a3-e9d589669c87"], "published": "2018-05-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:16:10.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
