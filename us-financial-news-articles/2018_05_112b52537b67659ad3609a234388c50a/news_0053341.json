China’s Commerce Ministry said a global economic downturn was the root cause of difficulties for the steel industry.\n“Recklessly adopting trade restrictions will not help to solve the problem,” said Wang Hejun, the head of the ministry’s trade remedy and investigation bureau, adding they would also harm EU steel users.\nThe Journal said the complaint was lodged on behalf of three manufacturers making all of the product in the EU, later listing them as ArcelorMittal subsidiaries in Luxembourg and Poland and Vitkovice Steel of the Czech Republic.\nThe complaint says exports from China have increased significantly at prices that are artificially low.\nCorrugated sheet piling is a steel segment used in construction, which represents 35 percent of total steel consumption. It is principally used for building foundations or retaining walls.\nReporting by Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels, Tom Daly in Beijing; Editing by Alastair Macdonald and Gareth Jones/Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-24T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:33:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
