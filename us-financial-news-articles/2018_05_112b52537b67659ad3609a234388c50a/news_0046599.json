Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love knows what I mean,” he said at the start of an address that jolted the congregation after a long period of serene choral music and formal ceremony.\nBy the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as “my brother, my sister,” and telling them “God love you, God bless you” before the opening notes of the soul standard “Stand By Me” started up.\nMeghan smiled throughout as Harry looked on intently.\nMembers of the royal family, including Harry’s brother Prince William and cousin Princess Beatrice, could be seen on TV smiling during the lengthy address.\nThe reaction online was overwhelmingly positive.\n“Quoting Dr. Martin Luther King from the altar of a British royal wedding. This sermon by Rev Michael Bruce Curry is very American, very boisterous, very passionate. Love it,” said New York Times reporter Katie Rosman on Twitter.\nKaren Attiah, Global Opinions Editor of the Washington Post, called the whole wedding “an overt celebration of black American culture”.\n“I wrote back in the fall that I didn’t think Meghan (Markle) was going to be very outspoken about race once she married into the royal family. Maybe she will prove me wrong?,” Attiah tweeted.\n“DISCOVER LOVE” Barely glancing at the transcript of his speech on a tablet computer in front of him, Curry talked directly to a congregation that included Queen Elizabeth and celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Elton John and David Beckham.\nHe told them that love was not just for married couples but part of God’s plan with the power to change lives.\n“Dr King was right. We must discover love, the redemptive power of love, and when we do that, we will make of this old world a new world,” Curry said in hushed tones, grasping the lectern.\n“Imagine our neighborhoods and communities when love is the way. Imagine our governments and countries when love is the way,” he said in a rare nod to politics in a highly orchestrated British state occasion.\nThe Episcopal Church - the U.S. arm of the Anglican Communion which also includes the Church of England, headed by the Queen – has taken a strongly liberal stand on social issues, including gay marriage which it allows.\nCurry was born in Chicago in 1953 and went on to become the bishop of North Carolina. At his installation at the head if the Episcopal church in 2015, he called for economic and racial unity at a time of rising racial tensions.\nIn 2016 he said he lamented the decision by the wider Anglican Communion to slap sanctions on the U.S. church over its support of gay marriage.
