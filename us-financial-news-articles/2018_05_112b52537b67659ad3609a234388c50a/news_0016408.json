As part of this focus, we are preparing a strategic and thorough presentation of our key data for an upcoming FDA Advisory Committee Meeting for REMOXY ER, scheduled for June 26 th in Washington, DC. We also continue to maintain tight fiscal discipline, and to advance our early-stage programs with non-dilutive funding.”\nFinancial Highlights for First Quarter 2018\nNet loss for the quarter was $2.2 million, or a net loss per share of $0.33. This compared to a net loss of $2.7 million, or $0.42 per share, for the same period in the prior year, representing a 19% decrease.\nCash and cash equivalents were $10.7 million. This compared to $10.5 million in the prior quarter, representing a 2% increase. Cash and cash equivalents for the quarter includes $1.9 million of net proceeds raised through issuance of shares of our common stock under a Capital on Demand TM program with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC.\nWe have no debt.\nWe believe existing capital resources are sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nWe received $0.4 million in research grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, recorded as a reduction in research and development expenses (R&D).\nR&D expenses were $1.1 million. This compared to $1.4 million for the same period in the prior year, representing a 23% decrease. R&D expenses included non-cash stock related compensation costs of $0.4 million, versus $0.3 million for the same period in the prior year.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $1.1 million. This compared to $1.4 million for the same period in the prior year, representing a 20% decrease. G&A expenses included non-cash stock-related compensation costs of $0.5 million, versus $0.5 million for the same period in the prior year.\nAbout REMOXY ER (extended-release oxycodone capsules CII)\nREMOXY ER is in registration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a new type of abuse-deterrent, twice-daily, capsule gel formulation of oral oxycodone, a strong opioid drug. REMOXY ER has physical/chemical properties intended to deter abuse and still provide 12 hours of steady pain relief when properly prescribed by physician and used appropriately by patients.\nStudies were extensive. The clinical efficacy of REMOXY ER was established in a Phase III study conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment. In total, over 2,400 subjects were exposed to REMOXY ER in 30 clinical studies. 9,000 unique data points were generated from 11 lab studies. The assessment of REMOXY ER’s abuse deterrence is supported by data from FDA Category 1 (lab), Category 2 (pharmacokinetic) and Category 3 (human abuse potential) studies. In addition, in November 2017 the Company and FDA held a pre-NDA meeting to confirm the sufficiency of data included in the REMOXY ER NDA resubmission.\nREMOXY ER has a thick, sticky, high viscosity, hydrophobic, gel formulation that abusers cannot cut, grate or divide into smaller discrete particle sizes. The gel formulation resists syringe-ability, injection, and rapid extraction in ingestible solvents. REMOXY ER’s high viscosity and adhesive properties also cause it to stick to tools and equipment used for abuse. When exposed to heat, REMOXY ER releases an irritant to the eyes and lungs. REMOXY ER resists dose-dumping when challenged by alcohol and common physical and chemical manipulations.\nWe are requesting marketing approval of REMOXY ER as an analgesic drug with properties that can be expected to deter against injection, snorting and inhalation/smoking routes of abuse.\nREMOXY ER intends to address the public health epidemic related to prescription opioids by advancing the science of abuse deterrence, providing an additional treatment option for physicians and patients, and increasing the range of available abuse deterrent technologies.\nAbout Opioid Abuse\nOpioid drugs such as oxycodone are an important treatment option for patients with severe chronic pain. However, oxycodone abuse and diversion remain serious, persistent problems. Opioid overdose deaths exceeded 64,000 in 2016, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). For over a decade, Pain Therapeutics has pioneered Abuse-Deterrent Formulations (ADFs) to help in the fight against prescription drug abuse. ADFs attempt to raise the bar on prescription drug abuse by making it more difficult, longer or aversive to tamper with long-acting opioid formulations, recognizing that no drug can be made abuse-proof.\nOur Pipeline of Drug Assets also Includes:\nFENROCK ™ (transdermal fentanyl patch system) – This is a proprietary, abuse-deterrent skin patch for severe pain. FENROCK is an early-stage program, substantially funded by a research grant award from National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).\nPTI-125 – This proprietary, small molecule drug candidate is aimed at the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. PTI-125 is a Phase I clinical-stage program, substantially funded by a research grant award from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nPTI-125DX – This is a proprietary blood-based test to detect Alzheimer’s disease. PTI-125DX is an early-stage program, substantially funded by a research grant award from the NIH.\nAbout Pain Therapeutics, Inc.\nWe develop proprietary drugs that offer significant improvements to patients and physicians.
