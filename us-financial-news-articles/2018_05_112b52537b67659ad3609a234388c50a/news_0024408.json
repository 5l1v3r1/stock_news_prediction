But in the same time, it was a completely different matchup today.\n“There was also the fact that I never beat him. It was 0-6 before today. Some things were a little bit shaky. But I was keeping my level up from yesterday, so that was a great thing.”\nHe will play either Alexander Zverev or Canadian Denis Shapovalov in Sunday’s final.
