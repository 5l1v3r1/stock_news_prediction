The combination of these companies will result in a leading energy delivery, infrastructure and services company serving more than 7 million customers across the United States. The combination capitalizes on the growth we have delivered and that we expect to continue well into the future,” said Chapman.\nSummary and highlights of results\nUtility Group earnings were $74.3 million, or $0.89 per share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $65.9 million, or $0.80 per share, in 2017. Results in the quarter reflect increased earnings from the returns on continued investment in the gas infrastructure replacement programs in Indiana and Ohio and the favorable impact of weather in 2018 as compared to the warmer than normal weather in 2017. Excluding the favorable earnings impact from 179D tax deductions at Energy Services of $4.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018, Nonutility Group seasonal losses were ($15.5) million, or ($0.19) per share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to ($10.5) million, or ($0.13) per share, in 2017. Results for Infrastructure Services were negatively impacted by colder, wetter conditions in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to 2017, which saw very favorable construction weather conditions.\n2018 earnings guidance affirmed\nThe company affirms its 2018 consolidated earnings guidance range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share. The 2018 consolidated earnings guidance expectation includes Utility Group earnings within a range of $2.20 to $2.25 per share and the Nonutility Group/Corporate and Other earnings within a range of $0.60 to $0.65 per share. These guidance ranges exclude any impact from Section 179D tax deductions and any costs that will result from the merger of the company and CenterPoint Energy.\nGuidance ranges are based on assumptions, including the assumption of normal weather across all of the areas served by both our utility and nonutility operations, and other information currently available, but changes in these assumptions or other circumstances could materially impact earnings and result in 2018 earnings significantly above or below this guidance. These targeted ranges are subject to such factors discussed below under \"Forward-Looking Statements\".\nUtility Group discussion\nThe Utility Group consists of the company’s regulated utility operations and other operations that provide information technology and other support services to those regulated operations. The company segregates its regulated utility operations between a Gas Utility Services operating segment and an Electric Utility Services operating segment. The Utility Group also earns a return on shared assets, such as customer billing systems and the customer contact center, used by the company’s utility operations.\nGas Utility Services: provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two-thirds of Indiana and about 20 percent of Ohio, primarily in the west-central area\nThe Gas Utility Services operating segment earned $56.0 million, or $0.67 per share, during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $47.9 million, or $0.58 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The improved results in the quarter are driven by returns on the growing Indiana and Ohio infrastructure replacement programs of about $3.0 million. Favorable weather, increased customer margins from industrial usage, and increased small customer count, all totaling about $5.0 million also increased quarter over quarter results.\nElectric Utility Services: provides electric transmission and distribution services to southwestern Indiana and includes its power generating and wholesale power operations\nThe Electric Utility Services operating segment earned $14.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $13.7 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2017. Electric results, which are not protected by weather normalizing mechanisms, reflect a $2.6 million increase due to weather, as annualized heating degree days in the first quarter of 2018 were 99 percent of normal, compared to 85 percent of normal in 2017. The increase was offset by the timing of increased power plant maintenance expenses.\nOther Operations\nThe Utility Group also earns a return on shared assets through currently approved rates as if portions of the assets were in the rate base of each utility. Such shared assets include customer billing systems and the customer contact center, as examples. Earnings from these operations were $4.3 million, or $0.05 per share, for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017.\nNonutility Group discussion\nAll amounts included in this section are after tax and net of corporate expenses allocated to the Nonutility Group.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Nonutility Group results were losses of ($10.6) million, or ($0.13) per share, compared to ($10.5) million, or ($0.13) per share, in 2017. Excluding the benefit from Section 179D tax deductions recorded in the quarter related to 2017, Nonutility Group results in the first quarter of 2018 were losses of ($15.5) million, or ($0.19) per share.\nInfrastructure Services: provides underground pipeline construction and repair services through wholly owned subsidiaries Miller Pipeline, LLC and Minnesota Limited, LLC.\nResults from Infrastructure Services’ operations for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2018, were losses of ($15.8) million, or ($0.19) per share, compared to ($9.3) million, or ($0.11) per share, in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter is typically a loss quarter given weather conditions and weather-related restrictions. Total Infrastructure Services revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were $135.3 million, compared to revenues of $147.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The distribution portion of the business was negatively impacted by cold, wet conditions in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the first quarter of 2017 that saw unusually warm and dry weather. Results in the quarter for the transmission portion of the business reflect normal seasonal losses and were in line with the first quarter of 2017. Infrastructure Services had an estimated backlog of blanket contracts of $505 million and bid contracts of $260 million, for a total backlog of $765 million at Mar. 31, 2018. This compares to an estimated backlog at Dec. 31, 2017 of $480 million for blanket contracts and $245 million for bid contracts, for a total of $725 million.\nThe fundamental business model related to the long cycle of integrity, station, and maintenance work in the transmission sector and infrastructure replacement in the distribution sector remains unchanged. Demand continues to be high due to the aging infrastructure and evolving safety and reliability regulations. While the focus remains on the recurring work in both sectors, opportunities for large transmission pipeline construction projects will continue to be pursued. Though the timing and recurrence of large transmission projects is less predictable, they demonstrate expertise in this area and provide strong revenues.\nEnergy Services: provides energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure, such as renewables, distributed generation, and combined heat and power projects through its wholly owned subsidiary Energy Systems Group, LLC (ESG).\nExcluding the favorable impact of Section 179D tax deductions recorded in the quarter of $4.9 million, or $0.06 per share, Energy Services’ results were $0.6 million, or $0.01 per share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to losses of ($1.2) million, or ($0.01) per share in 2017. Energy Services achieved record first quarter revenues of $60.6 million in 2018, compared to revenues of $52.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. At Mar. 31, 2018, the backlog of signed fixed price contracts is $193 million compared to $180 million at Dec. 31, 2017. The estimated sales funnel at Mar. 31, 2018 stands at $370 million and over $100 million in new orders have been signed year to date 2018. The Company's long-term view of the performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure opportunities remains strong with an expected continued national focus on energy conservation and security, renewable energy, and sustainability and as customer focus on new, efficient, clean sources of energy grows. As it relates to the impact on results from Section 179D, on Feb. 9, 2018, a one year extension of Section 179D was approved, making available deductions for the 2017 tax year. Though not assured and not reflected in long-term growth rates, efforts continue to secure this benefit in the future.\nPlease SEE ATTACHED unaudited schedules for additional financial information\nLive Webcast on May 2, 2018; Financial slides posted on website on May 1, 2018\nVectren’s financial analyst call will be at 2:00 p.m. (EDT), May 2, 2018, at which time management will discuss first quarter 2018 financial results.
