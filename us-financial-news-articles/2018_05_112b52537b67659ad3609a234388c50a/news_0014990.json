The governments in turn have partnered with companies who will play a role in the tests.\nSenator Dean Heller of Nevada , who is up for re-election in November, said in a press release the city of Reno was named one of the winners. The city is partnered with Nevada-based Flirtey, a company that has worked on delivering defibrillators by drone, as well as pizza for Domino's.\nAt least 200 companies spanning 149 applications are vying to be part of the program, a U.S. official said. Many major U.S. companies are part of the winning submissions.\nWinners include projects focused on package delivery, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, pipeline oversight and integrating drones near airports, the U.S. official said.\nCompanies such as Boeing and Ford Motor have also expressed interest in the program, sources said, though it was unclear whether they had joined applications and what they would be testing.\nAmazon declined to comment. Airbus, Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they on one or more applications, with Airbus noting it is interested in topics like risk analysis for airspace management. Qualcomm hopes to test network connectivity along with partners Verizon Communications and AT&T .\nRaytheon said it had not applied but was in talks with partners who have. Other companies did not immediately answer requests for comment.\nChanges to U.S. policy that result from the tests are not expected for some time. Package delivery, which can be particularly complex, might not take place until later on during the program.\nEarl Lawrence, who directs the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 's unmanned aircraft systems integration office, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that many of the other projects \"could go forward under the FAA's existing rules, including with waivers where appropriate.\"\nHe said after \"the 10 selections for the pilot program are announced, the FAA will be reaching out to other applicants, as well as interested state and local authorities, to provide additional information on how to operationalize their proposed projects.\"\nThe FAA is also working on proposed regulations to ensure the safety of drones and their integration into U.S. airspace.\nThe initiative is significant for the United States, which has lagged other countries in drone operations for fear of air crashes. That had pushed companies like Amazon to experiment overseas.\nIn the United Kingdom , the world's largest online retailer already sends some packages by drone. It completed its first such mission in late 2016, taking 13 minutes from click to delivery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T16:14:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
