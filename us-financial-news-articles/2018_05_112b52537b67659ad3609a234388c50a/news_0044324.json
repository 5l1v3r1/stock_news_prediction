The affluent community it located outside Windermere, Florida, near Orlando.\nUneek O'Neal purchased the mansion for $3.95 million in 1993, when it was a 23,000 square-foot Neo-Colonial, according to the Orlando Sentinel . Now, the estate boasts an impressive 31,000 square feet of living space.\nThe property, which is being exclusively marketed by Danial Natoli of Premier Sotheby's International Realty, includes luxurious amenities like a sound-proof home theater, a gallery hall designed for an art collection and a \"gentleman's room\" with game tables and a wet bar.\nUneek The formal dining room seats 16, and there's also a 1,170-square foot, two-story great room with a marble fireplace and glass walls.\nUneek Outside, the mansion features a 95-foot-long, 15-feet-deep pool with a custom rock waterfall, sunken hot tub and tiki-style open cabana overlooking Lake Butler.\nUneek On the main level, there's a guest wing consisting of five en-suite bedrooms, a great room and a bar.
