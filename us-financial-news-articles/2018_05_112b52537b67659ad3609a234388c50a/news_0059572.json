The Indy 500 promised much but ended the same way.\n“Definitely not a great ending,” said Patrick. “Today was a tough day.”\nWhile there was plenty of disappointment in Patrick’s words there was not a hint of regret, having been steadfast in the buildup to Sunday’s race she would not get behind the wheel again and had no interest in being involved as an owner or mentor to young racers.\nInstead, as one of the most marketable athletes in North America Patrick has been able to turn her fame into businesses ranging from wine to a clothing line, opportunities that she said would keep her busy.\n“Whenever you talk about retiring to someone they are like what are you going to do next,” Patrick told Reuters in an interview prior to the race.\n“Most people don’t have anything when they retire and have to figure it out after.\n“I have plenty of things to keep me busy and that’s just what is happening currently and doesn’t include what I want to do.”\nPatrick may not miss racing but the motorsport world would miss her, motor racing great Mario Andretti told Reuters.\n“She’s been an asset for the sport and probably inspired many,” Andretti said. “She’s been a great ambassador for the sport in general.\n“The sport will miss her for sure. I have the highest respect for her ... she didn’t leave anything on the table.\n“It’s a tough world to carve out your niche and she did that.” (Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-28T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T03:22:12.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
