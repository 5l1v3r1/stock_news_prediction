The two countries also signed a number of memoranda of understanding, including on the construction of dams in Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and South Kalimantan province on Borneo.\nChina currently consumes 5 million tonnes of palm oil, said Li, scheduled to fly on Tuesday from Jakarta to Tokyo for a summit with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, exported 3.73 million tonnes of palm oil to China last year, a leading destinations after India and the European Union.\nLi said boosting palm oil imports was aimed at helping smallholder farmers in Indonesia, and said China also planned to increase coffee and tropical fruit imports.\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang talks with Indonesian President Joko Widodo during their meeting at the presidential palace in Bogor, Indonesia, May 7, 2018.

I stressed about exports increasing from Indonesia to China.” said Widodo.\nIndonesia’s palm oil exports have come under pressure in Europe where lawmakers have approved draft measures on power reform that include plans to ban the use of palm oil in biodiesel from 2021, even though the E.U. recently removed anti-dumping duties for imports of biodiesel containing palm oil for some Indonesian producers.\nChina sees Indonesia as a key partner in its Belt and Road initiative that aims to bolster a sprawling network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\nIndonesia said last week it was seeking ways to accelerate a $5 billion high-speed rail project being built by a consortium of local and Chinese state firms, which is facing obstacles from land ownership issues.\nReporting by Agustinus Da Costa and Bernadette Christina Munthe; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Ed Davies and Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T12:10:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
