U.S. stocks took a beating, with the S&P 500 posting its first 1 percent drop in May, while the U.S. Treasury market had its best day since at least July 2011.\n“The market is reversing what appears to be a knee-jerk reaction from yesterday,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “As people take a step back, it appears that the sell-off was overdone.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 302.45 points, or 1.24 percent, to 24,663.9, the S&P 500 gained 34.81 points, or 1.29 percent, to 2,724.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 69.01 points, or 0.93 percent, to 7,465.61.\nThe Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks hit an all-time high during Wednesday’s session, buoyed by data confirming the strength of the U.S. economy. Small-cap U.S. companies generally have less international exposure than their large-cap counterparts.\nPayroll processor ADP’s monthly report showed U.S. private sector payrolls increased by 178,000 jobs in May. The Commerce Department revised its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product growth slightly downward, but economists estimate that U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter would rise above 3 percent annually.\nThe S&P energy index jumped 3.2 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day gain in seven weeks.\nEnergy shares, which provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500, benefited from a 2.2-percent surge in U.S. crude oil prices.\nCloud-based business software maker Salesforce.com rose 2.1 percent and computer and printer maker HP Inc jumped 4.2 percent after both companies raised their full-year profit forecasts.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.48-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.78-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 193 new highs and 28 new lows.
