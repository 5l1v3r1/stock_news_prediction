Profit margins for contract catering in France were impacted by a tough competitive environment combined with a period of managerial instability. This latter period is now behind us, a diagnostic analysis has been carried out and action plans launched accordingly. The large number of new contracts that started up, both in concession catering and contract catering, also had a temporary dilutive impact on our margins. And lastly, the poor weather conditions in France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as transport strikes in France, weighed on our revenue and profitability. All of these factors have led us to revise our guidance for the full year. The new Executive Committee set up in March is fully and committedly engaged at my side to oversee the short-term action plans already undertaken and draw up an ambitious and credible business plan for the medium and long term. We will present this plan on June 26\".\nThe Group's financial performance estimates for first-half 2017-2018 show:\ntotal growth of 3.9%, of which 2.9% organic growth; adjusted EBITDA of €231 million, representing 6.9% of revenue; €150 million in CAPEX; a leverage ratio of around 3.48x.\nA detailed analysis of the results for first-half 2017-2018 will be published on May 29, 2018 and will be commented on during a conference call.\nFor full-year 2017-2018, the Group's guidance is now:\norganic growth of close to 3% (compared with the previous guidance of organic growth of at least 3%); an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 7.5% and 7.8% (versus a stable adjusted EBITDA margin based on a constant scope of consolidation and constant exchange rates); a decrease in adjusted earnings per share (compared with a slight increase in adjusted earnings per share); CAPEX kept within a budget of €300 million.\nA conference call will take place today at 8.30 a.m. (CEST).
