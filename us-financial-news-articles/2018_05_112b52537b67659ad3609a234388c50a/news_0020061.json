(NYSE American: HLTH) (NEO: HLTH) (\"Nobilis\" or the \"Company\") today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nFirst quarter Total Revenues were $64.5 million, a 5.6% decrease over the prior year period of $68.3 million; Ness Loss for the first quarter was $3.9 million, compared to a loss of $2.4 million in the prior corresponding period First quarter Adjusted EBITDA 1 increased to $5.1 million, a 152.7% increase compared to the prior year period of $2.0 million Gross Margin in the first quarter increased by 2.8% to $4.3 million Total case volumes in the first quarter increased by 19.0% to 5,275 cases Total Operations Expense per case in the first quarter decreased by 21.2%\n\"Despite a reduction in top line revenues, we continued to see significant improvements in our margins and key efficiency metrics. Gross Margin edged up by nearly 60 basis points, Loss from Operations improved by 12.3%, and Total Operating Expense per case declined by 21.2%, year-over-year,\" said Harry Fleming, CEO.\n\"Total case volume for the first quarter was impacted by lower than anticipated case volumes from our physician partners offset by gains from higher than budgeted case volumes driven by our marketing efforts. The first quarter also marked the first full quarter of operations for our in-network Elite entities, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017. Integration is nearing completion, and physician activity has remained strong from Q4 into Q1, which we attribute to mutually collaborative attitudes, a strong physician syndication, and the success of our marketing platform among our new physicians. Following full integration of Elite into the Nobilis system, we will begin looking for similar, in-network acquisition opportunities like Elite that can benefit from Nobilis' marketing operations.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $64.5 million, a 5.6% decrease from $68.3 million in the prior year period. Total case volume increased by 844 cases to 5,275 cases, or 19.0%, compared to 4,431 cases in the prior corresponding period. The decrease in total revenue was primarily due to the loss of two key physician groups as well as the discontinuation of the Company's Lab Testing ancillary service-line. Lab Testing represented approximately $5.5 million dollars of revenue in Q1 of 2017 which did not re-occur in Q1 of 2018.\nRevenue per case dipped to $12,219 in the first quarter due to the discontinuation of the Company's Lab Testing ancillary, as well as a higher proportion of Nobilis' case mix being derived from in-network sources, the growth of which has been a longstanding goal of management.\nNet loss attributable to Nobilis for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.9 million, or $0.05 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.03 per fully diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the first quarter of 2018, which adds back certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, was $5.1 million, an increase of 152.7% over $2.0 million in the same quarter last year.\nTotal cash was $23.2 million and accounts receivable was $133.4 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $22.5 million and $144.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nRevenue in the range of $345.0 million to $355.0 million Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $57.0 million to $62.0 million\nConference Call Information\nNobilis Health will host a conference call on May 8th, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. CDT (9:00 a.m. EDT) to discuss its financial results for the first quarter 2018.

depreciation and amortization, non-cash compensation expenses, change in fair value of warrant and stock option derivative liabilities, acquisition expenses, and non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is an analytical indicator used by management and the health care industry to evaluate company performance, allocate resources and measure leverage and debt service capacity. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nContact Information:\nJoel Lehr\nAssistant Vice President, Corporate Communications\nIR@nobilishealth.com\n346-207-6342\n with multimedia: releases/nobilis-health-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300644369.html\nSOURCE Nobilis Health Corp.", "external_links": ["http://investors.nobilishealth.com/investors/events-and-presentations/", "http://www.nobilishealth.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nobilis-health-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300644369.html"], "published": "2018-05-08T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T16:58:17.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
