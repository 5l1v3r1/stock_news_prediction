Board member John McKinley received the second most votes against re-election, with about 64.6% voting in favor of his re-election. A third director, Mark Templeton, received 68.2% of the vote in favor of re-election.\nThe three board members were on the technology committee during the time of breach and were criticized in the run-up to the election for the breach. CtW Investment Group, an adviser to union pension funds that are invested in Equifax EFX, -0.19% , in a letter to the company’s shareholders in April advised against the re-election of the three board members, who CtW said failed to act on repeated warnings of cybersecurity issues at Equifax before its breach.", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/equifax-board-members-re-elected-despite-massive-data-breach-2018-05-03"], "published": "2018-05-04T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T01:45:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
