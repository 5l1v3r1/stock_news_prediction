Chinese authorities often also order the removal of certain posts deemed unsuitable, as part of their routine censorship efforts.\nBut Jiang Shengjie, from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's cybersecurity unit, said the gang's approach was new.\n\"In the past, such cases merely involved companies paying directly to remove the articles. We have never encountered such cases where people have posed as media enterprises or government authorities to order the removal of articles,\" Jiang said.\nWei Wuhui, an assistant professor from Shanghai Jiao Tong University's media school, said the gang flourished because Chinese news portals were used to government intervention in their content.\nSome local governments also tried to limit negative reports on key firms, Wei said.\n\"The companies are key taxpayers in the region and the authorities are keen to protect them,\" he said. \"So it sometimes leaves ordinary citizens confused about whether a government body's order to remove articles is truly a genuine request or not.\"\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/diplomacy/article/2147676/donald-trump-cancels-summit-kim-jong-un-citing-tremendous-anger", "https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternational", "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2146426/chinese-man-held-over-online-dating-scam-using-voice-manipulation", "https://twitter.com/cnbci", "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2141050/chinese-market-targeted-scammers-who-set-fake-qr-codes-divert"], "published": "2018-05-25T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:32:21.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
