It doesn't make money. That's a pretty shocking statement at this point 10 years after the crisis,\" he said in a \" Squawk Box \" interview. \"It's a bit late in the game to try to solve the problem. â€¦ I think Deutsche has to shrink. I think Deutsche five years from now will be a significantly smaller company.\"\nRegarding cryptocurrencies, he said current government-backed currency markets already serve the public efficiently.\n\"I have my doubts about it. My doubts center around the fact what's the social utility of cryptocurrency?\" he said. \"It's good for speculation and good for money laundering. ... I have no idea how to value [bitcoin] and I don't think anyone else does either.\"\nEisman is known for being one of the few investors to profitably bet against subprime mortgage securities during the financial crisis. He was a key character in Michael Lewis' best-selling book \"The Big Short\" and was depicted by actor Steve Carell in the movie based on the book.\nDeutsche Bank declined to comment for this story.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:33:44.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
