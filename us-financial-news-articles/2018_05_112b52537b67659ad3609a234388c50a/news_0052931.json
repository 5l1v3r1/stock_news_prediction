NO SILVER BULLET\nThe revised bill was proposed by Widodo’s government in early 2016, after a gun and suicide-bomb attack in Jakarta, which at the time was the first Islamic State-linked attack in Southeast Asia.\nBut the proposed changes languished in parliament amid concern over infringement of rights and after some parties objected to clauses that could mean greater military involvement in internal security.\nThe new bill states that overcoming terrorism is part of the military’s operations outside of war, but it can only get involved upon a request from the police and with presidential approval.\nSeparately, Widodo’s government has proposed setting up a special military task force to boost the efforts of the elite counter-terrorism police squad, Detachment, or “Densus”, 88.\nThere have long been concerns that rivalry between the police and the military could complicate the fight against militants.\n“They will only be allowed to get involved in the operational phase, where the police feel they need more resources,” Atmadji Sumarkidjo, a senior government official, said of the military.\nThe bombings in Surabaya, in which two families, including children as young as eight, carried out suicide attacks on churches and a police station, added a sense of urgency to the legislation.\nAndreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch welcomed the central role of the national anti-terrorism agency in the new bill, though said more needed to be done to monitor radicalised people returning from the Middle East.\n“The law itself isn’t a silver bullet. It’s time for a sober assessment of why most deradicalisation programs have not worked,” he said.\nThe legislation will still also not be as tough as some other countries in the region.\nMalaysia in 2015 reintroduced a law under which suspects can be detained without trial for up to two years with two-year extensions thereafter.
