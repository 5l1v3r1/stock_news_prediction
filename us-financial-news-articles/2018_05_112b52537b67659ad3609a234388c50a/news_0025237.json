(“SourceHOV”) and Novitex Holdings, Inc. (“Novitex”), which closed on July 12, 2017. The primary pro forma adjustment is to include the results of Novitex for the period January 1, 2017 to July 12, 2017. For more information, please refer to the reconciliation of reported to pro forma financial results contained in the Schedules of this release.\nFirst Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Financial Highlights\n(Note: all Q1 2017 numbers, unless otherwise stated, are presented on a pro forma basis.)\nRevenue: Revenue of $393.1 million, an increase of 8.7% from $361.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, and an increase of 1.8% from $386.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Please refer to the pro forma revenue reconciliation contained in this press release for the first quarter of 2017. ITPS revenue was $311.9 million, an increase of 11.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased volumes and expansion of services within existing customers. HS revenue was in-line with expectations at $58.6 million, a slight decrease of 0.8%. LLPS revenue was in-line with expectations at $22.6 million, a decline of 3.4%.\n6 customers over $25 million in annual revenue and approximately 200 customers with more than $1 million annual revenue.\nRevenue per full-time employee increased sequentially to $69 thousand from $66 thousand.\nTotal contract value won as of March 31, 2018, on a trailing-twelve-month basis, totaled $1.525 billion\nRenewal rate on strategic accounts greater than 95%.\nNet Loss for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $24.0 million, an improvement when compared to a pro forma net loss of $25.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA was $69.6 million, an increase of 10.9% when compared to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of $62.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by revenue growth and the impact of the Company’s cost savings initiatives, partially offset by ramp-up costs associated with new ITPS client contracts, investments in the Company’s revenue growth initiatives, and higher public company costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin: Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.7%, representing an improvement of 40 basis points when compared to an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.3% in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by revenue growth and the impact of the Company’s cost savings initiatives, partially offset by ramp-up costs associated with new ITPS client contracts, investments in the Company’s revenue growth initiatives, and higher public company costs.\nCapital Expenditures: 2.2% of Q1 2018 revenue compared to 3.1% in Q1 2017.\nShare buyback: As of the date of this release, total shares repurchased under the Company’s share buyback program totaled 186,205. Company anticipates continuing to be opportunistic in purchasing of shares under the current buyback program; particularly given the Company’s view that shares are undervalued at current levels.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity: At March 31, 2018, Exela’s total liquidity was $117 million, measured as $26.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $10.4 million of restricted cash with no legal restriction, and $79.4 million of available revolving credit facility ($100 million of revolving credit facility less $20.6 million of letters of credit). Total net debt was $1.368 billion (measured as total consolidated debt of $1.406 billion less cash balances not legally restricted of $37.3 million). During the first quarter, the Company made a cumulative $26.5 million investment in initiatives intended to drive growth including: business optimization expenses and working capital growth. Investments in the aforementioned growth initiatives resulted in a sequential decline in liquidity.\nOutlook\n2018\nCompany increases 2018 guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Revenue range increased to $1.55 billion to $1.58 billion from $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion previously. Increased range drives pro forma growth of 6.5% to 8.5%, up from pro forma growth of 4% to 6% previously. Adjusted EBITDA range increased to $295 million to $310 million from $290 million to $310 million previously. Increased range drives pro forma year-over-year growth of 20% to 26%; and expansion of adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 220 basis points to 320 basis points. Further Adjusted EBITDA guidance – in the range of $330 million to $355 million or a margin of 21% to 22%. Guidance includes delivering $40 million to $45 million in savings during 2018 with remaining to be achieved beyond 2018.\nLong-term\nRevenue growth in the range of 3% to 4% Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance in the range of 22% to 23% Adjusted Free Cash Flow conversion in the range of 87% to 89%\nGuidance is based on constant-currency.\nNote on Outlook: The company has not forecasted net income/(loss) on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income/(loss) including income tax expense, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict net income/(loss) as the difference between the two measures is variable.\nThe above outlook is based on first quarter 2018 results. Reconciliations are available in the attached tables.\nEarnings Conference Call and Audio Webcast\nExela will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results today at 5:00 p.m. EDT.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP measures allow investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. Our board of directors and management use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, and Further Adjusted Free Cash Flow to assess our financial performance, because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of debt and interest expense, as well as transaction costs resulting from the business combination and other such capital markets based activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA also seek to remove the effects of integration and related costs to achieve the savings, any expected reduction in operating expenses due to the business combination, asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and other similar non-routine items outside the control of our management team. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to liquidity or financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures and therefore the basis of presentation for these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Net loss is the GAAP measure most directly comparable our non-GAAP measures. For reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measures to these non-GAAP financial measures, see the schedules to this release. Optimization & restructuring expenses and merger adjustments are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives related to the business combination completed on July 12, 2017. All of these costs are variable and dependent upon the nature of the actions being implemented and can vary significantly driven by business needs. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we exclude these charges since we do not believe they truly reflect our past, current or future operating performance.\nForward-Looking Statements: Certain statements included in this press release are not historical facts but are for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
