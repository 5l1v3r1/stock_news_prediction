I mean, there were very few people who knew the people that were being placed in a lot of jobs.”\nJimenez said he also made a mistake in not seeking to end payments to Michael Cohen immediately after Novartis quickly determined that he would be of little help. Cohen was eventually paid $1.2 million for the one-year deal that prompted the drugmaker’s top lawyer to resign.
