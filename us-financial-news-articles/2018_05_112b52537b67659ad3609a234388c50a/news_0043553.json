REUTERS/Stringer China’s population is aging rapidly, with the number of births falling by 3.5 percent to 17.23 million last year despite the country’s decision in late 2015 to relax the controversial “one-child” policy and allow couples to have a second child.\nThe State Council, or cabinet, has commissioned research on ending the country’s birth limits on a nationwide basis, the Bloomberg report said.\nA decision could be made in the last quarter of this year or in 2019, the report said.\nChina implemented its one-child policy in the 1970s to limit population growth, but authorities are concerned that a dwindling workforce will not be able to support an increasingly aging population.\nThe one-child policy also contributed to a sharp gender imbalance, with 32.66 million more males than females at the end of 2017.\nReporting by Meg Shen; Editing by Tony Munroe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T16:42:29.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
