Of the 11 major S&P sectors, only utilities and real estate, sectors seen as bond proxies due to their high dividend yields, were higher.\nLeading the decliners was the financial sector, down 0.9 percent. Industrials, which as a group are the most sensitive to trade issues, fell 0.5 percent.\nRetailers had a mixed day.\nTarget sank 5.1 percent after the retailer’s quarterly profit rose less than expected as increasing investments dented margins.\nTiffany surged 16.2 percent after the jeweler’s quarterly results blew past estimates and the company also raised its full-year profit forecast and announced a $1 billion share buyback program.\nLowe’s gained 9.1 percent after the home improvement retailer maintained its annual financial targets despite a disappointing first quarter.\nComcast fell 1.7 percent after the U.S. cable operator said it was preparing to top Disney’s offer for certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets.\nDisney dropped 1.2 percent, while Fox gained 1.1 percent.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.52-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 2 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 30 new highs and 17 new lows.
