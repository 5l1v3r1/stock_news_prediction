(“Holdings”), the parent of DynCorp International Inc. (“DI,” and together with Holdings, the “Company”), a leading global services provider, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenue was $534.3 million, up 16.2% compared to $459.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program IV (\"LOGCAP IV\"), Afghanistan Life Support Services (\"ALiSS\") and T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply Bridge (\"T-6 COMBS\") programs and the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support, CLS Transport and Naval Test Wing Pacific O-Level Maintenance (\"Naval Test Wing Pacific\") contracts. The increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volume on the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation (\"INL Air Wing\") program. Net income attributable to Holdings for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.4 million compared to a net loss of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $47.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $36.5 million for the same period in 2017.\n“New business wins, continued growth on our existing contracts and exceptional operational performance drove increases in top line, earnings, and Adjusted EBITDA margins,” said George Krivo, Chief Executive Officer. “We are beginning 2018 with a very strong quarter and are confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nIn February 2018, DynLogistics announced the award of a contract extension from the United States Army Contracting Command to provide advisory, training and mentoring services to the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense. The extension has a one-year base period and two two-month options and a total potential value of $54.2 million. In February 2018, DynLogistics announced the award of a contract extension from the United States Army Contracting Command to provide advisory, training and mentoring services to the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior. The extension has a one-year base period and two two-month options and a total potential value of $67.2 million. In March 2018, DynLogistics announced two awards on the ALiSS contract for the Camp Eggers Support Services and Food Services task orders. The task orders have a total potential value of $89.9 million. In March 2018, DynAviation announced the award of the Contract Field Teams (\"CFT\") task order re-compete at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona to provide maintenance on the 357th Aircraft Maintenance Unit's A-10 Thunderbolt aircraft. The re-compete has a one-year base period and one one-year option and a total potential value of $46.2 million. In March 2018, DynLogistics announced the award of a contract modification to support the U.S. Army Garrison-Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA) on the U.S. Army Pacific Command (“PACOM”) task order under the LOGCAP IV contract. The modification has a period of performance from March 1, 2018 to September 12, 2018 and a total potential value of $45.6 million. In March 2018 and April 2018, DynLogistics announced a contract extension and expansion, respectively, to support material management and logistics services for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (\"USACE\") South Atlantic Division, Task Force Power Restoration in Puerto Rico on the Northcom task order under the LOGCAP IV contract. The extension and expansion has a total potential value of $24.9 million.\nReportable Segment Results\nDynAviation\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $317.2 million, up 10.2% compared with $287.9 million recorded in the same period in 2017 primarily due to the new CLS Transport and Naval Test Wing Pacific contracts and the T-6 COMBS contract. The increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased content on the INL Air Wing contract and the completion of the Multi Sensor Aerial Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (\"MAISR\") Operations and Sustainment program.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $27.0 million, compared to $21.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily due to more favorable terms on the T-6 COMBS contract, the performance on our Naval Test Wing Atlantic contract and productivity gains on a number of programs.\nDynLogistics\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $217.5 million, up 26.2% compared with $172.4 million recorded in the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased scope on both the LOGCAP IV program and ALiSS contract and the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract, partially offset by the completion of the Philippines Operations Support (\"POS\") contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $22.5 million, compared to $17.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher volume on our LOGCAP IV program and ALiSS contract and the performance on the G4 Worldwide Logistics Support contract.\nLiquidity\nCash provided by operating activities at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $8.0 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $15.0 million for the same period in 2017.\nThe unrestricted cash balance at quarter-end was $117.5 million. The Company reduced its debt through a $54.9 million Excess Cash Flow payment on March 21, 2018 and had no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility.\nDSO was 49 and 54 days as of the end of the first quarter of 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as the Company continued to focus on managing its customer payment cycles.\nBill Kansky, Chief Financial Officer, added, “Our strong first quarter performance, along with better visibility for the balance of the year, gives us increased confidence and allows us to raise our full year Adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $166 million to $170 million for 2018.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 14, 2018, to discuss results for the first quarter 2018.

For more information, visit www.dyn-intl.com .\nReconciliation to GAAP\nIn addition to the Company's financial results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) included in this press release, the Company has provided certain financial measures that are not calculated according to GAAP, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to the Company adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA for certain items from operations and certain other items as defined in our Indenture and New Senior Credit Facility. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating operating performance and are regularly used by security analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties in reviewing the Company. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in assessing our ability to generate cash to cover our debt obligations including interest and principal payments. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of the performance of other companies.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures please see the financial schedules accompanying this release.\nThe Company does not provide reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to Operating Income, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include other (loss) income and certain income/expense or gain/loss adjustments under the Company’s debt agreements that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis announcement may contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
