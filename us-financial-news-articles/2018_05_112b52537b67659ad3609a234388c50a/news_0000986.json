Efforts to reach Jackson were unsuccessful.\nHart, the star of “Jumanji” and “Ride Along,” was dogged by media reports last year that he had cheated on his wife and previous partners.\nIn September, the comedian released a video on his Instagram account saying he had made a “bad error in judgment” and would not “allow a person to have financial gain off of my mistakes.”\nIf convicted on both charges, Jackson faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nJackson, who is credited for parts in Hart’s “Think Like a Man Too” and stand-up special “Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain,” has been a member of the Professional Bowlers Association for 12 years, according to its website.
