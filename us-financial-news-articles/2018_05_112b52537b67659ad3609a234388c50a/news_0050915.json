Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman is seen ahead of a special cabinet meeting marking Jerusalem Day, at the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem May 13, 2018. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/Pool\nAvigdor Lieberman, writing on Twitter, said a regional planning board would be asked to designate 1,400 of the housing units for immediate construction.\nSettlements are one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, frozen since 2014.\nPalestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider settlements that Israel has built in territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war to be illegal.\nIsrael disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in peace talks with the Palestinians.\n“We will promote building in all of Judea and Samaria, from the north to south, in small communities and in large ones,” Lieberman wrote, using the Biblical names for the West Bank.\nThere was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials, who have long argued that Israeli settlements could deny them a viable and contiguous country.\nSome 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.
