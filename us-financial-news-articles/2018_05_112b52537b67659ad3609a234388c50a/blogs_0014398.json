That performance ranks No. 2 in the entire S&P 500. The shares are down 11 percent from its high on March 13.\nThe stock is up 2.7 percent Thursday.\nCurtis also bumped his price target on the stock to $280, implying 23 percent upside over the next 12 months. The stock opened slightly higher on Thursday.\nWhile the need for chips will likely scale over several years as more firms integrate AI platforms, the analyst noted that the company is likely seeing growth in its gaming segments thanks to new massive multiplayer online games in 2018 including Fortnite.\nNvidia is expected to launch new Volta chip-based graphics cards — considered the company's next big step in the video games space — later this year, a release many on Wall Street think could carry profits higher.\n\"As opposed to last year's lack of gaming launches, 2018 has already brought on titles like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite, which are driving a revitalized cycle in gaming communities,\" Curtis said. \"Nvidia is also gaining share, which should be bolstered by the launch of Volta later this year and should have plenty of runway.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T15:24:03.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
