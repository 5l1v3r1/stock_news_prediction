REUTERS/Paul Hanna/File Photo\nThe Juve captain was enraged by Oliver’s decision to award Real a decisive stoppage-time penalty during the second-leg tie at the Bernabeu and lost control, screaming at and jostling the English referee until he was shown a red card.\nForward Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up to convert the penalty and send Real through to the semi-finals 4-3 on aggregate.\nBuffon, 40, criticised Oliver after the match, saying the referee had been out of his depth, should have been in the stands eating crisps and must have had a garbage bin for a heart.\nUEFA said in a statement on its website that Buffon had been charged both for receiving a direct red card and with violating the governing body’s “general principles of conduct”.\nThe case will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on May 31.
