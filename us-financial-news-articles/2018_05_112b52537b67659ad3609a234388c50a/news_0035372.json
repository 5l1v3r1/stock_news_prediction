(Nasdaq:SGRP), a leading supplier of retail merchandising, business technology and other marketing services in 10 countries throughout North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa, today announced financial results for the\nHighlights for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period in the prior year include:\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased $14.7 million, or 36.8 percent, to $54.6 million. International operations contributed $7.7 million of the increase. Domestic operations contributed $7 million of the year-over-year revenue growth.\nOperating income for the first quarter increased $245,000, or 50.5%, to $730,000, compared to $485,000 for the same period last year. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by the growth in our international operations, partially offset by a decline in our operating profit in our domestic operations.\nNet income attributable to SPAR Group for the first quarter of 2018 was $124,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($244,000), or ($0.01) per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Results by Geography (in 000's) Three Months Ended March 31, % Revenue: 2018 2017 Change International $ 36,210 $ 28,565 26.8% Domestic 18,369 11,321 62.3% Total $ 54,579 $ 39,886 36.8 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, % Operating Income: 2018 2017 Change International $ 1,050 $ 421 149.0% Domestic (320 ) 64 (n/a) Total $ 730 $ 485 50.5 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, Net Income (loss): 2018 2017 International $ 387 $ 18 Domestic (263 ) (262 ) Total $ 124 $ (244 ) Earnings Per Basic and Diluted share: $ 0.01 $ (0.01 ) “As expected, we saw solid double-digit top-line growth both domestically and internationally during the first quarter. Positive comparisons in our domestic business were driven by the acquisition of Resource Plus early this quarter, which added incremental revenue and created opportunities for cross selling services. In addition, domestic revenue growth benefited from two new retail customer relationships and from projects expected to close during the second quarter that were accelerated into the first quarter, which will put some near-term pressure on revenue comparisons. With more than a year passing since we made our last major international acquisition, the 27% growth in international revenue reflects strong organic growth of our combined international business. International revenue was particularly strong in Brazil, South Africa and Mexico.” said Chief Executive Officer, Christiaan Olivier. “Overall, while profitability is improving, we still have room to make improvements. Our domestic profitability will face near-term pressure due to incremental investments in business development and technology and continued pricing pressure in all channels. However, we are implementing a comprehensive strategic plan this year to create sustainable improvements in profitability and returns. One of the first areas of change is to our domestic field services. We are currently evaluating new vendors that we expect can provide beneficial terms to improve efficiency of our operations while maintaining or improving the customer experience. We expect this initiative and others to drive meaningful improvements in our financial results this year and for several years to come.”\nMargin Profile by Geography Gross Margin: Three Months Ended March 31, Basis Point 2018 2017 Change International 15.0% 17.1% (207) Domestic 23.3% 27.9% (459) Total 17.8 % 20.2 % (235)\nOperating Income as a % of Sales: Three Months Ended March 31,\nBasis Point 2018 2017 Change International 2.9% 1.5% 143 Domestic (1.7)% 0.6% (230) Total 1.3 % 1.2 % 12 With the exception of Canada and Australia, which generated positive gross profit margin improvement, all other international subsidiaries experienced gross margin pressure in the first three months of 2018 compared to the same period last year.\nThe decrease in domestic gross profit margin was due to the mix of business from our Resource Plus acquisition in this quarter and an increase in lower margin project work compared to the same periods last year.\nBalance Sheet as of March 31, 2018\nAt March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $8.9 million. Working capital was $22.9 million and current ratio was 1.7 to 1. Total current assets and total assets were $54.6 million and $69.3 million, respectively.
