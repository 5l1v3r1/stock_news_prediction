It comes after more than a dozen fissures recently opened miles to the east of the crater and spewed lava into neighborhoods.\nThose areas were evacuated as lava destroyed at least 26 homes and 10 other structures.\nThe crater sits within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which has been closed since May 11.\nOfficials have said they didn't expect the explosion to be deadly as long as people remained out of park.\nKilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. An eruption in 1924 killed one person and sent rocks, ash and dust into the air for 17 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T20:14:26.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
