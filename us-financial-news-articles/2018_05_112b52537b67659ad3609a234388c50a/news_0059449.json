We’ve waited so long, we decided to make a move now to get the ball rolling,” said Duenbostel.\nKWS let itself “be guided” by a multiple of close to 17 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the proposed price, which Duenbostel said was what Bayer agreed to pay for all of Monsanto. He declined to give more detailed terms.\nSales of more than 400 million euros at the vegetable unit and an EBITDA margin of about 20 percent would translate to a bid value of roughly 1.4 billion euros.\nBASF last month agreed to pay up to 1.7 billion euros for a bundle of assets comprising Bayer’s vegetable seeds business, seed treatments and digital farming activities.\nThat would come on top of 5.9 billion euros worth of Bayer assets including soy, cotton and canola seed and herbicide businesses that BASF agreed to buy in October.\nWhile BASF has already secured EU antitrust approval for the October transaction, the go-ahead for BASF to also snap up the vegetable business is still outstanding, a Bayer spokesman said. He declined to comment further.\nBASF said it had an agreed deal with Bayer and declined to comment on KWS’s move.\nShares in KWS Saat fell 4.3 percent at 0844 GMT on concern the deal would be too big a financial burden for a buyer with a market value of about 2 billion euros. “Isn’t it a little too big for KWS?” a Frankfurt-based trader said.\nBayer’s bid to buy seed and chemical company Monsanto is on track to win U.S. antitrust approval by the end of May, unless there is a last-minute complication, two people familiar with the matter said in late April.
