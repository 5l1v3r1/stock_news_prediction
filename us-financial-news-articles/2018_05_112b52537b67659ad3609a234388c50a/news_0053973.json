You heard Mr Pompeo just as I did. Do you really think he’s going to hand out waivers,” Patrick Pouyanne told reporters in the Russian city of St Petersburg, referring to the threat by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to impose the “the strongest sanctions in history” against Iran.\nTotal said on May 16 that it would pull out of the multi-billion dollar South Pars project if it did not receive a waiver.. Total said any waiver would need to include protection from secondary sanctions that Washington might impose on companies that continue to do business with Iran.
