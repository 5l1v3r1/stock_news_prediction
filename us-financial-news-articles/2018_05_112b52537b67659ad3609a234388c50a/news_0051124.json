It said Kayali, who also goes by the name of Abu Osama, had been arrested and then released in France in 2010 on suspicion of belonging to terrorist organisations.\nFrench media have reported the captured man’s name as French citizen Adrien Guihal, wanted in connection with terrorist activities in France.\nSDF media spokesman Mustafa Bali told Reuters Adrien Lionel Kayali and Adrien Guihal were two names for the same man.\nFrench judicial sources told Reuters on Thursday there is an arrest warrant for an Adrien Guihal from 2015, and that he is suspected of having claimed responsibility for attacks in Nice and Magnanville, near Paris, in France in 2016.\nThe SDF, a alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters led by the Kurdish YPG militia, said it believed Kayali had entered Syria in March 2015 into Islamic State-held territory. The SDF said it captured him in the Raqqa region of northern Syria.\nThe U.S.-backed SDF control much of the territory east of the Euphrates in Syria’s Deir al-Zor province and drove Islamic State militants from their former de facto capital Raqqa in late 2017.
