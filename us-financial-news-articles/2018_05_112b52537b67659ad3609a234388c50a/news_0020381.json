The subscription rights will be exercisable for up to an aggregate of 9 million Units (approximately $20.25 million), with aggregate participation to be allocated among holders on a pro rata basis if in excess of that threshold.\nEach Unit will be comprised of one share of Common Stock and one publicly traded Series Z Warrant (PAVMZ) (the “Z Warrant”).\nEach Z Warrant will entitle its holder to purchase one share of Common Stock for $3.00 per share until April 30, 2024.\nThe Rights will be exercisable at a price of $2.25 per Unit (proposed ticker PAVMU). The Company expects the Units will trade promptly upon issuance and for up to 90 days, at which point they will mandatorily split and their underlying shares of Common Stock and Z Warrants will then trade separately. Holders who fully exercise their basic subscription right will be entitled, if available, to subscribe for an additional amount of Units that are not purchased by other holders, on a pro rata basis and subject to the 9 million unit aggregate offering threshold and ownership limitations. The subscription rights are non-transferable and may be exercised only during the anticipated subscription period of Tuesday, May 22, 2018 through 5:00 PM EDT on Tuesday, June 5, 2018, unless extended.\nThe issuance of the Units will be subject to the Units being listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Units do not qualify for listing, the shares of Common Stock and Series Z Warrants underlying the Units will be separately issued upon the closing of the Rights Offering.\nInvestors are advised to ensure they own PAVmed’s stock as of 4:00 PM EDT on Thursday, May 17, 2018 to be considered a stockholder of record on Monday, May 21, 2018, to take into account T+2 settlement timing.\nThe expected calendar for the rights offering is as follows:\nThursday, May 17, 2018: Buy-In Deadline - to be considered a stockholder of record on Monday, May 21, 2018; shares should be acquired by this date. Monday, May 21, 2018: Record Date Tuesday, May 22, 2018: Distribution Date; Subscription Period Begins Tuesday, June 5, 2018: Subscription Period Ends 5:00 PM EDT *\n* Unless extended in PAVmed’s sole discretion\nPAVmed intends to use the proceeds from the Rights Offering for research and development, including the development of its current pipeline and other related research and development, for general corporate purposes, and for general administrative expenses, working capital and capital expenditures.\nPAVmed has engaged Maxim Group LLC (“Maxim”) and Dawson James Securities, Inc.
