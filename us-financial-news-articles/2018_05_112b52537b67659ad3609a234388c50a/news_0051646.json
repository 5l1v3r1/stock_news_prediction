(NYSE:TPHS) announced today that it has closed on the previously announced acquisition of a newly built 105-unit, 12-story apartment building in Park Slope, Brooklyn for $81.0 million from an affiliate of Adam America Equities, LLC. The acquisition of the Park Slope property further expands Trinity Place Holdings core multi-family acquisition focused strategy, becoming the second property in this portfolio.\nLocated on the border of the Park Slope and Gowanus neighborhoods of Brooklyn at 237 11 th Street, the property is one block from the 4 th Avenue/9 th Street subway station, and a short walk to nearby amenities such as Prospect Park and Whole Foods Market.\nLeasing began in August 2017 at the Park Slope building, with the residential portion of the property approximately 63% leased. The property also includes 6,264 square feet of retail space, a portion of which is leased to Starbucks Inc.\nThe acquisition was capitalized with 2-year financings in the aggregate principal amount of $67.8 million. Such financings are interest-only and bear interest at the blended average rate of 3.72% over the 30-day LIBOR. The financings have a 1-year extension option.\nMatt Messinger, CEO of Trinity Place Holdings, commented, “We are excited to complete the acquisition of 237 11th. We believe there is a tremendous opportunity within key segments of the New York market to aggregate a portfolio of Class A apartments (some with ancillary ground-floor retail or mixed-use characteristics) which will generate stable, growing cash flow and offer long-term appreciation. We look forward to the continued execution of this strategy in the years to come.”\n237 11 th Street offers an array of modern amenities that surpass what is available in the neighborhood’s “brownstone” housing stock. Apartments feature a washer/dryer in all units, tenant-controlled HVAC units, stainless steel appliances, and private outdoor terraces. Building-wide amenities include a courtyard garden, party room, fitness center, tenant lounge, bicycle storage room, parking, and landscaped rooftop terrace. The property’s relative height offers panoramic views of the New York Harbor and the Manhattan skyline from upper floors and the rooftop.\nAbout TPHS\nTrinity Place Holdings Inc.
