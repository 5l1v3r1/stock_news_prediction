The Japanese yen weakened 0.37 percent versus the U.S. currency at 110.80 per dollar.\n“The near-term picture remains positive for the dollar with Treasury yields showing few signs of topping, a move that makes the buck a more enticing bet to income-seekers,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.\nOil prices hit $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014 on concerns that Iranian exports could fall because of renewed U.S. sanctions, reducing supply in an already tightening market.\nBrent was last at $80.29, up 1.27 percent on the day, after rising as high as $80.33.\nU.S. crude rose 0.71 percent to $72.00 per barrel.\n“The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay,” said Norbert Rücker, head of macro and commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “Supply concerns are top of mind after the United States left the Iran nuclear deal.”\nSpot gold dropped 0.1 percent to $1,288.96 an ounce, touching a new low for the year during the session.\nAdditional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York, Marc Jones and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-17T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:15:05.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
