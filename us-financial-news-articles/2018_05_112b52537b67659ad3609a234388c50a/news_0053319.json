(CSE:AUAG) is pleased to announce that the Company has acquired worldwide rights to a non-mercury, non-cyanide gold and silver extraction process that is currently patent-pending. The metallurgical extraction process was developed by Central America Nickel Inc. for the extraction of energy metals such as nickel, cobalt, vanadium, scandium, manganese and copper. The process was then applied to gold and silver samples originating from Auxico’s Zamora gold and silver property located in Sinaloa, Mexico.\nThe process extracted over 90% of the gold and over 80% of the silver in less then one hour, without the use of cyanide and mercury. The process uses no pressure and no heat. Auxico has agreed to pay Central America Nickel Inc. a 2% net royalty on the production of gold on any deposit in the world where the process is used. Auxico has the option to buy back this 50% of this royalty (or 1% of the 2% royalty) at any time through the issuance of 2,000,000 common shares of the Company.\nAuxico recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of the Department of Bolivar (Colombia), with the goal of implementing the environmentally friendly technology. Auxico will be in charge of the financing and construction of gold producing operations in Bolivar, as well as the management of the export and sale of gold and/or gold concentrates. The Department of Bolivar will provide: the property on which the gold production will take place; physical security of the gold production operations; help with the permitting process; and the liaison with local miners who will supply mineralized material to the Auxico gold production operations.\nThe Minamata Convention, whose objective is to end the use of mercury by artisanal miners, has been signed by 128 countries. The Auxico process is expected to provide an economic industrial alternative to the use of mercury while generating a much smaller environmental footprint.\nQualified Person\nThis news release was reviewed and approved by Joel Scodnick, P.Geo., an independent consultant to Auxico, in his capacity as a Qualified Person, as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n« signed »\nMark Billings\nPresident, Auxico Resources Canada Inc.\nmb@auxicoresources.com\nCell: +1 514 296 1641\nAbout Auxico Resources Canada Inc.\nAuxico Resources Canada Inc.
