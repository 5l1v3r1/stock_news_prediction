Thrown into the trash or even the recycling bin, they can cause fires at trash and recycling centers.\nLast year, 65% of waste facilities fires in California began with lithium-ion batteries. And when one goes, others can, too.\nMore from USA Today:\nHawaii volcano: Another cruise ship skips Big Island call due to Kilauea eruption\nVR: Learn why the world's largest musical instrument is in a cave\nSix types of annoying office co-workers to get on your last nerves\n\"If there are multiple batteries there, you will have not just a fire, you will have explosions,\" said Carl Smith, CEO and president of Call2Recycle, a national recycling program funded by battery manufacturers.\nIt's such a big problem that this week, California has launched an awareness campaign to try to get consumers to keep these ever-so-useful but also potentially dangerous items out of garbage trucks and landfills. It's part of a national effort to keep increasingly common batteries from causing fires.\nThose fires can be devastating. In March, an improperly disposed of lithium-ion battery caused a five-alarm fire at a recycling facility in Queens in New York City. It burned for two days and shut down four branches of the Long Island Rail Road for several hours, due to the thick smoke blowing onto the tracks.\nThat same month, an Indianapolis recycling plant also shut down after a fire blamed on batteries.\nLast year, a lithium-ion battery thrown into the trash caused an explosion in a New York City garbage truck when the workers compacted the waste, igniting and exploding the battery.\nLithium-ion batteries are found in cell phones, laptop computers, cameras and rechargeable power tools and even the electric scooters that have risen in popularity in the past year, says Kerchner. They also power electric cars like Teslas and Chevy Bolts.\nWhen it comes to the lithium-ion batteries in everyday devices, consumers tend to put them in the recycling \"hoping that somebody at the end of the line will recycle them eventually,\" said George Kerchner, executive director of the Rechargeable Battery Association.\nWe use a lot of them. In 2017, 175 million pounds of lithium-ion batteries were sold into the U.S. market, according to Call2Recycle.\nThe problem with lithium-ion batteries is the same thing that makes them so great — they're small and light but still pack a serious energy punch. These are the same kind type batteries that were catching fire in the recalled Samsung Galaxy Note 7's — as well as many other Samsung and other phone models that don't regularly explode.\nEven when they've pooped out in your device, there's still enough charge in them that they can create a spark if the terminal of the battery - the metal bits that send power from the battery into the device, touch something metallic, like the side of a garbage truck.\nThis can close the circuit, which creates an electric charge that can create a spark.\n\"And sparks create fires. If it's at a recycling facility where it's mixed in with paper and other items that are burnable, that just goes up like you wouldn't believe,\" Smith said.\n\"These are high-energy batteries, no question about it. If they're not properly handled they can catch on fire, Kerchner said.\nWhat to do with them Some areas' recycling programs have special battery recycling. For example, in San Francisco, you can leave batteries in a bag on top of your recycling bin on trash day and the local trash company will take them away to be recycled.\nNationally, lithium-ion batteries can be recycled at all Home Depots, Lowes and Best Buy stores.\nIf you put them in your recycling bin, put them in a closed plastic bag so that the battery can't come into contact with metal. A Ziploc bag or something similar works well, said Smith.\nDon't put them in the regular garbage, which is typically crushed and shredded. That can cause fires and even explosions.\nA less optimal but possible solution is to wrap either electrical or duct tape around the battery to cover the terminal, so that it can't make contact with metal and therefore close the circuit, said Smith.\nAnd note that lithium-ion batteries aren't the same as the alkaline batteries that typically go into toys and other devices that don't need really small, energy-dense batteries. Alkaline batteries can and should be recycled, but they don't carry so much electrical charge that they're a fire danger.", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/videos/virtual-reality/vrtually-there/2017/06/14/vr-learn-why-worlds-largest-musical-instrument-cave/102850622/?utm_source=taboola&utm_medium=exchange", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/05/17/hawaii-kilauea-volcano-princess-cruise-ship-skips-call/618470002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/strauss/2018/05/17/six-types-annoying-office-co-workers-get-your-last-nerves/617557002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/09/15/samsung-recalls-1m-note-7-phones/90427540/"], "published": "2018-05-18T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:58:33.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
