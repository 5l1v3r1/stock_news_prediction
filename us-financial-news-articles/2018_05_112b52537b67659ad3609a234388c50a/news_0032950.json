U.S. crude oil futures advanced 0.15 percent to $71.07 a barrel and in reach of $71.89, the highest since November 2014 scaled on Thursday.\nOil prices received their latest lift as OPEC reported that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated. Tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty about output from Iran amid renewed U.S. sanctions have contributed to the recent rise in oil prices.\n“The recent rise in prices of crude oil won’t have a broadly negative impact on equity markets if it continues at the current pace,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo.\n“The rise in oil prices is boding well for certain stock sectors like energy shares.”\nIn currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies nudged up 0.1 percent to 92.661.\nThe greenback took a knock against the euro earlier on Monday after European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could give fresh timing guidance of its first rate hike as the end of its exceptional bond purchases approaches.\nThe U.S. currency managed to bounce back, however, after Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester reiterated support for gradual interest rate increases.\nThe euro stood little changed at $1.1930 after pulling back sharply from the previous day’s high of $1.1996.\nThe dollar was a shade higher at 109.755 yen, adding to the previous day’s gains.\nThe currency drew support as U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the easing of U.S.-China trade tensions.\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield was at 2.998 percent after rising about 2.5 basis points overnight.
