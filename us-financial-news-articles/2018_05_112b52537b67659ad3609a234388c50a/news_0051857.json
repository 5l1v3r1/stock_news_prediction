Shipments from top-producing Michoacan state are already allowed.\nLast year, Mexico exported about $326 million in agriculture products to China, according to agriculture ministry data.\nMexico’s overall agriculture exports totaled more than $32 billion in 2017, with U.S. buyers accounting for 82 percent, according to central bank data.\nUrtega added that China is also interested in possible white corn imports from Mexico, since it is one of the few producers of white corn that does not use genetically modified organisms.\nAdditional reporting by Adriana Barrera; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-24T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:44:06.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
