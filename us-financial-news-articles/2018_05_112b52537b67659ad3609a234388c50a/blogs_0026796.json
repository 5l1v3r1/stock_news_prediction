Very few deals have been signed since last week for Brazilian soybeans for nearby shipment,\" he added. Sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.\nChina imports more than 60 percent of soybeans traded worldwide, crushing them to make cooking oil and protein-rich animal feed ingredient soymeal.\nThe premium for Brazilian soybeans, including freight <S-BRZPAR-A1>, quoted in China has dropped to $94 a tonne over July Chicago futures compared to a high of $160 touched in April. The premium is typically $50-60 a tonne at this time of year.\nBeijing last month threatened to slap an additional 25 percent tariff on soybean imports and a host of other products from the United States in retaliation for trade actions taken by President Donald Trump.\nBrazilian exports have also been hit as European and other Asian buyers have turned to cheaper U.S. supplies.\nHowever, the fall in Chinese near-term demand for Brazilian beans is only seen as temporary as prices for cargoes from the South American country are expected to drop as it gathers a record harvest.\nThe nation is harvesting an all-time high crop of more than 119 million tonnes, boosting expectations of stronger exports, with consultancy CÃ©leres estimating overseas sales will rise by 2 million tonnes in 2018 to 72 million tonnes.\nAnd Chinese buyers have not been shying away from taking June-July shipments, with demand for further months also robust. Importers booked 20 cargoes last week for August shipment, traders said.\nPIG OUT?\nChina will cut its soybean imports for the first time in 15 years in 2018/19, the agriculture ministry forecast on Thursday, with demand for animal feed faltering.\nHog prices in China registered one of the sharpest ever declines in the first quarter and are below average production cost.\n\"Most soybean plants in China are now overstocked with meal and oil,\" said a trader in Beijing.\n\"The main reason is demand-side. The hog price is not good so feed millers like to pick up cheap stuff hand-to-mouth.\"\nChina's April soybean imports fell to 6.9 million tonnes, a decline of 13.7 percent from a year ago.\n(Reporting by Naveen Thukral in Singapore and Dominique Patton in Beijing; Additional reporting by Roberto Samora in Sao Paulo; Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:32:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
