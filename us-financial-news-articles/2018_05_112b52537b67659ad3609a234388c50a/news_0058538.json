I think he deserves the opportunity to represent his country,” added Uelese, who was born in Wellington but has been capped twice by Australia.\nSamu said he was “thrilled” by the challenge of joining the Brumbies.\n“The Brumbies are well-renowned throughout Super Rugby for being a successful club and for having a fantastic playing culture,” he said in a statement.\nThe Wallabies face Ireland next month in a three-match test series, starting in Brisbane on June 9.
