Strickland got his ninth save with a hitless ninth.\nThe fivesome combined to strike out eight while allowing just two hits and no walks.\nDown 3-0, the Giants began their comeback when Belt smacked his eighth home run of the season over the right field wall against Reds starter Tyler Mahle (3-5).\nConsecutive singles by Evan Longoria, Brandon Crawford and Austin Jackson loaded the bases, setting the stage for a two-run, game-tying, pinch-hit single by Pablo Sandoval.\nSandoval was hitting for Blach, who was pulled after four innings despite having allowed just one earned run (three total). He gave up five hits and one walk, and he struck out one.\nAn infield single by Gregor Blanco reloaded the bases with still just one out, ending Mahle’s night. Reds reliever Amir Garrett entered, and Andrew McCutchen drove in what proved to be the difference-making run with a fielder’s choice ground ball.\nMahle was charged with four runs on seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. He walked one and struck out two.\nThe Giants added an insurance run in the eighth on a two-out, run-scoring single by Kelby Tomlinson. The hit scored Crawford, who had singled and advanced to second on a balk by Reds reliever David Hernandez.\nThe Reds opened their 3-0 lead on the strength of a two-run home run by Eugenio Suarez in the third inning and an RBI single by Billy Hamilton in the fourth.\nSuarez’s homer, his seventh of the season, came with two outs after an error by second baseman Tomlinson had kept the inning alive, making both runs unearned.\nSuarez and Scooter Gennett, the reigning National League Player of the Week, had two hits apiece for the Reds, who have lost two straight after a six-game winning streak.\nCrawford went 4-for-4 with a double and three singles for the Giants, who out-hit the Reds 11-7.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-16T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:27:47.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
