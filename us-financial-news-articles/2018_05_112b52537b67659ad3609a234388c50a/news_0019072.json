Tomorrow will be too late,” curator Simon Njami told Reuters at the venue, where more than 75 artists from around the world are exhibiting their work for a month.\nThe practice of hosting art exhibitions every two years has spread to several African countries, but none has been more successful so far than the Dakar Biennale, founded in the 1990s and also known as Dak’Art.\nThis year’s displays by African artists at the biennale are as eclectic as those from elsewhere. They include works using materials that have become hallmarks of the continent’s modern art - such as the recycled food packaging and strips of “African print” cloth in Nigerian artist Olanrewaju Tejuoso’s abstract wall piece.\nOthers - involving lights going on and off, rooms scattered with everyday household objects or projectors beaming images with enigmatic slogans onto walls - wouldn’t look out of a place in a Western conceptual art exhibition.\nOne by South African artist Frances Goodman seems to conjure up intense rage using an amorphous blob of fake fingernails.\nIn the past quarter-century African art has gone from near total obscurity on the world scene to producing stars such as Ghana’s El Anatsui and South Africa’s William Kentridge.\nYassine Balbzioui poses for a photo with his artwork \"Crazy Cloud\" during the 13th edition of the Dakar Biennale of African Contemporary Art, Dak'art in Dakar, Senegal May 4, 2018. REUTERS/Mikal McAllister “It’s a whole continent that was ignored. The market is just starting to pick up on it,” said Njami, a Swiss national of Cameroonian descent. “Before, anyone could have bought an El Anatsui. Nowadays if you don’t have $2 million, forget about it.”\nIn March a portrait of a Nigerian princess that was lost for 40 years and found in London sold for $1.4 million.\nDespite successfully lobbying for the Palais, Njami thinks African governments do woefully little to support the arts.\n“People say: ‘Why spend money on arts when you can build a road?’” he said. “But we need culture, not just infrastructure”.\nOwing to poor support, facilities and a tiny domestic market, many of Africa’s most talented artists predictably end up in Europe or the United States. Those staying at home are often underresourced.\nAt the exhibition, Senegalese artist Badara Sarr complained that his spot was underlit, so he had to buy a spot lamp, and then there was no technician available to install it.\n“It was a bit deplorable, but we manage as Senegalese. That’s Africa for you,” he told Reuters next to his cloud-like patches of red, blue and green paint. Despite being a bit in the dark, “a lot of people are interested” in his painting.\nSlideshow (9 Images) “I’m honestly happy about the interactions we’re having,” he said.\nEditing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-09T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T18:06:29.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
