(NYSE: AI) (the \"Company\" or \"Arlington\") today reported net loss attributable to common shareholders of $56.5 million, or $2.00 per diluted common share, loss before income taxes attributable to common shareholders of $38.3 million, or $1.36 per diluted common share, and non-GAAP core operating income of $16.1 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. A reconciliation of non-GAAP core operating income to GAAP net income (loss) before income taxes appears at the end of this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\n$2.00 per diluted common share of GAAP net loss, including a $0.64 per diluted common share income tax provision $1.36 per diluted common share of GAAP pre-tax loss $0.57 per diluted common share of non-GAAP core operating income $11.03 per common share of book value $11.65 per common share of tangible book value $0.55 per common share dividend\n\"Arlington delivered solid net interest income and non-GAAP core operating income results during the quarter. Our spread earnings benefited from higher asset yields on our agency mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") as prepayment speeds declined during the quarter while the increase in repo funding costs from Federal Reserve rate hikes was mitigated by our substantial interest rate hedge position,\" said J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Following a year of low volatility and a strong economic return for our Company in 2017, the first quarter of 2018 saw a sharp reversal of that trend as interest rates rose significantly and risk markets weakened amid heightened volatility. Increased volatility coupled with reduced Federal Reserve support for agency MBS resulted in a widening of spreads between agency MBS yields and benchmark interest rates. The higher interest rates and wider agency spreads resulted in underperformance in the pricing of our agency MBS relative to our interest rate hedges causing a decline in the Company's book value. While spread widening generally results in declines in book values, the future earnings power of a hedged agency MBS portfolio improves as reinvestments of the portfolio occur at higher returns. Spread earnings going forward should also benefit from favorable funding spreads as our interest rate swaps reset at higher receive rates relative to repo cost. Finally, Arlington continues to benefit from the flexibility provided by its C corporation structure that also offers shareholders tax-advantaged returns.\"\nOther First Quarter Highlights\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's agency MBS investment portfolio totaled $5,369 million in fair value, consisting of $3,907 million of specified agency MBS and $1,462 million of net long to-be-announced (\"TBA\") agency MBS. As of March 31, 2018, the Company's $5,369 million agency MBS investment portfolio was comprised of the following:\n$206 million of 3.5% coupon 15-year agency MBS $63 million of 4.0% coupon 20-year agency MBS $321 million of 3.5% coupon 30-year agency MBS $3,678 million of 4.0% coupon 30-year agency MBS $1,101 million of 4.5% coupon 30-year agency MBS\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's $3,907 million specified agency MBS portfolio had a weighted average amortized cost basis of $105.27 and a weighted average market price of $103.34. The Company's fixed-rate agency MBS are comprised of securities backed by specified pools of mortgage loans selected for their lower propensity for prepayment. Weighted average pay-up premiums on the Company's agency MBS portfolio, which represent the estimated price premium of agency MBS backed by specified pools over a generic TBA agency MBS, were approximately half of a percentage point as of March 31, 2018, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company's net long TBA agency MBS investment portfolio had a purchase price of $1,458 million and market value of $1,462 million, resulting in a net GAAP carrying fair value of $4 million. Under GAAP, the gross fair value of the agency MBS underlying the Company's TBA commitments is not recognized on the balance sheet as the Company accounts for its TBA commitments as derivative instruments.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $3,583 million of repurchase agreements outstanding with a weighted average rate of 1.89% and remaining weighted average maturity of 15 days secured by an aggregate of $3,775 million of agency MBS at fair value.\nInterest income less interest expense on short-term secured financing on the Company's agency MBS portfolio was $15.5 million of 2018 compared to $16.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, including the amortization of the Company's net premium on its agency MBS of $7.9 million of 2018 compared to $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company's weighted average yield on its agency MBS was 2.98% of 2018 compared to 2.86% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the actual weighted-average constant prepayment rate (\"CPR\") for the Company's agency MBS was 8.64% of 2018 compared to 9.55% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company's weighted average cost of repurchase agreement funding was 1.64% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 1.37% during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of its cost of borrowing and the value of its agency MBS portfolio including interest rate swap agreements, U.S. Treasury note futures, put and call options on 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures, and options on agency MBS.\nUnder the terms of the Company's interest rate swap agreements, the Company pays semiannual interest payments based on a fixed rate and receives quarterly variable interest payments based upon the prevailing three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") on the date of reset. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $3,525 million in notional amount of interest rate swap agreements with a weighted average pay fixed rate of 1.75% and a remaining weighted average maturity of 5.5 years. The Company's weighted average net pay rate of its interest rate swap agreements was 0.04% during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.28% during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to interest rate swap agreements, the Company held $850 million in equivalent notional amount of short positions in 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures as of March 31, 2018 that were purchased during the first quarter of 2018 when the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate was 2.91%.\nThe Company reported TBA dollar roll income of $6.6 million of 2018 compared to $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The implied weighted-average net interest spread of the Company's TBA dollar rolls was 1.84% of 2018 compared to 1.98% for the fourth quarter of 2017. TBA dollar roll income is considered the economic equivalent of investing in agency MBS financed with a repurchase agreement and is calculated as the price discount of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS relative to the \"spot\" sale of the same security. Under GAAP, the Company accounts for its TBA commitments as derivative instruments and recognizes income from TBA dollar rolls as a component of net investment gains and losses in the Company's financial statements.\nExcluding TBA dollar roll income, we had net investment losses on our investment portfolio of $127.3 million. On our related interest rate hedging instruments, we had net investment gains of $73.3 million, excluding interest rate swap net interest expense. This results in a net investment loss on our hedged investment portfolio of $54.0 million, or $1.91 per diluted common share of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to taxation as a corporation under Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of March 31, 2018, the Company estimated its net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforward at $51.5 million that begins to expire in 2027, its net capital loss (\"NCL\") carryforward at $380.7 million that begins to expire in 2019, and its alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\") credit carryforward at $9.1 million that does not expire. The Company's estimated loss and tax credit carryforwards as of March 31, 2018 are subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing the Company's income tax returns.\nFor GAAP purposes, the Company had a net deferred tax liability of $17.5 million, or $0.62 per common share, and an AMT credit carryforward within other assets on its consolidated balance sheet of $9.1 million, or $0.32 per common share, as of March 31, 2018. The Company continues to record a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that are capital in tax character and no valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that are ordinary in tax character. The Company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of its cost of borrowing and the value of its agency MBS portfolio. For income tax purposes, gains and losses from its agency MBS are capital in tax character while gains and losses from its interest rate swap hedges are ordinary in tax character. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company had net investment losses on its agency MBS for which no deferred income tax benefit was recorded since the Company records a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets that are capital in nature. However, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company had net investments gains on its interest rate swap hedges for which a deferred income tax provision was recorded resulting in the Company now having a net deferred tax liability on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2018. For accounting purposes, the Company's interest rate swaps are a hedge against future higher funding costs on the Company's repurchase agreement financing. However, those future higher expected funding costs are not currently reflected as a deferred tax asset whereas the future benefits of the hedge against the higher expected funding costs are currently reflected as a deferred tax liability. As a result, the deferred tax liability related to the net gain on the Company's interest rate hedges should be offset in the future by tax deductions related to future higher funding costs on the Company's repurchase agreement financing as they materialize.\nDistributions to Shareholders\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved a distribution to common shareholders of $0.55 per share of 2018. The distribution was paid on April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2018. The Company's Board of Directors also approved a distribution to its Series B preferred shareholders of $0.4375 per share of 2018. The distribution was paid on April 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of February 26, 2018.\nThe tax characterization of the Company's distributions to shareholders is determined and reported to shareholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year. As a C corporation, distributions to common and preferred individual shareholders of current or accumulated earnings and profits are qualified dividends eligible for the 23.8% maximum federal income tax rate whereas similar distributions to individual shareholders by a REIT of current or accumulated earnings and profits are nonqualified dividends subject to the higher 33.4% maximum effective federal tax rate (net of the 20% dividend deduction benefit), each inclusive of the 3.8% Medicare tax rate, on ordinary income. Any distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits would be reported as returns of capital instead of qualified dividends. Distributions that are classified as returns of capital are nontaxable to the extent they do not exceed a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock, or as a capital gain to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis in the Company's stock.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call for investors at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 3, 2018 to discuss the Company's first quarter 2018 results.\nInvestors may listen to the earnings call via the internet at: http://www.arlingtonasset.com/index.php?s=19 .

Economic net interest income is comprised of the following:\nnet interest income determined in accordance with GAAP;\nTBA agency MBS dollar roll income, which is calculated as the price discount of a forward-settling purchase of a TBA agency MBS relative to the \"spot\" sale of the same security, earned ratably over the period beginning on the settlement date of the sale and ending on the settlement date of the forward-settling purchase; and\nnet interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements.\nIn the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with GAAP, TBA agency MBS dollar roll income and the net interest income or expense incurred from interest rate swap agreements are reported as a component of the overall periodic change in the fair value of derivative instruments within the line item \"gain (loss) from derivative instruments, net\" of the \"investment gain (loss), net\" section. We believe that economic net interest income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company's long-term-focused, net interest spread-based investment strategy, prior to the deduction of core general and administrative expenses.\nCore General and Administrative Expenses\nCore general and administrative expenses are non-interest expenses reported within the line item \"total general and administrative expenses\" of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income less stock-based compensation expense.\nNon-GAAP Core Operating Income Results\nThe following table presents the Company's computation of core operating income for the last four fiscal quarters (unaudited, amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nGAAP net interest income\n$\n14,304\n$\n15,657\n$\n14,867\n$\n18,933\nTBA dollar roll income\n6,643\n7,171\n6,424\n4,298\nInterest rate swap net interest expense\n(816)\n(2,434)\n(4,198)\n(5,293)\nEconomic net interest income\n20,131\n20,394\n17,093\n17,938\nCore general and administrative expenses\n(3,846)\n(3,768)\n(3,171)\n(3,681)\nPreferred stock dividend\n(137)\n(133)\n(83)\n(35)\nNon-GAAP core operating income\n$\n16,148\n$\n16,493\n$\n13,839\n$\n14,222\nNon-GAAP core operating income per\ndiluted common share\n$\n0.57\n$\n0.58\n$\n0.52\n$\n0.58\nWeighted average diluted common\nshares outstanding\n28,430\n28,580\n26,856\n24,552\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP pre-tax net income (loss) to non-GAAP core operating income for the last four fiscal quarters (unaudited, amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nGAAP (loss) income before income taxes\n$\n(38,132)\n$\n20,948\n$\n23,691\n$\n(1,191)\nLess:\nTotal investment loss (gain), net\n48,139\n(10,238)\n(13,368)\n15,970\nStock-based compensation expense\n451\n1,179\n1,373\n473\nPreferred stock dividend\n(137)\n(133)\n(83)\n(35)\nAdd back:\nTBA dollar roll income\n6,643\n7,171\n6,424\n4,298\nInterest rate swap net interest expense\n(816)\n(2,434)\n(4,198)\n(5,293)\nNon-GAAP core operating income\n$\n16,148\n$\n16,493\n$\n13,839\n$\n14,222\nNon-GAAP core operating income is used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's long-term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as assist with the determination of the appropriate level of periodic dividends to common stockholders. The Company believes that non-GAAP core operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the Company's long-term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity. A limitation of utilizing this non-GAAP financial measure is that the effect of accounting for \"non-core\" events or transactions in accordance with GAAP does, in fact, reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results. For example, the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements, such as U.S. Treasury note futures or options on U.S. Treasury note futures, do not affect the computation of non-GAAP core operating income. In addition, the Company's calculation of non-GAAP core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Therefore, the Company believes that net income and comprehensive income determined in accordance with GAAP should be considered in conjunction with non-GAAP core operating income.\nThe following tables present information on the Company's investment and hedge portfolio as of March 31, 2018 (unaudited, dollars in thousands):\nAgency MBS:\nFair Value\nSpecified agency MBS\n$\n3,907,018\nNet long agency TBA position\n1,461,972\nTotal\n$\n5,368,990\nSpecified Agency MBS:\nUnpaid\nPrincipal\nBalance\nNet Unamortized Purchase Premiums\nAmortized\nCost Basis\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nFair Value\nMarket Price\nCoupon\nWeighted\nAverage\nExpected\nRemaining\nLife\n15-year fixed rate:\n3.5%\n$\n102,045\n$\n1,853\n$\n103,898\n$\n398\n$\n104,296\n102.21\n3.50\n%\n4.9\n20-year fixed rate:\n4.0%\n60,500\n2,090\n62,590\n269\n62,859\n103.90\n4.00\n%\n6.9\n30-year fixed rate:\n3.5%\n318,826\n11,253\n330,079\n(9,275)\n320,804\n100.62\n3.50\n%\n8.6\n4.0%\n2,801,423\n149,839\n2,951,262\n(57,710)\n2,893,552\n103.29\n4.00\n%\n7.6\n4.5%\n497,998\n34,168\n532,166\n(6,679)\n525,487\n105.52\n4.50\n%\n6.9\n5.5%\n19\n—\n19\n1\n20\n109.59\n5.50\n%\n5.9\nTotal/weighted-\naverage 30-year\nfixed rate\n3,618,266\n195,260\n3,813,526\n(73,663)\n3,739,863\n103.36\n4.03\n%\n7.6\nTotal/weighted-average\n$\n3,780,811\n$\n199,203\n$\n3,980,014\n$\n(72,996)\n$\n3,907,018\n103.34\n4.01\n%\n7.5\nNet Long Agency TBA Positions:\nNotional Amount:\nNet Long (Short)\nPosition\nImplied Cost\nBasis\nImplied\nFair Value\nNet Carrying\nAmount\n3.5% 15-year MBS purchase commitments\n$\n100,000\n$\n101,683\n$\n101,953\n$\n270\n4.0% 30-year MBS purchase commitments\n1,180,000\n1,206,313\n1,210,370\n4,057\n4.5% 30-year MBS purchase commitments\n550,000\n574,912\n575,594\n682\n4.0% 30-year MBS sell commitments\n(415,000)\n(425,033)\n(425,945)\n(912)\nTotal TBA commitments, net\n$\n1,415,000\n$\n1,457,875\n$\n1,461,972\n$\n4,097\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements:\nWeighted-average:\nNotional Amount\nFixed Pay Rate\nVariable Receive Rate\nNet Receive Rate\nRemaining Life (Years)\nFair Value\nYears to maturity:\nLess than 3 years\n$\n1,175,000\n1.25\n%\n1.96\n%\n0.71\n%\n1.6\n$\n7\n3 to less than 7 years\n600,000\n1.89\n%\n1.96\n%\n0.07\n%\n3.5\n(31)\n7 or more years\n1,750,000\n2.04\n%\n2.09\n%\n0.05\n%\n8.9\n(620)\nTotal / weighted-average\n$\n3,525,000\n1.75\n%\n2.03\n%\n0.28\n%\n5.5\n$\n(644)\nU.S. Treasury Note Futures:\nMaturity Date\nNotional Amount\nNet Fair Value\n10-year U.S. Treasury note futures\nJune 2018\n850,000\n(468)\nThe following table presents information about the components of the Company's net deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (unaudited, dollars in thousands):\nAs of March 31, 2018\nAs of December 31, 2017\nGross Amount\nTax Effected\nGross Amount\nTax Effected\nOrdinary deferred tax (liabilities) assets:\nNOL carryforward\n$\n51,489\n$\n13,253\n$\n60,681\n$\n15,619\nDeferred net loss on designated hedges\n6,595\n1,698\n17,020\n4,381\nNet unrealized gain on designated hedges\n(133,291)\n(34,309)\n(82,434)\n(21,218)\nStock-based compensation\n8,218\n2,115\n7,768\n1,999\nOther, net\n(275)\n(275)\n72\n19\nTotal ordinary deferred tax (liabilities) assets, net\n(67,264)\n(17,518)\n3,107\n800\nCapital deferred tax assets:\nNCL carryforward\n380,660\n97,982\n314,276\n80,895\nNet unrealized loss on investments\n129,171\n33,249\n91,030\n23,431\nValuation allowance\n(509,831)\n(131,231)\n(405,306)\n(104,326)\nTotal capital deferred tax assets, net\n—\n—\n—\n—\nTotal deferred tax (liabilities) assets, net\n$\n(67,264)\n$\n(17,518)\n$\n3,107\n$\n800\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlington-asset-investment-corp-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300641508.html\nSOURCE Arlington Asset Investment Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arlington-asset-investment-corp-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300641508.html", "http://www.arlingtonasset.com/index.php?s=19", "http://www.arlingtonasset.com/"], "published": "2018-05-03T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T02:31:52.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
