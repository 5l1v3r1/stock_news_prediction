Soleimani’s Quds Force is the main foreign backer of Amiri’s Badr, which served as the backbone of Popular Mobilisation, a volunteers force set up to fight Islamic State.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-16T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:04:51.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
