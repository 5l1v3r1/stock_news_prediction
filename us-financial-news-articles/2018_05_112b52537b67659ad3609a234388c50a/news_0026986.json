This helped offset a fall in overseas sales volumes, which were impacted by trade restrictions imposed by Russia and Europe. Still, net revenues fell 5 percent from the same quarter a year ago, to 8.2 billion reais.\nOn April 19, the European Union banned imports of Brazilian meat products, mostly poultry, in a move that affected 20 plants that had been authorized to export to the bloc, 12 of which are operated by BRF.\nThe company said it has not been formally notified of the bloc’s decision and will try to reverse it.\nIt is unclear whether BRF will be capable of directing any exceeding production capacity resulting from the bans to alternative markets, at similar prices.\nThe company said average selling prices for some products in some markets fell as a result of the trade bans, a direct result of the food safety probes that started in March 2017.\nBRF’s top shareholders last month overhauled the board, a move designed to kick off a turnaround after two years of net losses partially due to mismanagement of feed inventory and fallout from the scandal.\n“The next quarters will be extremely challenging,” Chief Executive Lorival Nogueira Luz said in a statement accompanying results.
