The fall in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, compared with a 3.0 percent decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll. Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and from electric power utilities, declined 2.4 percent in March. Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast core orders would rise 7.1 percent in April-June, after climbing 3.3 percent in the previous quarter.
