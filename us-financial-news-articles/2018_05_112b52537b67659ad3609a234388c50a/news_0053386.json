Jewellers are not comfortable with the current price level,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank.\nIn the Indian market, gold futures were trading around 31,325 rupees per 10 grammes, after rising to 31,620 last month, their highest since August 2016.\n“The rupee depreciation is making gold expensive for Indians. Investment demand is very weak,” said a gold dealer based in Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat.\nThe rupee has depreciated by about 6 percent this year, and hit its lowest in 16 months this week.\nMeanwhile, in Singapore, premiums of around 60 cents to $1 an ounce were being charged, as against the 90 cents level last week.\nIn Japan, prices remained on par with the global benchmark.\n“The price movements are not big enough to change premium levels,” said a Tokyo-based trader.
