It’s part of our future and we’re excited about going there for that particular race.\n“That said... next year we’re going to celebrate it as the year of the 1,000th grand prix so you’re going to see integrations across the year celebrating this incredible milestone,” he added.\nRISK-FREE\nBratches said the Chinese organizers had welcomed the move.\n“They’re embracing it and we’re starting to have discussions in terms of how we can amplify it and make sure that it’s celebrated in an appropriate way,” he said.\nFormula One has a record-equaling 21 races this season and Miami could be joining the party in 2019 with a street race proposed.\nThat has led to paddock speculation about Azerbaijan’s future but Bratches said that race was not linked in any way to Miami.\n“Nonsense. Capital letters. There’s no relationship between our efforts and grand prix in Baku and any other grand prix in the world,” he said. “Fake news.”\nSilverstone’s future has also been in the spotlight after the circuit’s owners activated a break clause in 2017 which means next year’s race will be the last unless a new deal is done.\nRepresentatives from Silverstone were in Barcelona but Bratches said there had been no meeting.\n“We didn’t have conversations with them this particular weekend. Most of the discussions we’ve been having have been taking place in London and that’s not to insinuate that anything is wrong,” he said.\n“There’s a lot of promoters here from Singapore, Silverstone and around Europe and the globe. Hockenheim is here,” he added, referring to the German track whose deal expires this year.\nHockenheim promoters said last week that they wanted to continue but with a new ‘risk-free’ deal, a concept that has met with little favor in the past and may again fall on barren ground.\n“A lot of people might want a risk-free contract but that’s not our business model. We’re looking forward to the grand prix there this year,” said Bratches.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-14T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:04:37.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
