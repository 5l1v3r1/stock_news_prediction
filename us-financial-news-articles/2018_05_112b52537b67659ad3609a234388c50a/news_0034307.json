Many expected the launch of bitcoin futures on major U.S. exchanges in December would have helped, but bitcoin has lost more than half its value since then.\nThe market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has halved from $800 billion in January to around $400 billion this month, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThree main hurdles — regulatory uncertainty, lack of market infrastructure and institutional-grade data sources — prevent institutions from participating in the cryptocurrency market at scale, the report said. That's forced much of the institutional trading volume into over-the-counter trades, which range from $150 billion to $30 billion in daily trading volume, the analysts said, noting comparisons to the early ages of the now-$5 trillion spot foreign exchange market.\nBut \"the newest technology providers entering this space are led by people from the wholesale financial markets who claim they have spotted a significant market gap waiting to be filled,\" the analysts said.\n\"The word on the street is that significant additional institutional money is being amassed and is waiting for the right conditions to enter the market — and expected to start doing so this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T14:36:23.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
