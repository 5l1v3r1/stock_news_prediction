It infects and monitors network traffic, looking for login credentials that a hacker can use to seize control of industrial processes, Williams said.\nThe malware also includes an auto-destruct feature that hackers can use to delete the malware and other software on infected devices, making them inoperable, he said.\nVPNFilter is named after a directory the malware creates to hide its files on an infected device.
