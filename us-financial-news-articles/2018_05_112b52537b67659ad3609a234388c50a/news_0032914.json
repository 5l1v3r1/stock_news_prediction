Now pictures of his bearded face are boosting sales ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Brighton & Hove Albion - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - May 13, 2018 Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates with the Golden Boot after the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nManufacturers have plastered his image on traditional Ramadan products ranging from pillows to lanterns “famous” and paper cut-outs as they try to cash in on his success to offset economic hardships caused by the government’s financial reforms.\n“The Mohamed Salah lantern is the highest selling lantern this year,” said Essam, a shopkeeper, who did not give his last name. Other shopkeepers at a market in Cairo’s Sayeda Zainab neighbourhood said “Salah mania” was also helping them sell.\nSalah scored 44 goals in 51 games in his debut campaign and last week won the Football Writers Association award. Next month, the 25-year-old will lead Egypt’s first team for 28 years at the World Cup.\n“Mohamed Salah is a role model for all Egyptians at the moment,” said Omnia, a shopper. “All of Egypt loves Mo’ Salah, as they call him in England.”\nDemand for food and traditional items soars during Ramadan, a month whose start date depends on the sighting of a crescent moon.
