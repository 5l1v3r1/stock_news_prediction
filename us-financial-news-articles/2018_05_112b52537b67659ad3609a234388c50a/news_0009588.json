(the “Company” or “SiteOne”) (NYSE: SITE) announced earnings for its first quarter ended April 1, 2018 (“First Quarter 2018”).\n“Our first quarter results reflect a late start to the spring season this year which delayed business during our seasonally slowest and traditionally loss-making quarter,” said Doug Black, SiteOne’s Chairman and CEO. “The quarter also included the opening of our two strategic distribution centers in California and Pennsylvania, completing our major supply chain investments. Given these factors, we are pleased with our overall 11% net sales growth in the quarter and with the underlying market trends that we see developing for the year. We continue to expect good organic growth and EBITDA margin expansion in 2018 driven by our strong teams and by the execution of our commercial and operational initiatives. We are also off to a great start with four acquisitions year to date and a healthy level of activity to support more acquisitions during the remainder of the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nNet sales for the First Quarter 2018 increased to $371.4 million, or 11%, compared to $335.0 million for the prior-year period. Organic Daily Sales increased 3% compared to the prior-year period driven by strength in our irrigation, hardscapes and ice melt product sales and positive pricing for the quarter. Partially offsetting the sales growth was the unfavorable weather patterns in March which negatively impacted nursery, fertilizer and control product sales. Acquisitions contributed approximately $27.9 million in sales, or 8%, to overall growth for the quarter.\nGross profit increased to $108.5 million, or 8%, compared to $100.9 million for the prior-year period. Gross margin declined by 90 bps to 29.2% for the First Quarter 2018. The decline in gross margin was due to the rollout of the new distribution centers and the adoption of the new revenue standard which impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition for our customer loyalty rewards program.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the First Quarter 2018 increased to $131.7 million from $113.7 million in the same period last year due to the additional contribution from acquisitions and continued investment in e-Commerce.\nNet loss for the First Quarter 2018 was $17.0 million, compared to a net loss of $10.5 million during the same period in the prior year. The net loss for the quarter is attributable to the seasonality of the business as well as continued investments in the Company.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $5.1 million for the First Quarter 2018, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million for the prior-year period.\nOutlook\nFor fiscal 2018, we continue to expect Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $180 million to $192 million.\nReconciliation for the forward-looking full-year 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook is not being provided, as the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation.\nConference Call Information\nSiteOne management today, May 2, 2018, at 8 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss the Company’s financial results.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our 2018 Adjusted EBITDA outlook. Some of the can be identified by the use of terms such as “may,” “intend,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” or the negative of these terms, and similar expressions. You should be aware that these are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. Factors that may cause actual results to those expressed or implied by the include, but are not limited to, the following: cyclicality in residential and commercial construction markets; general economic and financial conditions; weather conditions, seasonality and availability of water to end-users; laws and government regulations applicable to our business that could negatively impact demand for our products; public perceptions that our products and services are not environmentally friendly; competitive industry pressures; product shortages and the loss of key suppliers; product price fluctuations; inventory management risks; ability to implement our business strategies and achieve our growth objectives; acquisition and integration risks; increased operating costs; and other risks, as described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis release includes certain financial information, not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial information identically (or at all), the presentations herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, these measures should not be considered substitutes for the information contained in the historical financial information of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is set forth herein.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA in order to evaluate the operating performance and efficiency of our business. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for items permitted under the covenants of our credit facilities. EBITDA represents our net income (loss) plus the sum of income tax (benefit), depreciation and amortization and interest expense, net of interest income. Adjusted EBITDA is further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, related party advisory fees, (gain) loss on sale of assets and other non-cash items, other non-recurring (income) and loss. Adjusted EBITDA does not include pre-acquisition acquired Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our liquidity or financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Net debt is defined as long-term debt (net of issuance costs and discounts) plus capital leases, net of cash and cash-equivalents on our balance sheet. Leverage Ratio is defined as Net Debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Flow from Operating Activities, less capital expenditures. We define Organic Daily Sales as Organic Sales divided by the number of Selling Days in the relevant reporting period. We define Organic Sales as Net sales, including Net sales from newly-opened greenfield stores, but excluding Net sales from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the fiscal year. Selling Days are the number of business days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, that SiteOne branches are open during the relevant reporting period.\nSiteOne Landscape Supply, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nAssets April 1, 2018 December 31, 2017 Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 31.7 $ 16.7 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $5.8 and $4.7, respectively 233.0 219.9 Inventory, net 464.3 338.3 Income tax receivable 13.9 2.7 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 28.4 24.3 Total current assets 771.3 601.9 Property and equipment, net 79.2 75.5 Goodwill 122.2 106.5 Intangible assets, net 127.7 112.8 Other assets 18.2 14.0 Total assets $ 1,118.6 $ 910.7 Liabilities and Equity Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 236.8 $ 124.1 Current portion of capital leases 5.1 4.9 Accrued compensation 27.8 40.1 Long term debt, current portion 3.5 3.5 Accrued liabilities 37.7 33.2 Total current liabilities 310.9 205.8 Other long-term liabilities 12.5 16.8 Capital leases, less current portion 8.9 6.8 Deferred tax liabilities 12.5 8.4 Long-term debt, less current portion 572.7 460.1 Total liabilities 917.5 697.9 Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity: Common stock, par value $0.01;
