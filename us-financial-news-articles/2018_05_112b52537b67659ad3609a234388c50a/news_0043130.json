On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading up 0.61% at $72.68 a barrel.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday made sweeping demands that Iran must meet before the U.S. enters a new nuclear pact with the country. Washington threatened “the strongest sanctions in history” if the Islamic Republic didn’t yield to the requirements.\nOil today is up “specifically because of Pompeo’s speech,” said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at Capital Economics.\n“It certainly looks like the U.S. is going to go as hard as possible on sanctions and try their best to make it hurt,” Mr. Pugh said.\nPresident Donald Trump earlier this month pulled the U.S. out of a 2015 international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear activities, sending the oil price higher amid a belief that any new U.S. sanctions will hinder crude supply.\nLast week Brent temporarily breached $80 a barrel for the first time in over 3½ years.\nAnalysts have estimated that anywhere from 400,000 to 1 million barrels a day of Iran’s 2.4 million barrels a day of crude exports could be at risk.\nA gas flare in the Persian Gulf, Iran. The risk to supply comes during an already tightening global oil market. Photo: raheb homavandi/Reuters Newsletter Sign-up The risk to supply comes during an already tightening global oil market, and as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies continue to cut crude production as part of a coordinated agreement to mop up a global supply glut that had weighed on prices since late 2014.\nCommercial petroleum stockpiles have fallen to their lowest levels in over three years, according to the International Energy Agency, in one of the clearest signs to date that the market is back in balance.\nCrude prices are also being bolstered by fears of escalating supply disruptions in Venezuela , another OPEC member. The re-election of Venezuela’s far-left president, Nicolás Maduro, on Sunday in a race called illegitimate by the opposition and many foreign governments, paves the way for the imposition of stricter international sanctions on the country. The U.S. is widely expected to target the country’s already-embattled oil industry, analysts say.\nOn Monday, the U.S. broadened a ban on Americans buying Venezuelan debt, potentially making it harder for the country to get much needed finance for its ailing oil industry. The latest executive order impedes Venezuela’s ability to sell its foreign assets and prohibits Americans from buying any debt owed to Venezuela.\n“Venezuela has played a major part in the tightening of supply on the oil market, especially since these outages have not been offset by other OPEC countries yet,” analysts at Commerzbank wrote in a note Tuesday.\nVenezuelan crude output fell by 50,000 barrels a day in April month-on-month, to stand at 1.42 million barrels a day, according to the IEA’s latest monthly oil market report.\nOil market observers are looking ahead Tuesday to weekly U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.\n“The market will be watching closely the U.S. crude oil export number, and whether we see another week of strong exports,” according to analysts at ING Bank.\nGasoline futures rose 0.8% to $2.2746 a gallon. Diesel futures rose 0.82% to $2.2925 a gallon.\n—Alison Sider contributed to this article\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-11476?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11476?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11476?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11476?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11476?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-11476?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-05-22T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:46:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
