LOUIS, May 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stereotaxis, Inc. (OTCQX:STXS), the global leader in innovative robotic technologies for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We continue to improve our commercial execution, advance our strategic innovation initiatives, add to the robust body of clinical literature supporting our technology, and do all this while being financially disciplined and attentive to shareholder value,” said David Fischel, Chairman and CEO.\n“The positive recent trend of recurring revenue growth continued in the first quarter. Our commercial focus remains supporting electrophysiologists build successful robotic ablation practices. We have a well-defined multi-pronged strategy to do so. We are confident that year-over-year growth in recurring revenue will persist in the coming quarters followed by a period where we can reinvigorate system sales.”\n“We are advancing multiple strategic innovation initiatives internally and in collaboration with others. We are very excited by the recently announced collaboration with Acutus Medical and believe our joint efforts will meaningfully advance patient care and the physician experience in electrophysiology, particularly in the wide range of arrhythmias that are difficult to diagnose and treat effectively with traditional technologies. Our recent CE Mark expanded labeling for usage of the Niobe ® magnetic navigation system in the pericardial space represents the first approval for our technology outside of the vascular system and provides electrophysiologists with additional capabilities when treating complex arrhythmias. We are confident in our broader innovation strategy and additional details will be provided as appropriate.”\n“The increase in quantity and quality of peer-reviewed clinical literature supporting our technology continues. Eighteen publications have showcased our technology year-to-date, compared to thirty-seven in all of 2017 and twenty-two in 2016. A recent publication by Yuan et al from Lund University in Sweden compared robotic magnetic navigation to manual catheter navigation in 214 atrial fibrillation patients. Patients treated robotically had a 70% lower rate of major adverse events, were exposed to 38% less radiation, and had clinically meaningful and statistically significant increases in efficacy outcomes at all time periods measured post ablation. This included a statistically significant 38% increase in freedom from atrial fibrillation at the end of the follow-up period 3.5 years post ablation. Procedure times were equivalent between both arms.”\n“We appreciate the continued support of our shareholders. The additional capital we were able to raise in the first quarter from the non-dilutive early warrant exercise places us in a strong financial position to execute on our initiatives without the need for additional financings.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $7.0 million, consistent with the prior year first quarter. Recurring revenue was $7.0 million in the first quarter, up 3% from $6.8 million in the prior year quarter. System revenue in the first quarter was $0.02 million, down from $0.2 million in the prior year quarter.\nGross margin in the quarter was $5.7 million, or 82% of revenue, consistent with the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses in the first quarter were $6.8 million, down from $7.6 million in the prior year quarter. The reduction in operating expenses reflects a significant decrease in general and administrative expense, increased investment in research and development, and stable sales and marketing expense. Operating loss in the first quarter was $(1.1) million, compared to $(1.9) million in the prior year first quarter. Net income for the first quarter was $1.4 million, compared to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding mark-to-market warrant revaluation, the Company would have reported a net loss of $(1.2) million for the 2018 first quarter compared to a net loss of $(2.0) million for the 2017 first quarter.\nCash burn for the first quarter was $2.0 million, compared to $2.7 million in the year ago first quarter and $0.8 million in the preceding fourth quarter. Cash burn in the first quarter was impacted by the timing of cash collections, as demonstrated by the significant increase in accounts receivable, which is expected to reverse in the second quarter.\nCash Balance and Liquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, Stereotaxis had cash and cash equivalents of $11.6 million, no debt, and $4.5 million in unused borrowing capacity on its revolving credit facility, for total net liquidity of $16.1 million.\nFull Year 2018 Expectations\nConsistent with the positive trend experienced in recent quarters, Stereotaxis expects continued year-over-year recurring revenue growth throughout 2018. For the full year 2018, expected recurring revenue of approximately $28 million would represent the highest annual level of recurring revenue the company has achieved in its history.\nStereotaxis expects to generate positive free cash flow in the second quarter of 2018. Operating expenses are expected to moderately increase in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by R&D spending on strategic innovation initiatives. While the benefits of these initiatives are unlikely to impact revenue in 2018, they are expected to meaningfully contribute in 2019 and beyond. Stereotaxis’ balance sheet will allow the Company to deliver on its commercial and innovation initiatives over the coming years and reach profitability without the need for additional financings.\nConference Call and Webcast\nStereotaxis will host a conference call and webcast today, May 14, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
