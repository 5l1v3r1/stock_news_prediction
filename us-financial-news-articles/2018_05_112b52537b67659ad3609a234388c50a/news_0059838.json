The float plan was first reported by the Australian Financial Review.\nAn e-mail and phone call to a Vitol spokeswoman in London did not receive an immediate response.\nViva Energy was built from Royal Dutch Shell’s ( RDSa.L ) former refinery and petrol station business in Australia, which Vitol bought for $2.6 billion in 2014. Vitol’s co-owners include Abu Dhabi Investment Corp.\nViva supplies around a quarter of Australia’s fuel, partly from the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, with import terminals, and about 1,000 Shell-branded petrol stations, with convenience stores run by Wesfarmers’ ( WES.AX ) Coles arm.\nThe company spun off the petrol station sites in 2016 into a property trust. Viva Energy REIT ( VVR.AX ) units have fallen from an issue price of A$2.20 in August 2016 to A$2.05, valuing the property trust at A$1.5 billion.\nThe move to list Viva Energy follows Vitol’s float of its African venture Vivo Energy in London, which debuted with a valuation of nearly 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in early May.\nVitol and its partners, however, scrapped an IPO of their European oil products venture, Varo Energy, in April, citing poor market conditions at the time.\nReporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-29T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:18:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
