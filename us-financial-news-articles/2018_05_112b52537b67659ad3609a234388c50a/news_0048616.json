It also eases trading, lending and capital rules for banks with less than $10 billion in assets.\nBut it does not weaken the top U.S. consumer watchdog created by Dodd-Frank that has been consistently attacked by Republicans who say it oversteps its mandate.\nTouching the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a red line for Democrats, according to lobbyists.\nWall Street is written on a building in New York's financial district, March 4, 2013. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Nor does the bill weaken Wall Street’s obligation to comply with the so-called Volcker Rule banning banks from making risky bets with their own money, or limit the ability of regulators to apply stricter rules to large institutions they deem critical to the financial system.\nSpeaking to Reuters on Tuesday, Democratic U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a key backer of the bill, said it aimed to fix problems with Dodd-Frank, not to weaken it.\n“That’s going to improve Dodd-Frank not diminish or begin to erode Dodd Frank,” she added.\nStill, some larger players secured a handful of niche provisions, most notably the nation’s largest custody banks.\nThe bill will allow the likes of BNY Mellon ( BK.N ), State Street Corp ( STT.N ) and Northern Trust to exclude customer deposits they place with central banks from a stringent capital calculation requirement, potentially offering major capital relief.\nThey were able to successfully differentiate themselves from the Wall Street titans like Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), in order to win over some skeptical lawmakers, said lobbyists.\nThe draft legislation also offers more favorable treatment for municipal bonds, a measure that analysts say is likely to help Citigroup Inc’s ( C.N ) bond-trading business and help lower financing costs on infrastructure projects nationwide.\nConsumer advocates and Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren have warned big banks will exploit these provisions, potentially increasing systemic risk.\nBut independent regulatory experts said the big banks were better off focusing their efforts on the regulatory agencies where Trump’s appointees are better-positioned to cut them material slack.\n“This is a legislative win for the banks, but the biggest deregulatory bang for the buck is changing the referees, not the rules,” said Dan Ryan, PwC Banking & Capital Markets Leader.\n“I don’t see any more financial services bills passing the Senate this year,” he said.\nReporting by Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T01:00:32.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
