We are committed to continuing this dialogue and getting this right,” a Google spokesperson told Reuters.\nCisco's action follows a CNN report cnnmon.ie/2jOhAXZ in April that said ads from over 300 companies, including Cisco, ran on extremist channels on YouTube.\nThe companies may have unknowingly helped finance some of these channels through the advertisements they paid for YouTube, according to the CNN report.\nCisco did not respond to a request seeking comment on the blog’s removal from its website.\nYouTube said in a report released last month that it had deleted about 5 million videos from its platform for content policy violations in last year’s fourth quarter before any viewers saw them.
