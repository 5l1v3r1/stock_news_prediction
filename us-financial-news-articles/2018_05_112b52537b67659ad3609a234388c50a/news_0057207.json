Which is why a Congressional hearing this week offered potentially good news to nonprofits whose donors are under political threat.\nAt a Tuesday Senate Appropriations hearing, Montana Republican Steve Daines asked Acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter whether the agency is considering the necessity of IRS 990 Schedule B. These are the forms that nonprofits must supply to the IRS listing donors who contribute more than $5,000. Schedule Bs are supposed to remain confidential, but AGs in New York and California have sought to require nonprofits to file them at the state level. Many Democrats see the form as a gift-wrapped list of donors to target, and a way to chill donations to conservative nonprofits.\nForeign Edition Podcast\nForeign Edition podcast: The U.S.-China trade truce and the Senate’s bipartisan push to bulk up national-security reviews. Foreign Edition Podcast Former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen left office having failed to tackle this (and so many other) problems. But Mr. Kautter acknowledged that he was “actively involved” along with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin at offering more donor protection. “I think for many organizations there frankly isn’t a requirement,” he said. “We don’t need that information to administer the tax laws in a fair and equitable way.”\nNonprofits would still be required to keep their donor details, and if the IRS or other authorities had valid reason to suspect fraud they could demand to see the records. But requiring nonprofits to provide names each year to partisan AGs or tax bureaucrats is an invitation to repeat the scandal of the Obama years when Lois Lerner and the IRS targeted conservative nonprofits. The sooner the end of Schedule B, the fewer assaults on free political speech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T09:00:45.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
