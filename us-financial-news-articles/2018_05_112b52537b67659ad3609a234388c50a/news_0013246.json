Its previous forecast was a range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share.\nNet income fell 9 percent to $846 million. Excluding one-time items, Celgene earned $2.05 per share in the first quarter ended March 31, while analysts were expecting $1.96 per share.\nRevenue rose 19.4 percent to $3.54 billion, topping estimates of $3.46 billion.
