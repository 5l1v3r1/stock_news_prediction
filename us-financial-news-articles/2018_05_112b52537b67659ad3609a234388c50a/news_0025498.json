These included potential partnering conversations regarding our novel IL-2 antibody program, as well as discussions with companies seeking to monetize future potential milestone and royalty revenue streams,” stated Jim Neal, Chief Executive Officer at XOMA. “While the number of opportunities continues to expand, we are focused on identifying a narrower set of high quality potential transactions. With a cash runway that spans multiple years and additional access to capital from our credit facility, we remain intensely focused on allowing our fully-funded programs to mature in the hands of our partners while expanding and diversifying our portfolio of potential future revenue streams to drive both near- and long-term value.”\nFinancial Results\nXOMA recorded total revenues of $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $4.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in R&D expenses was due primarily to reductions of $1.0 million in clinical trial costs, $0.8 million in consulting costs, $0.6 million in the allocation of facilities costs, $0.3 million in salaries and related expenses, $0.3 million in stock-based compensation, and $0.3 million in external manufacturing costs. The significant reduction in R&D spending year-over-year is a result of the execution of the Company’s royalty-aggregator business model that is designed to leverage its extensive portfolio of partnered programs and licensed technologies.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $5.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The minimal change in G&A expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was due primarily to decreases of $0.8 million in consulting services, $0.3 million in legal and audit fees, and $0.2 million in information technology costs, partially offset by increases of $0.7 million in stock compensation cost and $0.6 million in the allocation of facilities costs due to a greater proportion of general and administrative personnel after the Company’s restructuring activities.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.8 million. Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $16.3 million and included non-recurring and restructuring charges totaling $7.6 million.\nOn March 31, 2018, XOMA had cash and cash equivalents of $42.0 million. The Company ended December 31, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents of $43.5 million. The Company’s current cash and cash equivalents are expected to be sufficient to fund its operations for multiple years.\nIn May 2018, the Company announced a flexible $20 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. The credit facility is available to XOMA through March 2019 and may be extended to March 2020 upon certain conditions. The credit facility includes the opportunity to increase the borrowing capacity to an aggregate amount of $40 million.\nAbout XOMA Corporation\nXOMA has built a portfolio of over two dozen products that are licensed to and being developed by other biotech and pharmaceutical companies. The Company’s portfolio of partner-funded programs spans multiple stages of the drug development process and across various therapeutic areas. Many of these licenses are the result of XOMA’s pioneering efforts in the discovery and development of antibody therapeutics. The Company’s royalty-aggregator business model includes acquiring additional licenses to partner-funded programs. XOMA’s license portfolio has the potential to generate significant milestone payments and royalty revenue in the future.

These statements are based on assumptions that may not prove accurate, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry, including those related to the fact that our product candidates subject to out-license agreements are still being developed, and our licensees’ may require substantial funds to continue development which may not be available; we do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest; we may not be successful in entering into out-license agreements for our product candidates; if our therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, our third-party licensees will not be able to manufacture and market them. Other potential risks to XOMA meeting these expectations are described in more detail in XOMA's most recent filing on Form 10-K and in other SEC filings. Consider such risks carefully when considering XOMA's prospects.
