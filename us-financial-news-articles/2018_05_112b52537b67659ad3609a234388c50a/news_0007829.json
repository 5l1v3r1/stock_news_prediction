These key financial measures provide an additional view of our operational performance over the long-term and provide useful information that we use in order to maintain and grow our business.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is used to enhance the understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance. It is not meant to be considered in isolation from, as superior to, or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nDefinition\nHow We Use The Measure\nNet Service Revenues\n• Sum of professional service revenues and Net Insurance Service Revenues, or total revenues less insurance costs.\n• Provides a comparable basis of revenues on a net basis. Professional service revenues are represented net of client payroll costs whereas insurance service revenues are presented gross of insurance costs for financial reporting purposes.\n• Acts as the basis to allocate resources to different functions and evaluates the effectiveness of our business strategies by each business function.\n• Provides a measure, among others, used in the determination of incentive compensation for management.\nNet Insurance Service Revenues\n• Insurance service revenues less insurance costs.\n• Is a component of Net Service Revenues.\n• Provides a comparable basis of revenues on a net basis. Professional service revenues are represented net of client payroll costs whereas insurance service revenues are presented gross of insurance costs for financial reporting purposes. Promotes an understanding of our insurance services business by evaluating insurance service revenues net of WSE related costs which are substantially pass-through for the benefit of WSEs. Under GAAP, insurance service revenues and costs are recorded gross as we have latitude in establishing the price, service and supplier specifications.\n• We also sometimes refer to Net Insurance Service Margin, which is the ratio of Net Insurance Revenue to Insurance Service Revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n• Net income, excluding the effects of:\n- income tax provision,\n- interest expense,\n- depreciation,\n- amortization of intangible assets, and\n- stock-based compensation expense.\n• Provides period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis and an understanding as to how our management evaluates the effectiveness of our business strategies by excluding certain non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation recognized based on the estimated fair values. We believe these charges are not directly resulting from our core operations or indicative of our ongoing operations.\n• Enhances comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects.\n• Provides a measure, among others, used in the determination of incentive compensation for management.\n• We also sometimes refer to Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Service Revenues.\nAdjusted Net Income\n• Net income, excluding the effects of:\n- effective income tax rate (1) ,\n- stock-based compensation,\n- amortization of intangible assets,\n- non-cash interest expense (2) , and\n- the income tax effect (at our effective tax rate (1) ) of these pre-tax adjustments.\n• Provides information to our stockholders and board of directors to understand how our management evaluates our business, to monitor and evaluate our operating results, and analyze profitability of our ongoing operations and trends on a consistent basis by excluding certain non-cash charges as described above, debt payment premiums and our secondary offering costs as these are not directly resulting from our core operations or indicative of our ongoing operations.\n(1)\nWe have adjusted the non-GAAP effective tax rate to 26% for 2018 from 41% for 2017, due primarily to a decrease in the statutory rate from 35% to 21%. These non-GAAP effective tax rates exclude the income tax impact from stock-based compensation, changes in uncertain tax positions, and nonrecurring benefits or expenses from federal legislative changes.\n(2)\nNon-cash interest expense represents amortization and write-off of our debt issuance costs.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Total revenues to Net Service Revenues:\nThree Months Ended\nChange\nMarch 31,\nQ1 2018 vs\n2017\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\n$\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n861\n$\n808\n$\n53\n7\n%\nLess: Insurance costs\n641\n609\n32\n5\nNet Service Revenues\n$\n220\n$\n199\n$\n21\n11\n%\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Insurance service revenues to Net Insurance Service Revenues:\nThree Months Ended\nChange\nMarch 31,\nQ1 2018 vs\n2017\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\n$\n%\nInsurance service revenues\n$\n732\n$\n688\n$\n44\n6\n%\nLess: Insurance costs\n641\n609\n32\n5\nNet Insurance Service Revenues\n$\n91\n$\n79\n$\n12\n16\n%\nNet Insurance Service Revenues Margin (1)\n12\n%\n11\n%\n$\n—\n9\n(1)\nNet Insurance Service Revenue Margin is calculated as the ratio of Net Insurance Service Revenues (a non-GAAP measure) to Insurance Service Revenues (a GAAP measure).\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n54\n$\n29\nProvision for income taxes\n13\n16\nStock-based compensation\n9\n6\nInterest expense and bank fees\n6\n5\nDepreciation\n8\n6\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1\n1\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n91\n$\n63\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin (1)\n41\n%\n32\n%\n(1)\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to Net Service Revenues (a non-GAAP measure).\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of Net income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share - diluted:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n54\n$\n29\nEffective income tax rate adjustment\n(4)\n(2)\nStock-based compensation\n9\n6\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1\n1\nNon-cash interest expense\n1\n1\nIncome tax impact of pre-tax adjustments\n(3)\n(3)\nAdjusted Net Income\n$\n58\n$\n32\nGAAP Weighted average shares of common stock - diluted\n72,274,821\n70,913,970\nAdjusted Net Income per share - diluted\n$\n0.80\n$\n0.45\nCash Flows\nIn January 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which significantly impacted our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as changes in our restricted cash and cash equivalents balances are no longer included within operating cash activities.
