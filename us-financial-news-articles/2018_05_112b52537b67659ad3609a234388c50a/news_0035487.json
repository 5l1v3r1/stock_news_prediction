Two were rescued early last week.\n“The (last) miner’s body was trapped under one of many structures in the destroyed pit,” JSW, the European Union’s biggest coking coal producer, said in a statement.\nAbout 1,000 people were involved in the rescue effort.\nAbout 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were in a team drilling a new tunnel.\nThe quake of magnitude ranging from 3.5 to 4.0 was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials said.\nAround 83,000 people work in Poland’s coal mining sector. Fifteen people died in mining-related accidents in 2017.
