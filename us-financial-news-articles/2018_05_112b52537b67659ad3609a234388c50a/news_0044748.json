The union is demanding the introduction of new systems for dealing with base allocations, promotions, and annual leave.\n“If it is not possible to negotiate the introduction of such a seniority agreement for the benefit of our member pilots directly employed by Ryanair, it is our intention to ballot our member pilots employed by Ryanair for sanction for industrial action up to and including strike action,” the union wrote.\nIt said pilots complain that mandatory relocations cause family upheaval and they are demanding transparency so that members know why specific pilots are selected for transfers or why requests for transfers are denied.\nThe union wants the company to tell pilots why they are in the base they are in, the order in which their turn may come for a transfer, and why they received a particular annual leave allowance.\nIt also wants greater transparency around promotions and internal moves.\nFollowing a request for a comment, Ryanair said: “We don’t comment on our negotiations with our people.”\nIn the past it has said the Irish union was making demands not compatible with its “low-fares, high productivity model”.\nThe company will release its full-year results on May 21.
