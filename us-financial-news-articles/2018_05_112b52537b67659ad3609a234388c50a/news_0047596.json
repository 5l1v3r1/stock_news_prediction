French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian attends a meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, France, May 18, 2018. Christophe Petit-Tesson/Pool via Reuters\nJean-Yves Le Drian was speaking two days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would impose “the strongest sanctions in history” if Iran did not curb its regional influence and limit its ballistic missile programme.\n“We disagree with the method because this collection of sanctions, which will be set up against Iran, will not enable dialogue and on the contrary it will reinforce the conservatives and weaken President (Hassan) Rouhani. This posture risks endangering the region more,” Le Drian told France Inter radio.\nHe said Paris shared Washington’s concerns over Iran’s ballistic missile “frenzy” and regional hegemonic ambitions, but that the 2015 nuclear deal was the best chance of stopping Tehran developing a nuclear bomb.\nDeputy foreign ministers of the remaining parties to the accord - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - will meet their Iranian counterpart on Friday in Vienna.\nThe meeting will assess what can be done to keep the deal and circumvent extraterritorial American sanctions that are already impacting foreign business appetite for Iran.\nEuropean companies say they are worried about getting caught up in the new U.S. sanctions, given the extent of Washington’s global reach, and some have already started pulling out.\n“We have another problem which is the security of our companies and the capacity to give Iran the economic benefits that it can expect in return for giving up on nuclear weapons,” Le Drian said.\n“These (U.S.) sanctions are not acceptable. We can’t allow them to become legitimate.” Reporting by John Irish, Editing by Geert De Clercq, William Maclean", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:39:10.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
