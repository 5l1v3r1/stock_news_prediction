And then we're on set at 9 [a.m.]\"\nCorcoran explains that the sharks hear 10 to 12 pitches a day, each lasting anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes. There's a 45-minute break for lunch, and a half hour for makeup and hair touch-ups. Other than that, the star investors are glued to their seats.\n\"They ask us not to go to the bathroom if we can hold it,\" Corcoran reveals. \"I'm good at that.\"\nThe sharks are done for the day and head home around 7:30 or 8 p.m., and Corcoran decompresses afterwards with a little self-care.\n\"When I get back to the Beverly Hills Hotel, I take a hot bath and then I have a masseuse come and give me a massage,\" she says. \"I'm either snoring within a minute or I will not sleep because I'm too wired.\"\nCorcoran also reveals to The Cut that she thinks long and hard about the deals that go down in the tank, noting that the sharks spend their own, real money.\n\"When you say to an entrepreneur, 'I'll give you $200,000,' it's not just a line,\" she says. \"Two-hundred thousand dollars would put a kid through Ivy League school for four years. Would I rather put a kid through an Ivy League school, which is a kind of charity I do for myself, or would I rather give it to this entrepreneur? Are they worthy?\" she asks herself.\nOther stars of \"Shark Tank\" have also revealed how intense the on-set environment can be, especially for the entrepreneurs. There's even a psychiatrist on set who talks to the contestants before and after they make their pitches, CNBC reported.\n\"People can get very upset when the outcome is not what they anticipated,\" \"Shark Tank\" investor Kevin O'Leary previously told CNBC .\nFellow investor Robert Herjavec also highlighted how the deals are not only high-stakes for the entrepreneurs, but the sharks as well.\n\"We have a very powerful relationship with our own money so ya, it gets serious. [The] tension is very real,\" he wrote during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything.\"\nHowever, the sharks also have their fair share of fun on-set, too. Guest investor Bethenny Frankel previously shared with CNBC Make It her and investor Mark Cuban enjoy jamming out to hip-hop between shots.\n\"In the breaks, they are playing full-on, old school hip hop,\" says Frankel. \"Mark Cuban and I are rapping and dancing and having the best time.\"\nDon't miss: 'Shark Tank': Here's what happened when Mark Cuban kept interrupting guest judge Bethenny Frankel\nLike this story?
