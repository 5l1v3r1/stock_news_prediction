(AP) â€” The Latest on illegal marijuana on public lands in California (all times local):\n2:15 p.m.\nThe top U.S. prosecutor for northeastern California says he'll prioritize black market marijuana rather than going after the state's newly legal pot market.\nU.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said Tuesday that there is so much illegal weed being grown on federal lands and trafficked to other states that he doesn't have the resources to target the world's largest legal recreational marijuana market.\nFederal law still bans pot, but Scott says he'll focus on interstate trafficking, organized crime and damage to U.S. public lands.\nThe Trump administration appointee announced that U.S., state and local authorities will target the illegal grows with $2.5 million in federal money.\nThe money is driven by concerns about an alarming increase in the use of a banned and highly toxic pesticide at illegal marijuana farms hidden on public land in California.\n9:02 a.m.\nResearchers and federal authorities are finding what they say is an alarming increase in the use of a powerful pesticide at illegal marijuana farms hidden on public land in California.\nThey're finding the pesticide residue in marijuana illegally grown in California but mostly destined for Midwestern and Eastern states.\nResearcher Mourad Gabriel tells The Associated Press that his team found the highly toxic pesticide Carbofuran at 72 percent of grow sites last year, up from 15 percent in 2012.\nNearly a third of pot plants tested positive for the pesticide.\nGabriel says the pesticide is so powerful that less than a teaspoon can kill a 300-pound bear.\nFederal and state authorities are announcing Tuesday that they will target the illegal grows with $2.5 million in federal money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-30T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T10:56:00.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
