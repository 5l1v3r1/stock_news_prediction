Charges against him were later dismissed.\nHis attorney Joann Rezzo says the firing violated state labor law, which prohibits employers from considering arrest records that don't result in a conviction in a decision to terminate an employee.\nAn Allstate spokeswoman says the company disagrees with the verdict and plans to appeal.\nInformation from: The San Diego Union-Tribune, http://www.utsandiego.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-05T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T23:59:36.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
