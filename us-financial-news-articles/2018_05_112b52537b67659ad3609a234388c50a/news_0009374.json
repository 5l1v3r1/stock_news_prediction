(NYSE: MTD) today announced first quarter results for 2018. Provided below are the highlights:\nSales in local currency increased 5% in the quarter compared with the prior year. Reported sales increased 11% as currency increased sales growth by 6% in the quarter. Net earnings per diluted share as reported (EPS) were $3.58, compared with $3.48 in the prior-year period. Adjusted EPS was $3.74, an increase of 12% over the prior-year amount of $3.34. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure, and we have included a reconciliation to EPS on the last page of the attached schedules.\nFirst Quarter Results\nOlivier Filliol, Officer, stated, \"Sales growth in the quarter came in as expected, and was impacted by the excellent sales growth in the prior-year period. China, in particular, had very strong broad-based sales growth in the quarter. This solid sales growth drove another quarter of strong Adjusted EPS growth.\"\nEPS in the quarter was $3.58, compared with the prior-year amount of $3.48. Adjusted EPS was $3.74, an increase of 12% over the prior-year amount of $3.34.\nSales were $660.8 million, a 5% increase in local currency sales, compared with $594.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Reported sales increased 11% as currency increased sales growth by 6% in the quarter. Compared with the prior year, local currency sales increased 5% in the Americas and 10% in Asia/Rest of World. Sales declined 1% in local currency in Europe. Adjusted operating income amounted to $139.5 million, a 10% increase from the prior-year amount of $126.5 million. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to earnings before taxes is provided in the attached schedules.\nOutlook\nThe Company said that, based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth in 2018 will be approximately 6%. This sales growth is expected to result in\nAdjusted EPS in the range of $20.10 to $20.25, which reflects growth of 14% to 15%. This compares with previous guidance of Adjusted EPS in the range of $19.95 to $20.15.\nManagement anticipates that local currency sales growth in the second quarter 2018 will be approximately 6%, and Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.60, an increase of 16% to 17%.\nWhile the Company has provided an outlook for Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for EPS as it would require an estimate of non-recurring items, which are not yet known. The Company noted in making its outlook that economic uncertainty remains in certain regions of the world and market conditions are subject to change.\nConclusion\nFilliol concluded, \"Our outlook for 2018 remains promising despite facing difficult comparisons given our very strong performance last year. We acknowledge there is more uncertainty in the global economy compared with a few months ago but overall demand remains solid. We believe we are well positioned for continued share gains. Our Spinnaker sales and marketing programs, new product launches and continued investments in sales activities are generating returns. Our margin and productivity programs complement our sales growth initiatives and will yield continued earnings growth and funds for additional investments for growth.\"\nOther Matters\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its quarterly results today (Thursday, May 3) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
