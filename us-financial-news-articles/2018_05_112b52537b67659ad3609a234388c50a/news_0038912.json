Since 2000, he has been the Director of the McCarthy Institute for IP and Technology Law at the University of San Francisco. He consults with some of the world’s leading companies and serves as an expert witness in trademark and IP cases.\nAt GGU, Franklyn has a joint appointment between the School of Law and the Ageno School of Business. This joint appointment will allow students to take classes that integrate legal and business principles. His hire adds to an already robust IP law program, which hosts the Intellectual Property Law Center (IPLC) led by Professor William Gallagher. The IPLC publishes the IP Law Book Review and convenes regular conferences on the subject. GGU’s IP Law program is one of the country’s leading centers for IP law and graduates go on to work at some of today’s leading technology companies and law firms.\n“We are thrilled to add David Franklyn to our faculty,” said President David Fike. “His hire fulfills a commitment to our students to initiate programs based on market demands and to expand our partnerships with the business, technology, and legal communities.”\n“I am so grateful for the opportunity to join Golden Gate University at this critical time in its storied history,” said Franklyn. “GGU has been providing educational and cultural opportunities to students going back to 1901. Its history and San Francisco’s history are intertwined and so are our futures.”\n“The appointment of Professor Franklyn to the law faculty adds world-class expertise and knowledge to our curriculum, particularly in the fields of trademark and technology law.

I believe he will be a superb addition to the Golden Gate University tenured faculty and an invaluable asset for students seeking careers in the tech industry.”\nFranklyn’s hire is the latest step in an ongoing transformation that has reshaped Golden Gate University and brought the school widespread praise and recognition.

Fike in 2015, GGU has restructured the administration, hiring new administrative and academic leaders, including deans for the Ageno School of Business and the School of Law.\nIn 2016, GGU hired Gordon Swartz as Dean of the Ageno School of Business and under his leadership has launched market-responsive programs including a Master’s in Business Analytics and a revamped Executive MBA.
