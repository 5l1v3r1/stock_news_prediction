The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Plan Fund’s Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Plan Fund will distribute all available investment income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, each Plan Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its shareholders in order to maintain a level distribution.\nThe Plan Funds’ estimated sources of the distributions paid as of April 30, 2018 and for their current fiscal year are as follows:\nEstimated Allocations as of April 30, 2018 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BCX 1 $0.051600 $0.007300 (14%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.044300 (86%) BDJ $0.046700 $0.008139 (17%) $0.007119 (15%) $0.031442 (68%) $0 (0%) BGR 1 $0.077600 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.077600 (100%) BGY $0.038000 $0.022370 (59%) $0.015630 (41%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) BME 1 $0.2 $0.010930 (5%) $0.043591 (22%) $0.145479 (73%) $0 (0%) BOE 1 $0.078000 $0.032329 (41%) $0.045671 (59%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) BUI 1 $0.121000 $0.018126 (15%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.102874 (85%) CII 1 $0.082800 $0.005757 (7%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.077043 (93%) BST $0.130000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.130000 (100%) $0 (0%) EGF 1 $0.041000 $0.024551 (60%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.016449 (40%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through April 30, 2018 Fund Distribution Net Investment\nIncome\nNet Realized\nShort-Term Gains\nNet Realized\nLong-Term Gains\nReturn of Capital BCX 1 $0.206400 $0.058557 (28%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.147843 (72%) BDJ $0.186800 $0.047582 (25%) $0.007118 (4%) $0.132100 (71%) $0 (0%) BGR 1 $0.310400 $0.062775 (20%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.247625 (80%) BGY $0.152000 $0.065542 (43%) $0.086458 (57%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) BME 1 $0.8 $0.041696 (5%) $0.043591 (5%) $0.589084 (74%) $0.125629 (16%) BOE 1 $0.312000 $0.106610 (34%) $0.157852 (51%) $0.035763 (11%) $0.011775 (4%) BUI 1 $0.484000 $0.111420 (23%) $0.055747 (12%) $0 (0%) $0.316833 (65%) CII 1 $0.331200 $0.048052 (15%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.283148 (85%) BST $0.520000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.520000 (100%) $0 (0%) EGF 1 $0.123000 $0.083417 (68%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.039583 (32%) 1 The Plan Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Plan Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Plan Fund’s net asset value per share.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Plan Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Plan Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: Fund Average annual total\nreturn (in relation to\nNAV) for the 5-year\nperiod ending on\n3/31/2018\nAnnualized current\ndistribution rate\nexpressed as a\npercentage of NAV as\nof 3/31/2018\nCumulative total return\n(in relation to NAV) for\nthe fiscal year through\n3/31/2018\nCumulative fiscal\nyear distributions\nas a percentage\nof NAV as of\n3/31/2018\nBCX 1.20% 6.14% (5.86)% 1.53% BDJ 9.38% 5.81% (2.71)% 1.45% BGR (2.92)% 6.08% (6.13)% 1.52% BGY 3.70% 6.80% (3.51)% 1.70% BME 13.88% 6.83% (0.01)% 1.71% BOE 6.00% 7.50% (4.04)% 1.88% BUI 7.34% 7.17% (2.33)% 1.79% CII 11.57% 5.95% (1.92)% 1.49% BST* 20.88% 5.27% 7.99% 1.32% EGF 1.36% 3.59% (0.88)% 0.90% *Portfolio launched within the past 5 years; the performance and distribution rate information presented for this Fund reflects data from inception to 3/31/2018 .\nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about a Plan Fund’s investment performance from the amount of the Plan Fund’s current distributions or from the terms of a Plan Fund’s Plan.\nAbout BlackRock\nBlackRock helps investors build better financial futures.
