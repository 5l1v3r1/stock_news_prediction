The Waratahs’ scrum then disintegrated under pressure near the line to concede a penalty try and give the hosts the lead 12 minutes from the finish.\nFlyhalf Bernard Foley missed a penalty kick with four minutes left that would have given the Waratahs the lead, and the Crusaders held on to claim the win. SUNWOLVES 63 QUEENSLAND REDS 28\nThe Sunwolves picked up their first win of the season on Saturday with a rousing 63-28 victory over the Queensland Reds in the Japanese capital.\nIn the final match to be held in Tokyo this season — the last two Sunwolves home games are in Hong Kong and Singapore — flyhalf Hayden Parker scored 36 points and winger Hosea Saumaki had a hat-trick of tries to lead their team to victory.\nTries from Parker and lock Grant Hattingh, as well as five penalties, gave the Sunwolves a 15-point lead at halftime and Jamie Joseph’s men did not relent after the break.\nThe Sunwolves piled on the points in the second half with three scores from Saumaki and a penalty try. AUCKLAND BLUES 15 WELLINGTON HURRICANES 36\nThe red-hot Wellington Hurricanes recorded their ninth straight win with a bonus point victory over the Auckland Blues at Eden Park on Friday, extending the home side’s winless streak against New Zealand opposition to 16 matches.\nTries from hooker Ricky Riccitelli, loose forward Gareth Evans, fullback Nehe Milner-Skudder, lock Sam Lousi and centre Matt Proctor were enough to see off a spirited Blues challenge and send the Hurricanes to the top of the standings.\nThe Blues, who had tries from centre Orbyn Leger and prop Ofa Tuungafasi either side of halftime, played plenty of enterprising rugby but were unable to match the execution of the Hurricanes at key moments.\nThe Hurricanes lead the Canterbury Crusaders by three points in the New Zealand conference having played a match fewer than the reigning champions, who would be expected to return to the top after they play the New South Wales Waratahs on Saturday.
