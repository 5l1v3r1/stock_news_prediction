Also, have conversations with people in your network with similar backgrounds.\nThese tools can help by measuring your pay against your experience and position and comparing it to the wages of other people in your field and give you a starting point for negotiations with your boss.\nBe realistic Erwin advises employees to begin with a monetary range in mind. But be realistic, he added: \"It's probably going to be hard to go in and ask for $20,000, but easier to get $5,000.\"\nIf even that seems unachievable, consider lobbying for a boost in benefits instead, such as reimbursement for transportation or child care, and more paid vacation.\n\"That will put more money in your pocket in the long run,\" Erwin said.\nIf at first you don't succeed… Don't be discouraged if you hear \"no\" at the outset. Establish a time frame for when you can revisit the topic, Erwin said.\nIn the interim, work on how you can demonstrate your achievements. \"Build yourself a business plan and come back in six months,\" he said.\nMost companies make salary adjustments in the back half of the year, Erwin added, which makes this a good time to speak up.\n\"If you start the discussion now, that's a good way to plant the seed,\" he said.\n\"On the Money\" airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 a.m. ET.
