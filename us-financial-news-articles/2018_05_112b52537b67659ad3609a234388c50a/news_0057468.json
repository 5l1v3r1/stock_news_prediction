These digests will include suggestions to participate in pitches and works in progress.\nThe launch will be in January 2019 and employees will join on a voluntary basis, added Publicis, which is the world’s third-biggest advertising group and whose rivals include WPP ( WPP.L ) and Omnicom ( OMC.N ).\nPublicis did not say how much the initiative had cost and declined to provide an estimate of the productivity gains it might be seeking to achieve with this tool.
