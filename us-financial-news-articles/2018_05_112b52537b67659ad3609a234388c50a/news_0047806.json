Soon I will tell.”\nThe 19-year-old Slovenian star told Eurohoops.net last week that he was not yet sure about his NBA plans, saying, “We have yet to make this decision. Perhaps after the season.”\nDoncic has until June 11 to withdraw from the NBA draft, which will be held June 21 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\nThe 6-foot-8 point forward is widely considered a top-five prospect and a possible contender to go first overall to the Phoenix Suns, who won last week’s lottery. Newly hired Suns head coach Igor Kokoskov coached Doncic and the Slovenian national team last year as it won the first European Championship in the country’s history.\nThe Suns are also expected to consider Arizona center DeAndre Ayton and Duke forward Marvin Bagley III, among others, and general manager Ryan McDonough said earlier this week he is open to a trade.\nIf Doncic doesn’t go first overall, ESPN reports the “growing consensus among NBA decision-makers” at Sunday’s championship game is that the Sacramento Kings (picking second) and the Atlanta Hawks (third) would pass on the Slovenian for a state-side talent, making it possible Doncic could be available to the Memphis Grizzlies at No. 4 or Dallas Mavericks at No. 5.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T04:38:52.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
