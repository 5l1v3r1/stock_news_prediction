Lava advances along a street near a fissure in Leilani Estates, on Kilauea Volcano's lower East Rift Zone, Hawaii, the U.S., May 5, 2018.

More recently in 2014, lava threatened the nearby Puna district and the town of Pahoa.\nJessica Gauthier, 47, a realtor in Leilani Estates, said the eruption of Kilauea, about 12 miles (19 km) distant, was a reality check for new residents. A new fissure spraying lava fountains as high as about 230 feet (70 m), according to United States Geological Survey, is shown from Luana Street in Leilani Estates subdivision on Kilauea Volcano's lower East Rift Zone in Hawaii, U.S., May 5, 2018.

As the lava finds a preferred route, some vents are expected to close, putting pressure on others and shooting magma up to 1,000 feet (305 m) into the air. On Saturday it reached heights of 230 feet.\nSome residents saw eruptions as inevitable and said if Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, wanted the land back, then she would take it.\nWilson, who grew up in Springfield, Missouri, was less philosophical. He has been trying to rescue his possessions before they are torched.\nHe was forced back on Sunday when he saw smoke coming from cracks in the road on the approach to his house.

So I’m no stranger to disasters, but this is something else,” said Wilson. “This is crazy.” Reporting by Terray Sylvester; Writing by Andrew Hay in New Mexico; Editing by Hugh Lawson", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T11:22:38.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
