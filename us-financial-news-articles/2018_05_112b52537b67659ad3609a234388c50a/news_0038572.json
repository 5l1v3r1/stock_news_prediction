(TSX: ENB) (NYSE: ENB) (Enbridge) today announced it has made, on behalf of itself and certain of its wholly owned US subsidiaries, separate all-share proposals to the respective boards of directors of its sponsored vehicles, Spectra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: SEP), Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EEP), Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C (NYSE: EEQ) and Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc. (TSX: ENF), to acquire, in separate combination transactions, all of the outstanding equity securities of those sponsored vehicles not beneficially owned by Enbridge.\nThe proposed exchange ratios reflect a value for all of the publicly held equity securities of the sponsored vehicles of CAN$11.4 billion, or 272 million Enbridge common shares, if all are completed on the terms offered based on the closing price of Enbridge's common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on May 16, 2018. The transactions as proposed are expected to be approximately neutral to Enbridge's three-year financial guidance and positive to Enbridge's post-2020 outlook due to tax and other synergies.\nIn December 2017, Enbridge outlined its 2018-2020 plan that emphasized several priorities, one of which was to assess the potential streamlining and simplification of its corporate structure. Enbridge has a long history of maximizing shareholder value through strong operational performance and efficient capital management, including the sponsorship of its high-payout investment vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. The recent FERC income tax allowance policy reversal and the regulatory rate impact from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), as well as the market reactions across the MLP landscape, have challenged the standalone viability of SEP, EEP and EEQ as reliable and cost effective sources of capital to support Enbridge's growth. Similarly, ENF has lost its cost of capital advantage and is no longer an effective funding vehicle.\nAfter evaluating options to mitigate the effects of these recent actions and the resulting capital markets' response, and to advance Enbridge's priority to simplify and streamline its corporate structure, Enbridge believes the proposals are strategically and economically attractive to each of the sponsored vehicles and to Enbridge shareholders. Enbridge expects to discuss the merits of each of the separate proposals with the respective independent committees of each vehicle, upon formation of these committees.\nIf the transactions are completed, all equity security holders of Enbridge and its sponsored vehicles would benefit from holding a single security that provides direct ownership in the largest energy infrastructure company in North America with best-in-class assets, a low-risk profile and attractive growth. These transactions offer several benefits to all equity security holders including a simplified structure, improved credit profile, enhanced trading liquidity and more sustainable dividends.\nUnder the newly changed FERC tax policy, holding certain interstate pipelines in MLP structures is highly unfavorable to unitholders and is no longer advantageous for Enbridge or the U.S. MLPs. The combination of this changed policy and the negative capital markets reaction has impaired the MLP structure for Enbridge's interstate pipelines. Without this restructuring, and in light of the challenging capital markets conditions and the resulting impact on MLP cash flows, Enbridge's view is that EEP and SEP will face the cessation of distribution growth, and compromised distribution outlook to unitholders as early as 2019. Similarly, Enbridge's view is that ENF's uncompetitive cost of capital will inhibit future dividend growth.\nBenefits and Considerations for Enbridge Shareholders\nThe roll-up of the sponsored vehicles simplifies Enbridge's corporate and capital structure, resulting in all of the core liquids and gas pipeline assets being held under one effective and streamlined entity, Enbridge. The assets held by the sponsored vehicles are already managed and operated by Enbridge's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and consolidated for financial purposes by Enbridge. Therefore, a broad simplification is achieved by eliminating four publicly traded vehicles while increasing the Company's ownership in its core businesses and further enhancing its industry-leading, low-risk profile. The buy-in of SEP and EEP addresses Enbridge's risks related to the FERC MLP tax allowance elimination and the continuing deterioration in the MLP equity marketplace. The restructuring also increases transparency and ease of investing in Enbridge's best-in-class pipeline and utility assets by reducing the complexity that exists today. The consolidated EBITDA of Enbridge is expected to remain unchanged following the transactions. We expect Enbridge's credit profile will be enhanced by eliminating sponsored vehicle public distributions. In addition, the roll-up of the sponsored vehicles will create opportunities to further enhance Enbridge's credit profile by eliminating the structural subordination of certain debt within the Enbridge family.\nAll of these benefits would be derived with an approximate neutral impact on Enbridge's three-year financial guidance, assuming each of the transactions occur on terms consistent with these proposals.\nBenefits and Considerations for SEP Unitholders\nThe recent FERC announcements and the regulatory rate impact from the TCJA have negatively affected SEP. Enbridge believes that both the direct consequences of the reversal in FERC policy, as well as the adverse market effects, have weakened SEP's value proposition and have made it an ineffective and unreliable standalone financing vehicle to support Enbridge's growth. These adverse impacts are compounded by the challenge SEP would face in mitigating the new FERC tax allowance policy while pursuing its regulatory and rate strategy. As a consequence, Enbridge believes that, on a standalone basis, SEP will face the cessation of distribution growth, and potential reductions in cash distribution to unitholders as early as 2019.\nEnbridge believes the proposed transaction mitigates the significant risk SEP faces in its current MLP form as it advances its regulatory and rate case strategies. The proposed restructuring addresses the risk to the cessation of distribution growth or a potential reduction in SEP's distributions. Additionally, Enbridge's proposal offers SEP unitholders a security with enhanced trading liquidity and provides direct ownership in North America's largest energy infrastructure company with diverse, safe and reliable cash flow generation supporting attractive dividend growth.\nUnder today's restructuring proposal:\nSEP unitholders will receive 1.0123 common shares of Enbridge per SEP unit, representing a value of US$33.10 per SEP unit based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares on the NYSE on May 16, 2018; equivalent to the closing price of SEP's common units on the NYSE on such date. Enbridge believes that the proposed exchange ratio for SEP reflects an appropriate value for SEP units based on its stand-alone value. The proposed merger transaction will be subject to the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding SEP common units.\nBenefits and Considerations for EEP Unitholders and EEQ Shareholders\nThe recent FERC announcements and the regulatory rate impact from the TCJA have negatively affected EEP and EEQ. Enbridge believes that both the direct consequences of the reversal in FERC policy which, as previously announced, reduces EEP's distributable cash flow (DCF), as well as the adverse market effects, have weakened EEP's and EEQ's credit profile and they are now ineffective and unreliable standalone financing vehicles to support Enbridge's growth. To sustain investment grade credit ratings, EEP would have to raise considerable external equity at a disadvantaged cost of capital, and also substantially cut its distribution. Enbridge projects that these actions would otherwise have to occur in early 2019.\nEnbridge's proposal offers EEP unitholders and EEQ shareholders a security with enhanced trading liquidity and provides direct ownership in North America's largest energy infrastructure company with diverse, safe and reliable cash flow generation supporting attractive dividend growth.\nUnder today's restructuring proposal:\nEEP unitholders will receive 0.3083 common shares of Enbridge per EEP unit, representing a value of US$10.08 per EEP unit based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares on the NYSE on May 16, 2018; equivalent to the closing price of EEP's common units on the NYSE on such date. EEQ shareholders will receive 0.2887 common shares of Enbridge per EEQ share, representing a value of US$9.44 per EEQ share based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares on the NYSE on May 16, 2018; equivalent to the closing price of EEQ's common shares on the NYSE on such date. Enbridge believes that the proposed exchange ratio for each of EEP and EEQ reflects an appropriate value for their respective securities based on their stand-alone values. The proposed EEP merger transaction is subject to the approval of holders of 66⅔% of the outstanding EEP units. The proposed EEQ merger transaction is subject to the approval of holders of a majority of the outstanding EEQ listed shares, other than Enbridge and its affiliates.\nBenefits and Considerations for ENF Shareholders\nEnbridge believes ENF's ability to cost-effectively raise capital has deteriorated and that ENF is no longer a cost-efficient sponsored vehicle. Previously, ENF could acquire assets that generate steady cash flow from Enbridge in a manner that was beneficial to both ENF and Enbridge shareholders. However, that is no longer the case. After ENF's current slate of organic growth projects are completed in 2020, its uncompetitive cost of capital will jeopardize its ability to benefit from future organic growth opportunities and inhibit future dividend growth.\nIf the transaction is successful, buying in ENF, along with the other entities in the underlying structure, will advance Enbridge's simplification strategy and allow ENF shareholders to derive the benefits of a more streamlined Enbridge structure, and to participate in Liquids Pipeline growth within a more diversified asset base. Trading liquidity will be meaningfully enhanced, particularly for institutional holders. Importantly, by exchanging ENF shares for Enbridge common shares, Enbridge believes ENF shareholders will be better positioned for dividend sustainability and growth beyond 2020.\nUnder today's restructuring proposal:\nENF shareholders will receive 0.7029 common shares of Enbridge per ENF share, representing a value of CAN$29.38 per ENF share, based on the closing price of Enbridge common shares on the TSX on May 16, 2018, reflecting a 5% premium to the closing price of ENF's common shares on the TSX on May 16, 2018. Enbridge believes that the proposed exchange ratio for ENF reflects an attractive premium to its stand-alone value. The proposed plan of arrangement transaction is subject to the approval (i) by holders of 66⅔% of the outstanding ENF shares present in person or by proxy at a meeting of shareholders, and (ii) by holders of a majority of the ENF shares present in person or by proxy at a meeting of shareholders, other than Enbridge, its affiliates and other insiders.\nOther Information\nEnbridge's offers are non-binding and have been approved by the board of directors of Enbridge and certain of its wholly owned US subsidiaries. Before Enbridge or any of such subsidiaries would be in a position to enter into any definitive agreement with any of the sponsored vehicles to effect a proposed transaction, such agreement would need to be reviewed and approved by the board of directors of Enbridge and such subsidiaries. These offers are not conditional on each other, except that the consummation of a transaction involving EEQ will be conditioned on the consummation of a transaction involving EEP.\nThe consummation of each proposed transaction will be subject to customary closing conditions, including standard regulatory notifications and approvals. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be consummated.\nBofA Merrill Lynch and Scotiabank are acting as financial advisors to Enbridge. McCarthy Tetrault LLP, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Vinson & Elkins LLP are acting as Canadian, U.S. and tax legal advisors, respectively to Enbridge.\nConference Call Information\nEnbridge will host a conference call and webcast on May 17, 2018 at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time (5:00 a.m. Mountain Time) to discuss the proposed restructuring.
