Last year’s output was around 20,000 tonnes, he added.\nHuayou last year decided to build a second cobalt refinery in Kolwezi in the south of the DRC, the world’s biggest cobalt producer, where it also has mining assets. That plant will have annual cobalt hydroxide production capacity of 5,000 tonnes.\nThe new plant is currently undergoing test production and will launch properly “very soon,” contributing to the company’s increased cobalt production this year, Chen added.\nCobalt is a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries used in electric vehicles to mobile phones, and Chinese companies like Huayou have already secured a large chunk of supply from the DRC.\nHuayou is looking to invest in new mining projects in the country, Chen said.\n“If there are better opportunities, we will definitely be willing,” he told Reuters, without specifying which assets the company would go for.
