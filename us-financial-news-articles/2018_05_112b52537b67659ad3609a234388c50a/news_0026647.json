TRADES AND TENDERS\nIn physical markets, India’s Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation is expected to pick a supplier before the weekend for its tender seeking seven cargoes for June 2018 to March 2019.\nShell is to fill the majority of Mexico’s demand for six cargoes for delivery across May and June. Argentina’s state-run Enarsa sought eight cargoes over July-August.\nTrinidad’s Point Fortin LNG Exports likely awarded its tender to sell a June 8-loading cargo this week.\nTraders also awaited the results of sell tenders by Angola for cargoes loading in May and June, respectively.\nKuwait Petroleum Corp sought a June cargo, paying an estimated $7.80 per mmBtu, according to traders.\nMeanwhile, Exxon Mobil’s Papua New Guinea export plant has offered two cargoes for May and June.
