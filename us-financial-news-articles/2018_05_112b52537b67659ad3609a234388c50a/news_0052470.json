REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Currency investors were burned by the Bank of England’s decision to keep interest rates on hold last month after signalling a rate hike was on the cards until a few weeks earlier.\nThat has left funds wary of pushing sterling sharply either way without any firm data to back those moves.\n“Markets will take what the Bank of England is saying with a pinch of salt after their strange communication last month,” said Esther Maria Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.\nIn late afternoon trading, sterling GBP=D3 gave back most of its earlier gains and was broadly flat on the day at $1.3432.\nBoE policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe told the Treasury Committee of parliament that policy rates are set to rise 25 to 50 basis points every year over three years, a comment initially interpreted by markets as supportive for the pound GBP=D3 .\n“His comments are helping sterling but it is important to remember that everything policymakers say today is conditional on the incoming data and that needs to be kept in mind to correctly assess the policy outlook,” said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING Bank in London.\nAgainst the dollar, sterling first extended gains and rose 0.4 percent to the day’s highs at $1.3492.\nIt also climbed 0.2 percent to a one-week high against the euro EURGBP=D3 at 87.60 pence but later trimmed some gains.\nInterest rate markets were broadly unchanged by the relatively optimistic comments, with the probability of another quarter point rate hike holding at around 90 percent by the end of the year, the same levels as earlier this week.\nGains were capped before important data on the British economy due out this week, including inflation on Wednesday and the gross domestic product figure on Friday.\nThese will be scrutinised by investors to gauge whether the BoE might tighten monetary policy as early as August.\nTuesday’s rise in the pound came after concerns over the post-divorce relationship Britain negotiates with the European Union weighed heavily on the currency last week.\nAdding to the uncertainty, lawmakers from Prime Minister Theresa May’s governing Conservative Party are reported to be preparing for a snap Autumn election amid fears that the Brexit deadlock will become insurmountable.\nBut the biggest reason for sterling’s recent fall has been a drastic shift in expectations of when the BoE will raise rates.\n“Until a solution emerges on the Brexit front, a rate hike is the only things that could support sterling temporarily,” Commerzbank strategists said in a note.\n“Without it, sterling remains unattractive.”\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-22T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:04:21.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
