The soil bulk collapsed and killed people,” said miner Min Naung, 30.\nMany jade mines are owned by companies linked to leaders of the previous military government, ethnic armies and Chinese firms. Workers, many of them migrants from elsewhere in Myanmar, toil long hours in dangerous conditions and for little pay.\n“To safeguard people’s lives and to reduce the risk of landslides, companies should follow the mining law while digging,” said Chit Kaung, administrator of Wai Hka, where most of its 50,000 population work in mines.\nEnvironmental advocacy group Global Witness put the value of jade production in Myanmar at around $31 billion in 2014. Experts say the majority of stones are smuggled to China.\nFighting between government forces and an ethnic armed group in Kachin has displaced more than 5,000 people since early April, the United Nations says.
