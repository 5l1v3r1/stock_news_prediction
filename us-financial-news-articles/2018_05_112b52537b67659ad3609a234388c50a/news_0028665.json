Under McCall, the group wants to improve the way it sells its shows to other platforms to grow those revenues further.\nMcCall said that a “strategic refresh” was progressing well and she would provide investors with an update at the group’s half-year results in July.\nThe former boss of easyJet McCall has said ITV creates great shows in a market where broadcasters and online players such as Netflix are battling for content. But she has said it needs to make sure it is paid the appropriate amount by platforms for its content made by its studios.\nAnalysts have welcomed the new focus but the shares are still highly sensitive to any change in advertising trends. Net ad revenue fell 5 percent in 2017.
