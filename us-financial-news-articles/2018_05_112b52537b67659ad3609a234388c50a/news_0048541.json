REUTERS/Thomas Peter Numerous other news organizations, including Reuters, had also sought to cover the shutdown of the North’s nuclear test site but were denied invitations.\nSouth Korea expressed regret that its journalists had not been included after earlier being invited.\n“Nonetheless, the government pays due attention to the fact that the North’s pledge to dismantle the Punggyeri nuclear test site, an initial measure for denuclearisation, is proceeding as planned, and expects that such action to lead to the successful hosting of the North Korea-U.S. summit,” South Korea’s Unification Ministry said in a statement.\nLast month, Moon and Kim held a historic summit at the Demilitarised Zone separating the two countries.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\nCNN's Will Ripley talks to the media after arriving at the aiport to board a plane to North Korea in Beijing, China, May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Peter North Korea has rejected unilateral disarmament and given no indication that it is willing to go beyond statements of broad support for the concept of universal denuclearisation.\nIt has said in previous, failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States provides security guarantees by removing its 28,500 troops from South Korea and withdraws its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and neighboring Japan.\nAdditional reporting by Christine Kim in SEOUL; Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Paul Tait and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T05:53:45.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
