He said Slack, which remains privately held, is in a multiyear process of preparing to go public. Butterfield ruled out an IPO this year.", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/slack-passes-3-million-paid-users-but-wont-go-public-in-2018-ceo-says-2018-05-08"], "published": "2018-05-09T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T21:12:29.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
