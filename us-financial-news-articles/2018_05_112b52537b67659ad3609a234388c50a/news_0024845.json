Provisioning costs should fall to 2 percent this financial year, he said, from 4.39 percent last year.\nAfter adding 100.43 billion rupees of bad loans in the March quarter, Union Bank’s gross non-performing loan ratio widened 270 basis points from three months earlier to 15.73 percent.\nRai said 50-60 percent of the bad loans added in the March quarter were due to the new central bank rules.\nThe bank aims to increase lending by 7-8 percent in the current financial year, he said.\nAhead of the results, Union Bank shares closed 4.7 percent down in a Mumbai market that ended 0.2 percent lower. $1 = 67.3075 Indian rupees Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy; Additional reporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:12:45.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
