( GD.N ), Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ), Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ), Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) and Boeing Co. ( BA.N )\nTreasury and the IRS sided with the contractors and exempted entities with more than 50 percent of annual revenue derived from contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense or other U.S. intelligence or security agencies.\nThe IRS said in a March 30 notice that they had sought input on a possible national security exemption when crafting the original rule. Subsequent consultations with the Defense Department and Treasury prompted the exemption, the IRS said.\nBut, in a letter this week to the Treasury, the FACT Coalition, which represents 100 groups including organizations on tax fairness, government ethics and international poverty, said the agencies had provided no “reasoned analysis justifying creation of the national security exception.”\n“The notice’s creation of an immediate national security exception to the (country-by-country) reporting requirement is arbitrary and capricious,” the FACT Coalition wrote in the April 30 letter.\nThe IRS could not immediately be reached for comment on the FACT letter. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe country-by-country IRS rule was intended to align with 2015 recommendations from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international group of advanced economies that has been working to curb corporate tax dodging.\nThe FACT letter said the IRS failed to acknowledge that the Defense Department, when crafting the original rule, had said that country-by-country revenue information “generally does not pose a national security concern.”\nAdditional reporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-02T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-02T02:04:06.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
