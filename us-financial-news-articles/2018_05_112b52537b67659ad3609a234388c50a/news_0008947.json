For lymphoma patients, the Swiss company has matched Yescarta’s $373,000 price and does not offer any outcomes-based price concessions.\nClinical trials have shown that a significant number of lymphoma patients may not respond to Kymriah until several months after treatment, making it difficult to measure outcomes within a defined period of time, said Pascal Touchon, head of cell and gene oncology at Novartis.\nKymriah is also approved for adults with high grade B-cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma arising from follicular lymphoma.\nThe new FDA label for Kymriah notes that clinical trials showed that about 50 percent of patients responded to the treatment, and that the duration of those responses has not yet been determined.\nTouchon said the 41 cancer treatment centers so far approved to administer Kymriah for pediatric leukemia are also certified for the lymphoma indication.
