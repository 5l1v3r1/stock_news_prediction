Capital of 10 billion yen ($91.41 million) is planned, the firms said, adding it was undecided when the it will begin business.\nThe move marks Nomura’s latest effort to tap a new generation of customers as its client base ages. It said in March it would invest about 1.6 billion yen in a fintech firm offering financial robo-advisory services. [nL3N1RC037]\nWith 75 million monthly active users, Line’s app - available on both portable devices and desktop computers - is ubiquitous in Japan and especially popular with younger, tech-savvy people. It already provides financial services such as loans and insurance, and in January said it planned to launch a cryptocurrency trading platform.\nThe companies said that Nomura’s financial services prowess would enable Line Securities to offer new services to Line customers looking to build up financial assets.\nThe firms said they did not expect the joint venture agreement to have a material impact on their financial results.\nReporting by Thomas WilsonEditing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:17:54.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
