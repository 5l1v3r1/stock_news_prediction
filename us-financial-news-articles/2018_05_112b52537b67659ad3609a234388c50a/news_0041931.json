Najib denied any wrongdoing and the attorney general cleared him following local investigations.\nAfter Najib lost last week's election, new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he would reopen investigations into 1MDB and declassify the audit report.\nHe barred Najib and his wife from leaving the country, and has replaced the attorney general who cleared Najib.\n\"In several instances, the 1MDB management had presented incomplete or inaccurate information to the 1MDB board before an important decision was made and had taken action without the approval of the 1MDB board,\" according to the audit report's executive summary seen by Reuters.\nAuditor General Madinah Mohamad verified the authenticity of the report seen by Reuters.\n1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBetween 2009 and 2015, several decisions involving high-value investments were made through 1MDB board resolutions without detailed discussion or evaluation, the report said.\nSeveral high-risk investments were made in a very short time, and the 1MDB management went against the board's and the shareholders' wishes in some instances, it said.\n\"There were also instances where the 1MDB management gave inaccurate or different information to interested parties,\" the report said.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has filed civil lawsuits alleging that over $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials and their associates.\nThe lawsuits seek to seize about $1.7 billion in assets, including a luxury yacht and paintings, that were bought with 1MDB funds.
