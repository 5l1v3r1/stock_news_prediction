The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nLicensed in 45 states, Synergy One offers a full suite of home financing products and services including mortgages and reverse mortgages through a wide network of loan officers, mortgage brokers as well as direct sales channels. It will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Bank.\n“Synergy One is an impressive company with a very talented team and dynamic management. We are a strong cultural fit – with both of us committed to collaboration, accountability and customer-focus – and our businesses are extremely complementary. We are excited by the potential this acquisition offers both companies to expand and serve more customers in the mortgage and reverse mortgage markets,” Schmid said.\n“Mutual of Omaha Bank is a respected, trusted brand with a complementary team of people, a significant base of capital and a commitment to excellence,” said Synergy One President and CEO Torrey Larsen. “The impact of two high performance teams working as one provides an undeniable opportunity to grow market share by executing every day on behalf of our customers. The combined company is fully aligned on vision, culture and purpose as we aim to build the best mortgage enterprise in the market, while maintaining our core values and commitment to serving others.”\nAs a wholly owned subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Bank, the company will continue to operate under the Synergy One name and its headquarters will remain in San Diego.\n“We already have a banking presence in San Diego, so it makes perfect sense for Synergy One’s headquarters and team to remain and expand there,” Schmid said.\nSynergy One will benefit from Mutual of Omaha Bank’s financial strength, strong brand and national presence, while the acquisition brings a comprehensive product portfolio, dynamic distributions and robust mortgage back office operations to the Bank, Schmid said.\nThe acquisition also expands Mutual of Omaha Bank’s product offerings to include the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), more commonly known as the reverse mortgage. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) dramatically changed the product to make it a more consumer-friendly and valuable financial planning tool for seniors. HECM products are offered through Synergy One’s Retirement Funding Solutions arm.\nTerry Connealy, president of Mutual of Omaha Mortgage, will oversee Synergy One’s operations on behalf of Mutual of Omaha Bank.\nAbout Mutual of Omaha Bank\nMutual of Omaha Bank is a full-service bank providing financial solutions to individuals and businesses across the United States.
