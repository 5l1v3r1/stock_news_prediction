In January we extended the term and modestly increased the size of our credit facility, solidified our partnership with Wipro through a $9.9 million preferred stock investment, and in March we sold our 3Q Digital subsidiary eliminating a $35 million earn-out liability. We also reduced executive and board compensation and continued to reduce our costs. These actions have created a strong foundation upon which to build.”\nMs. Puckett added, “We continued to make progress on our strategic turnaround in the first quarter. We improved our balance sheet and ended the quarter with no debt and $22.8 million of cash. We are also working to improve our results by focusing on higher levels of customer satisfaction and client retention, while at the same time attracting new clients.”\nThe following table presents financial highlights of the company's operations for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017.\nRESULTS FROM OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 % Change (2) Revenues from continuing operations $81,198 $94,894 (14.4) Operating Loss (5,035) (6,342) (20.6) Adjusted Operating Loss (1) (4,484) (5,858) (23.5) Net Income (Loss) available for common stockholders 32,629 (7,386) NM Basic Earnings (Loss) per comon share 5.24 (1.20) NM Diluted Earnings (Loss) per common share 4.67 (1.20) NM (1) See the attached table for reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.\n(2) Operating Loss and Adjusted Operating Loss improved compared to the prior year despite the negative percentage change.\nNM = not meaningful.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were $81.2 million, compared to $94.9 million during the same quarter last year, or a 14.4% decline, primarily due to reduced volumes from existing clients, particularily in our retail vertical.\nFirst quarter operating loss was $5.0 million, a 20.6% improvement compared to an operating loss of $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter.\nFirst quarter 2018 Adjusted Operating Loss was $4.5 million, compared to a loss of $5.9 million in the year-ago quarter, or a 21.7% improvement. The lower Adjusted Operating Loss was due to a broad based reduction in operating expenses, including lower payroll, severance, production related expenses and lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the impact of the decline in revenues.\nNet income available for common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $32.6 million or Basic Earnings per common share of $5.24. Diluted Earnings per common share were $4.67. Net income included a $31 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 3Q Digital during the quarter. In the year ago period, net loss was $7.4 million or a Basic and Diluted Loss per common share of $1.20.\nConference Call Information\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss the earnings release today at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
