It means that you’ve been playing well throughout the whole year, and you deserve that spot a little bit. But the seedings don’t matter,” the world number three told reporters.\nTennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - May 27, 2018 Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis in action during his first round match with Germany's Alexander Zverev REUTERS/Christian Hartmann “It doesn’t mean anything as there are a lot of great players wanting to stop me.\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re ranked No. 2 in the world or if you’re ranked 50 or 80 in the world... you try to beat the guy who is on the other side.”\nAlthough the German has been promoted one spot in the seedings due to Roger Federer’s decision to skip the entire claycourt season, his place at the bottom of the draw is no fluke.\nHe has enjoyed a sizzling build-up to Paris by contesting three claycourt finals and winning two of them.\nThe only blip, if it can be called that, was a semi-final defeat by Kei Nishikori in the Monte Carlo Masters.\n“On clay especially I have been playing well. During all the tournaments I have played on clay so far, the worst I did was semi-finals in Monaco. That’s not a bad preparation,” the champion in Munich and Madrid said with a grin.\n“I have won two tournaments, made the finals in Rome again, losing to Rafa in a close match. I feel good and today was a good start to the tournament. I’m happy the way it’s going so far.”\nReporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T20:29:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
