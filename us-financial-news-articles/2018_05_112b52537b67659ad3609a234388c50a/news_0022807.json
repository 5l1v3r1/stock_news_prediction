(NASDAQ:PRCP), a leading global provider of 3D automated metrology solutions and coordinate measuring machines, today announced results for the third quarter of its 2018 fiscal year (quarterly period ended March 31, 2018).\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Sales $ 21.4 $ 16.3 $ 5.1 $ 61.1 $ 55.6 $ 5.5 Net Income (Loss) 1.0 (0.6 ) 1.6 2.9 (0.4 ) 3.3 Diluted Income (Loss) per Share $ 0.11 $ (0.06 ) $ 0.17 $ 0.31 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.36\nThird quarter fiscal 2018 results compared to third quarter fiscal 2017:\nThird quarter consolidated net sales were $21.4 million, an increase of 31.3% compared to the third fiscal quarter one year ago Consolidated gross profit was $7.9 million and gross margin was 36.9%, a 500 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter Third quarter reported and recurring operating income totaled $1.1 million, up significantly as compared to the reported operating loss of $0.5 million in the prior year quarter Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 of $1.0 million was also up significantly compared to the net loss of $0.6 million in the prior year quarter Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.11 compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.06 in the third fiscal quarter one year ago Bookings hit an all-time record of $24.1 million; bookings have been at least $20 million for seven out of the last eight quarters Backlog increased 5.3% to $51.2 million, another all-time record for the Company Cash and short-term investments totaled $7.8 million at the period ending March 31, 2018\nYear-to-date fiscal 2018 results compared to year-to-date fiscal 2017:\nYear-to-date consolidated net sales increased 9.9% to $61.1 million as compared to $55.6 million in the prior year-to-date period Year-to-date consolidated gross profit increased $3.8 million to $23.0 million Consolidated gross margin was 37.6%, an increase of 310 basis points Year-to-date reported operating income totaled $3.1 million and recurring operating income was $3.7 million, increases of 288% and 147%, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year Net income increased dramatically, growing by $3.3 million to $2.9 million for year-to-date fiscal 2018 Year-to-date diluted earnings per share also improved significantly, achieving $0.31, as compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in the prior year-to-date period Bookings increased 2.1% to $67.3 million for year-to-date fiscal 2018\nFourth quarter and full year 2018 guidance:\nRevenue for the fourth quarter is expected to be in the range of $20.0 million to $23.0 million The Company reaffirms previous guidance of mid-single digit revenue growth for fiscal year 2018\nDavid Watza, President and CEO, commented, “We are very pleased with the continued momentum this fiscal year, as we experienced strong sales growth and improved profitability in several key areas of the business. Our elevated backlog levels, which grew faster than net sales this quarter, achieved a Company record.”\n“Our strong results this quarter are a direct result of the unique solutions we provide our customers. We remain well positioned this fiscal year with our year-to-date recurring operating income more than doubling, while we have also generated strong operating cash flows throughout the fiscal year,” added Watza. “The strategic plan we put into place continues to drive strength in key customer demand metrics, as evidenced by the robust sales, profitability and backlog results for the quarter.”\n“In addition to the Helix®evo product launched last quarter, we are very pleased with additional orders for our In-Line Robot Guidance Solutions during the third quarter,” continued Watza. “We believe that these unique solutions, as well as the newer solutions we are launching, will enable us to expand our market share within the automotive industry. Our strategy of continued investment in engineering capabilities has proven beneficial as we expand our technical advantages in hardware and software measurement technologies. We remain confident that a relentless focus in our core markets will continue to provide sustainable and profitable long-term growth opportunities both within the automotive industry as well as other industries longer-term, as we continue to remove cost from our system and deliver more value to our customers.”\n“Looking ahead to our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect revenue in the range of $20.0 million to $23.0 million, and affirm our previous guidance of mid-single digit growth in our top line results for the full year fiscal 2018. Our longer-term aspirations are for sustained high single-digit revenue growth and resulting double-digit earnings growth,” Watza concluded.\nHighlights of Operations INCOME STATEMENT KEY METRICS (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Americas Sales $ 8.1 $ 6.0 $ 2.1 $ 26.1 $ 20.3 $ 5.8 Europe Sales 10.1 6.5 3.6 24.3 24.2 0.1 Asia Sales 3.2 3.8 (0.6 ) 10.7 11.1 (0.4 ) Total Net Sales $ 21.4 $ 16.3 $ 5.1 $ 61.1 $ 55.6 $ 5.5 Gross Profit $ 7.9 $ 5.2 $ 2.7 $ 23.0 $ 19.2 $ 3.8 Gross Profit as a percent of sales 36.9 % 31.9 % 37.6 % 34.5 % Operating Income (Loss) $ 1.1 $ (0.5 ) $ 1.6 $ 3.1 $ 0.8 $ 2.3 Operating Income (Loss) as a percent of sales 5.1 % (3.0 %) 5.1 % 1.4 % Net Income (Loss) $ 1.0 $ (0.6 ) $ 1.6 $ 2.9 $ (0.4 ) $ 3.3 Diluted Income (Loss) per Share $ 0.11 $ (0.06 ) $ 0.17 $ 0.31 $ (0.05 ) $ 0.36 Recurring Operating Income (Loss) $ 1.1 $ (0.5 ) $ 1.6 $ 3.7 $ 1.5 $ 2.2 Recurring Operating Income (Loss) as a percent of sales 5.1 % (3.0 %) 6.1 % 2.7 % Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were the highest of any third quarter in company history, increasing $5.1 million, or 31.3%, versus the same quarter in the prior year, and reflecting increases in Europe and Americas regions. The Europe region was up due to increases in In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions, Off-Line Measurement Solutions and Value-Added Services. The year-over-year improvement in the Americas region was primarily due to increases in In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions and Value-Added Services, partially offset by decreased sales of 3D Scanning Solutions and a small decline in Off-Line Measurement Solutions. The decline in the Asia region was primarily due to decreases in the In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions as well as the 3D Scanning Solutions, partially offset by an increase in sales of Off-Line Measurement Solutions.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, gross profit as a percentage of sales improved by 500 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the higher volume of sales, the mix of the Company’s revenue and the timing of certain expenses in cost of goods sold under applicable accounting rules.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, SG&A, Engineering and R&D expenses were up $1.1 million, primarily as a result of strategic investments in several engineering, research and development initiatives, increased employee-related costs, including a higher bonus accrual due to improved financial results and increased usage of outside contractors, as well as increased allowance for doubtful accounts reserve, partially offset by lower finance and bank fees.\nThree Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, BOOKINGS (in millions) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Geographic Region Americas $ 10.3 $ 11.3 $ (1.0 ) $ 26.8 $ 30.6 $ (3.8 ) Europe 9.4 7.0 2.4 26.8 21.8 5.0 Asia 4.4 4.9 (0.5 ) 13.7 13.5 0.2 Total Bookings $ 24.1 $ 23.2 $ 0.9 $ 67.3 $ 65.9 $ 1.4\nBACKLOG (in millions) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 Geographic Region Americas $ 20.2 $ 18.0 $ 21.1 $ 19.5 $ 20.9 Europe 18.9 19.6 18.0 16.4 16.7 Asia 12.1 10.9 9.8 9.1 11.0 Total Backlog $ 51.2 $ 48.5 $ 48.9 $ 45.0 $ 48.6 Third quarter bookings reached an all-time record of $24.1 million. The increase in booking activity is primarily due to increases in Off-Line Measurement Solutions and Value Added Services, partially offset by decreases in In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions and 3D Scanning Solutions. The increased booking activity in Europe was driven by increases in Off-Line Measurement Solutions, In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions and 3D Scanning Solutions.\nBookings in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 exceeded revenue by $2.7 million, which resulted in an increase in backlog to $51.2 million at March 31, 2018. This is the highest backlog level in the Company’s history. As the levels of bookings and backlog typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter, management does not necessarily consider these metrics to be indicative of the future operating performance of the Company.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nCash and short-term investment balance was $7.8 million at March 31, 2018, down from $9.0 million at December 31, 2017 and up from $5.1 million at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, bank debt outstanding totaled $1.5 million, down slightly from an outstanding balance of $1.6 million at December 31, 2017, and up from $0.8 million at March 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Investor Call and Webcast\nPerceptron, Inc., will hold its third quarter fiscal year 2018 investor conference call/webcast, chaired by David L.

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting our performance.
