The transaction is the world’s first cobalt-nickel streaming deal on a producing mine, Cobalt 27 said in a statement.\nThe transaction comes as Brazilian miner Vale SA was seeking to sell cobalt from its Voisey’s Bay mine in eastern Canada in a streaming deal worth around $500 million, Reuters reported in January.\nPrices of cobalt, a critical component in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, have soared fourfold over the past two years to close to $100,000 a tonne on concerns of a shortfall as demand is forecast to spike.\nCobalt 27 said it had reached a C$145 million ($113.33 million) deal with Highlands Pacific Ltd to buy cobalt and nickel from a Papua New Guinea mine that the Australian miner has a stake in.\nCobalt 27, a small buyer of physical cobalt, is also in advanced talks with other owners of the Ramu mine on Papua New Guinea’s north coast for a further $87 million stream, it said. Both transactions can be funded from cash or a new debt facility.\nUnder the transaction with Highlands, Cobalt 27 will purchase 55 percent of Highlands’ share of cobalt production and 27.5 percent of its share of nickel output from the mine.\nThat will result in Cobalt 27 receiving an estimated 450,000 pounds of cobalt and 2.25 million pounds of nickel in concentrate a year from Ramu.\nAs a result of the deal, Highlands’ ownership of Ramu will increase to 11.3 percent from 8.56 percent. The mine is majority-owned and operated by Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd. Other shareholders include the Papua New Guinea government, landowners and other Chinese investors.\nCobalt 27 has also agreed to buy a 13 percent stake in Highlands, a Papua New Guinea-focused mining explorer, developer and producer.\n$1 = 1.2795 Canadian dollars Reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:02:45.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
