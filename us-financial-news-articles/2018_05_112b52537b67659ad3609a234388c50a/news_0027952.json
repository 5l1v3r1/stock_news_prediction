The FCC said the new rules take effect 30 days from Friday, which is around June 10.\nA group of states and others have filed suit to try to block the new rules from taking effect. The revised rules were a win for providers like AT&T Inc and Comcast Corp, but are opposed by internet firms like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc.\n] (Reporting by David Shepardson)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-10T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:28:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
