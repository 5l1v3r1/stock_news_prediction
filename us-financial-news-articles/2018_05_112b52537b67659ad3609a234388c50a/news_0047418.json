I am confident that is how it is going to be,” Putin said.\nLawmakers who suggested treating compliance with western sanctions in Russia as criminal offence were guided by “emotional considerations,” Putin said.\nFacing fierce criticism over the bill, Russian lawmakers this week put off a second reading of the bill pending consultations with business groups scheduled for May 23.\nThe draft, in its current form, makes it a crime punishable by up to four years in jail to refuse to supply services or do business with a Russian citizen, citing U.S. or other sanctions.\nThe legislation must pass a third reading, before being approved by the upper house of parliament and signed by Putin.\nHis views on the legislation are likely to have a direct bearing on the contents of the bill because parliament is dominated by his allies.\nReporting by Denis Pinchuk; Writing by Andrey Ostroukh\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:40:55.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
