As expected, the third quarter marked an inflection in our gross margin performance as we delivered almost a 300 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our focus on turning inventory faster, improving the overall inventory allocation across our store base, offering great values and a consistent flow of deals is delivering a better customer experience, all of which have contributed to improved comparable store sales. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue executing against our strategies to set the foundation for long-term profitable growth at Tuesday Morning.”\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results of Operations\nNet sales were $223.3 million, compared to $203.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 on a flat store base.\nComparable store sales increased 9.1% compared to the same period a year ago, and were comprised of a 5.9% increase in customer transactions along with a 3.0% increase in average ticket. During the third quarter, 10 stores were relocated, five stores were opened, and five stores were closed, for an ending store count of 724 as of March 31, 2018. Sales at the 58 stores relocated during the past 12 months increased approximately 65% on average for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the prior year quarter and contributed approximately 430 basis points of comparable store sales growth, driven primarily by better real estate and larger average store footprint. The Company’s third quarter benefitted from the shifts of a promotional event from the fourth quarter to the third quarter as well as from the timing of the sales ramp up prior to the Easter holiday. Although an estimation, the Company believes that these shifts benefitted third quarter fiscal 2018 comparable store sales performance by approximately 300 basis points.\nGross profit increased $13.1 million to $80.3 million compared to $67.2 million of gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 36.0% compared to 33.1% last year. The increase in gross margin for the quarter was driven by a significant decrease in the amount of distribution and freight costs as a percentage of sales recognized in the third quarter fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year. Those prior year elevated costs were incurred due to the supply chain issues the Company experienced in fiscal 2017. Additionally, the Company has achieved and recognized cost efficiencies in its distribution operations in the current year, along with reduced markdowns and continued improvement in initial merchandise mark-up which have contributed to improvements in gross margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $6.3 million to $88.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $81.8 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 39.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 40.3% in the same period last year, leveraging approximately 80 basis points. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by leveraging store labor costs, as well as reductions in certain corporate expenses, including labor and legal costs, which decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the current year quarter from the prior year quarter. Partially offsetting these decreased costs were higher store rent and depreciation, due in part to the Company’s strategy to improve store real estate, and higher advertising expenses due to promotional timing.\nThe Company’s operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $7.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $14.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $8.1 million, or $0.18 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $14.8 million, or $0.34 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $1.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to EBITDA of negative $8.7 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $0.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of negative $7.8 million for the prior year period, primarily driven by the change in net loss as compared to the prior year period as adjusted for incremental costs relating to the ramp-up of the Company’s Phoenix distribution center in the prior year period. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided below.\nNine Months ended March 31, 2018 Results of Operations\nNet sales were $775.9 million, compared to $743.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 on a flat store base.\nComparable store sales increased 4.3% compared to the same period a year ago, and were comprised of a 3.3% increase in customer transactions, along with a 1.0% increase in average ticket. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, 36 stores were relocated, 13 stores were opened, seven stores were expanded, and 20 stores were closed, for an ending store count of 724 as of March 31, 2018. Sales at the 58 stores relocated during the past 12 months increased approximately 61% on average for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to the same period in the prior year and contributed approximately 390 basis points of comparable store sales growth, driven primarily by better real estate and larger average store footprint.\nGross profit increased $13.4 million to $263.9 million compared to $250.5 million of gross profit in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 34.0% compared to 33.7% last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to improvements in initial merchandise mark-up and reduced markdowns, partially offset by higher distribution and freight costs recognized in the current year, due to the elevated costs incurred in the prior year as a result of the supply chain issues the Company experienced in fiscal 2017.\nSG&A increased $9.8 million to $275.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to $265.6 million in the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 35.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to 35.7% in the same period last year. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by reductions in certain corporate expenses, including labor costs, and legal and professional fees, which decreased both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in the current year from the prior year period. Partially offsetting these decreased costs were higher store rent and depreciation, due in part to the Company’s strategy to improve store real estate.\nThe Company’s operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $11.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $15.2 million for the prior year period.\nThe Company reported a net loss of $11.6 million, or $0.26 per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $15.2 million, or $0.35 per share, for the prior year period. The Company’s net loss in the current period reflects a favorable tax impact of approximately $0.6 million resulting from recent tax law changes.\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $8.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to EBITDA of $1.6 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $11.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2018, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $7.0 million for the prior year period, primarily driven by the change in net loss as compared to the prior year period as adjusted for incremental costs relating to the ramp-up of the Company’s Phoenix distribution center in the prior year period. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided below.\nThe Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2018 with $12.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company had $44.4 million outstanding under its line of credit with availability on the line of $67.0 million. Inventories at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $245.0 million compared to $268.3 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017, a decrease of $23.3 million or 8.7%. The decrease in inventory was driven primarily by lower distribution center and in-transit inventory levels, due in part to the Company’s continued supply chain and inventory management improvements. The Company’s inventory turnover for the trailing five quarters as of March 31, 2018 was 2.7 turns, an improvement of approximately 13% from the trailing five quarter turnover as of March 31, 2017 of 2.4 turns.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects comparable store sales for fiscal 2018 to increase 3% to 4%. Gross margin is expected to show year over year improvement in the fourth quarter, though to a lesser extent than that realized in the third quarter. The Company continues to expect significant projected EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2018. Net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately $23 million to $26 million in fiscal 2018, with a continuing focus on real estate strategy for new stores, relocations and expansions of existing stores, and IT infrastructure and enhancements.\nAbout Tuesday Morning\nTuesday Morning Corporation (NASDAQ:TUES) is one of the original off-price retailers specializing in name-brand, high quality products for the home, selling luxury textiles, furnishings, housewares and seasonal decor.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.\nTUESDAY MORNING CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income or net loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash items and other items that the Company believes are not representative of its core operating performance. These measures are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as a measure of operating performance. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presented as, and should not be considered as, alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by such adjustments. The Company believes it is useful for investors to see these EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures that management uses to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are included to supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and because the Company uses these measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its business as a supplement to GAAP measures and believes the presentation of these non-GAAP measures enhances investors’ ability to analyze trends in the Company’s business and evaluate the Company’s performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The non-GAAP measures presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:\nThe following table reconciles net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures:\n(unaudited - in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net loss (GAAP) $ (8,080 ) $ (14,796 ) $ (11,642 ) $ (15,221 ) Depreciation and amortization 6,363 5,659 19,087 15,635 Interest expense, net 485 370 1,450 1,028 Income tax provision/(benefit) (23 ) 101 (431 ) 113 EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ (1,255 ) $ (8,666 ) $ 8,464 $ 1,555 Share-based compensation expense (1) 784 908 2,729 3,224 Cease-use rent expense (2) (396 ) 87 398 560 Phoenix distribution center related expenses (3) — 59 — 2,196 Stockholder nominations related expenses (4) — — 408 — Gain on sale of assets (5) — (185 ) (371 ) (556 ) Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ (867 ) $ (7,797 ) $ 11,628 $ 6,979 (1) Adjustment includes charges related to share-based compensation programs, which vary from period to period depending on volume and vesting timing of awards.
