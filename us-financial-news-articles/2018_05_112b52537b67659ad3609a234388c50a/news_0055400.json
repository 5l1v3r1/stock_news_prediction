She has not lost an 800 metres race since 2015.\nAmerican Ajee Wilson finished second in 1:56.86.\nBaker, the world indoor bronze medallist, pulled ahead of 60 metres world record holder Coleman in the final 20 metres to win with an assisting wind of 2.4 metres per second.\nColeman finished second in 9.84 seconds with Britain’s Reece Prescod third in 9.88 seconds.
