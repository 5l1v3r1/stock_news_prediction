The number of aircraft with its Global Xpress service installed rose to 245 at the end of the first quarter, from 194 at the end of last year.\n“The in-flight connectivity business Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) is now close to break even and operating free cash is improving significantly - that is something investors have been concerned about,” Pearce said.\nInmarsat said in March it would not slow investment in in-flight connectivity, despite some risks to cash flow from a separate contract with a U.S. company that uses its airwaves.\nThe company kept its outlook, targeting mid-single digit revenue growth on average over the next five years, unchanged from March.\n$1 = 0.7352 pounds Editing by Susan Fenton and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:37:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
