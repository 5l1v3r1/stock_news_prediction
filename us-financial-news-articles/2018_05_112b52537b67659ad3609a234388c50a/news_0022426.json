It is testing, it is personal but most of all it builds strength, stamina, fitness and health. It is the mother of all sports.\n“On Wednesday 6 of June, we want as many people as possible to celebrate Global Running Day – the biggest annual celebration of running.”\nEach race will be headed by a designated ‘City Captain’, a former or current athlete who will lead local efforts to spread awareness of the initiative and to involve their respective running communities.\nCelebrating its third year in 2018, Global Running Day is a grassroots initiative where people of all abilities and from all paths of life come together to celebrate their passion for running and inspire others to get moving.
