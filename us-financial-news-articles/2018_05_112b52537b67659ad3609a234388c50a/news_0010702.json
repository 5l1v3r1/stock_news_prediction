His work focuses on expanding addiction treatment services in communities who need affordable, accessible care and sees RCA as the best place to do that.\nBrickner also served as president and CEO of Baltimore City's Substance Use Systems where he managed a yearly budget of $50 million to provide uninsured and underinsured individuals access to addiction treatment. There, he oversaw the management of treatment services for the city, working among 70 treatment agencies.\nEarlier in his career Brickner was appointed as the city of Denver's first 'drug czar' serving as Director of the Office of Drug Strategy where he launched a program to provide housing and treatment for homeless young adults with SUD.\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Adam to our team,\" says RCA's Chief Operations Officer J.P.
