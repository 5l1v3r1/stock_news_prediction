He added that the stock should be able to appreciate 2.5 to threefold over the next five to six years.\nSince reporting third-quarter results in October, the market cap of Amazon has increased by $318 billion – the analyst added – nearly the entire market cap of Walmart and Salesforce.com combined.\nWe think the swell in Amazon's market cap \"is warranted and still see very meaningful long-term upside from here,\" Sanderson wrote. By 2025, Tim Bezos's company could represent 14.5 percent of total U.S. retail sales, up from 5.2 percent in 2017, with third-party parties comprising 80 percent of the share.\n\"The brand, logistics infrastructure, secular trend and management competency will continue to drive meaningful share gain and penetration of its primary end markets (i.e. retail consumption, computing infrastructure) is well below penetration of verticals for its mega-cap peers (i.e. advertising, media, travel),\" Sanderson said.\nShares of Amazon fell modestly in premarket trading following the analyst's call, though the stock is up more than 37 percent so far this year. That's far ahead of the broader market, with the S&P 500 up only 1.7 percent since January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-29T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T16:18:47.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
