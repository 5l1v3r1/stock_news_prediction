returning the group to double-digit growth is going to take time,” analysts at Davy Stockbrokers wrote in a note, saying they would cut their earnings forecasts for this year and next by around 3 percent.\n“The next quarter should see an improvement; the development team will have had a further quarter to roll out new product, while the (soccer) World Cup will provide an excellent opportunity to re-engage with customers.” ($1 = 0.7346 pounds) ($1 = 0.7321 pounds) (Reporting by Padraic Halpin Editing by Keith Weir)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-02T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T12:13:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
