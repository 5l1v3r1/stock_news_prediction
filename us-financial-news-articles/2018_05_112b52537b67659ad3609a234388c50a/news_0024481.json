Bidders compete for stakes there by offering the biggest percentage of oil after cost to the government, which also receives a fixed bonus from the winning group.\nEarlier this month, Brazil’s energy policy council CNPE proposed Sept. 28 as the date for the fifth round auction, which should include blocks in the Saturno, Tita, Pau-Brasil and Southeast of Tartaruga Verde fields in the Campos and Santos basins.\nThe plan still requires presidential approval.\n$1 = 3.5919 reais Reporting by Luciano Costa; Writing by Alexandra Alper Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-12T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:25:37.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
