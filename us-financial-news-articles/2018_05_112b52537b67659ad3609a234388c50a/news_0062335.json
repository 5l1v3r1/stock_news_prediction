We're not seeing much of a safe haven bid for gold,\" said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank.\nItaly's two anti-establishment parties renewed attempts to form a government and avoid snap elections that investors fear would serve as a quasi-referendum on Rome's membership of the euro zone.\nSpot gold was down 0.14 percent at $1,299.23 ounce by 4 p.m. ET. It was down nearly 1 percent for the month, headed for its second straight monthly decline.

This could dent the appeal of gold, which does not bear interest.\nMeanwhile, spot silver declined 0.57 percent at $16.42, but was on track for a monthly rise of about 1 percent, its biggest since January.\nPlatinum gained 0.1 percent at $907.40, headed for a 0.5 percent monthly increase.\nPalladium increased 0.23 percent at $987.50 and was headed for its biggest monthly gain since December, climbing over 2 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T06:23:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
