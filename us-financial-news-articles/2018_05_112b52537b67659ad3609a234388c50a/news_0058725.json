Shepard in 1926 lays out the much-loved fictional world created by A.A. Milne, depicting characters Winnie-the-Pooh, Christopher Robin, Piglet and Eeyore.\n“It’s such a valuable piece because it’s such an obvious entry into the world of Winnie-the-Pooh,” Philip Errington, book and illustrations senior specialist at auction house Sotheby’s, said.\n“It’s there as you open the book of the first edition, it’s there on the end papers. It’s also there in the Disney cartoon,” he added, referring to the 1966 “Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree” film.\nThe map, with an estimate of 100,000 - 150,000 pounds ($133,260 - $200,000), will be auctioned at the English Literature, History, Science, Children’s Books and Illustrations sale in July.\nFour other Winnie-the-Pooh illustrations by Shepard are also being offered, including one of Christopher Robin and Pooh walking to say goodbye, as in Milne’s ending in “The House at Pooh Corner”.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Reporting by Iona Serrapica; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T18:50:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
