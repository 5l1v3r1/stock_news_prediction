Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.\nThe product was distributed nationwide and is sold in 8, 16, and 32 ounce and half gallon jars. The jars are labelled \"Tahini Sesame Paste.\" Lot codes and use by/expiration dates are printed on the white jar cap.\nProduct code, description, lot code, and UPC information (use by/expiration dates vary):\nProduct Code\nProduct Description & Size\nLot#\nUPC\nA0071\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste Â½ gal Glass Jar\n35417\n074265003076\nA0072\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 32 oz Glass Jar\n00318\n074265001553\nA0073\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 16 oz Glass Jar\n35317\n074265001560\nA0073\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 16 oz Glass Jar\n35417\n074265001560\nA0073\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 16 oz Glass Jar\n35517\n074265001560\nA0073\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 16 oz Glass Jar\n35617\n074265001560\nA0076\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 8 oz Glass Jar\n34817\n074265010975\nA0076\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 8 oz Glass Jar\n01218\n074265010975\nS0073\nZiyad Tahini Sesame Paste 16 oz Glass Jar\n34917\n074265001560\nNo illnesses have been reported to-date in connection with the Ziyad Brand Tahini.\nThis potential problem was revealed as a result of a random sampling by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Although we have not received the final laboratory reports, Ziyad Brothers is taking the precaution of recalling product with the lot codes listed above.\nConsumers who have purchased Ziyad Brand Tahini with these lot codes should discontinue use and return it to the store of purchase for a full refund. Retailers that may have further distributed the recalled lot codes should share this notice with their customers. Retailers or consumers with questions may contact Recall Coordinator Ray Hanania at 708-298-3818.\nCONTACT: Ray Hanania, 708-298-3818, Monday-Friday 8:00A - 5:00P CDT\nZiyad Brothers Importing\n5400 W. 35 th Street\nCicero, Il., 60804\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ziyad-brothers-importing-recalls-tahini-because-of-possible-health-risk-300651192.html\nSOURCE Ziyad Brothers Importing", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ziyad-brothers-importing-recalls-tahini-because-of-possible-health-risk-300651192.html"], "published": "2018-05-18T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T00:48:02.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
