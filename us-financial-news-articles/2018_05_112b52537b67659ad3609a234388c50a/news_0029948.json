He had always denied the charges against him.\nThe terrorism charges against him were dropped last week.\n“Five years of his life have been taken away despite his innocence. Words cannot express my happiness at his release,” his daughter Amy Fikru told Reuters shortly after he walked out of the prison complex.\nFikru is one of thousands of prisoners, including high-profile journalists and opposition leaders who had been charged with a variety of offences, including terrorism, to be freed.\nTheir release is part of reform pledges by the government of Abiy Ahmed, who took over in April this year, and preceding administrations, to end widespread protests\nHundreds of people have been killed during protests that convulsed two of the country’s most populous provinces, whose ethnic Oromo and Amharic communities complain they are politically marginalised.\nEditing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:22:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
