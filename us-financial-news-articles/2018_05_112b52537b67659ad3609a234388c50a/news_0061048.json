There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!\nTrump has repeatedly argued politics motivated the Russia investigation, claiming Democrats want to make up for a loss in the 2016 presidential election. Now, he appears poised to peg potential Republican troubles in November's midterms to the Russia probe.\nSome Democrats, with their party trying to either take control of Congress or narrow Republican majorities this year, aim to quell accusations of influence on the midterms. On Wednesday, Sen. Chris Coons , D-Del., said it is \"important\" that the special counsel \"avoid any major announcements\" ahead of the midterms to avoid affecting races.\n\"And I fully expect him to follow that practice,\" Coons told CNN on Wednesday.\nGetty Images Senate Appropriations Committee's Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee ranking member Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE. Sen. Mark Warner , a Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also suggested Wednesday that the investigation could weigh politically if it drags on for too long. Speaking at Recode's Code Conference, the senator said he thinks Americans will grow \"tired\" of the probe if it is not \"wound down this calendar year.\"\nOf course, that timeline would not necessarily mean the investigation would end before the midterms. The intelligence panel Warner sits on is conducting a separate counterintelligence investigation into Russian influence efforts.\nThe special counsel's office declined to comment for this article.\nRepresentatives for the top Senate and House Democrats, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi , respectively, did not immediately respond to requests about whether the leaders agree with Coons' view.\nTrump's personal legal team has partly cited the midterms as it pushes for a swift conclusion to the Mueller investigation. Rudy Giuliani , one of the president's lawyers in the Russia probe, told CNBC on Wednesday that he would want a potential Trump interview with Mueller's team to take place \"well before midterms so they can wrap up [the] case in September.\"\nTrump's fixation on the investigation has helped to keep it in the public eye. He tweeted frequently in recent days about the Russia investigation and unfounded accusations that the Obama administration planted a spy within his campaign.\n\"Why didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the election?\" he asked in one tweet Sunday.\nTrump tweet: Why didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.\nRepublicans have tried to focus their messaging on a strong economy and their law cutting tax rates for corporations and most individuals ahead of the midterms. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to acknowledge that he should spend more time talking about policy rather than the Russia investigation.\n\"Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.,\" he wrote on Twitter.\nTrump tweet: Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.\nâ€” CNBC's Brian Schwartz contributed to this report", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1001424695126880258", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1001417880116891650", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1000837182297464832"], "published": "2018-05-30T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-30T17:50:07.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
