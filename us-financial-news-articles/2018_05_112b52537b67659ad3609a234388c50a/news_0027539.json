He referenced Zuckerberg's 2016 proposal of a new share structure , which would have allowed him to give away a majority of shares, while remaining in a leadership role at the company.\n\"He has control of the content that over 2.1 billion people see. He cannot be removed from office,\" Galloway said. \"In my view, the most powerful, dangerous person in the world is 'the Zuck'.\"\nDespite his concerns over Zuckerberg's leadership, Galloway has no illusions that users will step away from the popular social media platforms.\n\"This isn't going to be a consumer-led revolution. People feign outrage at the subterfuge of our democracy and look where they go to express it, Facebook or Instagram,\" Galloway said. \"It is the job of our elected officials to look at these types of issues and decide whether or not a company like this should have more regulation.\"\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
