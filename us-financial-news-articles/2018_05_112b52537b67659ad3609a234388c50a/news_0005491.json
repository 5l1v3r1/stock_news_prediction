REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n“Pharma is one of our three pillars and we absolutely stand behind it. If avelumab doesn’t become a blockbuster there are enough highly interesting products in our pipeline,” said family representative Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp, speaking at an event marking the group’s 350-year anniversary at its Darmstadt, Germany headquarters.\nBlockbuster is the industry term for a drug with more than $1 billion in annual sales, but analysts on average do not expect avelumab, branded as Bavencio, to reach that status.\nTrial results have been mixed and it faces tough competition in a class of drugs dominated by Merck & Co’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo.\nMerck, which is developing avelumab in an alliance with Pfizer, is in intense negotiations with prospective partners for other promising experimental drugs in its pipeline.

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nThe Merck family, which holds 70 percent of the shares, have pursued a diversified approach, with the group’s activities ranging from liquid crystals for flat screens and pearlescent pigments to fertility drugs and lab equipment.\nAt 7 billion euros ($8.4 billion) in 2017 healthcare revenues - including allergy treatments and a consumer care unit it is selling - Merck does not make the top 20 list of global pharma majors.\nStangenberg-Haverkamp is one of two leading representatives of the roughly 150 family members that have voting rights in the family holding.
