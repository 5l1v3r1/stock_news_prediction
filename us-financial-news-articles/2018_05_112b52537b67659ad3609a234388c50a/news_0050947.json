(NYSE:SSI) today reported results for the first quarter ended May 5, 2018, and reaffirmed guidance for fiscal year 2018. For the first quarter, comparable sales decreased 2.8%. Loss before income tax was $31.5 million, compared to a loss before income tax of $27.9 million in the first quarter 2017.\nMichael Glazer, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “While the first quarter began with positive comparable sales in February, results were negatively impacted by unseasonably cold temperatures in our geography in late March and early April. Once the weather normalized in the second half of April, comparable sales turned positive, and business has accelerated in May. Notably, the underlying trends that emerged in 2017, including recovery in our oil and gas states, double-digit ecommerce growth, and the outperforming non-apparel business, have continued into 2018. In fact, our non-apparel business, which is less weather sensitive, was up over 3% for the first quarter. Additionally, due to our strong inventory management efforts, we maintained a consistent flow of new merchandise to our stores, and ended the first quarter with department store inventory levels down 5% compared to the first quarter 2017.”\nMr. Glazer continued, “We remain confident that we will meet our 2018 sales and earnings guidance. We are especially excited about accelerating the growth of our off-price business, and the recent conversion of one of our department stores to Gordmans has exceeded our expectations. As a result, we plan to redeploy capital to convert six more department stores and open one new Gordmans location in 2018.”\nThe company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock, payable on June 20, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 5, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Results\nFirst quarter 2018 results compared to first quarter 2017 results were as follows:\nNet sales were $344 million compared to $309 million Comparable sales decreased 2.8% Net loss was $31.7 million compared to $19.0 million Loss per share was $1.14 compared to a loss per share of $0.70 EBIT was $(29.3) million compared to $(26.3) million\n2018 Guidance\nFor fiscal 2018, the company reaffirmed the following guidance:\nNet sales between $1,610 million and $1,640 million Comparable sales of flat to an increase of 2.0% Net loss between $38 million and $27 million Tax rate of 0%, which, when compared to 2017, is expected to negatively impact 2018 EPS by $0.36 to $0.52 per diluted share within the comparable sales and EBIT guidance ranges Loss per diluted share between $1.35 and $0.95 Depreciation and amortization between $55 million and $60 million EBIT between $(29) million and $(18) million\nBased on continued belief in the off-price model and the success of its first Gordmans conversion, the company has updated its capital expenditures and store portfolio guidance. The company now plans the following for fiscal 2018:\nCapital expenditures of $30 million to $35 million compared to prior guidance of $30 million; and Opening 1 new Gordmans store, converting 5 to 10 department stores to Gordmans stores, and closing an additional 30 to 35 department stores versus closing 25 to 30 department stores.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The impact of the adoption on the condensed consolidated statements of operations reflects the reclassification of credit income from selling, general and administrative expense to revenue. The condensed consolidated balance sheets and cash flow statements reflect the reclassification of the asset related to the liability for sales returns to other current assets from inventory. The Company adopted the standard using the full retrospective method, and the condensed consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets and cash flows for the prior year periods have been restated.\nConference Call / Webcast Information\nThe company will post a pre-recorded conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results and guidance.
