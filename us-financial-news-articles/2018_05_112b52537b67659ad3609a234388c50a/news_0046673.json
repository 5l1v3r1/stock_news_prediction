I just can’t wait, they’re going to pipe out the music and the ceremony so we’re going to hear it, so that’ll be fun.”\nWerner and many others like her have traveled from around the globe to watch the wedding of the queen’s grandson, Prince Harry, and U.S. actress Meghan Markle, due to take place later on Saturday in a display of royal pomp and pageantry.\nThese super-fans lined the barricades on the streets around Windsor Castle in the days before, braving the elements to secure the best viewing spots.\nTerry Hett, 83, a regular at royal events where he dresses up in a full Union Jack suit, sat shivering in his camping chair on Saturday after six nights outside.\n“I’m looking forward to this wedding,” he told Reuters. “It’s a different wedding, a romantic wedding.”\nMarkle met Harry in 2016, and after a whirlwind romance announced their engagement a year later.\nWhile the carefully choreographed build-up to the wedding was overshadowed by uncertainty over whether her father, Thomas Markle, would be able to walk her down the aisle, fans said it didn’t spoil the romance for them.\nDonna Werner from the U.S., who is a super-fan of Britain's Royal Family, arranges flags and decorations near the spot she has chosen outside Windsor Castle from which to witness Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's carriage procession after their wedding, in Windsor, May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Marko Djurica “Everybody’s family is a little bit complicated, a little bit quirky, and it just makes it more real doesn’t it,” said Carol Ridding, 48, a hairdresser from Bristol in England whose daughter works as a Markle look-alike.\nShe was running on no sleep after enjoying the festivities on the street throughout the early hours.\nSome, like Jamie Williams, 33, from Texas, and her group, had hotel rooms booked but decided to stay outside to enjoy the atmosphere instead.\n“It was so special ... people were sharing their supplies,” she said. “It was worth it, we all bonded last night.”\nCloser to the castle, Werner said the same of the 12-15 people surrounding her, who hail from around the world.\n“It’s like family, we’ve all exchanged names, numbers and we’re going to keep in touch and meet for another big royal event some day,” she said.\nThe best thing that could happen today, for her, is to get a wave from Harry and Meghan, she said.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “Today is going to be the happily ever after for Meghan and Harry, and I’m just a little tiny part of it and I’m just thrilled.”\nReporting by Emma Rumney, editing by Estelle Shirbon\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-19T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-19T11:16:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
