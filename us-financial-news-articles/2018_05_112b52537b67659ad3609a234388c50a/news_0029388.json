All have tremendous name recognition and could potentially be used again. Several defunct companies, including Circuit City , have been resurrected after going out of business. (One possible bidder? The billionaire behind the Bratz dolls , who has been vocal in his desire to take over the chain.)\nThe intellectual property sale will take place next month. Individual stores and warehouses were expected to begin closing this week.\nEven Geoffrey has the chance at a second career. After Pets.com went belly-up in the dotcom crash, its well-known sock puppet mascot was purchased by loan firm 1-800-Bar-None, where it promoted the brand for years.
