Tennis - WTA Mandatory - Madrid Open - Madrid, Spain - May 11, 2018 Netherlands' Kiki Bertens celebrates winning her semi final match against France's Caroline Garcia REUTERS/Sergio Perez\nThe world number 20 blasted her way past seventh seed Garcia in just 66 minutes, breaking serve four times and never surrendering a break point to move within sight of her second singles title of the year.\nBertens, 26, had taken some big scalps already this week in Madrid, defeating Maria Sharapova in the quarter-finals on Thursday, the day after knocking out world number two and Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki.\n“I’m really happy with the way I played. I think it was maybe not great tennis, what people want to see with a lot of winners, but Caroline is a great player,” Bertens told a news conference.

I think I did it pretty well.”\nBertens will face a tough examination in Saturday’s final against either Petra Kvitova or Karolina Pliskova, conqueror of world number one Simona Halep on Thursday, with the two Czechs meeting later in Friday’s second semi.\n“She played very well, she used the high ball very well,” said Garcia, offering generous praise to Bertens.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it. I tried different things, but it didn’t work. Of course, I’m frustrated. My performance today was not great. But she had a game plan and it worked well.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ian Chadband", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-11T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:14:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
