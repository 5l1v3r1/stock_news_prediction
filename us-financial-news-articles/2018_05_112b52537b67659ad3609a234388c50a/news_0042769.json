I am desperate for England to do well as we push on to World Cup glory next year.”\nGustard will take over at Harlequins from John Kingston, who parted company with the club last month after a 10th-placed finish in the Premiership following a typically inconsistent season.\nThe club confirmed they will restructure the management team and will appoint a general manager to work alongside Gustard in due course.\nJones has worked without a specialist attack coach for most of his time at England - taking on the role himself - but the lost of Gustard is a huge blow.\nThe ambitious 42-year-old is credited with the wolf pack defence that worked so well for Saracens and England, and Jones picked him out for special praise after his team’s defensive masterclass in the 3-0 series win in Australia two years ago.\nGustard will remain in place while England seek to match that in South Africa and, coming off the back of three successive Six Nations defeats and with a poor away record against the Springboks, there will be plenty of defending to do.\nAfter that Brad Davis, another Australian currently working at the Ospreys, has been linked with the post, while Shaun Edwards, who is Wales defence coach, and Saracens’ Alex Sanderson are also contenders.
