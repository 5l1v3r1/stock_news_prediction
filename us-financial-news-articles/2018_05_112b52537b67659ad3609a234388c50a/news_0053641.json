Dustin Fowler made it a four-run inning with the team’s fourth hit, a single that plated Piscotty for a 4-2 lead.\nOakland got just one more hit and no more runs off Hernandez (5-4) in his six innings, but the damage already was done. The Seattle ace walked one and struck out two.\nMaking his first major league start, Lucas gave up two hits and a walk to load the bases in the Seattle first before Nelson Cruz grounded into a double play, scoring Jean Segura with the game’s first run.\nLucas walked Daniel Vogelbach and Andrew Romine in the second, but induced a double-play grounder in between. After Romine stole second, David Freitas got Seattle back within 4-2 with an RBI single.\nLucas was done after two innings, having allowed two runs, three hits and three walks in a 52-pitch adventure. He struck out one.\nChris Hatcher pitched two shutout innings and Yusmeiro Petit three to help the A’s retain their 4-2 lead before the Mariners rallied in the eighth.\nKyle Seager’s two-out double got Seattle within 4-3, but not before the A’s fifth double play had taken some of the sting out of a two-on, none-out situation.\nA’s closer Blake Treinen got Vogelbach to fly out with two aboard to end the inning, before retiring the side in order in the ninth, striking out a pair, for his 11th save.\nPetit (2-1) was credited with the win.\nFowler finished with two hits and a stolen base for the A’s, who already have lost three series to the Mariners by identical 2-1 counts this season.\nSegura had three hits and Seager two, including a double, for the Mariners, who out-hit the A’s 10-5.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:12:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
