Picture taken May 22, 2018. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader His laptop perched on the table of a traditional Viennese coffee house, Schrems showed how a pop-up message on Facebook seeks consent to use his data - and how he is blocked when he refuses.\n“The only way is to really accept it, otherwise you cannot use your Facebook any more,” Schrems explained.\n“As you can see, I have my messages there and I cannot read them unless I agree.”\nErin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, said in a statement that the company has prepared for 18 months to ensure it meets the requirements of GDPR by making its policies clearer and its privacy settings easier to find.\nFacebook, which has more than 2 billion regular users, has also said that advertising allows it to remain free, and that the whole service, including ads, is meant to be personalized based on user data.\n“1,000-EURO BRICK”\nSchrems said, however, that Instagram, a photo-sharing network popular with younger users, and encrypted messaging service WhatsApp - both owned by Facebook - also use pop-ups to gain consent and bar users who refuse.\nThe action brought by noyb against Google relates to new smartphones using its Android operating system. Buyers are required to hand over their data or else own “a 1,000-euro brick” that they can’t use, Schrems said.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nnoyb is filing the four claims with data protection authorities in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria. Ensuing litigation may play out in Ireland, where both Facebook and Google have their European headquarters.\nOne filing, made against Facebook on behalf of an Austrian woman, asks the country’s data protection authority to investigate and, as appropriate, prohibit data processing operations based on invalid consent.\nSlideshow (6 Images) It also asks the regulator to impose “effective, proportionate and dissuasive” fines as foreseen by GDPR, which in Facebook’s case could run to 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion).\n“So far it was cheaper just to ignore privacy rights,” said Schrems. “Now, hopefully, it’s going to be cheaper to follow them because the penalties are so high.”\nAdditional reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco and Julia Fioretti in Brussels; Writing by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-25T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T12:11:01.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
