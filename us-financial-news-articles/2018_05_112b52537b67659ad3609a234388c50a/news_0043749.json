Many of Netanyahu’s supporters celebrated the move, a break with decades of U.S. Middle East policy, as a triumph for the right-winger.\nPublication of the cartoon also came just a day after Israeli troops shot dead dozens of Palestinians during protests on the Gaza border, drawing strong criticism from many countries.\nHanitzsch told German broadcaster RND on Thursday that he found Netanyahu’s phrase “problematic ... It really does not help to pour even more oil onto the fire.”\nBut Sueddeutsche Zeitung editor-in-chief Krach told the same broadcaster that he saw the cartoon as anti-Semitic and that the newspaper had ended its relationship with the cartoonist.\nThe German Press Council launched an inquiry to determine whether the cartoon was anti-Semitic after readers had complained that the image “reminded them of the anti-Semitic language of Nazi times,” the council’s spokeswoman told Reuters.
