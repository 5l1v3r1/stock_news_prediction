Sales excluding autos, gasoline, building materials and food services—which economists watch as an indicator of trends in consumer spending—was up 0.4%.\nThat counts as good news for economy. Consumer spending grew at just a 1.1% annual rate in the first quarter, marking its weakest gain in over five years, but the second quarter is shaping up to be much better. It is becoming clear that the consumer weakness earlier this year was due to temporary factors such as a hangover from a hurricane-related pickup in fourth-quarter spending.\nMany good things are happening for consumers. The unemployment rate, at 3.9%, is at its lowest level since 2000, a fresh round of minimum-wage increases went into effect earlier this year, the government is spending more, tax cuts are putting more money in many people’s pockets and consumer sentiment measures are showing that Americans are in a pretty good mood.\nWhat’s more, if even just a small portion of corporate tax cuts starts to flow through into higher wages and more hiring, the backdrop for consumers ought to get even better. The only major drag consumers are experiencing right now is that rising gasoline prices are putting cash in the tank that might be spent elsewhere.\nIt may just be a matter of time before spending moves into an even higher gear. There is one potential fly in the ointment though: the money flowing into consumers’ pockets might not all flow out. The saving rate did improve during the first-quarter spending lull, but it is still low. Ten years after the financial crisis, it is hard for American consumers to completely throw caution to the wind as their incomes improve.\nThat wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing, but the days when consumer spending could really rip may be behind us.\nWrite to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.35.min.js"], "published": "2018-05-15T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:13:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
