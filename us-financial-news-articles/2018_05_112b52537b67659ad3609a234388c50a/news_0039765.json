REUTERS/Ramzi Boudina\nAbderazak Makri, elected last week as the new head of the Islamist MSP party, also told Reuters he will stand in the presidential election in April 2019 if the government does not bring the opposition into its plans for taking the oil-producer country forward.\nPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the veteran leader in power since 1999, has not declared yet whether he will seek a fifth term though the ruling FLN party and the biggest labour union have asked him to run again.\nShould the 81-year-old, who is wheelchair-bound following a stroke in 2013, run again this would provide short-term stability in the OPEC oil producer giving the military-backed power brokers time to sort out a smooth transition.\nBut Makri said the oil producer had no time to lose to agree on economic reforms as Algeria’s model of a state dominated economic dependent on oil and gas revenues no longer worked.

This is why we need a consensus,” Makri said in an interview.\n“If we do not reach a political consensus, all options will be then open. We may participate. We may boycott,” he said.\nIslamist parties now play no big role in Algeria where the FLN has dominated since independence from France. The MSP won only 6 percent in the 2017 election and it boycotted the presidential elections in 2014.

When elections are free and fair the winners are always Islamists,” he said. “In Morocco, the Islamists have won, in Tunisia they have won, and they would have won in Algeria if there had been no fraud.” Editing by Ulf Laessing and Richard Balmforth", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T20:46:09.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
