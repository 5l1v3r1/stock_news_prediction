He said there was no decision yet on the matter.\n“We are working hard to promote fiscal consolidation without any tax increase ... but of course we cannot afford to have a reduction in tax revenue at this moment,” Guardia said.\nTruck drivers blocked major roadways around the capital of the country’s largest grain state to protest increases in domestic fuel prices, affecting highways in 12 states.\nState-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA has adjusted domestic fuel prices on a daily basis to keep up with global prices, reverting from years of costly subsidies that helped to prop up its debt.
