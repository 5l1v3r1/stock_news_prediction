Triton reported Adjusted net income of $79.8 million or $0.99 per diluted share. Container pick-up activity was solid and drop-offs were exceptionally low leading to average utilization of 98.6% for the first quarter of 2018. Triton announced a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share payable on June 22, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2018.\nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes Triton’s selected key financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\n(in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended, March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Total leasing revenues $315.1 $313.9 $265.6 Net income attributable to shareholders (1) $80.9 $207.2 $34.6 Net income per share - Diluted $1.00 $2.57 $0.47 Adjusted net income (2) $79.8 $68.3 $35.4 Adjusted net income per share - Diluted (2) $0.99 $0.85 $0.48 Return on equity (3) 15.4% 13.6% 8.6% (1) Included in Net income attributable to shareholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is a one-time tax benefit of $139.4 million recognized as a result of the reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (2) Refer to the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income\" set forth below. (3) Triton's definition and calculation of Return on equity is annualized Adjusted net income divided by average shareholders' equity for the period. Operating Performance\n“Triton’s strong results in the first quarter of 2018 were supported by favorable market conditions and outstanding operational performance,” commented Brian Sondey, Chief Executive Officer of Triton. “We generated $79.8 million in Adjusted net income for the quarter, a sequential increase of 16.8%, which is particularly impressive given our first quarter typically represents a seasonally slow quarter and has the fewest number of revenue days. We are off to a great start to the year, and look forward to carrying the momentum forward as we head toward the peak shipping season.”\n“Our key operating metrics remain strong. Container pick-up and deal activity was solid in the first quarter despite the seasonality, while container drop-offs remained exceptionally low. Our utilization increased 10 basis points during the quarter to reach 98.7% as of March 31, 2018, and our utilization currently stands at 98.8%. New container prices held firm in the quarter, while used container sale prices increased, reflecting very low inventories of sale containers. We also benefited from a reduction in our average tax rate during the quarter as a result of corporate tax legislation enacted at the end of last year. We expect our average tax rate will remain in the 10-12% range for the full year of 2018. We have purchased over $850 million of containers for delivery in 2018, which puts us on track for another year of successful investment and growth.”\nOutlook\nMr. Sondey continued, “We expect market conditions to remain favorable. Trade growth is anticipated to remain positive, and many of our customers continue to rely heavily on leasing for new container additions to their fleets. The inventory of new containers has increased in the run up to the peak shipping season, but the availability of used leasing containers is exceptionally low, which has kept the overall supply and demand balance for containers favorable. Overall, we expect Adjusted net income to increase gradually throughout 2018.”\nDividend\nTriton’s Board of Directors has approved and declared a $0.52 per share quarterly cash dividend on its issued and outstanding common shares, payable on June 22, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2018.\nMr. Sondey concluded, “Our $0.52 per share quarterly dividend represents a 15% increase from our previous dividend level. The increase reflects the strength of our cash flow as well as our optimistic outlook for continued strong performance.”\nInvestors’ Webcast\nTriton will hold a Webcast at 8:30 a.m. (New York time) on Friday, May 4, 2018 to discuss its first quarter results.

throughout this press release.\nAdjusted net income is adjusted for certain items management believes are not representative of our operating performance. Adjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to shareholders excluding the write-off of deferred financing costs net of tax, gains and losses on interest rate swaps net of tax, transaction and other costs net of tax, and any foreign income and withholding tax adjustments.\nAdjusted net income is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted net income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including net income.\nWe believe that Adjusted net income is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because this measure:\nis widely used by securities analysts and investors to measure a company’s operating performance; helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure, our asset base and certain non-routine events which we do not expect to occur in the future; and is used by our management for various purposes, including as measures of operating performance and liquidity, to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis, in presentations to our board of directors concerning our financial performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nWe have provided a reconciliation of Net income attributable to shareholders, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted net income in the table below for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nTRITON INTERNATIONAL LIMITED\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income\n(In Thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended, March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net income attributable to shareholders $ 80,892 $ 207,160 $ 34,611 Add: Unrealized gain on derivative instruments, net (1,052 ) (1,084 ) (1,252 ) Transaction and other (income) costs (26 ) 4,862 2,066 Write-off of deferred financing costs — 2,327 — One-time tax benefit related to U.S. statutory rate reduction (139,359 ) Insurance recovery income — (5,567 ) — Adjusted net income $ 79,814 $ 68,339 $ 35,425 Adjusted net income per share - Basic $ 1.00 $ 0.85 $ 0.48 Adjusted net income per share - Diluted $ 0.99 $ 0.85 $ 0.48 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic 79,968 79,936 73,741 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Diluted 80,572 80,556 74,033 TRITON INTERNATIONAL LIMITED\nCalculation of Return on Equity\n(In Thousands)\nThree Months Ended, March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Adjusted net income $ 79,814 $ 68,339 $ 35,425 Annualized Adjusted net income (1) 323,690 271,128 143,668 Beginning Shareholders' equity 2,076,284 1,900,028 1,663,233 Ending Shareholders' equity 2,133,505 2,076,284 1,672,925 Average Shareholders' equity $ 2,104,895 $ 1,988,156 $ 1,668,079 Return on equity 15.4 % 13.6 % 8.6 % (1) Annualized Adjusted net income was calculated based on calendar days per quarter.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005106/en/\nTriton International Limited\nAndrew Greenberg, 914-697-2900\nSenior Vice President, Finance & Investor Relations\nSource: Triton International Limited", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trtn.com&esheet=51801089&newsitemid=20180504005106&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trtn.com&index=1&md5=2062306d76c332eb52f84bf51da88803", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180504005106/en/"], "published": "2018-05-04T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T15:42:52.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
