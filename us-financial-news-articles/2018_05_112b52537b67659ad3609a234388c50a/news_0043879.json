Candles are lit behind images of the victims killed in a shooting at Santa Fe High School during a vigil in League City, Texas, U.S., May 20, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\nThe accused killer, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, “used aspects of those (attacks) in his own shooting,” a source told the broadcaster, without going into further details.\nClassmates at the school in Santa Fe, Texas described Pagourtzis as a quiet loner who played on the football team. The attacker wore a black trench coat to school even in the Texas heat on Friday and opened fire with a .38 caliber pistol and Remington shotgun.\nMultiple media accounts say the gunman taunted some of his victims, asking some hiding in a closet if they wanted to answer their ringing cell phones. “You want to get that?” the attacker said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nHe spared others saying he wanted his story told. Police also found homemade pipe bombs that did not detonate.\nMany of the aspects of the attack mirrored one of the worst school shootings in American history: the massacre at Columbine High School in April, 1999, in which two teenage boys with weapons hidden under trenchcoats killed 12 students and one teacher.\nIn that mass attack, the teenagers had a shootout with police and ultimately committed suicide.\nPagourtzis did not attempt suicide, but Texas’ governor, Greg Abbott, a Republican, told reporters that the youth wanted to kill himself, citing the suspect’s journals, but lacked the courage to do so.\nColumbine touched off a national debate over gun control laws, gun culture, and even violence in video games. That debate still rages after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012 where 20 student and six adults were killed. And also in the Parkland, Florida shooting in February where 14 students and three adults were gunned down.

REUTERS/Ernest Scheyder “SADDENED AND DISMAYED”\nPolice said Pagourtzis confessed to Friday’s killings after he was taken into custody, but authorities have offered no motive yet for the massacre, the fourth-deadliest mass shooting at a U.S. public school in modern history.\nPagourtzis’ family said in a statement it was “saddened and dismayed” by the shooting and “as shocked as anyone else” by the events. The family said it was cooperating with authorities.\nSadie Rodriguez, the mother of Santa Fe student Shana Fisher who was killed in the attack, has said in media accounts that her 16-year-old daughter had rejected four months of aggressive advances from Pagourtzis.\nFisher finally stood up to him and embarrassed him in class, her mother told the Los Angeles Times.\n“A week later he opens fire on everyone he didn’t like,” she said. “Shana being the first one.”\nIn Santa Fe on Sunday, many churches and businesses had signs outside with messages such as “Santa Fe strong” and “Santa Fe ISD we are here for you.”\nAbout 100 people attended an emotional service at the Aldersgate United Methodist Church.\nJared Black, one of the students killed, attended a youth group at the church, and many of its members embraced his mother Pam when the family arrived.
