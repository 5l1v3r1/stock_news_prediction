March's sales pace was revised down to 672,000 units from the previously reported 694,000 units.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11 percent of housing market sales, falling 2.0 percent to a pace of 679,000 units in April.\nThe government also revised sales data going back to 2013. The benchmark revisions showed sales in the first three months of the year not as strong as previously reported.\nNew home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis.
