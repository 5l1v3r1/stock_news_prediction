Higher oil prices and asset sales contributed to the increase.\nPetrobras is at the center of the sprawling corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash. Investigators say construction companies rigged the bidding process for Petrobras contracts and overcharged the oil company. Politicians and executives received kickbacks and bribes from the padded prices.\nThe company reported a net loss in 2017, largely because of payments to settle lawsuits related to the corruption and outstanding debts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-08T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T08:54:59.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
