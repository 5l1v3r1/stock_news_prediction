Apple may stop bundling a headphone jack adapter with new iPhones this year, according to a new report. Apple’s iPhones don’t have headphone jacks, but they instead ship with adapters that let users plug in headphones through the handset’s Lightning charging port. In a move to get customers thinking about wireless headphones, Apple could ditch the adapter altogether , forcing wired headphone owners to buy an adapter separately. Camera technology maker Corephotonics this week sued Apple for allegedly violating its patent related to dual cameras in smartphones. The patent centers on the assembly that keeps the dual camera in place. Corephotonics argues Apple violated its patents in its iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. Last year, Corephotonics sued Apple for alleged patent violating in its iPhone 7 Plus. Apple Watch saved a man’s life last month. The man suffered a ruptured ulcer, causing extensive bleeding. His Apple Watch, which monitors heart rate, told him to immediately seek medical attention. He rushed to the hospital, where his life was saved. He had lost 80% of his blood during the ordeal. Angry MacBook Pro owners this week started a petition for Apple to recall MacBook Pros that it’s shipped since late-2016. They allege that the new keyboard design in the MacBook Pro, called a butterfly keyboard, malfunctions and is sometimes rendered inoperable with keys that don’t move. As of this writing, the petition had secured nearly 6,000 signatures . One more thing… Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri was discovered to have a potty mouth this week when users asked it to define the word “mother.” Its first definition was fine, but when it read the second definition , the response was explicit, to say the least.
