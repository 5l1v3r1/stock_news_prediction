However, Giuliani confessed that accusations of obstructing justice – which largely focus on the circumstances under which Trump's fired former FBI Director James Comey – made him less confident.\n\"The obstruction part, I'm not as comfortable with – the president's fine with it, he's innocent,\" Giuliani told the network.\n\"I'm not as comfortable because it's a matter of interpretation, not a hard and fast 'true or not true. If you interpret his comment about firing Comey … as obstruction rather than removing a guy who was doing a bad job on the recommendation in part of [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein, then you see it as obstructing the investigation.\nHe added: \"And then you can say it's perjury, which is even easier for them which is where I think they're going.\"\nTrump has blasted the entire probe as a partisan \"witch hunt,\" an accusation that Giuliani raised again on Sunday. He blasted Mueller's legal team as a collection of Democrats loyal to former President Barack Obama, and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:09:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
