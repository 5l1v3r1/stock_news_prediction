(“ProPetro” or “the Company”) (NYSE: PUMP) today announced financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights\nTotal revenue for the quarter increased approximately 23% to $385.2 million, compared to $313.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $36.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, as compared to $10.1 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $76.7 million, up 79% from $42.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Frac fleet remained fully utilized, including deployment of two new-build fleets, and an additional 35,000 hydraulic horsepower (“HHP”) into the legacy fleet. Period ending capacity was 815,000 HHP, or 18 fleets – more than a 18% increase as compared to 690,000 HHP at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. In April took delivery and immediately commenced operations of an additional new-build frac fleet bringing total deployed capacity to 860,000 HHP, or 19 fleets. As previously announced, the Company plans to deploy one additional new-build fleet in the fourth quarter of 2018. This addition will increase total frac fleet capacity to 905,000 HHP, or 20 fleets.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure and is described and reconciled to net income (loss) in the table under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nDale Redman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “I am pleased to report that our business is off to a great start in 2018. Through our best in class operations team and close collaboration with our customers, we avoided many of the headwinds that our sector faced in the first quarter. We are especially encouraged by the continued strength in activity in the Permian Basin and strong demand for our fully utilized frac fleet. We will continue to focus on executing at the wellsite to provide our customers with unmatched service as we help them harvest their respective resources in the most active onshore basin in the U.S.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $385.2 million, or almost 23% higher than $313.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to increased fleet size as well as fewer seasonal down days than the prior quarter, leading to improved profitability for the Company’s pressure pumping and other services. During the first quarter of 2018, 97.4% of total revenue was associated with pressure pumping services, which was similar to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCosts of services excluding depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2018 increased to $298.1 million from $262.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher activity levels and fleet size, coupled with an associated increase in headcount. As a percentage of pressure pumping segment revenues, pressure pumping costs of services decreased to 77% from 83% for the fourth quarter of 2017 due to improved pricing and operating leverage as activity increased without a significant corresponding increase in costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense was $11.9 million as compared to $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to higher property taxes, insurance expense and professional fees. General and administrative expense, exclusive of stock-based compensation, was $11.2 million or 2.9% of revenue for the first quarter of 2018.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $36.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, versus $10.1 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased approximately 79% to $76.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $42.8 million in the previous quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2018 was approximately 20%, as compared to approximately 14% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperational Highlights and Fleet Expansion\nActive HHP deployed during the quarter averaged 752,000, or 17.4 fleets, and active HHP at quarter end was 815,000, or 18 fleets. The Company also enhanced its legacy fleets with an additional 35,000 HHP, all of which was deployed by the end of the first quarter, bringing average pressure pumping capacity to approximately 45,000 HHP per fleet. An additional new-build 45,000 HHP fleet commenced operations in April with a dedicated customer bringing active horsepower to date to 860,000, or 19 fleets. As previously announced, to support strong demand for pressure pumping services, ProPetro plans to expand its fracturing capacity by an additional 45,000 HHP, or one fleet, in the fourth quarter of 2018, bringing expected 2018 year-end capacity to 905,000 HHP, or 20 fleets.\nAlso, as previously announced, the Company recently deployed one new build coiled tubing unit and one new build cementing unit, both of which will operate under long-term dedicated agreements. This brings total coiled tubing capacity to three units and total cementing capacity to 16 units. To support growing demand, ProPetro plans to further expand its cementing fleet capacity with two additional new-build units that are targeted to commence operations later this year.\nLiquidity and Capital Spending\nAs of March 31, 2018, total cash was $46.4 million and total debt was $117.3 million. Total liquidity at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was $146.4 million, including cash and $100 million of capacity under the Company’s $200 million revolving credit facility.\nCapital expenditures incurred during the first quarter of 2018 were $80.0 million, which reflects spending on ProPetro’s growth initiatives as well as maintenance capital.\nOutlook\nMr. Redman concluded, “The outlook for E&P activity in the Permian remains strong and the need for efficient pressure pumping services is growing. Our leading position in the basin provides us with unique visibility, and we are responding to our customer’s long-term needs through further targeted expansion of our fleet capacity and driving increased efficiencies at the wellsite. As in the past, our workforce and customer relationships will remain our top focus as we continue to differentiate our brand and service offerings, which will drive further value for our customers, supply chain partners and shareholders.”\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:00 AM Central Time on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 to discuss financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2018 and recent developments.

We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) Pressure\nPumping\nAll Other Total Pressure\nPumping\nAll Other Total Net income (loss) $ 52,934 $ (16,226 ) $ 36,708 $ 20,330 $ (10,252 ) $ 10,078 Depreciation and amortization 17,763 1,173 18,936 15,927 1,099 17,026 Interest expense - 1,261 1,261 - 878 878 Income tax expense - 10,353 10,353 - 3,000 3,000 Loss on disposal of assets 7,828 (163 ) 7,665 10,117 - 10,117 Stock-based compensation - 758 758 - 759 759 Other expense and legal settlement - 231 231 - 233 233 Deferred IPO bonus expense 538 294 832 452 247 699 Adjusted EBITDA $ 79,063 $ (2,319 ) $ 76,744 $ 46,826 $ (4,036 ) $ 42,790\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006648/en/\nProPetro Holding Corp\nSam Sledge, 432-688-0012\nDirector of Investor Relations\nsam.sledge@propetroservices.com\nSource: ProPetro Holding Corp.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.propetroservices.com&esheet=51803082&newsitemid=20180508006648&lan=en-US&anchor=www.propetroservices.com&index=1&md5=d09e96398b937eb7b730a8b8a20aa7d3", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508006648/en/"], "published": "2018-05-09T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T00:53:04.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
