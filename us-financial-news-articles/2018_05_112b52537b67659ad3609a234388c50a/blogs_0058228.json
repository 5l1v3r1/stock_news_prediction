But unlike other popular online games like Activision Blizzard's \"Call of Duty\" franchise, \"Fortnite\" is free to play.\nHow is it that a free game is on pace to make $3.5 billion this year alone?\nIt all comes down to the in-game purchases made by gamers from around the world.

The gaming studio said that it will be funding $100 million in esports prize pools for \"Fortnite.\" WATCH: What we learned about Fortnite from 12-year-olds show chapters", "external_links": ["https://www.superdataresearch.com/us-digital-games-market/"], "published": "2018-05-25T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:12:47.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
