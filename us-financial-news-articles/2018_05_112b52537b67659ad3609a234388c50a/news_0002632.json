(NASDAQ:CRVS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of precisely targeted oncology therapies, today announced financial results , and provided a business update.\n“We made important progress in advancing our clinical programs and building our pipeline, with several notable developments in the first quarter that reinforce our continued leadership in the development of therapies targeting the adenosine pathway,” said Richard A. Miller, M.D., co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Corvus. “We are now enrolling patients in our Phase 1/1b trial evaluating CPI-006 as a monotherapy, in combination with CPI-444 and in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab). We believe this is the first human clinical trial in oncology to evaluate the effect of dual-blockade of the adenosine pathway by inhibiting both CD73 and the A2A receptor. With the initiation of this new trial and our ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial with our A2A receptor antagonist CPI-444, we continue to have one of the most advanced programs addressing the adenosine pathway. Our clinical trials with CPI-444 are expanding in both renal cell and lung cancer and are designed to evaluate its use in earlier lines of therapy.”\nRecent Achievements\nCPI-444: A2A Receptor Antagonist of Adenosine\nAmended the clinical trial protocol for the ongoing Phase 1/1b clinical trial evaluating CPI-444, the Company’s lead product candidate, administered alone and in combination with Genentech’s Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in up to 50 patients with renal cell cancer (RCC) who have failed no more than two prior treatment regimens, which must have included an anti-PD-(L)1 and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Prior to this amendment, RCC patients were eligible and enrolled with up to five (median three) prior treatments regimens. Continued enrolling patients in the Phase 1b/2 trial, being conducted by Genentech as part of their MORPHEUS platform, which is evaluating CPI-444 and Tecentriq in up to 60 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed no more than two prior regimens.\nCPI-006: Anti-CD73 Antibody\nAs recently announced, initiated the Phase 1/1b clinical trial evaluating CPI-006, the Company’s anti-CD73 antibody, as a single agent and in combination with CPI-444, and in combination with pembrolizumab. The trial is anticipated to enroll up to 350 patients and is designed to select the dose and evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, immune biomarkers and efficacy in patients with NSCLC, RCC, and other cancers who have failed standard therapies.\nPreclinical\nAdvanced Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies and additional preclinical trials in spontaneous canine T-cell lymphoma for the Company’s interleukin-2–inducible kinase (ITK) inhibitor and progressed scale-up manufacturing activities in preparation for an anticipated IND filing in late 2018.\nCorporate\nRaised $64.9 million in net proceeds in March 2018 through an underwritten public offering, broadening our investor base.\nFinancial Results\nAt March 31, 2018, Corvus had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $143.9 million. This compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $90.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses for the three months totaled $12.1 million compared to $13.5 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $1.4 million was primarily due to the payment of a $3.0 million milestone related to CPI-444 2017, partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in drug manufacturing costs for CPI-006 and an increase of $0.7 million in personnel costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months totaled $2.5 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease of $0.2 million was primarily due to a decrease of $0.4 million in patent and public company expenses, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in personnel costs.\nThe net loss for the three months was $14.3 million compared to $16.0 million for the same period in 2017. Total stock compensation expense for the three months was $1.8 million compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2017.\nAbout Corvus Pharmaceuticals\nCorvus Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of precisely targeted oncology therapies. Corvus’ lead product candidate, CPI-444, a small molecule inhibitor of the A2A receptor, is currently being evaluated in a multicenter Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with various solid tumors. This successive expansion cohort trial is examining the activity of CPI-444 both as a single agent and in combination with Genentech’s atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody. Corvus is conducting the trial with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, under a clinical trial collaboration the two companies entered into in October 2015. In May 2017, Corvus and Genentech expanded the collaboration and are now conducting a trial of CPI-444 and atezolizumab in patients with NSCLC who have failed prior therapies with anti-PD-(L)1 and platinum based chemotherapy. Corvus is evaluating a second product candidate, CPI-006, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD73, in a multicenter Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with various solid tumors.

Adenosine, a metabolite of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate), is produced within the tumor microenvironment where it may bind to the adenosine A2A receptor present on immune cells and block their activity. CD39 and CD73 are enzymes on the surface of tumor cells and immune cells. These enzymes work in concert to convert ATP to adenosine. In vitro and preclinical studies have shown that dual blockade of CD73 and the A2A receptor may be synergistic.\nAbout CD73 and Adenosine\nCD73 is a cell surface enzyme whose function is to convert adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine by removing phosphate from AMP. CD73 is expressed on cells of the immune system, including T-cells and B-cells. CD73 is also present on many tumors, including lung, renal, melanoma, colon, prostate, breast and others. In the tumor microenvironment, CD73 produces adenosine, which binds to the adenosine A2A receptor on immune cells and inhibits various immune responses including those directed against the tumor. Tumors utilize this immunosuppressive mechanism to escape attack by the immune system.\nAbout CPI-006\nCPI-006 is a potent humanized monoclonal antibody that reacts with the active site of CD73, blocking the conversion of AMP to adenosine. In vitro studies of CPI-006 have shown it is capable of substantially inhibiting the production of adenosine by blocking the CD73 enzyme.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements related to the potential safety and efficacy of CPI-144 and CPI-006, the Company’s ability to develop and advance product candidates into and successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the Company’s Phase 1/1b clinical trial of CPI-444, the Company’s Phase 1/1b clinical trial of CPI-006 and the Company’s IND-enabling studies of its ITK inhibitor, the basis for and the timing of any future clinical trials of the Company’s ITK inhibitor and the utility of biomarker data collected and the suitability of dosing regimen selected for clinical trials.
