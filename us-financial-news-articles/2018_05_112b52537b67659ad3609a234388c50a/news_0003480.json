Authorities from both countries are continuing to search for the missing men.\nMedia reports, citing survivors, said that the fishermen were forced to jump in the sea, some with weights tied to their legs.\nPiracy has long been rife in the waters off the tiny nations of Suriname and Guyana, as well as neighboring Venezuela.\n“We have been very successful over the last three years in curbing piracy. This has come as a setback,” Guyana President David Granger said.\nHis counterpart in Suriname, President Desi Bouterse, has yet to speak publicly on the subject, spurring criticisms of a lack of response from the government.\nJerry Slijngard, who coordinates Suriname’s disaster management center, said that victims’ families would be supported by the government.\n“The exchange of information, patrols by maritime police and the deployment of technology ... will contribute to reducing this form of crime,” he said in a statement.\nAnother boat was attacked off Suriname on Wednesday, according to a fishermen’s association, who said the captain was shot dead but the rest of the crew survived.\nReporting by Ank Kuipers in Paramaribo and Neil Marks in Georgetown; writing by Girish Gupta, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\nOur ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T02:05:29.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
