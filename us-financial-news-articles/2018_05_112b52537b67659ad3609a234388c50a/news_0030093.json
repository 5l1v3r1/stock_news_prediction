But the measured stalled briefly in the House, where Republican leaders sought additions to further ease rules on banks.\nHouse Republican leaders agreed to move on the bill after the Senate said it would separately consider additional legislation to make it easier for companies to raise capital, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\nAmong its provisions, the bill would raise the threshold at which banks are considered systemically risky and subject to stricter oversight to $250 billion from $50 billion. It also exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets from rules banning proprietary trading, as well as exempts smaller banks from several other post-crisis rules.\nProponents of the bill argue it eases rules for smaller banks that were not central to the last crisis, freeing them up to offer additional loans. But critics, including most congressional Democrats, oppose easing any rules on banks, warning it increases the risks of future bank failures.
