On that Sunday, I was seven shots back going into the last day.\nGolf - European Tour - BMW PGA Championship - Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, Britain - May 23, 2018 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy during the Pro-AM Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs “I didn’t expect to win. I just wanted to go out and play a good final round. It did snowball from there and I got on to a nice little bit of a hot streak, and I’d love to be able to do something like that again.\n“I’ve got a busy summer coming up... three major championships and Ryder Cup, and everything else. So maybe this could be the spark that gets that all going again.”\nMcIlroy has not had it all his own way at Wentworth in the past, missing the cut on several occasions, and the course has undergone a multi-million pound revamp since his last appearance.\n“It’s a course where if you’re not quite on, you can get frustrated easily and sort of let it go from there,” he said.\n“I’ve had my fair share of bad play here but I still feel like I’ve played well enough to have some good memories and draw on some good experiences.\n“It’s a bit of a new course, especially for me and some of the other guys over the last couple years. I think if I can hit the ball the way I know that I can and control my shots into these greens, I’ll have a chance.”\nReporting by Simon Jennings, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-23T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-23T21:08:09.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
