Video from the scene showed a demonstrator in a green shirt hanging onto the vehicle's hood as it moved through the gathering. No injuries were reported.\nThe UC system, which includes five medical centers and three national laboratories, has 190,000 faculty and staff and 238,000 students.\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-07T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T02:23:05.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
