Euro zone money markets now price roughly a 75 percent chance of a 10 basis point hike from the European Central Bank by mid-2019, scaling back bets on a rate rise given a softening in economic data and inflation.\nWorries about political uncertainty in Italy, which faces fresh elections, is also weighing on the single currency.\nThe euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.1828 versus the dollar, bringing its year-to-date losses to 1.4 percent.\nThe euro has already lost 2 percent of its value in May as investors betting on a falling dollar were caught out and rushed to cover their positions, further pushing the greenback higher.\nThe dollar index rose 0.3 percent to 93.377, its strongest since late December.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar rose 0.6 percent to 109.74 .\nTrump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.\nSentiment towards the euro cooled after Italian President Sergio Mattarella’s call to bickering political parties to rally behind a “neutral government” were met with immediate opposition and raised the prospect of elections being held as early as July.\n“The dollar is in a firm position to gain against its European peers as rhetoric from central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of England is perceived to have turned dovish,” said Shin Kadota, senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nThe Swiss franc, traditionally a safe-haven currency, fell 0.2 percent versus the dollar but gained 0.1 percent against the euro. It had hit a three-week high against the euro on Tuesday.\nThe Australian dollar extended its overnight slide to touch an 11-month low of $0.7415.\nPressured by the dollar’s broad strength, the Aussie has weakened despite an upbeat budget from the country’s government.
