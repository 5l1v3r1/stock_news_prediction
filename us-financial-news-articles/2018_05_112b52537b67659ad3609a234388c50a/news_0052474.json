The cloud-based reporting solution experienced significant year-over-year growth. As part of Quorum Software, WellEz On Demand is expected to triple its new customers in 2018.\n\"We see two distinct cohorts among upstream operators. The first being established companies looking inwards and realizing they need to focus on execution and get out of the capital-intensive business of managing software. The second is PE-backed startups that have no appetite for a large IT installation but have the same usability requirements as established operators. Both groups have identified and adopted WellEz On Demand in record numbers,\" said James Morley, Director of Customer Success for Quorum.\n\"Quorum's investment in WellEz On Demand following the acquisition is allowing us to add substantial bandwidth to our product roadmap with multiple parallel development projects. We're very excited to start rolling these out to our customers in the near future,\" said Morley.\nWellEz On Demand joins Quorum's cloud-based land, accounting and production management solutions to offer an integrated upstream suite that is proven, affordable and fast.

WellEz On Demand helps us with both,\" Dan Wingerson, Director IT â€“ Applications and Data Management, Alta Mesa Operating. \"The ability to access KPIs from any computer or device gives me all the data I need to run my crew right at my fingertips.
