It's all about your personal budget. The timeline of when you send your gift, however, does matter.\nAlthough it's commonly said that you have up to a year after attending a wedding to send a gift, the conventions have changed. \"It used to be true,\" Lizzie Post, etiquette expert and co-host of Emily Post's \"Awesome Etiquette\" podcast , tells CNBC Make It . \"You used to have a year because everything took longer.\"\nBut today's digital world is much more fast-paced. Now, you should aim to have your gift delivered by the three-month mark. \"It allows the couple to get their wedding thank-you notes out within six months of the wedding,\" Post says.\nOther experts agree that it's polite to send your gift as close to the wedding as possible.\n\"It's traditional and the best practice to send the wedding gift before the wedding,\" Cheryl Seidel, an etiquette expert and the founder and president of RegistryFinder.com , writes , noting that, if you don't get around to sending it beforehand, one-to-two months afterwards is ideal.\n\"Think about it. If you got married and didn't receive a gift after a few months, wouldn't you assume it wasn't coming?\" she says.\nOf course, it's always better late than never if you don't get something sent out in time. But it makes it easier on both parties to get it out of the way as early as possible.\nDon't miss: Here's exactly how much you should spend on a wedding gift\nLike this story?
