REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino Venezuela owes the vast majority of the nearly 1 billion reais ($281.60 million) owed to Brazil’s BNDES [BNDES.UL] state development bank and also to Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ), payment of which is due May 8.\nThe Brazilian government, under former President Dilma Rousseff, had agreed to act as the guarantor of the loans. The funds were used by Venezuela and Mozambique to pay works carried out by Brazilian firms.\nBrazilian President Michel Temer had earlier warned that if Congress did not approve covering the payment, the government would have been considered as having defaulted on the loans.\nReporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T05:12:15.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
