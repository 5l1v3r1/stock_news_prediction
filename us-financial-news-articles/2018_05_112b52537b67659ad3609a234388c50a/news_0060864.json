Walmart will subsidize tuition, books and fees and provide support with the application and enrollment processes. As many as 68,000 employees might sign up, Walmart executives estimated. They declined to disclose the potential cost of the program.\n“Many of our associates don’t have the opportunity to complete a degree,” said Drew Holler, Walmart’s U.S. vice president of people innovation, in an interview. “We felt strongly that this is something that would improve their lives and help us run a better business.”\nThe tuition program — offered to part-time staff as well as full-timers — is the latest move by Walmart to improve employee retention and engagement. Earlier this year, the company boosted its starting hourly wage to $11, expanded its maternity and parental leave policy and added an adoption benefit. The newest offer comes three years after Starbucks Corp. said it would pay full tuition for its workers, rather than just partially foot the bill. Three Schools\nThe Walmart and Sam’s Club employees can choose from three schools that focus on adult learning: the University of Florida, California’s Brandman University or Bellevue University in Nebraska. Courses can be taken at the campuses or online, Walmart said, and there is no penalty for courses already taken if an employee leaves the company while enrolled in school. There’s also no requirement to continue working at Walmart for any period after receiving the degree.\nWalmart estimates that as many as 5 percent of its U.S. workforce could take advantage of the college program. The company currently offers subsidized programs to help employees get their high-school diploma.\nAcademic counseling will be provided by Guild Education, a company that helps large employers extend education benefits.\nStarbucks said it hopes to have 25,000 employees graduate from Arizona State University by 2025 as part of its free four-year college tuition program. Chairman Howard Schultz said last year that Starbucks was the first American company to offer free four-year tuition for all its employees.
