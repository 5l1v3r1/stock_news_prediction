The firms were previously seized for links to the network of the Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen.\nThe liquidation by the state-run TMSF does not include Dumankaya’s construction arm. The TMSF is in talks with a German firm to complete Dumankaya’s construction projects halted after the coup attempt, its head said last week.
