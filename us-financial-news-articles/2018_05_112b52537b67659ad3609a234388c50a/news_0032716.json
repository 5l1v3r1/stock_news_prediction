If that term is also upheld, the sentences will run successively for a total of 31 years in prison.\nAnother PetroVietnam official, Trinh Xuan Thanh, withdrew an appeal against the life sentence he received in the same case at the January trial, his lawyer said.\nLast week, the Communist Party of Vietnam said that Thanh, whom Germany has said was kidnapped from Berlin in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, withdrew his appeal because of “health conditions”.\nHis lawyer, Nguyen Van Quynh, said Thanh did not have any health issues ahead of the appeal trial.\nReporting by Khanh Vu; Editing by James Pearson and Clarence Fernandez\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
