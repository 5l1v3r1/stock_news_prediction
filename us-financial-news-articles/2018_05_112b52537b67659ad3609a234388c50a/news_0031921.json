The British embassy to Israel is based in Tel Aviv and we have no plans to move it,” the spokesman told reporters.\nHe was speaking on a day when the United States was due to open its embassy in Jerusalem, an event that has led to Palestinian protests. Israeli gunfire killed two Palestinians and wounded at least 35 other protesters along the Gaza border on Monday, health officials said.
