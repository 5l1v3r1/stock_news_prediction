They also ransacked shops, torched cars and scrawled anti-capitalist graffiti on walls before eventually being dispersed by police.\nInterior Minister Gerard Collomb condemned the violence and said everything was being done to apprehend the culprits.\nGovernment spokesman Benjamin Griveaux criticized the protesters for covering their faces. “When you have sincere convictions, you demonstrate with your face unmasked,” he said. “Those who wear hoods are the enemies of democracy.”\nThe protesters chanted anti-fascist slogans, waved old Soviet flags and anti-government banners and threw firecrackers. Some started to erect barricades.\nDavid Le Bars, a police union official, told BFM TV that security services had opted to let the protesters smash things rather than engage them to avoid casualties on either side that could exacerbate tensions.

When you come with Molotov cocktails, it’s to burn cops,” he said, pointing to clashes on May 1 last year that saw one police officer seriously burnt. DISCONTENT\nUnder a union campaign to foil Macron’s economic reforms, railway staff have begun three months of nationwide rolling strikes against a planned overhaul of state-run railway SNCF.\nDiscontent over Macron’s policies has spread beyond the railways and the May Day protests were intended to send a message of defiance to the former investment banker, who is currently on a trip to Australia.\nEarlier on Tuesday Macron reiterated that he would not back down on his reform agenda.\nUnions put the number of peaceful protesters at Tuesday’s main May Day rally in Paris at about 55,000, though police put it at around 20,000. The numbers were relatively small compared to other recent demonstrations.\nPolice said the Black Blocs had mixed into a second rally of 14,500 people set up alongside the official union movement.\nOpposition conservative and far-right politicians accused Macron’s government of being insufficiently prepared for the violent protests and criticized it for not cracking down more heavily on anarchists.
