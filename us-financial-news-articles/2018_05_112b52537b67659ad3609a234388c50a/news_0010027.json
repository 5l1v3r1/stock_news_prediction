President Tayyip Erdogan, a self-described “enemy of interest rates”, has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs to boost the economy.\nThe central bank’s unwillingness to tighten via its benchmark one-week repo rate - it has been using its late liquidity window - has only strengthened the perception that it is avoiding outright increases because of political pressure.\n“For a long time, markets have been waiting for the simplification of monetary policy,” said Inan Demir, senior emerging markets economist at Nomura International.\n“Expectations that the simplification will take place after the June 7 meeting have surely strengthened. If we don’t see the simplification step, we might face pressure on the lira.”\nTurkey’s central bank is due to have its next policy-setting meeting on June 7.\nINFLATION FORECAST The lira has fallen some 7 percent this year, hitting a series of record lows against both the dollar and the euro, and making it one of the world’s worst-performing emerging market currencies.\nThe central bank lifted its year-end inflation forecast to 8.4 percent from 7.9 percent, citing expectations for higher prices of oil and imports.\nFor 2019, it stuck to its target of 6.5 percent, while maintaining a 5 percent outlook for the medium term.\nDouble-digit inflation, which has been stoked by chronic weakness in the lira, remains one of the most pressing problems for the economy. It was at 10.23 percent in March.\n“The tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until the inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and consistent with targets,” Cetinkaya said.\nThe central bank last week lifted its top interest rate by a more-than-expected 75 basis points to 13.5 percent, although some economists have said that a greater increase is needed to put a floor under the lira.
