It announced a record interim dividend of A$3.20 per share, up 14 percent.\nMacquarie shares jumped to a record high before closing 0.2 percent higher, while the broader market was 0.5 lower.\nDubbed the “millionaire’s factory” due to the salaries of its most successful executives, the Sydney-based bank makes money from M&A advisory and fees and trading commodities such as shares, currency and oil.\nIts biggest-earning asset management unit collects fees based on the performance of its global funds, which are meant to be a less volatile source of income. MIC IMPAIRMENT\nMIC unexpectedly cut dividends by 30 percent in February after one of its five businesses lost key clients, prompting a group of investors led by New York-based Moab Capital to demand a reshuffle of the fund’s board.\nThe fund has lost 40 percent of its market value since then, with disgruntled investors claiming the fund manager has misled them and is funnelling hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to the parent, Moab director Michael Rothenberg told Reuters.\nMacquarie, which manages MIC on behalf of shareholders as part of its A$495 billion asset management business, took a A$191 million impairment expense on its investments, largely driven by its MIC holdings. Despite the hit, the unit posted a 10 percent jump in profit to A$1.69 billion.\nMIC had issued a response on Wednesday disputing the claims and urging investors to vote for all directors at the shareholder meeting on May 16.\nOn Friday, Moore was unable to say whether the controversy had affected the bank’s fund-raising efforts in the United States.\nThe profit contribution from its banking and financial services division also rose to A$560 million, from A$513 million the previous year.\nThe contribution of its commodities and global markets unit fell 6 percent to A$910 million, as a year of low market volatility and tight credit spreads hurt its financial markets business.
