Bouchard and another mediator, appointed in November, will set dates for future negotiations.\nAlcoa, which holds its annual meeting May 9, owns 74.95 percent of the Becancour, Quebec smelter and Rio Tinto holds the remainder.\nReporting by Susan Taylor; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-05T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-05T12:11:42.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
