Lenders have booked large losses due to soured loans in recent years following a deep recession, accumulating tax credits towards the state.\n“Plans to simplify the tax system ... could reduce the value of lenders’ tax credits,” he said.\nShares in mid-tier Credito Valtellinese, which is known as Creval and has one of the largest exposure among listed banks to Italian bonds relative to both its total assets and capital, sank further after a 5.8 percent drop on Friday.\nEarlier this year, Creval raised eight times its market value in cash from investors to strengthen its balance sheet but it still in the process of shedding bad debts.\nA plan to make it harder for banks to recover debt from retail borrowers, included in a programme agreed last week by the League and the 5MS, has also hit shares.\nItaly’s biggest loan collector DoBank fell 4.5 percent, taking its losses over the past week to 20 percent.
