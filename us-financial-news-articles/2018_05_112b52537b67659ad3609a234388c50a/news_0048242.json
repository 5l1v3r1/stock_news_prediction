In addition, he is giving supervisors paid time off and all employees paid sick leave.\nMason told a local television station that he was raising wages to attract people looking for long-term opportunities and people with families. Chick-fil-A is known for conservative and traditional values such as closing on Sundays across all locations. Those values have landed the restaurant chain in hot water before: in 2012, then-CEO Dan Cathy said Chick-fil-A supported the “biblical definition of the family unit” and that marriage equality was “inviting God’s judgement,” leading to protests and a national boycott .\nCalifornia’s minimum wage is currently $11 per hour, but it is rising to $15 per hour by 50 cent increments each year until 2022. According to a living wage calculator created by Dr. Amy K. Glasmeier at MIT, the current living wage for one adult and one child in Sacramento County is $25.90.", "external_links": ["http://uk.businessinsider.com/chick-fil-a-reinvents-itself-liberal-conservative-2017-5", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.ajc.com/news/national/california-chick-fil-raises-hourly-wages-from/ehSmpUi18hFTfs6fiyPe2M/", "http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/06067", "https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank"], "published": "2018-05-29T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-29T12:56:22.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
