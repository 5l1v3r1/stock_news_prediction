We saw lower equity, higher bond yields and falling currency in many emerging market countries,” Alain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients.\nCurrencies fared more mixed with many struggling to booking gains against a weaker dollar on the day and some on track for losses over the month.\nIndonesia’s rupiah strengthened 0.8 percent to a one-month high after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the second time in two weeks on Wednesday and opened the door for further hikes to boost the fragile currency and contain capital outflows.\nBut Turkey’s lira weakened 0.3 percent, retreating from the near two-week highs reached on Wednesday in the wake of a number of central bank emergency measures and ignoring the latest data showing the number of foreign visitors in Turkey surged 28 percent year-on-year in April.\nThe lira is still set to end the month down almost 10 percent, its worst performance since November 2016.\nThe Mexican peso weakened 0.3 percent after an opinion poll showed presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador extending his lead well beyond his nearest rivals with just a month to go before the July 1 election.\nObrador, a runner-up in the previous two elections, though fears that he could destabilize the economy contributed to his defeat. Yet this time frustration over corruption, rising violence and tepid growth have all helped lift his bid, but his ascent has sent jitters through markets.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see Reporting and graphic by Karin Strohecker", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-05-31T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T12:43:35.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
