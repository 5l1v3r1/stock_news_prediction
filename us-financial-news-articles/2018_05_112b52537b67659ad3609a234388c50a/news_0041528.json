FILE PHOTO: The new Chamber of Deputies president, Five Stars Movement (M5S) Roberto Fico speaks at the Chamber of Deputies during the second session day since the March 4 national election in Rome, Italy March 24, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile\nItalian banks were laid low by a deep recession and the sector teetered on the edge of a full-blown crisis for years until last summer’s state bailout of Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ).\nThe plan signed off by leaders of the League and the 5-Star Movement, the two parties that won the most parliamentary seats in the March 4 election, called for Monte dei Paschi to be given a new “mission” to serve the community, scrapping its turnaround plan in a potential blow to euro zone stability.\nThe EU Commission urged Italy to stick to its commitments over the state-owned bank, saying it was monitoring the implementation of the rescue deal.\nItalian lenders are under pressure because of their remaining large exposure to domestic sovereign bonds, whose yields jumped to their highest level in more than seven months on the spending-boosting plans of the new coalition.\nThey were also hurt by a reference to debt recovery rules in the plan, which hit loan collectors such as DoBank ( DOB.MI ), Cerved ( CERV.MI ) and Banca IFIS ( IF.MI ) as well, pushing the latter two to their lowest level in more than a year.\nThe new government pledged to abolish any rules that allow banks to claw back money from retail borrowers without previous judicial authorisation.\n“If this means you need to get an authorisation before ringing up a borrower, then recoveries would become much lengthier, costlier and more uncertain,” said Christian Arsenio, Chief Executive of small debt collector Distressed Technologies.

The scheme runs out in September and it will be up to the new government whether to renew it.\n“It makes little sense what the programme says in relation to bad debts, but what’s scary is precisely the little knowledge those words betray,” the head of an Italian bad loan specialist said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe government pact mentions retail borrowers while more than two thirds of Italy’s soured bank loans are corporate.\nShares in Banco BPM ( BAMI.MI ), Creval ( PCVI.MI ), UBI Banca ( UBI.MI ) and BPER Banca ( EMII.MI ) all fell 6 percent by 1331 GMT, against a 2.6 percent drop in Italy’s banking sector.\nRising government bond yields increase borrowing costs for lenders and curtail the value of banks’ sovereign holdings.\nItalian banks have reduced their stock of domestic government bonds after the sovereign debt crisis but Creval and Banco Popolare both hold Italian bonds equivalent to more than twice their core capital, according to analysts.\nShares in Monte dei Paschi fell 0.9 percent after an 8.9 percent drop the previous day. The stock is down nearly 40 percent since returning to trade in Milan following a 10-month hiatus.\nFor years the biggest threat to Italy’s financial stability, Monte dei Paschi is slowly trying to recover from years of mismanagement and huge loan losses after an 8 billion euro rescue last year which handed Rome a 68 percent stake and also turned some bondholders into shareholders.\nThe League’s economic spokesman Claudio Borghi on Thursday said the new mission for the bank would entail dropping a plan to close branches, which Monte dei Paschi is pursuing to meet profit targets agreed with EU competition authorities.\nBorghi said a new government would likely replace current Chief Executive Marco Morelli, who last week beat forecasts with a first-quarter net profit of 188 million euros thanks to cost cutting and shrinking loan losses.
