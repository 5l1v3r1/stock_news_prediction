REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo/File Photo The Florence-based group, which issued a profit warning in December, has been battling falling sales and profitability, partly due to a clean-up of inventories.\nThe shoemaker parted ways with Chief Executive Eraldo Poletto in March a year after he unveiled an ambitious plan aimed at refreshing the style of its products and increasing its appeal to a younger clientele.\nFILE PHOTO: Italian luxury fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo's logo is seen at the flagship in Rome, Italy, February 18, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo “We have to work, we still have a lot to do,” executive chairman Ferruccio Ferragamo said on Monday, adding the group was focusing on its organization and products, as well as containing costs.\nFerragamo said the group would press on with the strategy started under Poletto but would put on hold “everything that is very costly”.\nLast month, the family-controlled company appointed a Gucci executive - Micaela Le Divelec - as general manager of the group, postponing the choice of a new CEO.\nFerragamo reiterated he hoped the new CEO would come from within the company.\nThe group said 2018 sales and margins could be undermined by currency swings and an unfavorable distribution of sales through its various sales channels, after posting first quarter results in line with expectations.\nAlthough like-for-like sales in the first three months of the year were up 0.3 percent, sales in its retail channel - two thirds of total revenues - were down 3.6 percent at current exchange rates.\nThat was partially offset by a rise in wholesale revenues, up 2.6 percent.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti; Editing by Mark Potter\nOur ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-08T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-08T06:19:51.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
