Authorities were in the process of rendering them safe and asked the public to call 911 if they see anything suspicious.\nThe district confirmed an unspecified number of injuries but did not release details. A school police officer was shot, officials said, but there was no immediate word on his condition.\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said he could not be precise about the number of deaths at Santa Fe High School, which went on lockdown around 8 a.m. One person was in custody, and a second person had been detained, he said.\nA law enforcement official has identified a person in custody in the Houston-area school shooting as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the shooting by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.\nA woman who answered the phone at a number associated with the Pagourtzis family declined to speak with the AP.\nShe said: \"Give us our time right now, thank you.\"\nPagourtzis plays on the Santa Fe High School junior varsity football team, and is a member of a dance squad with a local Greek Orthodox church.\n@SheriffEd_HCSO: On the scene now. No longer an active situation. Personnel treating the injured. Info is still preliminary, but there are multiple casualties. @HCSOTexas is on the scene with other law enforcement assisting in the search of the school.\nMichael Farina, 17, said he was on the other side of campus when the shooting began and thought it was a fire drill. He was holding a door open for special education students in wheelchairs when a principal came bounding down the hall and telling everyone to run. Another teacher yelled out, \"It is real.\"\nStudents were led to take cover behind a car shop across the street from the school. Some still did not feel safe and began jumping the fence behind the shop to run even farther away, Farina said.\n\"I debated doing that myself,\" he said.\nshow chapters Texas high school shooting: Sheriff says shooter believed to be student 2 Hours Ago | 01:10 Friday's assault was the deadliest in Texas since a man with an assault rifle attacked a rural church late last year, killing more than two dozen people. It comes three months after the Feb. 14 attack in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17.\nAerial footage showed students standing in a grassy field and three medical helicopters landing at the school in Santa Fe, a city of about 13,000 people roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Houston.\nOne student told Houston television station KTRK in a telephone interview that a gunman came into her first-period art class and started shooting. The student said she saw one girl with blood on her leg as the class evacuated the room.\n\"We thought it was a fire drill at first but really, the teacher said, 'Start running,'\" the student told the television station.\nKTRK-TV ABC13 | AP In this image taken from video emergency personnel and law enforcement officers respond to a high school near Houston after an active shooter was reported on campus, Friday, May 18, 2018, in Santa Fe, Texas. The student said she did not get a good look at the shooter because she was running away. She said students escaped through a door at the back of the classroom.\nAuthorities did not immediately confirm that report.\nVice President Mike Pence said he and President Donald Trump were briefed on the shooting. Pence said the students, families, teachers and all those affected should know: \"'We're with you. You're in our prayers and I know you are in the prayers of the American people.\"\nTrump added in a tweet that that early reports were \"not looking good. God bless all!\"\n@realDonaldTrump: We grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas. To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School – we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever...\nFirst lady Melania Trump also weighed in on Twitter, saying her \"heart goes out to Santa Fe and all of Texas today.\"\nThe shooting was all but certain to re-ignite the national debate over gun regulations. In the aftermath of the Feb. 14 attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, survivors pulled all-nighters, petitioned city councils and state lawmakers, and organized protests in a grass-roots movement.\nWithin weeks, state lawmakers adopted changes, including new weapons restrictions. The move cemented the gun-friendly state's break with the National Rifle Association. The NRA fought back with a lawsuit.\nIn late March, the teens spearheaded one of the largest student protest marches since Vietnam in Washington and inspired hundreds of other marches from California to Japan.\nParkland survivors took to social media to express outrage and heartbreak over the Texas attack.\n\"My heart is so heavy for the students of Santa Fe High School. It's an all too familiar feeling no one should have to experience. I am so sorry this epidemic touched your town — Parkland will stand with you now and forever,\" Marjory Stoneman Douglas student Jaclyn Corin said in a tweet.\nShe also directed her frustration at Trump, writing \"Our children are being MURDERED and you're treating this like a game. This is the 22nd school shooting just this year. DO SOMETHING.\"\nThe calls for tighter gun controls that have swelled since the February mass shooting at a Florida high school have barely registered in gun-loving Texas — at least to this point.\nTexas has some of the country's most permissive gun laws and just hosted the NRA's annual conference earlier this month. In the run-up to Texas' march primaries, gun control was not a main issue with candidates of either party. Republicans did not soften their views on guns, and Democrats campaigned on a range of issues instead of zeroing in on gun violence.\n— CNBC.com contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-18T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T18:19:39.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
