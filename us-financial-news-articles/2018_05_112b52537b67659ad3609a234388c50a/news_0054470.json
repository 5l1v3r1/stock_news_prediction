I am trying my best to come to a conclusion,” he said.\nHe said European measures would need in large part to ensure that oil exports remained the same and that the SWIFT international payments messaging system continued to work for Iran.\nReporting by Francois Murphy; writing by John Irish; editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T13:08:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
