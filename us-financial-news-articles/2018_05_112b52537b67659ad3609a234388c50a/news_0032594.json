To carry out a speedy processing of asylum claims while respecting the rights of those seeking international protection,” he said. The government also planned to hire more staff, including on the islands, he said.\nOn Monday, a dozen human rights groups criticised the bill, which also foresees a shortened appeals procedure for rejected asylum seekers, saying it would lead to slapdash procedures violating refugees’ rights.\nThe bill also allows for the imposition of a ban on asylum-seekers travelling beyond the islands until their claims are processed, which had been lifted by Greece’s top administrative court last month.\nGreece has for years been a gateway to Europe for refugees fleeing violence in the Middle East and beyond, arriving via Turkey before travelling north to wealthier European nations.\nA 2016 European deal with Turkey has stemmed the flow but effectively trapped thousands in Greece until their asylum applications are processed.\nAlthough the number of new arrivals remains well below 2015 levels, the pace has picked up in recent months both through the Greek islands and on Greece’s northern land border with Turkey, United Nations data shows.
