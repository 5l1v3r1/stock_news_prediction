Three significant step-out delineation wells were drilled but not completed as at this date. The wells were positioned to the east and north of Leucrotta’s current development to prove the level of productivity substantially beyond current productive boundaries. Leucrotta will start the completion of these wells in July and report on level of productivity in early fall. The new wells were set up to be completed with higher intensity fracs (40 or 50 frac stages over approximately 1 mile laterals). By the end of the year, the delineation phase for the Lower Montney will be completed.\nFrom an operations perspective, the previous 40 and 50 stage frac wells (8-22 and 9-33) continue to outperform expectations and Leucrotta is very pleased with the longer term production data to date. Production and cash flow reached all time corporate highs due in part to some flush production and favourable commodity prices during the quarter. In Q2 2018, production will be affected by approximately 500 boe/d that was recently shut-in due to pricing and some facility maintenance. This production was flowing through third party facilities and has higher operating costs than average. Leucrotta estimates it will average 3,600 boe/d for 2018.\nLeucrotta continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with net working capital of $13.6 million and no debt at the end of Q1 2018 and has projected to have positive working capital at year-end with an unused bank credit facility of $20 million based on the previously released capital budget of $33 million.\nWe look forward to reporting on the results of the new wells and other business developments in the near future.\nFrequently Recurring Terms\nThe Company uses the following frequently recurring industry terms in this news release: “bbls” refers to barrels, “mcf” refers to thousand cubic feet, and “boe” refers to barrel of oil equivalent. Disclosure provided herein in respect of a boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent has been used for the calculation of boe amounts in this news release. This boe conversion rate is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis news release refers to certain financial measures that are not determined in accordance with IFRS (or “GAAP”). This news release contains the terms “adjusted funds flow”, “adjusted funds flow per share”, “operating netback” “net operating expenses”, and “net transportation expenses” which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. The Company uses these measures to help evaluate its performance.\nManagement uses adjusted funds flow to analyze performance and considers it a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and abandonment obligations and to repay debt, if any. Adjusted funds flow is a non-GAAP measure and has been defined by the Company as cash flow from operating activities excluding the change in non-cash working capital related to operating activities and expenditures on decommissioning obligations. The Company also presents adjusted funds flow per share whereby amounts per share are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding, consistent with the calculation of net earnings (loss) per share. Adjusted funds flow is reconciled from cash flow from operating activities under the heading “Adjusted Funds Flow” in the Company’s MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nManagement considers operating netback an important measure as it demonstrates its profitability relative to current commodity prices. Operating netback, which is calculated as average unit sales price less royalties, net operating expenses, and net transportation expenses, represents the cash margin for every barrel of oil equivalent sold. Operating netback per boe is reconciled to net earnings (loss) per boe under the heading “Operating Netback”.\nNet operating expenses is calculated as operating expenses less processing revenues. Management uses net operating expenses to determine the current periods’ cash cost of operating expenses less processing revenue and net operating expenses per boe is used to measure operating efficiency on a comparative basis. The measure approximates the Company’s operating expenses relative to its produced volumes by excluding third party operating costs.\nNet transportation expenses is calculated as transportation expenses less marketing revenues. Management uses net transportation expenses to determine the current periods’ cash cost of transportation expenses less marketing revenue and net transportation expenses per boe is used to measure transportation efficiency on a comparative basis as well as the Company’s ability to mitigate the cost of excess committed capacity.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
