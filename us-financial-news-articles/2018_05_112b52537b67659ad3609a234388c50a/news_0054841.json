The large number of Russians in the city has earned it the nickname \"Londongrad,\" and speculation over the source of that affluence.\nThe foreign affairs committee said the city was like a \"laundromat\" for Russia's corrupt assets.\nTasked with examining what action the British government could take against the proceeds of Russian corruption being funneled into the country, the committee made several recommendations that it said could strengthen anti-money laundering strategies.\nThese included strengthening sanctions against individuals closely connected to hostile regimes, where appropriate, and linking sanctions relief to changes in Russia's behavior. It also called for accelerated legislation to establish a register of ownership for overseas companies that could expose individuals who purchase U.K. property through offshore shell companies, disguising their identities and the \"potentially corrupt\" sources of their funding.\nMost of all, the committee said that the U.K.'s current sanctions regime against Russia, could be strengthened in order to put more pressure on the Kremlin to \"to change its aggressive and destabilizing behavior.\"\nTimothy Ash, a senior emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, told CNBC that there will questions as to what the U.K. can do, without coordination with the U.S. and European allies.\n\"That said, I think most people would accept there is considerable scope for the U.K. to tighten the regulatory environment around capital inflows, including perhaps tightening KYC ('know your customer' rules) around such entities. The rules/regulations are arguably already in place, they just need to be policed with more vigor,\" Ash said.\nThe committee said that anti-corruption legislation — the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill — that is currently entering the final stages of its passage through parliament was an important opportunity to assess \"the strengths and weaknesses of our existing sanctions regime, and to ensure that sanctions remain an effective part of the U.K.'s foreign policy toolkit.\"\nThe foreign affairs committee, which is made up of a select group of members of the U.K. parliament, said that the size of London's financial markets and their importance to Russian investors \"gives the U.K. considerable leverage over the Kremlin,\" and that the government should work with the EU and U.S. \"to prohibit the purchase of bonds in which a sanctioned entity has acted as book-runner. It should also seek EU agreement to bar the European clearing houses from making available Russian sovereign debt.\"\nBusiness as usual The report comes at a time of strained relations between Moscow and London. Tensions peaked in March when a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury, England, with a Russian-made Novichok nerve agent . The U.K. government said it was \"highly likely\" that Russia was behind the attack.\nThe episode led to a war of words between the two countries, the mutual expulsion of diplomats and a long list of other nations showing solidarity with the U.K. by doing the same . The Skripals have been discharged from hospital after a long period in intensive care and taken to secret locations.\nMonday's report said that despite the government's \"strong rhetoric\" following the Skripal attack, \"President Putin's allies have been able to exploit gaps in the sanctions and anti-money laundering regimes that allow them to hide and launder assets in London.\"\nThis, it said, \"undermines the strength and unity of the global diplomatic response to Russian state actions, threatens U.K. national security, and helps to enable corrupt kleptocrats to steal from the Russian people.\"\nCNBC has contacted the Kremlin but has yet to receive a response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T11:53:02.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
