Italy's president is opposing the appointee.\nPolitical risk also reared its head in Spain, where a threat of no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sent Spanish stocks and bond prices plunging.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.05 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.29 percent.\nWhile yields on German and U.S. bonds fell amid the uncertainty, there have been few signs of a wide-ranging sell-off in higher-risk assets - Wall Street's volatility index stayed near four-month lows.\n\"Market reaction to heightened political risk remains reasonably muted,\" Indosuez Wealth Management global head of economic research Marie Owens Thomsen said.\nShe cited the example of Turkey and Italy, where a stock and bond sell-off has not spilled much into other emerging economies or euro zone states.\nHowever, worry about Italy kept the euro under pressure against the dollar.\nThe dollar index rose 0.48 percent, with the euro down 0.53 percent to $1.1657.\nThe dollar has rebounded after touching two-week lows versus a basket of currencies on Thursday, helped by gains against commodity-linked currencies, as oil prices fell.\nElsewhere, worries that investors could shift assets from emerging markets to higher-yielding U.S. bonds have been a major headwind for emerging markets this year. Turkey has been the worst hit.\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney Editing by Nick Zieminski, Chizu Nomiyama and Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-26T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:22:30.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
