Shareholders were also assessing any potential impact from the kingdom’s anti-corruption drive, two sources told Reuters in January.\nThe steps still to be agreed include completion of confirmatory due diligence, finalisation of the merger deal and agreement on a number of other commercial issues, the banks said.\nBased on the preliminary agreement, Alawwal shareholders would receive 0.485 SABB shares for each Alawwal bank share, they said.\nBased on the exchange ratio and the closing price of 33.5 riyals ($8.93) per SABB share on Monday, the last trading day prior to the date of this announcement, the merger would value each Alawwal bank share at 16.3 riyals and Alawwal’s existing issued ordinary share capital at approximately 18.6 billion riyals, the statement said. This represents a premium of 28.5 percent to the Alawwal Bank share price, the banks said.\n“[The] merger would be a win-win situation. It would create the third-largest bank in the kingdom in terms of assets and net profit, which could reach 5.9 billion riyals annually,” said Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital.
