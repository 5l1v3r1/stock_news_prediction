(NYSE: TCS) (the “Company”), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017:\nConsolidated net sales were $232.8 million, up 5.3%. Net sales in The Container Store retail business were $214.1 million, up 5.3%. Elfa International AB third-party net sales were $18.7 million, up 4.8%, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Comparable store sales were up 2.7% with Custom Closets contributing strongly to the increase, largely due to the success of Our Annual elfa® Sale. Consolidated net loss per share (“EPS”) was ($0.01), inclusive of a $0.18 per share net provisional expense from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), compared with consolidated net income per share of $0.17 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income per share (“Adjusted EPS”) was $0.18 compared with $0.18 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table).\n“We are very pleased to have concluded our fiscal 2017 with our strongest quarter of comparable store sales performance of the year, driven by an acceleration in our important Custom Closets business as well as in our other product categories. This improvement is primarily the result of our sales revitalization and optimization initiatives, and was accompanied by gross margin expansion of 100 basis points and 20 basis points of SG&A leverage, despite some timing factors that impacted profitability in the fourth quarter and are expected to benefit fiscal 2018,” said Melissa Reiff, Chief Executive Officer.\n“In fiscal 2018 we remain committed to driving improved performance on both the top and the bottom line as we build on the progress we have made across each of our key strategic priorities, particularly our Optimization Plan executed in fiscal 2017 that is expected to generate substantial benefits in fiscal 2018. We plan to continue our disciplined approach to expense management and capital allocation, and expect to open two new stores and relocate two existing stores this year. In addition, we have begun to invest in a second distribution center which is anticipated to become operational in late fiscal 2019, as well as continued technology and marketing investments that are designed to further enhance the customer experience and improve efficiency,” Reiff concluded.\n1 See Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table. Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter (thirteen weeks) ended March 31, 2018:\nConsolidated net sales were $232.8 million, up 5.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Net sales in The Container Store retail business (“TCS”) were $214.1 million, up 5.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in comparable store sales of 2.7%, as well as an increase in sales from new stores. Elfa International AB (“Elfa”) third party net sales were $18.7 million, up 4.8% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily due to a positive impact from foreign currency translation, which increased third-party sales by 9.0%, partially offset by lower sales in the Nordic markets during the quarter. Consolidated gross margin was 58.6%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. TCS gross margin increased 110 basis points to 57.1%, as lower cost of goods associated with the Optimization Plan and the benefit of favorable foreign currency contracts were partially offset by a greater portion of sales generated by sale campaigns during the quarter. Elfa gross margin decreased 300 basis points to 39.8% primarily due to higher direct materials costs during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, gross margin increased 100 basis points, as the improvement in TCS gross margin was partially offset by the decline in Elfa gross margin. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased by 4.9% to $104.9 million from $99.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to ongoing savings and efficiency efforts, with a portion of such savings offset by incremental spending, including costs incurred for various projects. Consolidated net interest expense increased 79% to $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 from $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the previously announced amendment of our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in August 2017, which increased the applicable interest rate margins. The consolidated effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 103.1%, as compared to 35.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the provisional amount recorded for the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings in connection with the Tax Act. Consolidated net loss was $0.4 million, or ($0.01) per share (inclusive of $0.18 per share net provisional expense from the Tax Act), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to consolidated net income of $8.4 million, or $0.17 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Consolidated adjusted net income was $8.4 million, or $0.18 per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $8.7 million, or $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $31.1 million compared to $26.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table).\nFor the year (fifty-two weeks) ended March 31, 2018:\nConsolidated net sales were $857.2 million, up 4.5% as compared to fiscal 2016. Net sales at TCS were $787.4 million, up 4.6% as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to new store sales, as well as a 0.9% increase in comparable store sales. Elfa third-party net sales were $69.9 million, up 3.9% compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation during the fiscal year, which increased third party net sales by 4.0%, partially offset by lower sales in the Nordic markets. Consolidated gross margin was 58.0%, a decline of 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2016. TCS gross margin increased 10 basis points to 57.2%, primarily due to lower cost of goods sold associated with the Optimization Plan and the benefit of favorable foreign currency contracts, partially offset by a greater portion of sales generated by merchandise campaigns and higher costs associated with our installation services business. Elfa gross margin declined 180 basis points primarily due to higher direct materials costs. On a consolidated basis, gross margin declined 10 basis points, as the improvement in TCS gross margin was more than offset by the decline in Elfa gross margin. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 6.1% to $411.7 million from $387.9 million in fiscal 2016. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 70 basis points. The increase was primarily due to consulting costs incurred as part of the Optimization Plan, which contributed 80 basis points to the increase in fiscal 2017. Additionally, the impact of amended and restated employment agreements entered into with key executives during fiscal 2016, which led to the reversal of accrued deferred compensation associated with the original employment agreements, net of costs incurred to execute the agreements, contributed a 50 basis points benefit in fiscal 2016. This combined 130 basis points year-over-year increase was partially offset by a 60 basis point improvement in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, primarily due to ongoing savings and efficiency efforts, inclusive of savings from the Optimization Plan, partially offset by increased occupancy costs. Pre-opening costs decreased to $5.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $6.9 million in fiscal 2016. The Company opened five new stores (inclusive of one relocation) in fiscal 2017 as compared to seven new stores in fiscal 2016. Consolidated net interest expense increased 50% to $25.0 million in fiscal 2017 from $16.7 million in fiscal 2016 due to the previously announced amendment of our Senior Secured Term Loan Facility in August 2017, which increased the applicable interest rate margins. Additionally, the Company recorded $2.4 million as a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The consolidated effective tax rate was -189.8%, as compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the estimated impact of the Tax Act enacted in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, including the provisional benefit for the remeasurement of deferred tax balances, partially offset by the provisional accrual of the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings. Consolidated net income was $19.4 million, or $0.40 per share (inclusive of $0.33 per share net provisional benefit from the Tax Act), in fiscal 2017 compared to net income of $15.0 million, or $0.31 per share, in fiscal 2016. Consolidated adjusted net income was $13.6 million, or $0.28 per share, in fiscal 2017 compared to adjusted net income of $13.4 million, or $0.28 per share in fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $89.6 million compared to $86.6 million in fiscal 2016 (see Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures table). The Adjusted EBITDA of $86.6 million in fiscal 2016 includes a benefit from the impact of amended and restated employment agreements entered into with key executives during the first quarter of 2016, net of costs incurred to execute the agreements, of $3.9 million.\nBalance sheet and liquidity highlights:\nFiscal Year Ended\n(In thousands) March 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Cash $8,399 $10,736 Total debt, net of deferred financing costs $285,165 $317,471 Liquidity 1 $90,767 $99,594 Free cash flow 2 $34,530 $16,124 1 Cash plus availability on revolving credit facilities 2 See reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures table Outlook\nThe Company is establishing its outlook for fiscal 2018 as follows:\nFiscal 2018 Outlook Net sales $880 million to $890 million New store openings 4, including 2 relocations of existing stores (1) Comparable store sales Flat to up 1% Net income per common share (2) $0.27 to $0.37 Adjusted net income per common share (3) $0.35 to $0.45 Assumed tax rate (4) 30% Estimated share count 49 million (1) The Company opened a new store in Bridgewater, NJ on April 7, 2018 and plans to open a new store in Oklahoma City late in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

Accordingly, the assumed tax rate does not reflect any impact of any potential future adjustments to the provisional amounts initially recorded.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2017 financial results is scheduled for today, May 22, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in a table accompanying this release. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and they should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. These non-GAAP measures are key metrics used by management, the Company’s board of directors, and Leonard Green and Partners, L.P., its controlling stockholder, to assess its financial performance.\nThe Company presents adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they assist investors in comparing the Company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and because the Company believes it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company. These non-GAAP measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using non-GAAP measures supplementally. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe Company defines adjusted net income as net income available to common shareholders before distributions accumulated to preferred shareholders, stock-based compensation and other costs in connection with our IPO, charges related to an Elfa manufacturing facility closure, impairment charges related to intangible assets, losses on extinguishment of debt, certain gains on disposal of assets, certain management transition costs incurred and benefits realized, charges incurred as part of the implementation of our Optimization Plan, and the tax impact of these adjustments and other unusual or infrequent tax items. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. We use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We present adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company.\nWe have included a presentation of adjusted net income for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended April 1, 2017 to show the net impact of the amended and restated employment agreements entered into with key executives during fiscal 2016 (“management transition costs (benefits)”). Although we disclosed the net positive impact of the amended and restated employment agreements in our discussions of earnings per share and SG&A in our earnings press releases in fiscal 2016, we did not include in those press releases a presentation of adjusted net income. However, in the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended March 31, 2018, our Optimization Plan caused us to incur similar charges that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. As a result, we believe that adjusting net income in the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended April 1, 2017 for management transition costs (benefits), in addition to adjusting net income for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended March 31, 2018 for charges incurred as part of the implementation of our Optimization Plan will assist investors in comparing our core operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Likewise, we believe that presenting full year fiscal 2018 adjusted net income guidance will assist investors in evaluating our anticipated financial performance as it relates to our core operations.\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in accordance with its credit facilities and is one of the components for performance evaluation under its executive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items that the Company does not consider in its evaluation of ongoing operating performance from period to period as discussed further below. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in connection with covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, and to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare its performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. The Company believes it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company, its executives and its covenant compliance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry.\nThe Company presents free cash flow, which the Company defines as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period, because it believes it is a useful indicator of the Company’s overall liquidity, as the amount of free cash flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is available for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. Accordingly, we believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our liquidity in the same manner as management. Our definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not solely represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows . Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.\nThe Container Store Group, Inc.
