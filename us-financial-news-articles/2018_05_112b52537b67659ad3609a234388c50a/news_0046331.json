The index has climbed 4% since the start of April. The euro edged up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.1791 while the British pound declined 0.3% to $1.3426.\nInvestors’ expectations that the U.S. will grow faster than other countries has given the dollar a boost lately after a monthslong downturn. A rise in Treasury yields also has boosted the currency lately, with more analysts expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates three more times this year, as opposed to the central bank’s previous projection of two more increases.\nBut on Monday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 3.065% from 3.067% Friday. The 10-year yield hit its highest level since July 2011 last week.\nInvestors Monday were tracking speeches by Fed officials and awaiting minutes from the central bank’s last meeting that are scheduled to be released on Wednesday.\nRelated\nRising Dollar Sparks Tumult in Emerging Markets Analysts also are keeping an eye on developments in emerging markets, as the dollar’s resurgence has pounded assets in countries such as Turkey and Brazil. The U.S. currency rose 1.9% against its Turkish counterpart, with one dollar recently buying 4.5749 lira—a record.\nLee Ferridge, head of macro strategy for North America at State Street Global Markets , said it was a positive for emerging-markets currencies that investors were generally favoring other riskier assets Monday, but he noted that Treasury yields likely would need to stabilize further and economic data abroad would need to pick up to pause the dollar’s rally.\n“I’m not sure we’re going to get all those things, but that’s what would be required,” Mr. Ferridge said.\nAnalysts said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s statement over the weekend that the U.S. was putting a trade war with China “ on hold ” quelled fears that protectionist trade policies would slow the economy’s momentum, potentially giving the dollar a boost moving forward.\n“There’s nothing there to upset the general positive mood on the dollar,” Mr. Ferridge said.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s comments over the weekend quelled fears that protectionist trade policies would slow the economy’s momentum, analysts said.
