A cabin attendant also suffered a minor injury as the plane suddenly lost altitude.\nTwenty-seven passengers received medical checkups in a hospital in Chengdu, but no injuries were detected.\nThe rest of the passengers resumed their trip at noon, according to statements by the airline.\nPilot Liu Chuanjian told the Red Star News, a local news portal, that the windshield had given way without warning around 150km from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.\n\"The windshield cracked suddenly and gave a huge bang. I looked aside and found half of the co-pilot's body was already outside the window. Fortunately his seat belt was fastened,\" Liu said.\nThe pilot added that the cabin equipment malfunctioned as a result and it was so noisy he could not hear the wireless.\nThe aircraft was shaking vehemently and he could not read the metres.\n\"The sudden loss of pressure and low temperature made me very uncomfortable and it was very difficult to make a single move when the aircraft was flying at 900 kilometres an hour and at such a high altitude,\" Liu said.\nFlying data showed the aircraft was on the cruising altitude of 9,750 metres (32,000 feet) but then dropped suddenly to 7,300 metres (24,000 feet).\nLiu said he had to fly the aircraft manually because the automatic systems were not functioning.\n\"I have flown this route a hundred times and know everything very well,\" Liu said.\nOne veteran pilot who did not wish to be named said the crew had handled the incident masterfully.\n\"As pilots we receive such training twice a year, but it was one thing to train on a simulator and another when you are affected by the sudden loss of pressure and oxygen when the temperature drops to minus 40 degrees.\n\"The pilot stayed calm, responded quickly and correctly to drop the aircraft to an altitude where emergency oxygen is not needed and handled the situation with strong skills. That's very professional.\"\nPassenger Zhao Shihai told the China Youth Daily that he was sleeping when he suddenly felt the strong turbulence.\n\"I was thrown up in the air and fell for several times. The oxygen masks on the plane all dropped out\", he said.\nZhao, who was sitting in the middle of the aircraft, felt a draft of cold air and saw the cockpit door flew open several minutes later.\nHe added that several passengers had fallen over but the turbulence reduced after crew pushed the door closed.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternational", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2141799/hostage-drama-beijing-bound-flight-forces-emergency", "https://twitter.com/cnbci", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2119732/china-southern-airlines-flight-forced-make-emergency-landing", "http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/business/article/2145796/why-china-suddenly-seeking-filipino-english-teachers"], "published": "2018-05-14T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-14T19:00:01.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
