A head-and-shoulders pattern has appeared that suggests the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) could be moving toward the bottom end of the channel, as TLT failed to retest and recapture old highs.\n— TLT has specifically bounced up time and again from the $115 level before falling back, and now Gordon believes TLT could finally fall below that support level.\n— This would essentially put an end to a four-decade downtrend in rates and uptrend in bond prices, according to Gordon.\nThe trade: Gordon is suggesting buying the September monthly 115 put for $2.14, or $214 per options contract.\nBottom line: Gordon believes the head-and-shoulders pattern in TLT is a bearish signal that could send bonds plummeting and rates soaring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-17T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T23:32:36.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
