However, Microsoft's Dynamics enterprise software is emerging as a major competitor after nearly tripling its market share to 4 percent in 2017.\nSalesforce reported net income of $344 million, or 46 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30, compared with $1 million, or breakeven per share, a year earlier.
