(OTCQB:GLXZ), a developer, manufacturer and distributor of casino table games and enhanced systems, announced today its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nQ1 2018 vs. Q1 2017\nRevenue increased 25% to $4,361K Revenue increased 20% to $4,154K excluding effect of accounting change Adjusted EBITDA increased 28% to $1,559K Pre-tax income increased 184% to $682K Net income increased 231% to $537K\nBalance Sheet Changes (vs. December 31, 2017)\nCash decreased 5% to $3,396K Total debt (gross) decreased 3% to $9,345K Stockholders’ equity increased 13% to $6,166K\nExecutive Comments\n“We maintained revenue growth in the 20% range in Q1 2018,” stated Todd Cravens, Galaxy’s President and CEO. \"However, the increases in operating expenses that we made last year have moderated in Q1 2018, allowing us to deliver growth in EBITDA that exceeded the growth in revenue. We expect that trend to continue throughout 2018.”\n“Revenue as reported for Q1 2018 included $207K from our adoption of ASC 606 effective beginning this year,” stated Harry Hagerty, Galaxy’s CFO. “Cash decreased slightly in the quarter due to our payment in January 2018 of amounts owed to a strategic partner; excluding that payment, cash would have increased 16%. Interest expense decreased in the quarter due to lower debt balances, and we expect further decreases in 2018 as a result of the refinancing we announced last month. Finally, our effective tax rate was 21.2%, reflecting the new tax rates enacted late last year.”\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release may constitute forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
