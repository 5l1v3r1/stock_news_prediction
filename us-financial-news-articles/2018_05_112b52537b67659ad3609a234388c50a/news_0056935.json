The whereabouts of the others remain unknown, according to a report by the charity.\nMany of the children were sexually abused, made to sleep in rat-infested tents and beaten by traffickers, the report said, after many of them had fled conflict and crisis further south.\nBritain’s exit from the European Union could hamper its fight against trafficking at a time when the number of people being trapped in slavery is on the rise, fueled by social media, the country’s anti-slavery body said earlier this month.\nThe Gangmasters and Labor Abuse Authority (GLAA) said it was unclear how Brexit would affect Britain’s drive to crack down on human traffickers, but it was the key factor likely to impact the intelligence picture in coming years.\nBritain passed the Modern Slavery Act in 2015 to crack down on traffickers, ensure businesses check supply chains for forced labor, and protect people most at risk of being enslaved.\nIn Britain, at least 13,000 people are estimated by the government to be victims of modern-day slavery - used in forced labor, sexual exploitation or domestic servitude - but police say the true figure is likely to be in the tens of thousands.\nReporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
