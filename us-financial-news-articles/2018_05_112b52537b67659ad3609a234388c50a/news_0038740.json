Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 18, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe U.S. dollar’s rally continued, rising for a fifth straight session against a basket of currencies.\nInvestors were digesting asset moves from earlier this week, when the 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury yields broke above 3.1 percent and oil topped $80 a barrel. On Friday, oil prices were little changed and the 10-year bond yield retreated from a near-seven year peak.\nA volatile week for Italian markets continued as two anti-establishment parties pledged to increase spending in a deal to form a new coalition government.\nYields on Italy's 10-year bond IT10YT=RR rose to its highest point in more than seven months, while the country's stocks .FTMIB slumped 1.5 percent.\nThe euro EUR= was down 0.17 percent to $1.1773, on track for a fifth session of declines.\n“The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence ... at this point a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance (in Italy) does seem likely,” said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets.\nMajor European stock markets fell. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.29 percent, but posted gains for an eighth straight week.\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 6.94 points, or 0.03 percent, to 24,720.92, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 6 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,714.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 20.59 points, or 0.28 percent, to 7,361.89.\nA disappointing report by Applied Materials ( AMAT.O ) weighed on chip stocks.\nInvestors were watching developments in trade talks between the United States and China.

On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said China and other countries had become “very spoiled” on trade.

The benchmark on Thursday broke through $80 for the first time since November 2014.\nU.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.06 percent to $71.53 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $78.94, down 0.45 percent on the day.
