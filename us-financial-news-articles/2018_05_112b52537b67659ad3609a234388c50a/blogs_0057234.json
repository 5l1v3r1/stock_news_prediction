The buyer had a representative come to inspect the Levis jeans prior to his purchase.\nThe Levis were previously owned by Solomon Warner, a shopkeeper from what is now Arizona. The jeans come with the one back pocket design of older Levis and have no belt loops, since men typically wore suspenders rather than belts at the time, according to The Detroit News. They were reportedly still in good condition, as Warner only wore the jeans a few times before he became ill.\nThe large sale didn’t even mark a record for vintage Levis. A pair of Levis from 1888 previously sold for six figures, and a cheaper pair from the 1880s sold for $60,000.
