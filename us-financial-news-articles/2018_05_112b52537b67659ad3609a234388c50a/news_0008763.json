He pleaded guilty in January to one count of wire fraud.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a related lawsuit accusing Murakami and his partner, Avi Chiat, of defrauding more than 50 investors in their three funds after raising more than $15 million.\nThe SEC’s case against Chiat is pending. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe case is U.S. v. Murakami, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 17-cr-10346.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-03T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-03T23:13:59.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
