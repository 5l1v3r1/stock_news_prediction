It also has 235,000 customers for its internet services, a 36 percent rise from a year ago.\n“Alongside the continued competition in the cellular segment, we continued to recruit new customers, among others, through a quatro package that offers cellular, television, internet and fixed line home telephony,” Cellcom Chief Executive Nir Sztern said.\nCellcom’s mobile subscriber base gained 1.1 percent to 2.822 million in the first quarter.\nSztern said the company was still deploying a fibre-optic network to customers’ homes, which is meant to provide Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit.\nCellcom was considering investing in Israel Broadband Company (IBC), which would allow for a further acceleration of the fibre-optic network, he added.
