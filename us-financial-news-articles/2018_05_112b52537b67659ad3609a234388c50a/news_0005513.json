(NYSE:BRT) announced that an entity in which it has an 80% equity interest acquired Anatole Apartments, a 208-unit multi-family property located in Daytona Beach, Florida, for $20.5 million, including the assumption of $13.6 million of mortgage debt. The mortgage debt matures in 2025, carries an attractive interest rate in today’s environment of 3.94% and is interest only until 2020. BRT contributed $6.9 million of equity in connection with this acquisition.\n“Anatole is an in-fill, value-add opportunity where we plan to upgrade units with new flooring and washers and dryers as well as upgrading the clubhouse and other common areas. The property, which is located just two miles from the Daytona International Speedway, also benefits from its proximity to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which specializes in aviation and aerospace and has a total enrollment of 5,700 students. The Daytona multi-family market has multiple local economic drivers that we believe will contribute to the success of a value-add repositioning,” shared Jeffrey A. Gould, Chief Executive Officer of BRT. “This is our third acquisition with this joint venture partner which underscores the benefits of establishing strong relationships with local sharpshooters to augment our team’s ability to enter into accretive transactions quickly and efficiently.”\nForward Looking Statements:\nCertain information contained herein is forward looking Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
