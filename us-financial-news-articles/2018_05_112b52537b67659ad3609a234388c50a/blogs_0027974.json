Many of you will have seen media reports regarding Novartis' relationship with Essential Consultants in the United States and many of you will feel disappointed and frustrated. You can read our full statement here. We made a mistake in entering into this engagement and, as a consequence, are being criticized by a world that expects more from us.\nPersonally and for my family, it was also a difficult day, as unfounded stories spread through the US news. While I was not involved with any aspect of this situation, the facts did not matter. I went to sleep frustrated and tired.\nBut I woke up this morning full of determination. Determined to fight for the transformative medicines we create and the patients we serve. Determined to fight for this company I deeply love. Determined to fight for all of you so you continue to feel proud, inspired and empowered to transform the health of the world every day. This moment will pass and we will learn. Our medicines however will endure for generations.\nWhat defines us now is as how we respond to this difficult situation. I look to you to remain resilient and keep your focus on serving patients. Together we will respond by continuing our work to profoundly impact human health. Please focus on that noble purpose in this difficult moment â€” bending the curve of life.\nVas\" Kevin Breuninger Special to CNBC.com Ryan Ruggiero Senior Assignment Desk Manager and CNBC Internship Program Manager Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-10T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T21:03:55.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
