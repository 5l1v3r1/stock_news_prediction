Holden, President and Chief Executive Officer of Envision. “We made significant strides to align our practice support and corporate overhead to support our clinical programs and these efforts contributed to our solid financial results in the quarter. We expect the impact of these efforts to accelerate through the remainder of 2018. We are also making good progress in improving our revenue cycle functions to achieve operational efficiencies, which we expect to realize during the second half of this year. We are also advancing a number of initiatives to improve the efficiency of our clinical teams as they care for patients.\n“Our operational focus will be key to our ability to optimize shareholder value as our clinical providers and operations professionals are continuously working to improve patient safety, quality and efficiency to deliver value to health systems and the patients we serve. We continue to successfully execute on a clearly defined strategy that supports our clinical providers as they participate in high-performing healthcare networks in communities across the country. Our Physician Services’ growth validates this strategy.”\nReporting Segments\nEnvision reports two operating segments as continuing operations: Physician Services, which includes facility-based and post-acute services, and Ambulatory Services.\nPhysician Services\nNet revenues for Physician Services were $1.77 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 13.2% from the prior-year period. Revenue growth was driven by contributions of 8.2% from acquisitions, 2.3% from net new contracts and 2.7% from same contracts. Physician Services’ net revenue growth from new contracts consisted of 8.0% growth from contract additions, partially offset by contract terminations of 5.7%.\nOn a same-contract base, net revenues grew by 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior-year period. Same-contract patient encounters grew by 2.3%, while revenue per patient encounter increased by 0.8%.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Physician Services Adjusted EBITDA was $150.1 million and was essentially unchanged from the prior-year period. Physician Services results were impacted by increasing seasonal payroll tax expense, incentive compensation accruals that were not in the prior-year period, as well as higher-than-anticipated malpractice expense related to settlement of claims from prior years. Physician Services' margin improved by 50 basis points on a sequential basis.\nAmbulatory Services\nNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $307.6 million, which compares to $315.9 million for the prior-year period. Ambulatory Services results were affected by weather- and flu-related procedure cancellations during the 2018 period.\nSame-center revenue declined by 0.7%, which included a 1.3% volume decline, offset by 0.6% rate growth. Surgery centers deconsolidated and disposed in the 12 months ended March 31, 2018, contributed incremental revenues of $9.7 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $57.5 million, which compares with $60.2 million for the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.7%, which compared to 19.1% in the prior-year period.\nLiquidity\nEnvision had cash and cash equivalents of $767.4 million at March 31, 2018, and the Company had no amounts outstanding under its asset-based lending facility at the end of the first quarter of 2018. During the period, Envision used a substantial portion of the net proceeds it received from the sale of AMR to reduce debt outstanding on its Term Loan B by $1.7 billion. At March 31, 2018, Envision had total debt outstanding of $4.7 billion. The Company’s ratio of total net debt at March 31, 2018, to trailing 12 months EBITDA as defined under the Company’s credit agreement, was 4.2 times.\nNet cash flows from operations, less distributions to noncontrolling interests and excluding transaction costs, were $20.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Envision’s cash flow from operations was impacted by accelerating approximately $45 million of incentive compensation payments into the first quarter, from the second quarter, to benefit from higher tax deductibility associated with those expenses as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nGuidance\nEnvision is modifying its outlook for 2018 and introducing its outlook for the second quarter of 2018. For all of 2018, Envision expects to generate revenue of $8.35 billion to $8.53 billion, Adjusted EBITDA of $965 million to $1 billion, and Adjusted EPS of $3.49 to $3.70.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, Envision expects to generate Adjusted EBITDA of $234 million to $246 million, and Adjusted EPS of $0.83 to $0.90.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year and second quarter of 2018 excludes interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs, acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions, gain or loss on deconsolidations and discontinued operations. Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year and second quarter of 2018 excludes acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, acquisition-related amortization expense, gains and losses on future deconsolidation transactions, share-based compensation, impairment charges, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and debt extinguishment costs, net of tax impact. Envision is not providing a reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance because the exact amount of such exclusions is not currently determinable, including variability and timing associated with acquisitions, disposals, deconsolidations and impairment charges. These amounts may be significant and may vary significantly from period to period (see page 6 for a reconciliation of all historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial results presented in this release).\nOngoing Strategic Review\nEnvision’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) continues to conduct a full review of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, and is considering a number of options including execution of the Company’s strategic plan, portfolio rationalization, and a potential sale of the Company.\n“We remain fully engaged in a comprehensive review of our options,” said Denny Shelton, Lead Independent Director of Envision’s Board. “While we have not set a definitive timetable for the completion of this review, the Board is moving toward identification of the optimal outcome for our shareholders during the current quarter.”\nThere can be no assurance that this review will result in a transaction or other alternative of any kind.\nConference Call Information\nEnvision will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Tuesday, May 8, 2018, to discuss its financial results. The live broadcast of Envision’s quarterly conference call will be available on-line by going to www.evhc.net and clicking on the link to Investors. The on-line replay will follow shortly after the call and continue for 30 days.\nAbout Envision Healthcare Corporation\nEnvision Healthcare Corporation is a leading provider of physician-led services and post-acute care, and ambulatory surgery services.

to GAAP Measures\n(1) We believe the calculation of adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to common stockholders provides a better measure of our ongoing performance and provides better comparability to prior periods because it excludes discontinued operations, the gains or loss from deconsolidations, net of noncontrolling interests, which are non-cash in nature, impairment charges, transaction and integration costs, including associated debt extinguishment costs and deferred financing write-off, and acquisition-related amortization expense, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, share-based compensation expense, and unrealized gain or loss on equity securities. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to common stockholders should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the items excluded from it is a significant component in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because adjusted net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share attributable to common stockholders is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, it may not be comparable as presented to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per share, we utilize the if-converted method to determine the number of diluted shares outstanding. In periods where utilizing the if-converted method is anti-dilutive, the mandatory convertible preferred stock will not be included in the calculation of diluted shares outstanding. (2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction and integration costs, share-based compensation, impairment charges, debt extinguishment costs, gain or loss on deconsolidations, net of noncontrolling interests, changes in contingent purchase price consideration, purchase accounting adjustments related to mergers and acquisitions, the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, discontinued operations and unrealized gain or loss on equity securities. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is an analytical indicator used by management and the health care industry to evaluate company performance, allocate resources and measure leverage. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings, cash flows from operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507006032/en/\nEnvision Healthcare Corporation\nBob Kneeley, 303-495-1245\nVice President, Investor Relations\nbob.kneeley@evhc.net\nSource: Envision Healthcare Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evhc.net&esheet=51802122&newsitemid=20180507006032&lan=en-US&anchor=www.evhc.net&index=2&md5=5f9a21bf62dcf32490e538c248cc79e5", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180507006032/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evhc.net&esheet=51802122&newsitemid=20180507006032&lan=en-US&anchor=www.evhc.net&index=1&md5=4579bef414b1d6e25099d9b46f717677"], "published": "2018-05-08T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-07T23:31:50.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
