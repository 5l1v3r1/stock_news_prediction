The decrease in revenue was due to a delay in completion and delivery of hydrovac trucks during the quarter. Three completed trucks held in inventory as at March 31, 2018 were delivered and sold in early Q2 2018.\nDespite the decreased revenue, Gross Profit of $888 was comparable to $897 in the same period of 2017 due to production efficiencies at the company’s Stettler plant.\nSelling and general and administrative expenses of $1,244 increased by $271 compared to $973 in the same period of 2017. The increase is principally due to increased employee costs of the North America operation and increased overhead costs of the China operation and corporate.\nEBITDAS (1) of negative $356, comprising North America ($96), China (negative $287) and Corporate (negative $165), decreased by $280 compared to negative $76 in Q1/2017, due to increased selling and general and administrative expenses. For the North America segment, EDITDAS during the quarter of $96 decreased significantly compared to Q4 2017, due to decreased activity levels. For China, negative EDITDA during the quarter was ($287) and is expected to stay at this level until there is an increase in the scope of operations.\nNet loss of $635 increased by $313 compared to a loss of $322 in Q1/2017. This is due to the factors discussed above, together with stock-based compensation expense of $68.\n1 Earnings (loss) before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (EBITDAS) and Earnings (loss) before interest and tax (EBIT) are not defined by IFRS. The definition of EBITDAS does not consider gains and losses on the disposal of assets, fair value changes in foreign currency forward contracts and non-cash components of stock-based compensation.
