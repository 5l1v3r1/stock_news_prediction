Egypt production was 11,777 barrels of oil per day (\"bopd\") and Canada production was 2,598 boepd.\nThe Company sold 235,930 barrels of inventoried entitlement crude oil to EGPC during the first quarter of 2018 for $13.2 million. The proceeds will be used to cover in-country expenditures of the Company's Egyptian operations. At quarter end the Company had approximately 1.0 million barrels of inventoried entitlement crude oil. Subsequent to the quarter, the Company lifted approximately 452,000 barrels (\"bbls\") of entitlement crude oil on April 7, 2018, with net proceeds of $26.5 million to be received in early May. All Canadian production was sold during the quarter.\nDated Brent oil prices averaged $66.81 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018. TransGlobe's crude oil is sold at a quality discount to Dated Brent and received a blended price of $56.20 per barrel during the quarter. TransGlobe's Canadian oil production received an average of $57.15 per barrel of oil and $1.70 per million cubic feet (\"mcf\") of natural gas during the first quarter. The Company had funds flow from operations of $3.9 million and ended Q1-2018 with positive working capital of $45.3 million, which included cash of $31.1 million.\nThe Company experienced a net loss in the quarter of $10.1 million, including a $6.0 million unrealized loss on derivative commodity contracts. The loss on derivative commodity contracts represents a fair value adjustment on the Company's hedging contracts as at March 31, 2018.\nIn Egypt, the Company drilled two oil wells (Arta-48 in West Gharib and K-46 in West Bakr) during the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter, the Company drilled an oil well at K-45 in West Bakr and is currently drilling Arta-54 in West Gharib. Following Arta-54 the rig is scheduled to move to NW Gharib to drill a planned injector at NWG 38A-3. Concurrently, the Company is progressing the 2018 exploration drilling program in the Western Desert with the first two wells (NWS 9 and NWS 12) targeting a June start utilizing two drilling rigs.\nIn Canada, a planned turnaround at the main third-party owned and operated natural gas processing plant in Harmattan will result in the majority of the Company's Canadian production being shut-in during May. To coincide with this, the Company commenced a planned 3 to 4 week turnaround/maintenance program at its central oil processing battery and main natural gas compressor site in early May. The 2018 production guidance numbers include the planned turnaround. Additionally, in July 2018 the Cardium development drilling program is scheduled to commence. The planned Cardium drilling program, consisting of six horizontal wells (including one two-mile horizontal), will be drilled from a common pad to improve efficiencies and reduce costs commencing in Q3.\nThe Company has undertaken an extensive review of its existing stock market listings and its current and potential common share investors. The Company determined that although oil prices have shown tangible and structural improvement in Q4-2017 and Q1-2018, its share price and liquidity have not responded to that improvement despite significant increases in profitability and funds flow. The Company concluded that a listing on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM is expected to provide access to a significant pool of investors who currently do not have adequate access to TransGlobe’s common shares and should eventually improve its profile by placing TransGlobe alongside many of its international Exploration and Production peers. In addition, an AIM listing, may attract European analyst coverage focused on international companies similar to TransGlobe. TransGlobe has retained Canaccord Genuity as its nominated advisor (\"NOMAD\") to support the listing on AIM. Preparations are now at an advanced stage and the Company expects to complete the AIM process by the end of June. In addition, the Company intends to establish an executive office in London by September 2018.\nOPERATIONS UPDATE\nARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT\nEASTERN DESERT\nWest Gharib, Arab Republic of Egypt (100% working interest, operated)\nOperations and Exploration\nDuring the first quarter, the Company drilled the Arta-48 development well in the Arta Red Bed pool. Arta-48 targeted the northern extension of the main Arta Red Bed pool in the boundary area between the Arta pool and the offsetting new development lease (“DL”) in the NW Gharib concession (DL #3). The Arta-48 well is the first well drilled in the buffer zone and encountered 45 feet of Red Bed formation with an internally estimated 20 feet of net oil pay. The Red Bed conglomerate section encountered in Arta-48 is scheduled for a frac stimulation in May.\nThe Company is currently drilling a second Arta Nukhul/Red Bed development well at Arta-54, targeting the northern extension of the main Arta Red Bed pool. The Arta-54 location will be the second well drilled in the boundary area between the Arta pool and the offsetting new development lease DL #3 in NW Gharib.\nProduction\nProduction from West Gharib averaged 5,104 bopd to TransGlobe during the quarter, a 2% (89 bopd) increase from Q4-2017 due to accelerated well servicing efforts during Q1-2018, partially offset by natural declines.\nProduction averaged 4,975 bopd during April.\nSales\nThe Company sold 235,930 barrels of inventoried entitlement crude oil to EGPC for $13.2 million in Q1-2018.\nQuarterly West Gharib Production (bopd) 2018 2017 Q-1 Q-4 Q-3 Q-2 Gross production rate 5,104 5,015 5,741 6,389 TransGlobe working interest 5,104 5,015 5,741 6,389 TransGlobe production inventoried (sold) (21 ) 774 (5,715 ) (92 ) Total sales 5,125 4,241 11,456 6,481 Government share (royalties and tax) 2,504 2,459 2,826 3,155 TransGlobe sales (after royalties and tax) 1 2,621 1,782 8,630 3,326 Note: 1 Under the terms of the West Gharib Production Sharing Concession, royalties and taxes are paid out of the Government's share of production sharing oil. West Bakr, Arab Republic of Egypt (100% working interest, operated)\nOperations and Exploration\nDuring the first quarter, the K-46 oil well was drilled and placed on production. The K-46 well encountered an internally estimated 111 feet of net oil pay with 96 feet attributed to the main Asl A formation (A1, A2, and A3) and 15 feet of oil pay in the Asl B over water. The well was initially completed in the Asl B zone to obtain a production rate prior to perforating the main Asl A formation. The Asl B produced approximately 45 bopd with water. In late April, the Asl A was perforated and commingled with the Asl B formation and placed on production. The well is currently producing 120 bopd and will be optimized during the second quarter in conjunction with the Company’s facility upgrades at West Bakr K Station and high-volume lift initiatives.\nSubsequent to the quarter, the Company drilled the second South K-field development well at K-45, which was targeting the main Asl A sand in a crestal position in South K-field. The well was drilled to a total depth of 5,831 feet and encountered main Asl A sand approximately 66 feet structurally higher than the K-46 well and is structurally the highest well in South K-field Asl A & B pools. K-45 encountered an internally estimated 195 feet of net oil pay comprising 120 feet of net oil pay in the Asl A pool (A1, A2 and A3) and 75 feet of net oil pay in the Asl B pool. The K-45 well was completed in the Asl B formation and placed on production at an initial rate of 300 bopd in early May 2018.\nUp to three additional wells are planned for West Bakr in late Q2/early Q3, including two wells inside the recently negotiated reduced buffer zone targeting the M-field Asl A formation.\nThe Company also has an active recompletion campaign scheduled throughout 2018, targeting low-risk behind pipe opportunities in addition to water-flood optimization opportunities. The majority of these opportunities reside in the West Bakr K-field where the Company has completed construction of the Phase 2 K-field facility expansion to double the current fluid handling capacity. Commissioning of Phase 2 has commenced and will be operational in May. Concurrent with the K-field facility expansions the drilling rig was used to re-enter and deepen a legacy well (K-5) for water disposal. The K-5 water disposal well is scheduled for completion in May 2018 to handle additional planned water production from the expanded facilities. Following Phase 2 commissioning, construction will commence on Phase 3 to add a third process train and triple the original facility capacity by year end. The expansions will allow for accelerated fluid withdrawal rates supporting incremental production volumes and additional reserves from both West Bakr K and M fields.\nProduction\nProduction from West Bakr averaged 5,274 bopd to TransGlobe during the quarter, a 5% (250 bopd) increase from the previous quarter due to accelerated well servicing efforts and recompletion activity in K South during the quarter, partially offset by natural declines.\nProduction averaged 5,683 bopd during April.\nSales\nTransGlobe did not sell its entitlement share of production from West Bakr during Q1-2018.\nQuarterly West Bakr Production (bopd) 2018 2017 Q-1 Q-4 Q-3 Q-2 Gross production rate 5,274 5,024 5,651 6,085 TransGlobe working interest 5,274 5,024 5,651 6,085 TransGlobe production inventoried (sold) 2,136 (3,511 ) 2,288 (3,202 ) Total sales 3,138 8,535 3,363 9,287 Government share (royalties and tax) 3,138 2,990 3,363 3,621 TransGlobe sales (after royalties and tax) 1 — 5,545 — 5,666 Note: 1 Under the terms of the West Bakr Production Sharing Concession, royalties and taxes are paid out of the Government's share of production sharing oil. North West Gharib, Arab Republic of Egypt (100% working interest, operated)\nOperations and Exploration\nNo wells were drilled during the quarter.\nThe drilling rig is scheduled to move to NW Gharib following the Arta-54 well to drill NWG 38A-3. The NWG 38A-3 well is planned as a water injection well to provide reservoir pressure support and enhanced recovery in the NWG 38 Red Bed pool. The first three wells drilled in the NWG 38 pool did not encounter a water leg and are currently producing at a combined, restricted rate of approximately 920 bopd. It is expected that the current production rates will be optimized upon completion of the water injection scheme and stabilized reservoir pressures.\nThe Company will be stimulating and completing two drilled and uncompleted wells (DUC’s) in the NWG 1 and NWG 5 Development Areas (discovered in 2014) during the second quarter of 2018. The NWG 1 and NWG 5 wells encountered a tight Red Bed conglomerate sequence, which requires stimulation to produce, and are expected to produce at similar rates to TransGlobe's Arta Nukhul wells which typically have an initial 30-day production rate (IP 30) of 150-180 bopd with ultimate recoveries of 120-150 thousand barrels (\"Mbbls\") per well on primary production.\nProduction\nProduction from NW Gharib averaged 1,399 bopd during the quarter, a 15% (187 bopd) increase from the previous quarter, primarily due to production from the NWG 38A2 well placed online in late December 2017.\nProduction averaged 1,213 bopd during April.\nSales\nTransGlobe did not sell its entitlement share of production from NW Gharib during the quarter.\nQuarterly North West Gharib Production (bopd) 2018 2017 Q-1 Q-4 Q-3 Q-2 Gross production rate 1,399 1,212 876 1,377 TransGlobe working interest 1,399 1,212 876 1,377 TransGlobe production inventoried (sold) 507 439 318 499 Total sales 892 773 558 878 Government share (royalties and tax) 892 773 558 878 TransGlobe sales (after royalties and tax) 1 — — — — Note: 1 Under the terms of the North West Gharib Production Sharing Concession, royalties and taxes are paid out of the Government's share of production sharing oil. WESTERN DESERT\nSouth Alamein, Arab Republic of Egypt (100% working interest, operated)\nOperations and Exploration\nNo wells were drilled during the quarter.\nThe Company has approved a Jurassic exploration well for South Alamein in its 2018 capital plan. This well has not received military approval for access. The Company has entered into discussions with EGPC to extend the concession beyond the June 2018 expiry to facilitate additional dialogue with the military and to evaluate alternative solutions. EGPC has indicated an extension is possible although it is not finalized at this time.\nSouth Ghazalat and North West Sitra, Arab Republic of Egypt (100% working interest, operated)\nOperations and Exploration\nNo wells were drilled during the quarter.\nThe Company is targeting to test four independent structures on South Ghazalat and North West Sitra and is expected to commence drilling in the NW Sitra concession utilizing two rigs in June 2018. The larger 2,000 HP drilling rig will drill NWS 12 targeting a stacked Cretaceous/Jurassic prospect. The smaller 1,000 HP drilling rig will drill NWS 9 targeting a stacked Cretaceous prospect. Following NWS 9, this rig will be moved to the South Ghazalat Concession to drill two independent stacked Cretaceous structures. The four, basin opening wells in NW Sitra and S. Ghazalat could de-risk 13 of the 21 additional prospects currently mapped on 3-D seismic. The Company has not budgeted any production from the Western Desert exploration assets in 2018.\nCANADA\nOperations and Exploration\nNo wells were drilled during the quarter.\nIn Canada, the Company commenced a planned 3-to-4 week turnaround/maintenance program at the Company’s central oil processing battery and main natural gas compressor site in early May. The work has been scheduled to coincide with a planned turnaround at the main natural gas processing plant in the Harmattan area, which is operated by a third party. It is expected that the majority of the Canadian production will be shut-in during May 2018 due to this planned outage. TransGlobe's 2018 production guidance numbers include the planned turnaround.\nIn addition, the Company is finalizing the 2018 Cardium drilling program, which is scheduled to commence in July. The 2018 Cardium development program of six horizontal wells will be drilled from a common pad to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. The Company is planning to drill one two-mile extended reach horizontal (“ERH”) well to evaluate the performance of ERH wells in the Harmattan area. The remainder of the 2018 program will be one-mile horizontal wells.\nThe Company will continue to evaluate properties for acquisition in the greater Harmattan area.\nProduction\nProduction from Canada averaged 2,598 boepd (60% oil and liquids) to TransGlobe during the quarter, a 4% (102 boepd) decrease from the previous quarter primarily due to natural declines offset by the 2017 Cardium three-well drilling campaign.\nProduction averaged 2,492 boepd for April.\nQuarterly Canada Production (boepd) 2018 2017 Q-1 Q-4 Q-3 Q-2 Canada crude oil (bbls/d) 675 775 518 496 Canada NGLs (bbls/d) 894 915 1,081 919 Canada natural gas (mcf/d) 6,176 6,058 6,268 7,191 Total production (boe/d) 2,598 2,700 2,644 2,613 About TransGlobe\nTransGlobe Energy Corporation is a Calgary-based, growth-oriented oil and gas exploration and development company whose current activities are concentrated in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Canada.
