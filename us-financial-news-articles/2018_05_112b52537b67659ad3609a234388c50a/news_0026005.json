(\"Spark\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:SPKE), an independent retail energy services company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey Highlights\nAchieved $15.9 million in Adjusted EBITDA, $45.7 million in Retail Gross Margin, and a $(41.8) million Net Loss for the first quarter Total RCE count increased 1% to a record 1,055,000 as of March 31, 2018 Average monthly attrition of 4.2% for the first quarter Closed on two acquisitions, adding approximately 80,000 RCEs Continue to simplify, streamline, and optimize the organization Expanded the senior credit facility to $200.0 million in commitments Issued two million shares of Series A Preferred Stock for net proceeds of approximately $48.9 million\n“Since the start of the year, we closed on two acquisitions, completed the integration of Verde Energy, implemented additional integration and cost-reduction initiatives, and further increased our liquidity,” said Nathan Kroeker, Spark Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “That said, first quarter results were tempered by an unexpected burst of cold weather in early January that adversely affected Spark and our entire industry. This prolonged cold weather negatively impacted our financial results, especially compared to last year, when warmer-than-normal weather resulted in very strong unit margins for the winter months.\n“Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we will continue to execute on our synergy projects to achieve further economies of scale. We intend to remain cost-effective with our organic acquisitions, and we will continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities while maintaining discipline with respect to purchase prices and valuation. On balance, we still anticipate that full-year Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 should be similar to that of 2017.”\nSummary First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Spark reported Adjusted EBITDA of $15.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $34.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company attributes this decrease of $18.5 million primarily to unexpected extreme cold weather patterns that raised short-term commodity prices in January.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Spark reported Retail Gross Margin of $45.7 million compared to Retail Gross Margin of $64.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Spark attributes this decrease of $18.9 million primarily to unexpected extreme cold weather patterns that raised short-term commodity prices in January.\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $(41.8) million compared to net income of $11.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, driven by higher non-cash mark-to-market losses.\nStrategic Update\nAs previously announced, the termination of the Verde earnout agreement on January 15, 2018 has allowed Spark to integrate Verde's operations on an accelerated basis. In addition, the Company expects the reintegration of Retailco Services into its operations, effective April 1, 2018, will allow it to realize synergies and cost reductions as early as the second quarter. Finally, Spark's internal brand consolidation and cost-cutting measures should also begin impacting 2018 results in the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter, Spark increased the commitments on its credit facility to $200.0 million and issued an additional $48.9 million of its Series A Preferred Stock.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,065 Senior Credit Facility Availability (1) 43,811 Subordinated Debt Availability (2) 25,000 Total Liquidity $ 89,876 (1) Subject to Senior Credit Facility borrowing base and covenant restrictions.\n(2) The availability of the Subordinated Facility is dependent on our Founder's financial position and liquidity.\nDividend\nSpark’s Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.18125 per share of Class A common stock payable on June 14, 2018, and $0.546875 per share of Series A Preferred Stock payable on July 16, 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast\nSpark will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern).\nA live webcast of the conference call can be accessed from the Events & Presentations page of the Spark Energy Investor Relations website at http://ir.sparkenergy.com/events-and-presentations .

Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA less (i) customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period, (ii) net gain (loss) on derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments, plus (iv) non-cash compensation expense, and (v) other non-cash and non-recurring operating items. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before provision for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization. We deduct all current period customer acquisition costs (representing spending for organic customer acquisitions) in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred, even though we capitalize such costs and amortize them over two years in accordance with our accounting policies. The deduction of current period customer acquisition costs is consistent with how we manage our business, but the comparability of Adjusted EBITDA between periods may be affected by varying levels of customer acquisition costs. For example, our Adjusted EBITDA is lower in years of customer growth reflecting larger customer acquisition spending. We do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of business or portfolios of customers in calculated Adjusted EBITDA. We deduct our net gains (losses) on derivative instruments, excluding current period cash settlements, from the Adjusted EBITDA calculation in order to remove the non-cash impact of net gains and losses on derivative instruments. We also deduct non-cash compensation expense as a result of restricted stock units that are issued under our long-term incentive plan.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors as a financial indicator of our ability to incur and service debt, pay dividends and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our condensed consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, commercial banks and rating agencies, use to assess the following:\nour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends; and our ability to fund capital expenditures (including customer acquisition costs) and incur and service debt.\nRetail Gross Margin\nWe define retail gross margin as operating income (loss) plus (i) depreciation and amortization expenses and (ii) general and administrative expenses, less (i) net asset optimization revenues, (ii) net gains (losses) on non-trading derivative instruments, and (iii) net current period cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments. Retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity business by removing the impacts of our asset optimization activities and net non-cash income (loss) impact of our economic hedging activities. As an indicator of our retail energy business’ operating performance, retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business's operating performance.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Retail Gross Margin is operating income (loss). Our non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities, or operating income (loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or Retail Gross Margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities, and are defined differently by different companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Retail Gross Margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management’s decision-making process.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities for each of the periods indicated.\nAPPENDIX TABLES A-1 AND A-2\nADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATIONS\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 (1) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income: Net (loss) income $ (41,831 ) $ 11,132 Depreciation and amortization 13,019 9,270 Interest expense 2,245 3,445 Income tax (benefit) expense (6,467 ) 2,405 EBITDA (33,034 ) 26,252 Less: Net, losses on derivative instruments (36,542 ) (21,796 ) Net, Cash settlements on derivative instruments (15,537 ) 7,355 Customer acquisition costs 4,274 7,690 Plus: Non-cash compensation expense 1,131 1,367 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,902 $ 34,370 (1) Financial information has been recast to include results attributable to the acquisition of Perigee Energy, LLC by an affiliate on February 3, 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 (1) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities: Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (9,540 ) $ 23,294 Amortization of deferred financing costs (295 ) (248 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense (2,423 ) (356 ) Interest expense 2,245 3,445 Income tax (benefit) expense (6,467 ) 2,405 Changes in operating working capital Accounts receivable, prepaids, current assets 11,374 (2,381 ) Inventory (4,070 ) (3,322 ) Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 17,570 13,076 Other 7,508 (1,543 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,902 $ 34,370 Cash Flow Data: Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities $ (9,540 ) $ 23,294 Cash flows used in investing activities (15,795 ) (112 ) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities 16,981 (17,193 ) (1) Financial information has been recast to include results attributable to the acquisition of Perigee Energy, LLC by an affiliate on February 3, 2017.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Retail Gross Margin to operating income (loss) for each of the periods indicated.\nAPPENDIX TABLE A-3\nRETAIL GROSS MARGIN RECONCILIATION\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 (1) Reconciliation of Retail Gross Margin to Operating Income: Operating (loss) income $ (46,254 ) $ 16,783 Depreciation and amortization 13,019 9,270 General and administrative 30,047 24,493 Less: Net asset optimization revenues (expenses) 2,687 (193 ) Net, Losses on non-trading derivative instruments (36,712 ) (21,376 ) Net, Cash settlements on non-trading derivative instruments (14,882 ) 7,515 Retail Gross Margin $ 45,719 $ 64,600 Retail Gross Margin - Retail Electricity Segment $ 19,719 $ 36,771 Retail Gross Margin - Retail Natural Gas Segment $ 26,000 $ 27,829 (1) Financial information has been recast to include results attributable to the acquisition of Perigee Energy, LLC by an affiliate on February 3, 2017.\nContact: Spark Energy, Inc.\nInvestors:\nChristian Hettick, 832-200-3727\nMedia:\nKira Jordan, 832-255-7302\nSource:Spark Energy, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://ir.sparkenergy.com/events-and-presentations", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/3ba00f4f-8e45-4894-898d-237159cbc687"], "published": "2018-05-10T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-10T01:24:00.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
