Bush, 21-year-old Wise pulled away from the field after starting the final round tied with Marc Leishman.\nHe notched six birdies in a seven-hole stretch from the fourth and was never challenged thereafter, finishing at 23-under 261.\nAustralian Leishman shot a final-round 68 for second place on 20-under.\nPGA Tour rookie Wise, who moved with his parents to the U.S. at the age of three, had an outstanding amateur career and won the American collegiate championship in 2016 before turning pro.
