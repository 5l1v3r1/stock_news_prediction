Bill Cosby reacts while being notified a verdict is in at the Montgomery County Courthouse in his sexual assault retrial, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., April 26, 2018.

He faces up to 30 years in prison.\nPolanski, 84, who won the best director Oscar in 2003 for World War Two drama “The Pianist,” in 1977 admitted to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles.\nThe French-Polish director lives in France and fled the United States following his guilty plea for fear his deal with prosecutors would be overruled and he would get a lengthy prison term. Polanski’s case is still ongoing.
