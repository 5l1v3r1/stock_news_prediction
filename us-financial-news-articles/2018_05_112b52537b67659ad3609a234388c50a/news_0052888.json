The LOOP is the only U.S. port that can offload the largest crude oil tankers.\nBP Plc spokesman Jason Ryan said Alberto is not expected to affect the company’s operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nChevron Corp said it was monitoring the storm’s forecast, but offshore operations and at its 340,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery were continuing as planned on Friday.\nPhillips 66’s 247,000 bpd Alliance, Louisiana, refinery was also monitoring the storm on Friday, the company said.\nThe Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Both figures have decreased as onshore oil and gas production ramped up in big shale plays.\nMore than 45 percent of the nation’s refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-26T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:07:14.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
