It is possible that it may also be the case that we do not have to do any international placements in 2019, depending on the negotiations that are taking place,” Caputo said.\nArgentina is negotiating a ‘high access stand-by arrangement’ from the International Monetary Fund.\nCaputo said the government issued a 36.87 billion peso ($1.53 billion) 5-year local bond at a 20 percent interest rate on Tuesday and a 36.38 billion peso ($1.51 billion) 8-year bond at 19 percent.
