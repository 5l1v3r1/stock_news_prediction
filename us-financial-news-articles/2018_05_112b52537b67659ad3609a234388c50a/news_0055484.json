It goes without saying that he is going to be greatly missed wherever international cricket is played.”\nFormer South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher tweeted:\n“I remember this young guy on his first day out for the Proteas. What an inspiration, person and player, he turned out to be. Thank you for everything you have done for your country, teammates and fans.”\nFormer Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardena tweeted:\n“One of the best! Wish you all the best AB. Amazing player, but above all that great guy...”\nCricket broadcaster Harsha Bhogle tweeted:\n“Must admit to being a bit shocked by AB de Villiers’ decision to quit all international cricket. We knew it was coming but I thought he would give the World Cup another shot.”\nFormer India seam bowler RP Singh tweeted:\n“The man who showed the world that batting 360° is an easy task. All the best for your future endeavours AB de Villiers, thank you for all the unforgettable memories!”\nFormer South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald tweeted:\n“So shocked to hear AB de Villiers has decided to call time on his international career.

GREAT GREAT player ... top three that I have ever seen.”\nFormer South Africa spin bowler Paul Harris tweeted:\n“What a great career. Best I have ever seen. Was great to be a part of it AB de Villiers. Nou gaan ons braai (now we are going to barbeque).”\nFormer India batsman Mohammad Kaif tweeted:\n“One of the all time greats of the game, many congratulations AB de Villiers on an outstanding career. The (Roger) Federer of cricket, the most loved cricketer on the planet. Wish you the best for your future endeavours.”\nAustralia women’s international Alex Blackwell tweeted:\n“True legend. Finishing on top and allowing next generation to step up. The way AB found innovative ways to dominate bowling attacks was an inspiration.”\nFormer India batsman Aakash Chopra tweeted:\n“The biggest entertainer in the last decade has bid goodbye to International cricket. Your absence will be felt, AB. Cricket will be poorer.”\nDe Villiers’ Indian Premier League side Royal Challengers Bangalore tweeted:\n“Sudden but we’re confident there was immense thought and contemplation behind the decision.
