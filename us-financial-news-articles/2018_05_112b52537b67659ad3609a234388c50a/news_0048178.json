REUTERS/Stringer The world’s second most populous country suffers hundreds of deaths from infectious diseases every year because of weak disease surveillance and infection control systems, leading health experts to worry about the risks of such outbreaks.\nThere is no vaccine for the Nipah virus, carried by fruit bats and spread through contact with bodily fluids, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Treatment for the virus, which has a mortality rate of about 70 percent, is supportive care.\nRelated Coverage Bahrain asks nationals to avoid traveling to India's Kerala Symptoms of the virus surfaced in a 20-year-old woman and a 75-year-old man in the port city of Mangalore after they traveled to neighboring Kerala and had contact with infected patients, said Rajesh B.V., a health official in Karnataka.\nMedics wearing protective gear examine a patient at a hospital in Kozhikode in the southern state of Kerala, India May 21, 2018.

Shailaja told a news briefing, where she announced payment of compensation to her family and others who lost family members to the infection.\nAt least 17 patients are under treatment, Shailaja added.\n“All steps to prevent the spread of the virus have been taken,” she added, urging people not to destroy colonies of fruit bats.\nReporting by Zeba Siddiqui in Mumbai and D.
