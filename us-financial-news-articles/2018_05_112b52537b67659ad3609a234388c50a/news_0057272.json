I was (already) thinking (about) what I will do for the rest of the day.”\nWith little time to collect his thoughts on becoming the first Egyptian man to make it into the main draw of a major in 22 years, Safwat appeared to be suffering from a serious bout of stage fright as within 40 minutes the Bulgarian fourth seed had romped to a 6-1 4-1 lead.\nSlideshow (3 Images) A medical time out taken by Safwat to treat blisters on his playing right hand gave him a chance to calm down his frayed nerves. The 182nd-ranked Egyptian skipped back to the baseline following the interlude and won back-to-back games for the first time in the contest by breaking Dimitrov.\nThe potions and lotions applied by the tournament’s trainer allowed Safwat to serve more confidently and he twice came within a game of taking the third set.\nHowever, the challenge of toppling one of the top seeds was a task too far for a player who, before Sunday, had earned a grand total of $352,674 prize money after 11 years as a professional.\nA netted backhand might have ended Safwat’s French Open odyssey but that did nothing to stop him from celebrating the standout moment in his career.\n“When I was young, I was watching (Roger) Federer and Gustavo Kuerten play and I was recording the match,” said Safwat, who had never been inside Philippe Chatrier Court before walking out for his match on Sunday.\n“I was always dreaming to play there. And, yeah, it’s a dream come true. Definitely this is a milestone in my career.”\nReporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-28T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:48:10.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
