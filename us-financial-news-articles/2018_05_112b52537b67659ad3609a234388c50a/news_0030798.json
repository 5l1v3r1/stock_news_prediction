I think there was some political concern that the deal would not close due to the tension that Trump has with China,” analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said, adding that he doesn’t expect many hurdles in the Qualcomm-NXP deal as well.\nShares of NXP rose 1.4 percent at $112.30.\nShares of Microsemi, the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment, rose 1.3 percent to trade closer to the offer price of $68.78. Microchip shares were marginally down in early trading.\nThe deal, which has already received antitrust approval in the United States, is expected to close in late May or early June and will strengthen Microchip’s base in the computing and communications sectors.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-15T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:38:34.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
