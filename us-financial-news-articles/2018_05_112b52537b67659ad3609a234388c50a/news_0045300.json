Refugees have reported murder, rape and arson by Myanmar troops.\nWashington has called the army response “ethnic cleansing” - a charge Myanmar denies, saying its security forces have been waging a legitimate counter-insurgency operation against “Bengali terrorists”.\nAfter meeting Myanmar’s de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyitaw and civil society leaders in the main city Yangon on Friday and Saturday, Green met local government officials in Rakhine and toured villages and camps over the weekend.\nOn Sunday, he went to Muslim and Buddhist villages in the Rathedaung township in the north of the violence-torn state. He then met camp leaders in Thet Kae Pyin camp for nearly 6,000 Rohingya, a short drive from state capital Sittwe.\n“We don’t have the luxury of time. We really do need all of us to see positive steps forward and we stand ready to help,” Green said.\nReporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-20T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:32:51.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
