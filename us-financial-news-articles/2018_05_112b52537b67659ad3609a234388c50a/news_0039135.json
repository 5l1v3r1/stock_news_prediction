The industry pulled in a record amount of cash last year as investors turned to the asset class for public-market-beating returns.\nHowever, larger money managers are keen to cut down on paying the fees demanded by firms, which typically collect a roughly 1.5 management fee and a 20 percent cut of any profits.\n“The move by CalPERS is part of a broader trend amongst large institutional LPs, led by large Canadian pension, looking to disintermediate traditional fund managers to lower the cost of private equity and venture capital investment,” said James Gelfer, senior analyst at financial data firm PitchBook.\nCalPERS Direct, which is expected to begin work in 2019 subject to final board approval and would only invest CalPERS money, would be made up of two funds. The first would target late-stage investments in technology, life sciences and healthcare, and the second on long-term investments in established companies.\nCalPERS said its private equity program, which began in the early 1990s, has been the fund’s highest-returning asset class over the last two decades.\nCalPERS in February said it lost 4.6 percent in value during the stock market’s tumble earlier this year, highlighting the appeal of private markets.\nReporting by Joshua Franklin in New York Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-18T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-18T08:03:16.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
