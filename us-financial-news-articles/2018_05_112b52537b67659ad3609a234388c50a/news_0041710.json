Bond is a veteran financial executive with an extensive record of developing and implementing strategy, and driving revenue and profitability in the medical device industry. Bond joins the Dune Atlanta office after years with McKesson and Given Imaging.\n“Alan has experience in both large and small organizations during times where the companies were undergoing significant strategic changes and acquisitions,” says Lori Chmura, CEO of Dune Medical. “His experience in driving organizational performance will add significantly to Dune Medical’s capability to manage new growth, and we are pleased to add him to our distinguished team.”\nDune Medical Devices’ proprietary tissue characterization technology utilizing Radiofrequency (RF) Spectroscopy, is a ground-breaking solution to identifying microscopic residual cancer at the surface of the tissue to give surgeons another tool to help identify all the cancerous tissue in the operating room. Dune’s first medical device, the MarginProbe System, achieved FDA approval in 2013 for use in breast cancer lumpectomy procedures. Numerous peer reviewed publications have demonstrated a 50 - 79% reduction in re-excision with the use of MarginProbe.\n“Breast conservation surgery is a first line surgical modality for most women facing a breast cancer diagnosis and MarginProbe improves the effectiveness and outcome of the surgery,” says Bond. “I look forward to playing an important role in optimizing Dune’s organizational performance and bringing a strategic focus as we expand our revolutionary technology platform to the diagnosis, surgery and therapy of other cancers.”\nAbout Dune Medical Devices\nImagine not having to wonder, did we get it all?\nAt Dune Medical Devices, we believe in reducing the anxiety that waiting for pathology results places on a patient and their families. Our solutions, which are developed on a first-of-its kind RF Spectroscopy platform can differentiate cancerous from healthy tissue based on electromagnetic properties, making it possible for patients and physicians to answer the question, “did we get it all?”\nhttp://www.dunemedical.com/\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180517005271/en/\nWrite2Market for Dune Medical Devices\nPaul Snyder, +1-404-414-4240\nVice President, Healthcare\npaul@write2market.com\nSource: Dune Medical Devices", "external_links": ["http://www.dunemedical.com/", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180517005271/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunemedical.com%2F&esheet=51807972&newsitemid=20180517005271&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunemedical.com%2F&index=1&md5=2eab088ccedd2343ec41364af09e0455"], "published": "2018-05-17T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-17T18:48:18.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
