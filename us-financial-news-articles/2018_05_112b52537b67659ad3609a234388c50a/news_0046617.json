The result also compared with a restated net loss of 34.42 billion rupees in the same period a year earlier.\nBanks saw soured loans and provisions surge in the quarter after the central bank in February eliminated half a dozen loan restructuring schemes to hasten the clean-up of near-record levels of bad debt. Most state-run banks that have reported quarterly earnings so far have posted losses.\nSBI’s bad-loan provisions for the quarter more than doubled from a year earlier to 280.96 billion rupees. Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans rose to 10.91 percent from 10.35 percent three months earlier and 6.90 percent a year prior, the lender said in a statement.\nNet interest income for the quarter fell 5.2 percent to 199.74 billion rupees.\nShares of the lender rose as much as 6.2 percent after the results in a broader Mumbai market that was 0.1 percent higher. $1 = 68.0350 Indian rupees Reporting by Vishal Sridhar in BENGALURU Editing by Christopher Cushing", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-22T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:51:19.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
