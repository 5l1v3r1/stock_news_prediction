The action culminated on Friday in a surprise hike of the bank’s key interest rate to 30.25 percent from 27.25.\nArgentina’s local stock index rose 77 percent last year and investors even gobbled up a 100-year bond as President Mauricio Macri’s strong performance in mid-term elections spurred hopes for more market friendly reforms. But investors have more recently woken up to the country’s vulnerabilities.\n“The forces driving the peso lower are unlikely to abate,” Capital Economics said in a report on Wednesday, pointing to a current account deficit equivalent to 5 percent of gross domestic product as well as high inflation.\nLocal brokerage Delphos Investment said in a report the recent pace of dollar selling was not sustainable. It also said the implementation of a capital gains tax for foreign investors last month had led to a decrease in foreign capital entering Argentine markets.\nConsumer prices in Argentina rose 2.3 percent in March, slightly down from the 2.4 percent increase in February. Twelve-month inflation was 25.4 percent, the same level as February.
