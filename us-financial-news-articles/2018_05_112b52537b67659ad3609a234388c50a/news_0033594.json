Ordnance has occasionally strayed into China and killed people.\nSuch conflict has frayed ties between China and Myanmar, which Beijing has hoped could be a key gateway in its multi-pronged “One Belt One Road” strategy to promote regional economic links.\nReporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-13T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-13T07:53:37.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
