But his critics say after serving in each of Mugabe’s governments since independence from Britain in 1980, Mnangagwa has little to offer.\n“Let us put our differences aside and campaign for the thunderous victory of our revolutionary party. A house divided cannot stand,” Mnangagwa said.\nThe 75-year-old leader promised better conditions for government workers following public sector strikes by doctors and nurses in March and April. Teachers say they will not go back to work when schools re-open on Tuesday.\nMnangagwa talked up his government’s achievements since assuming office, adding that foreign investors had promised more than $11 billion in investments, which his administration would ensure materialised.\n“The condition of service of our teachers, health workers, security forces and general civil servants will be reviewed with the view of improving their conditions of service,” he said.\nUnder the manifesto’s “Unite, fight corruption, develop, re-engage, create jobs” theme, ZANU-PF promises annual economic growth of 6 percent for five years, foreign direct investment of $5 billion annually and will build 1.5 million houses.\nUnder the ZANU-PF government, the mining sector will be opened up to more investors, farmers will have leases for their land, roads will be rebuilt and power generation increased to 3,000 MW from 1,800 MW, the manifesto said.\nZimbabwe is in the grips of severe shortages of dollars that have curbed imports, unemployment rate is above 80 percent and public infrastructure like roads is in decay.
