YouTube appeared to be working in Egypt on Saturday as of 1250 GMT.\nThe film “Innocence of Muslims”, a low-budget 13-minute video, was billed as a film trailer and made in California with private funding. It provoked a wave of anti-American unrest in Egypt and other Muslim countries when it appeared in 2012.\nMohamed Hamid Salem, a lawyer who filed the case in 2013, said the ruling also orders that all links that broadcast the film be blocked.\nThe ruling is considered final and cannot be appealed.
