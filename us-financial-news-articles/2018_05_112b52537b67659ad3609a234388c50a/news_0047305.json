Courtesy Johnson County Sheriff's Department/Handout via REUTERS The shooting drew international attention as part of a wave of attacks nationwide against ethnic and religious minority groups following the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has railed against illegal immigration.\nThe shooter, Adam Purinton, approached two Indian men, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, at a bar, demanding to know where they were from, calling one a terrorist and shouting, “Get out of my country!” Two other patrons escorted him out of the bar.\nPurinton returned about a half-hour later and fired his semi-automatic pistol at the two men who he had harassed earlier. As he ran out, he shot another patron, Ian Grillot, who had chased him.\nKuchibhotla, a legal U.S. resident, died of his injuries. Madasani and Grillot survived.\n“While we cannot ameliorate the irreparable harm to the victims and their families, we hope that securing this guilty plea brings them some measure of closure,” said Jesse Panuccio, an acting associate attorney general, in a statement.\nPurinton had already pleaded guilty to state charges for murder and attempted murder, and was sentenced earlier in May to life in prison. The local prosecutor said at the time that Purinton will not be eligible for parole for 50 years.\nThe sentencing is scheduled for July 2, the Justice Department said, and, despite the Kansas sentence, both federal prosecutors and the defense are seeking the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-21T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-21T23:16:08.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
