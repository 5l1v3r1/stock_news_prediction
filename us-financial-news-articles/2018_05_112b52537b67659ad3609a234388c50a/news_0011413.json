The payrolls report may not resolve this market battle.”\nThe U.S. dollar had erased all its 2018 losses in the past two weeks on expectations the Fed will continue to raise rates, even as other major central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, take longer to reduce stimulus.\nThe dollar index has risen about 1 percent so far this week and is on track for a third straight weekly gain.\nJOB AND WAGES The focus for markets will be on the U.S. jobs data due later in the global day, with the April report likely to underscore labour market strength. Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 192,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after rising only 103,000 in March.\nBut it will be the wages figure that could shift views on future Fed hikes, analysts said.\n“A further pick-up in the pace of wage gains could be the ‘smoking gun’ for the Fed to express any shift away from ‘roughly balanced’ risks to inflation,” said Mizuho analyst Vishnu Varathan in a note.\n“For now, we expect that reactions may still be subdued given that the runway of evidence remains short; and so the bearish UST and bullish USD trades may not be taking off aggressively just yet.”\nInvestors were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, though analysts said they had little confidence that the U.S. delegation in Beijing, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, will achieve any breakthrough on the tariff standoff between the world’s two biggest economies.\nChinese shares nudged lower, with the blue-chips off 0.2 percent and Shanghai’s SSE Composite down 0.1 percent.\nThe euro was flat on the day at $1.1991 and has lost 0.74 percent in a month.\nOvernight, Argentina’s peso, which has been among the worst hit emerging market currencies during the past couple of months on rising U.S. yields, tumbled again to a record low.\nThe currency has been hit by a lack of investor confidence in Latin America’s No. 3 economy, which has been blighted by one of the world’s highest inflation rates.\nArgentina’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 300 basis points to 33.25 percent on Thursday, but the second steep rate increase in less than a week failed to stop the peso currency from plunging.\nElsewhere, U.S. crude dipped 7 cents to $68.36 a barrel, while Brent crude down a shade at $73.59.\nGold was slightly higher. Spot gold was traded at $1313.4 per ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-04T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-04T10:52:51.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
