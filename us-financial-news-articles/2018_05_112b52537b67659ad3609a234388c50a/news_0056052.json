Soccer Football - International Friendly - South Korea vs Honduras - Daegu Stadium, Daegu, South Korea - May 28, 2018 South Korea's Son Heung-Min celebrates scoring their first goal REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nThe 20-year-old has been viewed as Korea’s most promising player for years having come through Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy and while he signed for Italy’s Hellas Verona last August, Barca reportedly have a buy-back option.\nHis inclusion in Shin Tae-yong’s preliminary squad for Russia raised some eyebrows, given that he had yet to win his first full cap, and there was more surprise on Monday when he was given a start against the Central Americans in Daegu.\nLee got off to a rough start, failing to link up with his team mates and trying too hard to impress, but after getting to grips with the pace of the game, it quickly became evident why so much is expected of him.\nDriving at defenders with pace, carving out chances with incisive passing and harrying opponents out of possession, Lee managed to draw some of the focus off skipper Son and showed that despite standing a modest 5ft-7in (1.7m) tall, he would not be intimidated by hulking Honduran defenders.\nIn the 60th minute Lee created the opener, swiping the ball from an opponent, driving toward goal and laying it off to Son, who fired home a glorious left-foot effort from outside the box.

I’m focusing on creating scoring chances.”\nLee will hope to prove his worth to the national side again on Friday when the Koreans host Bosnia in another warm-up match in Jeonju before Shin names his final 23-player squad for the World Cup.\nKorea have been drawn in Group F alongside Sweden, Mexico and world champions Germany.
