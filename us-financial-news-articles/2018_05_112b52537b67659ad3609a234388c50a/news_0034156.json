North Korea is desperately in need of energy...for their people. They are in great need of agricultural equipment and technology,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n“We can create conditions for real economic prosperity for the North Korean people that will rival that of the South,” he added.\nNorth Korean state media reported over the weekend that the country has scheduled the dismantlement of its nuclear bomb site for later in May.\nPompeo welcomed the news of those plans.\n“Every single site that the North Koreans have that can inflict risk on the American people that is destroyed, eliminated, dismantled is good news for the American people and for the world,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”\nLast month, Pompeo became the first known U.S. official to meet with Kim, where he helped lay the ground work for the upcoming meeting with Trump.\nHe returned again to North Korea last week for a second meeting, after which Kim agreed to the historic release of three American prisoners.\n“The prospect for North Korea is for it to become a normal nation, to behave and interact with the rest of the world the way South Korea does,” White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, adding that prospects for the country are “unbelievably strong” if it follows through on its commitment.\nPompeo, meanwhile, also spoke about what it was like to meet Kim, whom few Americans have interacted with personally.\n“The conversations are professional,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.\n“He does follow the western press. He’ll probably watch this show at some point.”\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during a joint press availability with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha after their meeting at the State Department in Washington, U.S., May 11, 2018.
