REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin Lim Guan Eng said in a tweet: “The Inland Revenue Board is asked to investigate Jho Low and his family in relation to any returns or anything received in the 1MDB scandal.”\nThe whereabouts of Low, a close friend of former prime minister Najib Razak’s family, are unknown. He has previously denied any wrongdoing. Najib, who was defeated in an election two weeks ago, has been barred from leaving Malaysia, as the new government has relaunched an investigation into how billions of dollars disappeared from 1MDB.\nReporting by John Geddie; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-25T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-25T12:55:55.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
