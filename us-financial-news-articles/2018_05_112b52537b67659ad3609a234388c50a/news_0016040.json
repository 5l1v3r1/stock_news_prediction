A perpetrator was sentenced to nine months in jail, but released early as part of an amnesty.\nLakic’s editor, Mihajlo Jovovic, spoke with Lakic in the hospital, and said she saw the attacker and two other men fleeing the scene.\nThe incident prompted calls from the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United States, demanding better protection of journalists in the former Yugoslav republic.\n“There must be no impunity. Ensuring the safety of journalists is key to the future of democracy in Montenegro,” said Harlem Desir, OSCE’s representative on freedom of the media.\nThere have been around a dozen attacks against journalists and media organizations in the last 15 years, including the 2004 assassination of Dusko Jovanovic, a newspaper editor.\nReporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-05-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-09T13:21:21.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
