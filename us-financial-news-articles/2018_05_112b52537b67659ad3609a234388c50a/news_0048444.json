REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\nIt was not clear what effect the blacklisting would have as many Russian companies have already sought to wind up their Ukraine-linked activities due to earlier sanctions.\nBut restrictions on Deripaska could impact the operations of the Mykolaiv plant in southern Ukraine, which is the second-largest alumina asset of his aluminium business Rusal.\nKiev first implemented sanctions against hundreds of Russian companies and entities after Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.\nEarlier in May it expanded these restrictions to mirror those of the United States, which blacklisted officials and business people around President Vladimir Putin in April - one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity”.\nUkraine’s updated list was published online on Thursday, confirming sanctions on Deripaska as well as on other Russian tycoons such as Viktor Vekselberg, key owner of Renova holding group, and Alexei Miller, the CEO of Russia’s gas exporter Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ).
