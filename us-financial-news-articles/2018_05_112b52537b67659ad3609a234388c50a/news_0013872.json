They did run a little bit ahead of themselves. Valuations are just adjusting to more normalised market levels.\"\nThe JSE All-share index, the broadest measure of South African stock market performance, is down around 4 percent from the high notched up when Ramaphosa took charge of Africa's most industrialised economy in February.\nIncluding the sale of shares from existing shareholders such as buyout firm Abraaj and the Public Investment Corporation, the IPO raised a further 1.5 billion rand.\nLibstar's 27 business units offer consumer products that include specialised food such gluten-free baked products and household goods such as laundry detergents.\n($1 = 12.6153 rand) (Editing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-04T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-06T16:05:33.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
