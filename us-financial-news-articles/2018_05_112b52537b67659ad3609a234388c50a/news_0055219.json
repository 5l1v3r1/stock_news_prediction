Cricket - England vs Pakistan - First Test - Lord's Cricket Ground, London, Britain - May 26, 2018 England's Joe Root looks dejected as he walks off after losing his wicket Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley\nEngland were bowled out for 184 on the first day after Root won the toss and never recovered as they suffered their first defeat in a May test at the home of cricket following series losses in Australia and New Zealand.\n“We got it wrong, we know that,” Root told reporters on Sunday. “These conditions suit us as well. It’s a talented team and there are guys in there who will do great things for England.”\nPakistan scored 363 in their first innings and England collapsed to 110 for six in their second before a seventh-wicket partnership of 126 between Jos Buttler and Dom Bess spared the embarrassment of an innings defeat and took the match into the fourth day.\n“We have been out-performed in all three departments, we have to be better,” Root said. “There have been a number of collapses recently and we have to find a way as a group.”\nThe last time England lost the first test in a home summer was in 1995 against West Indies and they only have four days to regroup before the second and final match at Headingley starting on Friday.\n“We have to be more patient and take our opportunities when we get them. We can do that next week and we must take that chance,” Root said.\n“We can’t ignore this, we have to learn from it quickly. A lot of the things that we do are very good.”\nEngland, fifth in the world test rankings, are unlikely to make changes to their side, although batsmen Mark Stoneman and Dawid Malan are under particular pressure following lean runs.\n“We are ambitious, we want to win but sometimes we make poor decisions,” Root said.\n“It’s about the number of runs you score, not how long it takes you and maybe we need to absorb a bit more. You have to recognise the right times to attack.”\nEngland’s last home test series loss came in 2014 against Sri Lanka and they have won five and two drawn two since.\nThey host top-ranked India in a five-test series starting in August.
