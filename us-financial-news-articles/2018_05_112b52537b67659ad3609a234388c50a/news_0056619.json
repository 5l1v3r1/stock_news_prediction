PIECE OF THE ACTION\nUnder the stock connect system linking Hong Kong to the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges - through which most of the MSCI flows are expected to go - the number of trading accounts rose to over 4,000 this month from about 1,000 in January last year, stock exchange data showed.\nForeign ownership of stocks in China represent just over 2 percent of its nearly $9 trillion market capitalisation, and muted overseas interest and accessibility have to date weighed on demand for company research and broking services.\n“With the MSCI inclusion, China has now become a mainstream market,” said Jason Yates, Asia head of execution services for Morgan Stanley institutional equity division. It has doubled China coverage to more than 200 stocks in three years.\nCaroline Yu Maurer, head of Greater China equities for BNP Paribas Asset Management, said it is looking to expand coverage to 500 Chinese stocks over time from a few hundred now.\nJPMorgan plans to double the firms it covers to more than 200 this year, focusing on large caps, Ryan Holsheimer, head of its cash equity sales and trading for Asia Pacific.\nHSBC, the only foreign bank to own a majority stake in a China securities joint venture, and UBS are also working on plans to ramp up investments in teams and technology.\n“At the moment, we have 117 analysts who cover 220 A-share stocks ... MSCI inclusion and increasing demand will ensure that both the number of analysts and the stocks covered will increase substantially,” said Thomas Fang, UBS head of China equities.
