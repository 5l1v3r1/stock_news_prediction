Jakarta-based Winarta had been with Credit Suisse for 20 years, most recently as head of the bank’s Indonesian investment banking coverage.\nCarlyle also hired Long Hoang as a director focusing on deals in Vietnam. Hoang joined the firm from TPG Capital where he was a vice president.\nThe two senior hires come as Carlyle is inching towards the closure of a $6.5 billion Asia private equity fund, its biggest ever in the region.\nCarlyle has also beefed up its Southeast Asian team with the new hires, which will focus principally on both small and large market opportunities in Indonesia, Vietnam and Philippines.
