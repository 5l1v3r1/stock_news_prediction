May 31, 2018, Paris, France: Serena Williams (USA) in action during her match against Ashleigh Barty (AUS) on day five of the 2018 French Open at Roland Garros. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports\nThe rankings show Williams is only the 451st best player in the world and her nine-month-old daughter Alexis Olympia will need a few years to appreciate what her mum’s day job is.\nBut anyone foolish enough to think motherhood would kill off Williams’ competitive edge got a reminder of why the 23-times Grand Slam champion is one of the all-time greats as she clawed her way to a 3-6 6-3 6-4 second round win over Ashleigh Barty.\nA set and a break down, it looked like Williams’ comeback slam following her maternity break would end in defeat by the 17th seeded Australian.

Slideshow (2 Images)\n“I lost the first set and I thought I’ve just got to try harder and Serena came out,” said a beaming Williams after giving her skin-tight, black catsuit another outing. “Every day is a great day I’m excited to... fight my heart out.”\nBarty was pragmatic about the way things played out, rather than moaning about her rotten luck at being drawn against the three-times Roland Garros champion so early in the tournament or feeling she had wasted a golden chance to beat Williams.\n“In the first set she gave me a hell of a lot of cheapies, a lot of errors,” said the 25-year-old Australian who had secured her highest ever seeding at a major in Paris.\n“She’s not quite at the level she was when she was at her best but that’s expected. But her level when she’s not quite on her best (form) is still bloody good.\n“When push came to shove, the real Serena came out. And one of her best assets is that when her back is against the wall, the best comes out.” Reporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-05-31T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:45:57.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
