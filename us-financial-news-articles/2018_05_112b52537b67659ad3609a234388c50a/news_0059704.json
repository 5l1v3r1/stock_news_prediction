In the medium to longer term, we still see oil prices falling as indicated by the downward-sloping futures curve. Our low for longer view is deferred, not refuted,\" Julius Baer's Norbert Ruecker said in a note.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on June 22.\nVolatility, a way of measuring demand for a derivative, on highly bearish Brent sell options that expire just after the meeting has shot to its highest since February.\nThe spread between Brent and U.S. crude <CL-LCO1=R> stands at nearly $9 a barrel, its widest since March 2015 because of the depressed price of U.S. crude compared with Brent.\nRecord crude oil volumes from the United States are expected to head to Asia in the coming months, nibbling away the market share of OPEC and Russia.\nU.S. oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has surged by more than 27 percent in the past two years to 10.73 million bpd. That puts the United States ahead of Saudi Arabia and within reach of top producer Russia, which pumps about 11 million bpd.
